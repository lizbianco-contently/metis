Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder to file second-degree amendments until 10 a.m. this morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Following that vote, additional amendments are expected \nto the supplemental appropriations bill. Rollcall votes will occur \nthroughout today's session. It is the majority leader's intention to \ncomplete action on the bill as soon as possible, so Members who intend \nto offer amendments should be prepared to do so as soon as possible \nduring today's session.\n  Mr. President, there are 109 amendments filed to this bill. I plead \nwith the Senate to vote cloture on this bill so we will have a means of \nmanaging this bill. It is a disaster relief bill.\n  I now yield 5 minutes of the time allocated to me to Senator Hagel \nfor the purpose of making a statement as in morning business, and ask \nthat the statement appear at the appropriate place in the Record after \nthe cloture vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HAGEL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Hagel pertaining to the introduction of S. 709 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 140\n\n(Purpose: To modify eligibility for emergency rail assistance funds in \n                               the bill)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mr. Byrd, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 140.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 28, line 8, strike the words ``in the Northern \n     Plains states'' and insert ``in September 1996, and''.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this modifies the eligibility for \nemergency rail assistance funds under the bill. It has been cleared on \nboth sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 140) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, later this morning, the Senate is going \nto\n\n[[Page S4044]]\n\nvote, as I said, as near to 10 o'clock as possible. I regret that this \nstep is necessary. I didn't think it would be necessary to have \ncloture. Senator Byrd and I have spent 2 days trying to resolve \ndifficulties on the bill regarding amendments. As I said, 109 first-\ndegree amendments are pending with regard to this bill. We simply \ncannot wait to move on the legislation. It does have millions of \ndollars for assistance to victims of the disasters. Those disasters, \nMr. President, occurred in 33 States.\n  The bill provides $1.8 billion to the Department of Defense for \noverseas contingency operations. This is for money that has already \nbeen spent on activities in Bosnia and Southwest Asia, and it replaces \nthe funds that are critical to operating and maintenance accounts and \npersonnel accounts to assure regular training and quality-of-life \nprograms for the Department of Defense personnel through the remainder \nof 1997.\n  Let me make that clear. The money has been spent, but it was spent \nfrom very critical accounts under the power of the Presidency. We need \nto reprogram moneys into those accounts in massive amounts to assure \nthat in the last quarter of this year, there is regular training and \nmaintenance of our readiness.\n  Now, last night, we commenced a bipartisan review of all the \namendments presented by 2:30. We hope we can work out or accept many of \nthose. I urge any Member who is serious about the appropriations and \nhas an amendment to this bill that is germane, to come to the floor so \nwe can clear as many of the amendments as possible. It is my intention, \nafter consulting with Senator Byrd, to take a very strict view to \namendments in a post-cloture environment. I think that is what the \nSenate will want to do--consider germane amendments and move forward to \nthis bill. Nongermane legislative amendments will be subject to a \nruling by the Chair, and that will be taken up after cloture. But as I \nsaid, this is an emergency, although the funds--like the Department of \nDefense funds, money is being spent on the disaster now from other \naccounts available to the executive branch, so we must replace that \nmoney and make further money available.\n  We have placed the money to keep the Government going, where the \nmoney has been borrowed for a short period of time, under the \nprocedures available for disasters. We must make these moneys \navailable. This is a 500-year flood, Mr. President. This is one of the \nmost severe disasters we have had since the Johnstown flood. If we are \nsuccessful here, I think we can proceed very quickly.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee has concluded the \nbudget agreement. He will manage the budget presentation following the \naction on this bill. That is my understanding. We hope that we will be \nable to get that budget agreement through the Senate and then be able \nto proceed on the 1998 appropriations bills. So I ask Members to defer \nnonemergency matters until we bring up those bills.\n  Now that we have a budget agreement, we are certain we will be moving \nregular appropriations bills very quickly. Many of the amendments \npresented here to this bill are amendments that would be germane to the \nregular appropriations bills for the various agencies. But they are not \ngermane to this bill. So I hope that there is a strict ruling by the \nChair on the germaneness of these amendments that have been filed.\n  Now, we have worked several days to try and bring about compromises \nin several areas, such as the amendment pertaining to the continuing \nresolution concept that is in the bill, the census and endangered \nspecies. I hope that we can effect a compromise on each of those \nissues. If not, let's have the vote. We waited all afternoon yesterday \nto take up these issues. As the Chair knows, we were finally forced to \nrecess last night so that we could get the control factor that will \ncome from the cloture process.\n  As I said, I didn't think it would be necessary. As a matter of fact, \nI told the floor staff I didn't think we should even file that cloture \nmotion. They thought we should, and I am glad we did. They were right \nand I was wrong.\n  Senator Byrd and I are going to work out the shortest time agreement \npossible on any amendments today. We expect to have many votes. I \nbelieve that we will begin to call up amendments from the eligible list \nas soon as the Chair rules on the amendments under cloture. As a matter \nof fact, we are available to take up amendments before 10 o'clock if \nanybody wants to come over and try to work one out before that time.\n  I have taken the bulk of my time, Mr. President. Let me, again, thank \nSenator Byrd for his cooperation. We have moved numerous amendments in \na bipartisan fashion already. Later today, Senators Conrad and Dorgan \nhave asked us to meet with the mayor of Grand Forks, and we will do \nthat. We are going to see some television footage. I saw some, as a \nmatter of fact, on the news, but we intend to promise the mayor that we \nare going to finish this bill and get it to the President as soon as \npossible.\n  I am happy to yield the remainder of the time to Senator Byrd, if he \nwishes time at this time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I do not need more \nthan a minute or so.\n  I shall vote for cloture, and I urge my colleagues on this side of \nthe aisle to vote for cloture. We have been on the bill now 3 days. It \nis an emergency bill. The people who have been stricken by floods \nthroughout the several States are in need of help. We should not delay \nmatters here very long.\n  I also hope that many of the 110 amendments that have been filed will \ngo away without being called up. There are others against which points \nof order would lie, and I intend to join with my friend and colleague, \nMr. Stevens, in making points of order against amendments that are not \ngermane as he sees fit to do so. He is the manager of the bill, and I \nwant to cooperate with him as much as possible.\n  So I hope that we can get on with the bill today and make good \nprogress and, hopefully, complete action on it earlier than the close \nof business tomorrow. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to Mr. Stevens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, I want to raise the issue of a provision that is in \nthe bill concerning section 2477 of the Revised Statutes--43 United \nStates Code 932.\n  Some groups have been alleging in the press that the provision in the \nsupplemental bill before us regarding rights-of-way under section 2477 \nof the Revised Statutes is going to result in roads across our national \nparks and wilderness. That is simply not true. These false allegations \nare being made in order to scare our constituents and to convince \nMembers to oppose our provision.\n  Rights-of-way under Revised Statute 2477 were granted by statute from \n1866 to 1976, when the provision was repealed. At the time of the \nrepeal, all existing rights-of-way were specifically protected.\n  Rights-of-way under R.S. 2477 are granted across Federal lands not \nreserved for public uses.\n  When Congress sets aside land for a park or wilderness, that land is \nreserved for that purpose. Once the park or wilderness is created, no \nnew right-of-way can be created under Revised Statute 2477.\n  This means that only rights-of-way that were created prior to the \nreservation of the land for a park or wilderness are valid under R.S. \n2477.\n  To create a right-of-way under R.S. 2477, there must either have been \npublic use of a right-of-way or an affirmative act of a State \nindicating that it accepted the grant and intends to use it for a \npublic highway.\n  Most of this Nation's most famous parks were created during the 110 \nyears that Revised Statute 2477 was available. Yellowstone was created \nin 1872.\n  Yosemite, Kings Canyon, and Sequoia were created in 1890. The Grand \nCanyon was set aside in 1908.\n  Denali, then known as Mount McKinley, was created in Alaska in 1917. \nKatmai in Alaska was established in 1918, and Glacier Bay National Park \nwas created in 1925.\n  Zion National Park in Utah was created in 1919, with Bryce Canyon \nfollowing in 1923, and the Arches National Park in 1929.\n  Throughout the 50 or more years of each of these parks' existence, a \nRevised Statute 2477 right-of-way could\n\n[[Page S4045]]\n\nhave been asserted, even before the provision was repealed. Yet, these \nparks have not been paved by public highways.\n  Congress began creating wilderness areas in 1964--12 years before \nRevised Statute 2477 was repealed. Section 5 of the Wilderness Act \nspecifically preserves existing private rights.\n  It has been 20 years since Revised Statute 2477 was repealed and over \n30 years since the creation of many major wilderness areas. During the \n30 years of the policy of wilderness the same practice that the \nprovision in the supplemental seeks to continue was in effect.\n\n  Yet, during those 30 years, we have not seen any of our wilderness \nareas covered with roads under Revised Statute 2477.\n  In Alaska, where 60 percent of the wilderness areas exist, we have \nalready dealt with the issue. The Alaska National Interest Lands \nConservation Act has numerous provisions that specifically deal with \naccess to wilderness areas. Nothing in this provision changes the law \nregarding rights-of-way in Alaska.\n  On the contrary, the provision seeks to keep the pre-existing policy \nand specifically denies the Secretary of the Interior the right to \nunilaterally change the policy contrary to what Congress has said many \ntimes and what the courts have said many times. As a matter of fact, \nCongress has spoken three times in the past 2 years on this and stated \nthat the Secretary cannot change the existing law and policy by \nregulation or by edict.\n  The people who claim this provision will lead to roads across \nwilderness areas and parks already created by Congress are just plain \nwrong.\n  What is at issue here are areas that are not yet wilderness or that \nhave been recently added by Executive action to our parks and \nmonuments.\n  Mr. President, every time Congress has addressed that subject, it has \nprotected valid existing rights, even in the creation of national parks \nand wildlife refuges.\n  Wilderness areas by definition don't have any roads. The \nenvironmental groups and the Department of the Interior are seeking to \ncut off valid rights-of-way in certain areas of the West so that those \nareas may be proclaimed wilderness.\n  I hope that the Senate understands this. If the Secretary of the \nInterior and these groups are allowed to prevail, then areas that do \nhave existing valid rights-of-way, which should by law be given some \nconsideration and may ineligible to become wilderness areas, could be \ncreated as additional wilderness and national park areas by Executive \norder or secretarial edict.\n  If they can keep the R.S. 2477 right-of-way from being recognized \nunder State law, as they have been created for the past 130 years, then \nthose areas would be roadless and eligible for wilderness designation \nby Congress.\n  That is the issue here. There are valid, existing rights-of-way \nacross some of these areas. They have been used for decades by the \npublic in the West. Those areas are not capable of being established as \nwilderness areas. But that is not for us to decide here.\n  All this provision does is maintain the status quo. If there are \nvalid existing rights under R.S. 2477, they had to be created more than \n20 years ago, before 1976.\n  The provision simply prevents the Secretary of the Interior from \nprejudging the issue in the ongoing review of which remaining Federal \nareas should be wilderness. This only preserves rights-of-way that \nalready exist. It does not create new rights or new roads.\n  I hope that the Senate will seriously consider the issue that is \ncoming before us today regarding Revised Statute 2477. Our intent is \nmerely to keep the policy that has existed in the past and which has \nbeen protected by every act of Congress that I know of. The valid \nexisting rights were protected. Those rights have been defined as far \nas rights-of-way under State law for 130 years.\n  This Secretary of the Interior now wants to have them decided under \nFederal law that his regulations would establish. That is contrary to \nthe policy of Congress. It is contrary to the decisions of the courts \nof the United States, and it should not be done by secretarial edict.\n  As I said, we have acted in the National Highway System Designation \nAct of 1995, in the 1996 Interior appropriations bill and in the 1997 \nInterior appropriations bill to prevent those regulations from being \nissued. Now the Secretary wishes to announce a policy. That policy is \nthat in the future the validity of the rights will be determined by \nFederal law. That is contrary to a whole series of court decisions and \ncontrary to the acts of Congress that specifically recognize valid \nexisting rights under State law.\n\n  Mr. President, I hope that this is going to be a short day. But I \nwant to tell the Senate that it is our intention, as Senator Byrd has \nannounced, to enforce the cloture motion. I call again on the Senate to \nvote for cloture. Give the managers of this bill the control that comes \nfrom the cloture process, and we will assure this bill passes to \nprovide money to those in the disaster areas. The bill affects \ndisasters in 33 States, Mr. President. We will give this bill to the \nconference and to the President as quickly as possible.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 208\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 208.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill insert the following:\n       None of the funds made available in the Foreign Operations, \n     Export Financing, and Related Programs, 1997, (as contained \n     in Public Law 104-208) may be made available for assistance \n     to Uruguay unless the Secretary of State certifies to the \n     Committees on Appropriations that all cases involving seizure \n     of U.S. business assets have been resolved.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is an amendment that we hope will \nbring about an awareness of Government officials of Uruguay of a very \nsad situation with regard to the fishing assets from Washington State \nand Alaska that were entered into in a joint venture with a seafood \ncompany in Uruguay.\n  What happened was that the assets of the Americans were seized after \nthey were in Uruguay territory, and the joint venture that was supposed \nto be forthcoming was dissolved by actions of the Uruguay citizens.\n  I offer this amendment sort of in frustration, trying to see if we \ncan work out with the Uruguay Embassy here and officials in the State \nDepartment at Montevideo a resolution of this problem.\n  I hope that it has the salutary effect of calling the attention of \nthe Uruguay Government to a very unsatisfactory development with regard \nto our business relationships.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Alaska.\n  The amendment (No. 208) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is the time for filing of second-\ndegree amendments, I remind Senators. It is also the time set for the \nvote on cloture motion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/07/senate-section/article/S4043-5", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4045-S4067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Senator Byrd and I are overwhelmed by the \nsupport of the Senate for this bill. I hope that will be demonstrated \nin the hours to come.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, might we have order, please? It is very \ndifficult to hear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please come to order.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we would like to work up a schedule, \nrotating from one side to the other with amendments. I want to state to \nthe Senate the amendments that have been filed touch or concern every \none of our 13 subcommittees. Those subcommittees' staffs are standing \nby now to confer with any Member who really wants to pursue one of \nthese 109 amendments that have been filed.\n  I ask the Chair to help us keep order. We would anticipate, for the \ninformation of the Senate, with the concurrence of the two leaders, \nthat we would proceed with the D'Amato amendment and then the Bumpers \namendment and, if possible, another amendment and have our first series \nof stacked votes sometime around 12:30 to 1 o'clock.\n  We will keep the Senate informed, but I do want the Senate to know we \nwill try to stack votes so that none will occur prior to approximately \n12:30 to 1 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nYork.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 166\n\n   (Purpose: To rescind JOBS Funds, extend the transition period for \n          aliens receiving SSI funds, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Reid \namendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I ask that amendment No. 166 be called up and that \nSenator Feinstein's name be added as an original cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. D'Amato], for himself, Mr. \n     Chafee, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Specter, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mrs. \n     Boxer, proposes an amendment numbered 166.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 44, strike all after line 19, through line 2 on \n     page 45, and insert in lieu thereof the following:\n\n\n                  ``JOB OPPORTUNITIES AND BASIC SKILLS\n\n                              (RESCISSION)\n\n       Of the funds made available under this heading in Public \n     Law 104-208, there is rescinded an amount equal to the total \n     of the funds within each State's limitation for fiscal year \n     1997 that are not necessary to pay such State's allowable \n     claims for such fiscal year.\n       Section 403(k)(3)(F) of the Social Security Act (as in \n     effect on October 1, 1996) is amended by adding after the \n     ``,'' the following: ``reduced by an amount equal to the \n     total of those funds that are within each State's limitation \n     for fiscal year 1997 that are not necessary to pay such \n     State's allowable claims for such fiscal year (except that \n     such amount for such year shall be deemed to be \n     $1,000,000,000 for the purpose of determining the amount of \n     the payment under subsection (1) to which each State is \n     entitled),''.''\n       On page 75, strike all after line 10 through line 22 on \n     page 80, and insert in lieu thereof the following:\n\n           ``TITLE VI--SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME AMENDMENT\n\n     ``SEC. 601.

Mr. President, on behalf of myself, Senator Chafee, \nSenator DeWine, Senator Feinstein, and Senator Specter, I call up this \namendment because, notwithstanding the attempt--and I appreciate it--by \nthe Appropriations Committee initially to deal with a very vexing \nproblem, the problem of immigrants and the problem of legal immigrants \nand the problem really dealing with legal immigrants, most of whom are, \na good percentage are disabled and who are elderly who would otherwise \nbe cut off August 22, notwithstanding that they came into the country \nlegally, that they are currently receiving benefits, that if these \nbenefits were to be cut off in some States, they would be faced with \nlittle, if any, help.\n  In other States, the burden would be a tremendous one on some of the \nlocal municipalities and the States. This amendment would continue the \nexisting funding of those legal immigrants--let's understand, we are \ntalking about people who came into this country legally; we are talking \nabout people who obeyed the law; we are talking about, for most cases, \nsenior citizens, elderly, and disabled--to continue their SSI benefits.\n  Mr. President, it seems to me that this is a prudent way in which to \nhandle what could otherwise be a very disastrous problem for 500,000 \npeople, most of whom are elderly, in this country. That is a half-\nmillion people. That is a lot of people who would be facing tremendous \nhardship, many who have no one in a position to be of any kind of \nassistance. For others, without their SSI payments and cut off from \nfood stamps, their families would be in perilous situations even \nattempting to give them modest help.\n  Let me say that I am deeply appreciative of the leadership that has \nbeen displayed by the Senate majority leader, the chairman of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee, and our distinguished colleague from \nWest Virginia, in attempting to deal with this problem in a way that \nwill give us additional time.\n  Again, we are not talking about people who came into this country \nillegally, people who are trying to take advantage of the system. We \nare taking an opportunity to give the Congress of the United States and \nthe President sufficient time to work out a program that will see to it \nthat the system is not abused but, by the same token, see to it that \npeople are not disadvantaged as a result of the significant work of the \nCongress in bringing about workfare as opposed to welfare.\n\n[[Page S4047]]\n\n  Let me say what the situation is in terms of New York. In New York, \nwe are talking about 80,000 legal immigrants who now would be facing \ntermination of benefits--80,000. Again, Mr. President, the vast number \nwho are senior citizens, many of them have tremendous language \nbarriers, many of them have been in this country for a number of years, \nsome not long enough to qualify for Social Security benefits, all of \nthem here legally. Mr. President, 70,000 of these people are in the \ncity of New York.\n  What an incredible impact that would be to the city, to the State, \nand to other communities. As I look around, I see my colleagues from \nCalifornia, who have the same kind of problem. I see my colleague from \nRhode Island. It is a tremendous problem that would be created. That \nwas never our intent in terms of reforming the welfare system. Ours was \nto create an opportunity for workfare, not a system that entraps \npeople. Ours says to those who are capable of going out and holding a \njob or getting into a job training program that you just cannot take \nadvantage of the system. But I do not believe it was one in which we \nenvisioned just cutting off those people who cannot do for themselves. \nWe are a compassionate country. We are a country which is ready and \nrecognizes the need to help those citizens who cannot do for \nthemselves.\n  So, let me say this. The Social Security Administration estimates \nthat SSI recipients who received notices of possible termination of \nbenefits are made up of--let me just give you an idea who these half a \nmillion people are: 72 percent are women; 41 percent are over the age \nof 75; 18 percent are over the age of 85. Are we going to say to those \npeople, 18 percent over the age of 85, ``go out and get a job''? What \nare we going to do?\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield on that point for a question?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Certainly.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York for \noffering this amendment. I say to him, and I am sure Senator Feinstein \nwill amplify this, that this is so crucial to our State, as he has \nsaid, and I know the Senator is aware--and I will put this in the form \nof a question--that in the budget agreement that was reached among all \nparties, this issue was recognized. What the Senator from New York is \ndoing is carrying over this agreement, that these people need the \ncertainty of assistance because they are very old, they are very frail, \nthey are very disabled, and what the Senator is doing is, in essence, \nsaying that that agreement ought to really apply right now and these \npeople should not be under the threat of a cutoff. So he is restoring \nSSI to legal immigrants until all the new details are worked; am I \ncorrect in that?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. That is correct. What we are doing is providing the \nCongress, as well as these people, an additional 6 weeks from August \n22. A good number of these people during this period of time will be \nqualified as citizens, understanding, if you look at the age category \nof them, many of these people are elderly, there was never an impetus. \nIt is very difficult. They have language barriers, disabilities, \nproblems in communication and transportation. The immigration offices \nare swamped with those people who are attempting and who are eligible \nfor citizenship.\n  When you look at this, if close to 20 percent are over 85, we are \ntalking about almost 100,000, and most of them women, who are over the \nage of 85, who may have disabilities, who may have language problems \njust trying to qualify them for citizenship. In some cases, they will \nnot have to take the ordinary test. But how do we get them that \ninformation? How do we get them there in time? It cannot be done \nbetween now and August 22. New York City Mayor Giuliani is engaged in \nan outreach program to contact many of these elderly immigrants and \ngive them an opportunity to qualify for full citizenship; therefore, \nthey would not have to be concerned with the cut off in benefits.\n  So for all of those reasons, this additional time will also give us \nand our colleagues an opportunity--as well as the administration--to \nexamine what the program will be in the fullness of time after October \n1.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask the Senator to add me as a \ncosponsor.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom California, Senator Boxer, be added as an original cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I thank Senator Chafee for his support \nand leadership and, again, the leaders of the Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Stevens, and the ranking minority member from West Virginia, \nSenator Byrd, for their leadership, for their compassion in \nunderstanding and finding the resources to make this extension \navailable. Senator Byrd has always demonstrated a great compassion and \nconcern for senior citizens in particular, and they are the ones who \nwould be most victimized if we were not to continue this action. I \nyield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise to support the D'Amato-Chafee resolution. I am \nvery pleased to be a cosponsor. I want to point out that two cities in \nthis Nation are impacted more than any other, and that is the city of \nLos Angeles and the city of New York. In California alone, there are \n310,000 legal immigrants currently receiving SSI benefits. Under the \npresent law, they all go off on August 22, regardless of need.\n  I want to clear the air somewhat, because the \nadministration proposal, accepted by the Budget Committee, does not \ncover elderly legal immigrants. In other words, if you are 85 years old \nand monolingual in another language, you cannot get a job, but come \nAugust 22, under the agreement, you would be out on the streets. Either \nyou are homeless or else it is a transfer to the local government to be \npicked up by the counties' general assistance grant.\n\n  This proposal of Senator D'Amato's essentially takes that August 22 \ndeadline and extends it to October 1, giving us time to work with the \nadministration, work with the Appropriations Committee and try to see \nif there is not a better solution.\n  If only disabled are covered, which is currently the case under the \nproposed bipartisan agreement, this means that only refugees and \nasylees who have exhausted the 7 years would be eligible for SSI only \nif they are disabled. This impacts 61,360 people in California; 60 \npercent of those who are disabled and 40 percent of the elderly would \nnot be affected by this legislation.\n  So we have a ways to go in reconciling what is really out there in \nterms of problems of people who are elderly and the proposal that is \npart of the bipartisan agreement. The D'Amato proposal extends that \ndeadline by 2 months and gives us an opportunity to work this out. I \nthink it is extraordinarily important that that happen.\n  Additionally, I pay my compliments to the Senator from Rhode Island. \nSenator Chafee and I have a bill which would extend SSI for all of \nthose who are presently covered by SSI, not prospectively, not for \nnewcomers, but for those people already in this country for whom we \nhave certain responsibilities who are unable to have any other source \nof income to support themselves. Our bill, I think, is the long-term \nsolution that is the most viable.\n  So I thank Senator D'Amato--he is also a cosponsor of the Chafee-\nFeinstein bill--for offering this, and I am very hopeful that a \ndominant majority of this body will see the wisdom in adopting it.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 145\n\n   (Purpose: To rescind JOBS Funds, extend the transition period for \n          aliens receiving SSI funds, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, for the purpose of technical adjustment, \nI ask unanimous consent that the clerk instead report No. 145 in place \nof amendment No. 166 and that that be the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, so that the Record properly reflects the \ncosponsors, in addition to myself, they are Senator Chafee, Senator \nDeWine, Senator Specter, Senator Feinstein, Senator Kohl, Senator \nMoynihan, and Senator Kennedy as well.\n\n[[Page S4048]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, amendment No. 166 is \nwithdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 166) was withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report amendment No. 145.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. D'Amato], for himself, Mr. \n     Chafee, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Specter, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \n     Moynihan, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Kohl and Mr. Kennedy, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 145.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO.

The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, first, I congratulate Senator D'Amato for \nhis work on this amendment which will mean so much to so many people \nwho he has well described as being the frailest in our society.\n  I also pay tribute to Senator Feinstein with whom I have worked on a \nprogram similar to this for the long-term solution, as she pointed out. \nIt may well be that we will turn to that when we start the new fiscal \nyear.\n  I also want to salute Senator DeWine, who is not on the floor at this \nmoment. I hope he will be here soon. But I wanted to pay tribute to him \nbecause he has worked very hard on it.\n  Mr. President, I would like to extend my thanks to the distinguished \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, the Senator from Alaska, and \nthe distinguished ranking member of that committee, the Senator from \nWest Virginia, who have agreed to accept this amendment. I am very \nappreciative of that.\n  I am speaking on behalf of 3,750 legal immigrants--legal immigrants--\nin my State who would face the loss of these SSI benefits but for the \npassage of this legislation, which I hope will be accepted in the House \nlikewise. That group of 3,750 Rhode Island seniors, as the Senator from \nNew York has described, fits in that typical pattern of 18 percent \nbeing over 85 and so forth.\n  Mr. President, this is a good amendment. What it does, it gets us \nthrough the remainder of this fiscal year and gives us a little \nbreathing time.\n  Mr. President, as you know, in the underlying bill there is a block \ngrant of $125 million. This replaces that. I think that is wise because \na block grant would cause a lot of problems in its distribution, trying \nto set up a new system to get the money out. The continuation of the \nexisting system of the SSI benefits is, I believe strongly, the right \nway to go.\n  So this is an occasion where I think we can all celebrate a little \nbit. I was strongly supportive of the welfare reform bill that we \npassed last year. I believe in it. I think it is working.\n  At the time when we foresaw the difficulties that were going to come \nup under this particular group, I supported legislation to take care of \nthem. That did not pass. I believe it was the legislation of the \nSenator from the State of California. It did not pass. But now we are \nattacking that problem.\n  As I mentioned before, I think it is coming out in a very \nsatisfactory way. So I want to thank the Chair. And, again, I do want \nto point out that Senator DeWine is deeply interested in this, as is \nSenator Specter. Senator DeWine may be on the floor a little later. I \nwant to extend my appreciation to his work on this and also to the \nleadership of both parties in the Senate for permitting this to be \naccepted.\n  Thank you very much.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I understand that there may be somebody \nin opposition. But at this point, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, let me simply say, I am just going to \nlook at one statistic again and put it in terms of not just saying 18 \npercent of all of those are over the age of 85. We are talking about \n90,000 people, seniors--90,000. Many of them, again, are disabled. Many \nof them have problems with the language. All of them are here in this \ncountry legally. Let us understand that. Let us understand that three-\nquarters of those people, better than 65,000, are women.\n  Are we really going to say to grandmothers, grandparents, to the \nelderly, to the frailest of the frail, ``No more will we meet even your \nminimum needs''? That is not what this country is about. That is \ncertainly not what I intended nor do I think any Members intended when \nwe voted for the reform of the welfare system. I voted for that. I \nthink we did the right thing.\n  I think we can make this bill a much better bill by not only \ncontinuing this program now, but then we will argue, and it will give \nus an opportunity for those to come forward and have a fuller discourse \nin the future. But certainly, certainly, we should not terminate it \nnow.\n  Again, I want to thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Stevens, and the ranking member, Senator Byrd, for their \nunderstanding and their support of this legislative correction. It is a \ncorrection. It is one. And there is nothing wrong with saying we can do \nit better, we erred at this point in time. I did.\n  Let me tell you, I was concerned that there were many people who were \ntaking advantage of the system. There were those who said and pledged, \n``Yeah. We'll take care of our elderly, our relatives,'' and instead of \ndoing that, they gamed the system and put them right into SSI. Well, \nthat is wrong. We should see to it that that does not take place. But \nfor us now to say, with one fell swoop all of them will be \ndisadvantaged who are presently receiving, that is something that I \nwould not in good conscience support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues \nfrom New York and Rhode Island, Senator D'Amato and Senator Chafee, in \noffering this amendment to extend Supplemental Security Income [SSI] \ncoverage to disabled, legal immigrants until the end of the fiscal \nyear. This amendment is consistent with the recent agreement between \nthe congressional leadership and President Clinton to allow disabled, \nlegal immigrants to continue receiving SSI and Medicaid benefits.\n  First, let me commend my friends from New York and Rhode Island, \nSenator D'Amato and Senator Chafee, for their extraordinary efforts on \nbehalf of legal immigrants. It is safe to say that the bipartisan \nagreement to restore SSI and Medicaid benefits to disabled, legal \nimmigrants would not have been made without their leadership.\n  Plain and simple, this is an issue of fairness--fairness to those who \nplayed\n\n[[Page S4049]]\n\nby the rules to become legal immigrants, only to see those rules \nchanged to their detriment.\n  While the budget agreement provides hope to legal immigrants, a \ntemporary measure is needed to protect those immigrants who would stand \nto benefit from the budget agreement. That's the purpose of the \namendment we are offering today. As my colleagues know, the 1996 \nwelfare law bans legal immigrants from receiving SSI benefits beginning \nAugust 22, 1997--1 year after the day the law was signed. This 1-year \ntransition period was designed to give legal immigrants time to obtain \ncitizenship without losing eligibility, and to provide State and local \ngovernments time to adjust to increased demand for general assistance.\n  The Social Security Administration estimates that roughly 525,000 \nlegal immigrants currently receiving SSI could lose benefits under \ncurrent law. Of that number, roughly 3,000 are from Ohio--and more than \nhalf of those immigrants, roughly 1,700 reside in Cuyahoga County. Many \nof these immigrants will seek and obtain citizenship and thus, can \nstill receive SSI. However, many disabled immigrants currently \nreceiving Federal support may not be able to become citizens. It is \nthis population that stands to lose the most if current law is not \nchanged.\n  The Jewish Community Federation of Cleveland brought to my attention \nseveral families that would be affected if the law is not changed. Lev \nand Ada Vaynshtock, ages 64 and 60 respectively, came to this country \nfrom Moldova in 1991. They reside in Cleveland.\n  Ada has passed her citizenship exam and is eagerly waiting to become \na U.S. citizen. Lev's memory is getting worse and worse after open-\nheart surgery, and may never become a citizen. Both currently are \neligible for SSI. Ada certainly will be able to retain her SSI \neligibility when she gains citizenship, but Lev stands to lose this \neligibility. If he outlives Ada, he will have no benefits at all--\nunless we act to change the law.\n  They are just one of many elderly Russian families--families that \nbecause of mental or physical disability, stand to lose their SSI \nbenefits later this summer. It is for them, and for countless others, \nthat compelled a bipartisan group of Senators to seek changes in the \nlaw to protect elderly people.\n  Let me emphasize to my colleagues that our efforts on behalf of \ndisabled legal immigrants does not alter the key policy changes made in \nlast year's welfare and immigration reform bills. Our efforts do not \nalter the basic policy change made last year that sponsors of legal \nimmigrants need to take more financial responsibility for legal \nimmigrants. Newly arrived immigrants still will have to abide by the \n1996 welfare and immigration laws.\n  Again, we're here to help those already here, those already disabled \nimmigrants who played by the rules. Although Congress and the President \nhave made a commitment to help this population, it may not be until the \nbeginning of the fiscal year before that relief is provided. We cannot \nhold disabled, legal immigrants hostage to the legislative process, \nespecially when they stand to lose benefits in a few short months.\n  Again, our efforts have been bipartisan. I want to commend the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee and the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, Senator Stevens and Senator Roth, and of course our \nmajority leader, Senator Lott, for working to place a temporary measure \nin the existing bill. The amendment we offer today simply expands that \neffort, to ensure that all immigrants who stand to retain their \nbenefits because of the budget agreement are not denied benefits while \nthe details of this agreement are worked out. What this amendment \noffers is certainty--the certainty that these immigrants will continue \nto receive benefits for an additional 6 weeks.\n  In short, the budget agreement reflects our long-term commitment to \nfairness. By passing this amendment, we can take a short-term first \nstep to realize that long-term goal.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise as an original cosponsor of the \namendment offered by my colleague from New York to extend Supplemental \nSecurity Income [SSI] benefits to elderly and disabled legal immigrants \nthrough the end of September. Under last year's welfare legislation, \nwhich I opposed, these individuals are to lose their SSI benefits in \nAugust. The budget agreement recently reached would restore SSI \nbenefits to many of these individuals. I support that effort, although \nmore should be done. This amendment will ensure that there is no \ninterruption of SSI benefits while legislation necessary to implement \nthe budget agreement is considered.\n  It is a welcome measure of compassion where there has been too little \nof late.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of the \nChafee-D'Amato amendment regarding SSI benefits to legal immigrants and \nrefugees. I am pleased to support this important first step to correct \na significant mistake of last year's welfare bill.\n  As you know, this amendment would extend the eligibility of disabled \nand elderly legal immigrants to the Supplemental Security Income \nProgram. These people, including approximately 5,000 in my home State \nof Wisconsin, were scheduled to lose their SSI benefits in August of \nthis year. As my colleagues from California, New York, Rhode Island, \nand elsewhere have explained, many others would have been similarly \naffected all across the country.\n  While many legal immigrants will become citizens by the August \ndeadline, without this amendment, State officials estimate that \napproximately 3,000 elderly and disabled legal immigrants living in \nvarious Wisconsin communities would have been cut off from their only \nsource of support. These are people who cannot work and who would not \nbe able to live or take care of their families without outside help. If \nthe Federal Government abandoned them, their most basic needs--shelter, \nfood, medical help--and the accompanying costs, would have fallen on \nthe shoulders of, and quite potentially overwhelmed, State and local \nresources.\n  Wisconsin has already decided to continue medical assistance to SSI \nrecipients. And the recently hatched budget deal contains even more \ncomprehensive remedies for the next fiscal year--two encouraging bits \nof news. Nonetheless, the extension of benefits from August to October \nwill provide crucial help until those long-term remedies take effect.\n  Mr. President, I supported the new welfare law. Policy reforms to \nmove people from welfare to work were laudable and long overdue. Yet \nthroughout the welfare debate I also supported numerous attempts, all \nof which failed, to soften the bill's restrictions on benefits to legal \nimmigrants and refugees.\n  Simply put, the welfare bill went too far. It was too harsh on legal \nimmigrants who come to this country with every intention of working \nhard and contributing to our economy and cultural melting pot. It also \nwas too harsh on refugees and asylees who come to this country to \nescape persecution in their native lands. To this latter group, the \nUnited States made and continues to make a unique commitment of \nassistance and guidance to help them rise above adversity and build a \nnew life for themselves and their families.\n  Wisconsin has been enriched by many different ethnic groups \nthroughout its history. That said, I would like to take this occasion \nto discuss a population that has been hit particularly hard by the \nwelfare changes--the Hmong and other highland peoples--who came to \nWisconsin and other parts of the country as refugees from Southeast \nAsia. Since coming, they have faced the challenges of integrating into \nAmerican society. Many arrived in this country illiterate because they \ndid not have a written language at home and have had a difficult time \nfulfilling the educational requirements of the citizenship application. \nIn August, many of the Hmong would have lost the SSI benefits that they \nhave relied upon to cope with these challenges.\n  Like most legal immigrants before and since, the Hmong and their \nchildren have strengthened our communities. But some of my colleagues \nmay not know of the Hmong's invaluable contribution to the United \nStates before ever setting foot in Wisconsin or anywhere else on \nAmerican soil.\n  Mr. President, Americans owe a debt of gratitude to the Hmong. Most \nof them fled their native country at the\n\n[[Page S4050]]\n\nend of the Vietnam war, fearing retribution for having fought for the \nUnited States alongside American soldiers and helping us through what \nwas a very difficult time in our history.\n  While no disabled or elderly legal immigrants should be left without \nhelp, I am particularly pleased to cosponsor the Chafee-D'Amato \namendment on behalf of the Hmong. It would be unconscionable to abandon \nthe Hmong in their time of need. They put their lives on the line in \ndefense of all that Americans hold dear--our freedom, our prosperity, \nand our way of life. Today, Congress has taken a very small step toward \nrepaying their priceless service to all Americans.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from California sought recognition on this \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  I would just like to add to my earlier comments with some of the \nspecific numbers from each of the big States of people that would not \nbe covered by the bipartisan budget agreement.\n  These are elderly people.\n  In California it is 163,900. In Florida it would be 44,310. In \nIllinois 13,360; in Massachusetts 13,410; in New York 65,340; and in \nTexas, 32,640. These are people who are above the age of 65.\n  It is my understanding that the administration, with Members in the \nother House, may have reached an agreement whereby they would agree to \ntry to certify some of these people as disabled. But, nonetheless, \nthese are the people, at least in the statistics of the Social Security \nAdministration, who would be dropped off come August 22 for sure right \nnow.\n  I think this is living testimony, in terms of numbers of people, to \nthe argument that Senator D'Amato, Senator Chafee, and I are making \nthat: Let us extend this by 2 months and see what we can do to effect a \nreasonable system where people will not become homeless or a major \ntransfer onto county general assistance rolls.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I hope all Members understand, however, \nwe are entirely in agreement with statements made so far concerning \nthese legal immigrants who will be covered by this procedure. \nHopefully, pursuant to the budget agreement, we will continue a policy \nof caring for people who are here legally now.\n  But I hope everyone, including the Immigration Service, is on notice \nit applies to those who are here now. In the future, I hope that we \nwill enforce the commitment made by those who sponsor legal immigrants \nto maintain those people that they sponsor in the event they become \nindigent and cannot support themselves. That is the commitment that we \nmust see carried forward once again in our basic law of protecting \nimmigration.\n  Again, it is my desire at this time, Mr. President, to ask the Senate \nto set aside the D'Amato amendment. This amendment and the Bumpers \namendment will be voted upon sometime before 1 o'clock today. That is \nour hope. There may be further proceedings with regard to the D'Amato \namendment. I do not want to jeopardize them. But I do ask unanimous \nconsent that we temporarily set aside the D'Amato amendment at this \ntime so we may proceed with the Bumpers amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Reid \namendment be temporarily set aside while I offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 64\n\n (Purpose: To strike section 310, relating to R.S. 2477 rights-of-way)\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 64.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 64.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 50, strike lines 1 through 11.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield at this point?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Yes.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Anne \nMcInerney be given privileges of the floor during the duration of this \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, for Members of this body who have not \ndealt with this issue on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \nthis is a slightly complex amendment. I am going to simplify it as best \nI can. We have had several hearings in the Energy Committee on it, but \nit deals with an issue that sounds so bizarre you would not believe it \nwas actually on the statute books of this country.\n  In 1866, Congress passed a bill which has become popularly known as \nR.S. 2477, Revised Statute 2477. What that law did, as part of the 1866 \nmining law, was to validate public highways built across unreserved \npublic lands.\n  That does not mean much, so here it is. The United States owns 350 \nmillion acres of land in the lower 48 States. Since 1866, we have set \naside millions and millions of acres in wilderness areas, national \nparks, monuments, all kind of things since 1866. But bear in mind, the \nR.S. 2477 statute said ``unreserved lands,'' so that meant all of the \npublic lands the United States owns that have not been set aside for \nanother purpose. The effect of that, of course, was, from 1866 until \n1976 when it was repealed, anybody who claimed a footpath, almost a cow \ntrail, a sled trail, hiking trails, almost anything would qualify as a \nhighway under the language in this bill.\n  A lot of highways were built under these R.S. 2477 rights-of-way \nbetween 1866 and 1976, and we are not contesting a single one of those.\n  What we are saying is, the provision put in this bill by the Senator \nfrom Alaska [Mr. Stevens] simply says we are going to let State law \ndetermine what is and is not a public, valid right-of-way.\n  This, admittedly, is primarily an Alaska, Utah, and probably Idaho \nissue. It does not affect my State. There are some of the Western \nStates that have these rights-of-way. But in any event, here is what \nthe law said as we passed it in 1866. ``[T]he right-of-way for the \nconstruction of public highways across public lands, not reserved for \npublic uses, is hereby granted.''\n  As I say, that includes dogsled trails, that includes footpaths, it \nincludes any kind of a path. And there are literally thousands and \nthousands of them that have been claimed.\n  Mr. President, I will come back to how the language in this bill will \nwork in just a moment. But listen to this. The State of Alaska has \npassed a law making every section line in Alaska a right-of-way and \nsubject to having a highway built on it. I am reluctant to say this, \nbut if you build on just half the rights-of-way that Alaska is \nclaiming, you would not be able to travel. There would be too many \nroads to get around.\n  In any event, I want to make it crystal clear that this amendment has \nnothing to do with existing highways that have been built under the \n1866 law.\n  Mr. President, there have never been regulations crafted to deal with \nthis issue. In the 1930's there was sort of a half-hearted regulation, \nbut not really anything.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Now, Mr. President, I want to make another point crystal \nclear, and it is this: When I said a moment ago that the effect of this \namendment would allow State law to determine what constitutes a valid \nexisting\n\n[[Page S4051]]\n\nright-of-way, it would take away the Secretary of the Interior's \nability to determine what was a highway. In short, all of these \nthousands and thousands of so-called R.S. 2477 right-of-way claims all \nover the West would become valid.\n  Now, bear in mind, there is another facet to this, and that is the \nSecretary in January of this year set out a policy which effectively \nrepealed a policy established by Donald Hodel when he was Secretary of \nInterior in 1988. The Hodel policy--it is not a regulation; we have \nnever had a rule or regulation, it was simply a policy statement--was \nthat just about anything could qualify as a highway.\n  Now, whether the Hodel policy stated that the States shall have \nexclusive rights to determine what a right-of-way is, I do not really \nknow right now, but I can tell you, if section 310 passes, State law \nwill determine what is going to happen to thousands of rights-of-way in \nthis country that cross national parks, wilderness areas, monuments, \nand any other land in the West that was set aside after these claimed \nrights-of-way existed.\n  Let me give an example. Assume that there are 20 rights-of-way that \nthe State of California would claim cross Yosemite National Park. They \nclaim those rights-of-way were established before Yosemite became a \nnational park. It was unreserved Federal land before, and these rights-\nof-way were across that Federal land. Later on, we establish Yosemite \nNational Park. Under this section, if the Stevens language stays in \nthis bill, which has absolutely no business being in this bill, but if \nmy amendment is defeated, that means that California law will dictate \nwhat highways can be built across Yosemite National Park--not the \nNational Park Service, not the Federal Government, but the State of \nCalifornia.\n  Think of all the thousands of rights-of-way that could be claimed in \nAlaska. Mr. President, just for openers, here are some of the claims \nthat have been filed. These are not all the claims that Alaska, Utah, \nIdaho, and other States have as to what constitutes a valid right-of-\nway. These are the ones that have actually been filed with the \nSecretary of Interior and requested to be declared an existing valid \nright-of-way on which they can build a four-lane superhighway, if they \ndesire. Alaska has 256 claims on file, but they have God knows how \nmany--thousands that they could claim. Idaho has 2,026 on file, and \nUtah has 6,173 claims filed in the Secretary's office. Those are a lot \nof potential highways across Federal lands, and the Federal Government \ncould not stop them no matter what kind of highway they wanted to \nbuild.\n  When I started off telling you how bizarre this was, just think about \nthat. When we held our first hearing in the Energy Committee on what to \ndo about these so-called R.S. 2477 rights-of-way, I may have been \ndense, but it took me a long time to understand that we were really \ntalking about something serious. I never heard of anything so bizarre \nin my life. Yet, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee--we all \nrepresent our States, and I am not holding him guilty of anything. I am \njust saying the rest of us do not have to follow suit. He is chairman \nof the committee and he puts this in a supplemental appropriations bill \ndesigned to aid areas hurt by natural disasters, including help for the \npeople of Arkansas. There is $6.5 million for debris removal in streams \nas a result of a tornado on March 1 in Arkansas. There is $3.5 million \nin this bill to allow an all-black community just outside Little Rock \nto tie into the Little Rock sewer system. Virtually the entire \ncommunity of College Station was wiped out, a community of less than \n500 people, and they cannot build new homes or borrow money to build \nnew homes until they get on the sewer system. And the chairman, very \ngraciously, and the committee, very graciously, accepted my amendment \nto put $3.5 million in there to accomplish that. How many nights did we \nlook at the Dakotas and Minnesota, which was a veritable lake?\n\n  Mr. President, do you know the name of the bill we are considering? \nIt is the emergency supplemental appropriations bill. The R.S. 2477 \nissue is no emergency. The language I am trying to strike was put in \nthere and it had nothing to do with any kind of disaster or emergency. \nIt was put in there to accommodate primarily the States of Alaska, \nUtah, and Idaho. I have nothing against any of those States, but I tell \nyou what I do have, I do have a strong feeling about protecting the \ncitizens of this country and the Federal lands which they all own. Some \nof it is in my State--admittedly, not as much as in Alaska and some \nWestern States--but every single Member of the U.S. Senate has a solemn \nobligation, occasionally, to stand on their hind legs and say no to \nsuch things as this.\n  Every Senator has or will have a letter on his desk from Secretary \nBabbitt saying he will strongly urge the President to veto this $8 \nbillion bill if this provision is left in it. Why wouldn't he? My point \nis, why are we, U.S. Senators, holding the people of North Dakota, \nSouth Dakota, and Minnesota hostage to an amendment that should not be \non this bill? It is not an emergency. It is not even an appropriations \nmeasure.\n  Mr. President, I get terribly exercised about things like this \nbecause I think I have a solemn duty to bring this to the attention of \nthe Senate. In January of this year, Secretary Babbitt, not popular \nwith Western Senators--but that has nothing to do with this amendment. \nWhat it does have to do with this amendment is whether or not we are \ngoing to allow every single State who can identify a pig trail that was \nused by human occupants any time between 1866 and 1976, across lands \nthat have subsequently been made national parks, monuments, and \nwilderness areas, whether we are going to allow those States to \ndetermine that those trails are now highways and then build highways on \nthem with no input from the Secretary.\n  So Secretary Babbitt, in January of this year, issued a policy--not a \nrule, not a regulation, but a policy. Here is what his policy said. It \ndefines a highway to be ``a thoroughfare used by the public for the \npassage of vehicles carrying people or goods.'' Now, Secretary \nBabbitt's policy also allows for the abdication of State law to the \nextent consistent with Federal law, which, of course, makes Federal law \ndominant, as it should be.\n  Nobody is trying to punish Alaska. Nobody is trying to punish Idaho. \nNobody is trying to punish Utah. What we are trying to do is say these \nsacred parks and monuments that we have developed over the years--\nYellowstone, Yosemite, Bryce Canyon, Saguaro, you name it--you cannot \nlet the States just walk in and willy-nilly start building highways \nacross those places. If you do not vote for my amendment, that is \nprecisely what you are voting for.\n  Mr. President, I hope the Senate will pay attention to this issue--as \nI say, this is an arcane issue. Most people in this country do not have \na clue that a law such as R.S. 2477 ever existed. I want to get help to \nthe people of my State who have been devastated by tornadoes. I want to \nget help to people in California who have suffered from floods, to the \nDakotas and Minnesota, one of the most awesome things we have ever \nwatched on television. This bill is designed to help them. That is what \na compassionate, caring government does.\n  One of the reasons I voted against the constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget is because it would have prohibited the Congress \nfrom appropriating money to help people who had suffered that kind of \ndisaster because it would unbalance the budget. You could not do it \nwithout a 60 percent vote of both Houses, and if you did not get it, \nthey just suffered. That is what would happen a lot of times.\n  I am not going to belabor this. I have made the point as well as I \ncan. I see the junior Senator from Alaska on the floor. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of my friend \nfrom Arkansas. But the Senator from Arkansas says that this is not an \nemergency, and, as a consequence, this particular provision that is in \nthe appropriations supplemental should not be here. Well, he is \nabsolutely wrong because this is an emergency. It's a raid on the \nWestern States of this Nation. The reason it is a raid, Mr. President, \nis because we are going to change the rules all of a sudden. Why are we \nchanging the rules? Because the Secretary of the Interior doesn't want \nthe States to continue to have the rights that we have had for 130 \nyears. We have had a law for 130 years, a law that ensures access \nacross public lands, which\n\n[[Page S4052]]\n\nspecifically addresses that there was some kind of a highway, some kind \nof an access in existence prior to October 21, 1976.\n  Now, the Secretary of the Interior proposes to take this authority \naway from the States and give it to the Federal Government. That is why \nit is an emergency. We are fighting for survival. Here is a picture of \nmy State of Alaska. I hope the Senator will take a good look at it, \nbecause here is Alaska today, Mr. President--a State with 33,000 miles \nof coastline. You can see our highway system here. We had one new \nhighway built in the last 20 years, the Dalton Trail, which parallels \nthe pipeline. This is an area one-fifth the size of the United States, \nMr. President.\n  If the motion to strike prevails by the Senator from Arkansas, our \ntraditional access routes will be eliminated. Let me show you a map, \nMr. President, of the State of Arkansas. There is the highway system in \nArkansas, Mr. President; it's a fully developed State. It has been a \nState of the Union for over 100 years. My State has been in existence \nfor 39 years. Here is a map of Arkansas today--roads all over the \nplace. They are necessary for the economy of the area. I don't take \nissue with the road system. These roads came about in the development \nover a long period of time in the State, as we would anticipate. So \nthere we have the basic issue.\n  The Senator from Arkansas says that virtually any access across \npublic land would be provided if indeed this portion that he wants to \nstrike remains in the legislation. Well, let me tell you, as chairman \nof the committee with jurisdiction over R.S. 2477, I'll just say that \nthe rights-of-way are the future vitality of our State.\n  Despite all the rhetoric that has been made about this provision, it \nsimply amounts to a tightening of a permanent moratorium placed on the \nFederal Government last year. It is that simple. What we want to do is \nkeep in place the law as it has been for 130 years, keep the \ndepartmental regulations as they have been codified since 1932, I \nbelieve, and again in 1974.\n  Now, the only thing that has changed in this debate is the level to \nwhich the administration will go to provide scare tactics to influence \nthis process. Let me state here that I find some of the rhetoric coming \nout of the Interior Department concerning this provision absolutely \nreprehensible.\n  I have a copy of a letter the Secretary of Interior sent to the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee last week. At best, this \nletter shows an alarming ignorance of the history, topography, and the \neconomy of the Western States. At worst, it shows the level of deceit \nthat this administration is evidently willing to go to in order to \nmislead the American public about this issue.\n  Now, in this letter there is a claim that a provision in this bill \nwill create some 984,000 miles of new highways in Alaska, based on a \n1923 Alaska law creating section-line rights-of-way. That is a fallacy, \nMr. President. This is in a State--my State--which currently has just \nover 13,000 total miles of roads, along with the marine highway system. \nAlaska has a population of about 600,000, a budget deficit, and the \nlast road built in Alaska cost more than $6 million per mile, down from \nWhitehorse to Skagway, the U.S. portion.\n  If you take the miles the Secretary is talking about in his scare \nletter, you would have to spend just roughly $6 quadrillion to build \nthese proposed roads in our State--more money than even the current \nadministration could even dream up in taxes.\n\n  The Secretary contends that this is going to happen because the \nsection-line law exists in Alaska. Here are some facts about that. The \nState has had a section-line law on the books since 1923. That is the \none correct statement in Secretary Babbitt's letter. The State has had \nthe ability to assert section lines since 1923. There are no current \nrights-of-way based on section lines in Alaska. The State has never \nfiled a section-line right-of-way. We have the right, but we also have \nthe self-discipline. According to the Governor's office during last \nyear's hearing, the State has no intention to ever file a section-line \nright-of-way. The fact is, section lines have little or no practical \napplication as transportation corridors in Alaska due to the difficulty \nof the terrain.\n  Second, the Secretary also states:\n\n       My efforts over the past several years have been directed \n     to establish a clear, certain, and fair process to bring \n     these claims to conclusion . . . the public will be poorly \n     served by Congressional action that has the effect of \n     rescinding the Department's current orderly manner of \n     proceeding to deal with the right-of-way claims.\n\n  I find that statement interesting, considering what the Secretary \nwrote us in 1993, which was:\n\n       I have instructed the BLM to defer any processing of R.S. \n     2477 assertions except in cases where there is a \n     demonstrated, compelling, and immediate need to make such \n     determinations.\n\n  So, in fact, the administration's orderly process of dealing with \nthese claims is to take no action whatsoever.\n  Well, Mr. President, the fact is, if an R.S. 2477 was not in \nexistence on October 21, 1976, it will not and cannot, by definition, \nbe created now. This is what the statement of my friend from Arkansas \nsuggests will lead to simply an open and arbitrary selection of areas \nacross public land. He said, ``Just about anything, anybody, any \nexcuse, will get you access.'' It will not, Mr. President. It is \nmisleading and it is inappropriate to suggest that. You must have had \nin existence on October 21, 1976, evidence of utilization of that area \nas a trail, as a highway, some kind of route.\n  Let me show you what we have here, Mr. President. This is a map made \nin 1917, before Alaska became a State. What it shows here is rather \ninteresting, because this is what this issue today is all about. It is \nabout access, early access. The two definitive identifiers in red here \nare winter stage lines and U.S. Government winter U.S. trails to \nFairbanks. We didn't have a highway system. These two large red \nroutings were trails, winter trails. In the summertime, they were used \nas wagon trails. That was access into the interior. Today, these two \nrepresent highways. These greens are the R.S. 2477's that provide \naccess routes across public lands, so that we can get from Fairbanks \nout to McGrath, we can get from Nome out to the gold fields, across \npublic lands.\n  Let me show you why it is so important in Alaska relative to having \nthe assurance of access across public lands. This is Alaska. Every \ncolor you see is a Federal withdrawal, Mr. President. Take a look at \nit. Federal withdrawal. Now, how in the world are we going to get from \nthe southern part of the State to the northern part of the State \nthrough all these colors, because the only area that the State controls \nare the white areas? We have to have access. This law gives us that \naccess. That is why this is an emergency. It is an emergency because \nthe Secretary wants to take that authority away. We have had the \nauthority for 130 years.\n  Look at what we have done with it, relative to highways in Alaska. We \nhaven't wandered all over the place. We have 13,000 miles of roads. But \nwe have to have access, and that is why it is so vital that this matter \nbe addressed now. We have to have access down from Prudhoe Bay. We have \na little, tiny corridor, 3 miles wide. This is all Federal withdrawal. \nHow are we going to get east and west if we don't have this provision? \nWe simply can't get there from here. So while it doesn't mean much from \nthe standpoint of the constituents in Arkansas, who have a State that \nis fully developed with a road system that looks like this, we have a \nsituation where it is the lifeblood and the future of our State to have \nthe assurance that we are going to have access, because the Federal \nGovernment basically owns our State.\n\n  The Secretary wants to take that authority away from us. The senior \nSenator from Alaska and I and the Senators from Utah are all sensitive \nto the realities associated with this. This is our lifeblood. We have \nto have it. It is an emergency. It is necessary now. The administration \nand the Secretary want to take the authority away from the States and \ngive it to the Federal Government. We all know what that means, Mr. \nPresident. That means disaster.\n  The fact is, again, if an R.S. 2477 was not in existence on October \n21, 1976, it will not and cannot, by definition, be created now. So \nwhen we look at those old maps of Alaska, we have to go back and \nascertain and prove that we have had a trail, we have had a sled dog\n\n[[Page S4053]]\n\ntrail, we have had a regular route of access. If we can prove that, \nthen we have a right to public access across the land. That is what \nthis issue is all about. It is a legitimate States rights issue. The \nonly thing is, most of the States aren't affected anymore. But some of \nthe Western States are, and it is our lifeblood.\n  The problem, of course, is the prevailing attitude of the Secretary \nof the Interior, who basically controls public land in our State--his \nparticular attitude toward allowing us--which we can do under current \nlaw--to get across those public areas. But that is going to be taken \naway. And as a consequence of that, Mr. President, we are at the \nabsolute mercy of the Secretary of the Interior if the motion to strike \nby my friend from Arkansas prevails.\n  I am not going to speak about what happened in Utah last fall. The \nSenators from Utah are here to state that. It is a perfect example of \nwhat happens when a small cadre of administrative officials take it \nupon themselves to decide how America's public lands should be used. I \nhave worked with my friend from Arkansas for a long time. We have been \nable to work on many issues that we agree upon. But during that time, \nwe have had different approaches to some issues. In 1995, a number of \nWestern Senators, upset about the Department of the Interior's proposed \nregulations on R.S. 2477, sought to place the language in the proposed \nhighway bill overturning the effect of the proposed regulations.\n  Many of my colleagues will remember that the final passage of that \nbill was delayed until late in the evening until we could resolve the \nissue during the day. The Senator from Arkansas and I met to discuss \nthe issue. We didn't come out with any finality about how to solve the \nR.S. 2477 debate. But we did agree for the time being placing a \nmoratorium on the Department from issuing any regulations. That made \nsense.\n  So in the 1995 national highway bill there appeared a 1-year \nmoratorium on the department from issuing any rules or regulations on \nthe issue. For the most part, this held the status quo, as it has been \nfor the past, as I said, 130 years in terms of R.S. 2477 right-of-way.\n  I, along with a number of Western Senators, introduced Senate bill \n1425 last Congress to set out an orderly process by which people can \nsubmit their right-of-way claims to the department to seek formal \nrecognition. My friend from Arkansas opposed that, and in the end we \nagreed upon compromise legislation that passed out of the committee. \nThe compromise legislation placed a permanent moratorium on the \nGovernment by stating, ``No final rule or regulation of any agency of \nthe Federal Government pertaining to the recognition, management, or \nvalidity of a right-of-way pursuant to Revised Statute 2477 shall take \neffect unless expressly authorized by an act of Congress subsequent to \nthe date of enactment of this act.''\n  It is this language that was placed in last year's Omnibus \nAppropriations Act, and is law today. We agreed to only prevent final \nrules and regulations in the hope that the Department would work on \ndeveloping a more reasonable recognition process that could be \nsubmitted to Congress for approval. Unfortunately, it has been about 8 \nmonths now since that legislation passed, and there is no indication \nthat the Secretary has any intention of submitting regulations. \nInstead, what the Secretary has decided now to do is to shred the \nlongstanding departmental policy regarding R.S. 2477 regulations and \nreplace it with his own. That is why this is an emergency now. It is \nthe lifeblood of the Western States who are still developing and need \naccess, and need the assurance that we will be able to cross public \nland as long as we are able to prove that we have traditionally used \nthat access route prior to 1976--a wagon trail, a snow machine trail, a \ndog sled trail. And it doesn't mean much in New York. It doesn't mean \nmuch in Arkansas. But in Alaska that is how we can get there from here. \nWe simply have to have that assurance.\n  The real difference between the provision in the bill before Congress \ntoday and the permanent moratorium passed last year is that there is \nless likelihood that the administration will be able to find a way to \nskirt around congressional intent with this provision.\n  Mr. President, in my State these were coveted promises that we were \nadvised would be available to us when we accepted statehood--that we \nwould have the opportunity to access across public land based on \ntraditional utilization, trails, rights, and so forth.\n  To make the statement that almost anywhere indiscriminately one could \nclaim a route across public land, or parks, or recreation areas is \nabsolutely absurd. The only areas, again, that have any justification \nfor consideration under R.S. 2477 are the historical areas of use prior \nto 1976 across unreserved public lands.\n  So, Mr. President, as we conclude this debate, I encourage my \ncolleagues to dismiss the rhetoric suggested by my friend from Arkansas \nwho is, obviously, carrying the weight of the Secretary of the \nInterior. But when he makes statements that just about anybody or any \nexcuse is justifiable in coming across public land is unrealistic. When \nhe suggests that this is no emergency and should not be on the \nappropriations supplemental, he is wrong because it is an emergency. \nThey are going to take this away from us by administrative fiat. That \nis the bottom line.\n  So here we are today, Mr. President, responsibly; 13,000 miles of \nroad, an area one-fifth the size of the United States. This action by \nthe Secretary of the Interior would eliminate the right that we have as \na State, and the commitments that we had coming into the Union, to have \nthe assurance that we would have continued access across public land.\n\n  So I encourage my colleagues on this vote to recognize the \nsignificance of what this means to Western States. This was a promise \nmade by the Federal Government--a commitment that they are proposing to \ntake away. It is unrealistic. It is unjust.\n  This belongs in here because we need the continued assurance that we \nwill have an opportunity, and in an orderly manner, to pursue, if you \nwill, access that was guaranteed when Alaska became a State and when \nother Western States came into the Union.\n  I yield to the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Alaska for the \nexcellent remarks he has made. He has summarized this as well as anyone \ncould. He is an expert in this area.\n  And I compliment my colleague from Utah for the work he is doing in \nthis area. He is a great leader in this area. I personally appreciate \nthe leadership that he has provided. He will show through descriptive \nevidence some of the problems that we have.\n  Let me just say this: I also want to thank Senator Stevens, the \nsenior Senator from Alaska. Both he and Senator Murkowski have provided \nour colleagues with a good overview of where the situation now stands, \nwhy the language in the supplemental appropriations bill is necessary, \nand why Senators should oppose the amendment of our good friend and \ncolleague, Senator Bumpers.\n  I want to commend Senators Murkowski and Stevens for their leadership \non this matter. They know and understand the issue better than anyone \nelse in this body. When it comes to preserving rights-of-way over \npublic lands for State and local governments, there are no better \nadvocates than the two of them, and certainly the senior Senator from \nAlaska, who himself served in the Interior Department. I am pleased to \njoin with them today, and I thank them on behalf of the citizens of my \nState for leading this effort.\n  For several years now the Department of Interior and the U.S. \nCongress have been at odds over that Department's effort regarding \nvested property rights essential to states and local governments \nthroughout the west. On at least three occasions, Congress has blocked \npromulgation of Interior Department regulations intended to regulate \nretroactively the terms and conditions of the establishment of certain \nhighway rights-of-way vested between the middle of the last century and \n1976.\n  As Senator Murkowski indicated, the Department of Interior, \nfrustrated by Congress, is now attempting to do indirectly that which \nit cannot do directly. The Department is attempting to implement the \nblocked regulations under the guise of a new policy guidance issued on \nJanuary 22 of this year. This\n\n[[Page S4054]]\n\nguidance promotes a concept of Federal law which preempts State law, in \nspite of the fact that Federal courts have found State property laws \napplicable to issues such as vesting and scope of the right-of-way as a \nmatter of Federal law.\n  What is at stake here for those of us in the West is the preservation \nof what amounts to the primary transportation system and infrastructure \nof many rural cities and towns. The rights-of-way in question are found \nin the form of dirt roads, cart paths, small log bridges over streams \nor ravines, and other thoroughfares and ways whose development and use \nwas originally authorized in 1866 during the homesteading activities \nthat led to the establishment of western communities. They have been \ncreated over time and by necessity. In many cases, these roads are the \nonly routes to farms and ranches; they provide necessary access for \nschool buses, emergency vehicles, and mail delivery. These highways--\nand we are obviously not using the term ``highway'' in the modern \nsense--traverse Federal lands, which in Utah comprises nearly 70 \npercent of Utah's total acreage, and they have been an integral part of \nthe rural American landscape for over a hundred years. Congress created \nthese rights-of-way in 1866; Secretary Babbitt is now attempting to \neliminate, if not devalue, them in 1997.\n  Let me set forth for my colleagues, in as brief a form as possible, \nthe black letter principles applicable to this issue and why the \ndisposition of this matter is so critical to those of us representing \npublic lands States.\n  As has been stated, Revised Statutes 2477 states, in its entirety:\n\n       Sec. 8. And be it further enacted, That the right of way \n     for the construction of highways over public lands, not \n     reserved for public uses, is hereby granted. (Sec. 8 of the \n     Act of July 26, 1866, 14 Stat. 253, later codified at 43 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 932, repealed October 21, 1976.)\n\n  In 1976, Congress adopted the Federal Land Policy and Management Act \nof 1976 (FLPMA) that repealed these 26 words known as R.S. 2477. At the \nsame time, Congress included language protecting these valid existing \nrights, thus making the actions of the Department of Interior after \npassage of FLPMA subject to those rights. FLPMA explicitly states this:\n\n       Nothing in this Act, or in any amendment made by this Act, \n     shall be construed as terminating any valid lease, permit, \n     patent, right-of-way, or other land use right or \n     authorization existing on the date of approval of this act * \n     * * All actions by the Secretary concerned under this Act \n     shall be subject to valid existing rights. (FLPMA \n     Sec. Sec. 701 (a) and (h), 43 U.S.C. Sec. 1701 notes (a) and \n     (h).)\n\n  From 1938 until the repeal of R.S. 2477 in 1976 by FLPMA, regulations \npublished by the Department of Interior made it clear that the \nexecutive branch had no role to play in determining or regulating the \nvalidity or scope of R.S. 2477 rights-of-way. The regulations \nexplicitly stated that:\n\n       No application should be filed under R.S. 2477, as no \n     action on the part of the Government is necessary. 43 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 2822.1-1 (1972, emphasis added).\n\n  They further provided that:\n\n       Grants of rights-of-way referred to in the preceding \n     section become effective upon the construction or \n     establishment of highways, in accordance with the State laws, \n     over public lands, not reserved for public uses. 43 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 2822.2-1 (1972).\n\n  In other words, the grant of a right-of-way was a unilateral offer \nthat vested automatically upon an act of acceptance. A published \nInterior Department decision said essentially the same thing as early \nas 1938:\n\n       This grant [R.S. 2477] becomes effective upon the \n     construction or establishing of highways, in accordance with \n     the State laws, over public lands not reserved for public \n     uses. No application should be filed under this act, as no \n     action on the part of the Federal Government is necessary.'' \n     (56 I.D. 533 (May 28, 1938).)\n\n  The current published Interior regulations state that if \nadministration of any pre-existing right-of-way under regulations \npromulgated pursuant to FLPMA would diminish or reduce any rights \n``conferred by the grant or the statute under which it was issued, * * \n* the provisions of the grant of the then existing statute shall \napply.'' This language was explained in the Department's final \nrulemaking as follows:\n\n       In carrying out the Department's management \n     responsibilities, the authorized officer will be careful to \n     avoid any action that will diminish or reduce the rights \n     conferred under a right-of-way grant issued prior to October \n     21, 1976.\n\n  FLPMA also provides:\n\n       Nothing in this title [43 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1761 et seq.] \n     shall have the effect of terminating any right-of-way or \n     right-of-use heretofore issued, granted or permitted. \n     However, with the consent of the holder thereof, the \n     Secretary concerned may cancel such a right-of-way or right-\n     of-use and in its stead issue a right-of-way pursuant to the \n     provisions of this title. (43 U.S.C. Sec. 1769 (emphasis \n     added).)\n\n  These explicit provisions make it clear that the local and the State \ngovernments that hold R.S. 2477 rights-of-way have always been entitled \nto exercise them in accordance with their duly constituted authority \nand in accordance with the applicable provisions of State law without \ninterference from the Federal Government. No action by Congress would \nallow any interference by Federal agencies with the exercise of these \nrights in accordance with State law. The current Department of Interior \nregulations merely confirm Congress' intent that the agencies honor \nthese vested property rights.\n  Past efforts to define any of the key words in the original R.S. 2477 \nstatute and to determine their original intent have created many \ndifferent and varied opinions. Words such as ``construction'' and \n``highway'' have been the subject of many analyses by lawyers and other \nexperts on public land issues. Even Secretary Babbitt in his policy \nguidance of January 22 provides a definition of a ``highway'' as it \npertains to R.S. 2477 that, in my opinion, is inconsistent with legal \nprecedents. For example, Federal courts have honored the common law \ndefinition of ``highways,'' which basically requires only that the \nroute be open to the public to travel at will. Here are just a few of \nthe statements the courts have made which elucidate this point:\n\n       The act of Congress [43 U.S.C. 932--then R.S. 2477] does \n     not make any distinction as to the methods recognized by law \n     for the establishment of a highway. It is an unequivocal \n     grant of right of way for highways over public lands, without \n     any limitation as to the method for their establishment, and \n     hence a highway may be established across or upon such public \n     lands in any of the ways recognized by the law of the State \n     in which such lands are located. Any other  conclusion would \n     occasion serious public inconvenience. (United States v. \n     9.947.71 Acres of Land, 220 F. Supp. 328 (D. Nev. 1963), \n     quoting Smith v. Mitchell (1899) 21 Wash. 536, 58 P. 667, \n     at 668.)\n       The parties [including the Department of Interior of the \n     United States] are in agreement that the right of way statute \n     [R.S. 2477] is applied by reference to state law to determine \n     when the offer of grant was accepted by the construction of \n     highways.\n\n  In Colorado, and in Utah, the term ``highways'' includes footpaths.\n  Highways under 43 U.S.C. 932 can also be roads formed by the passage \nof wagons, etc., over the natural soil.\n  In Colorado, mere use is sufficient: ``It is not required that `work' \nshall be done on such a road, or that public authorities shall take \naction in the premises. Use is the requisite element, and it may be by \nany who have occasion to travel over public lands, and if the use be by \nonly one, still it suffices.''\n  The Secretary's new policy states that ``a highway is a thoroughfare \n* * * for the passage of vehicles carrying people or goods from place \nto place.'' This policy blatantly ignores the history of legal \ndecisions in this area by insisting that a R.S. 2477 right-of-way must \nprovide for the passage of a vehicle. How did the Secretary arrive at \nthis definition? By what authority can he overlook decades of legal \nopinions and insert his own philosophy or interpretation of the \noriginal statute to create this critical definition? There can be no \nsolid foundation upon which he takes this leap of interpretation, \nexcept his own desire to rewrite these opinions to say or mean \nsomething different. The decisions stand for themselves. This body \ncannot allow the Secretary's new policy guidance to go unchallenged.\n  Let me underscore the importance of this issue by stating several \ncritical facts.\n  First, it is clear from the record that the Department of Interior \nunderstood that FLPMA did not grant authority to the Bureau of Land \nManagement [BLM] to diminish any prior valid existing rights. It is \nalso clear that many counties in western States have been maintaining \nthe transportation infrastructure across Federal lands for many decades \nwithout interference from the Federal land managing agencies, \nparticularly the BLM, according to legal and regulatory precedents.\n\n[[Page S4055]]\n\n  However, current actions by Interior and the Department of Justice \ncontradict these express provisions of FLPMA. For example, the \nSecretary's new policy guidance of last January states that the BLM \nshould not process R.S. 2477 assertions in the absence of a \ndemonstrated, compelling, and immediate need to make such \ndeterminations. Thus, BLM has been precluded from addressing R.S. 2477 \nquestions administratively, to the extent it might otherwise have done \nso.\n  And, Department of Justice officials have been telling county \ngovernments that they cannot maintain their R.S. 2477 rights-of-way \nwithout first obtaining the permission of the BLM. It is a catch-22 of \na serious nature. The BLM is not addressing R.S. 2477 rights-of-way on \nthe lands they manage, while right-of-way holders are being told they \ncannot exercise the rights unless BLM addresses them first. For this \nreason, several western counties have been sued by the United States, \nbased on complaints that assert that the counties have violated the law \nby maintaining roads without first seeking permission from the BLM or \nthe National Park Service. These complaints, as well as other public \nstatements made by Department of Justice officials, assert that \npermission from the land managing agencies is required before a county \ncan take any action to exercise its rights.\n  The BLM or the Justice Department has told more than one county in \nUtah that they should seek FLPMA rights-of-way, more accurately \ndescribed as conditional use permits than true rights-of-way, because \nthere is no R.S. 2477 process in place and because BLM cannot authorize \nactivities on R.S. 2477 rights-of-way without first going through a \nprocess. Counties are threatened with lawsuits if they exercise their \nrights as they have in the past.\n  I recently brought this matter and these current facts to the \nattention of Attorney General Janet Reno in a letter detailing the \nhistory of R.S. 2477. Among several things, I asked her if she was \naware of Secretary Babbitt's policy guidance of January 22 and whether \nher office was consulted as to the legal sufficiency of terms defined \nwithin the policy. I asked her because, in the end, if this or any \nother government policy is challenged in court, the Department of \nJustice will have to defend it, and the lack of consistency on \ndefinitions and other wording contained in that policy could lead to \ninsupportable and unnecessary litigation. Her response to my letter \nindicates that while her office was aware of the Secretary's January \npolicy statement, she does not say conclusively that Justice was \nconsulted. The letter closes by stating that ``the final determination \n(on the policy guidance) * * * rests with the Secretary.'' The answer \nto my query is obvious.\n  This is interesting in light of the fact that the chief of the \nGeneral Litigation Section of the Environment and Natural Resources \nDivision at the Department of Justice wrote a letter to the Department \nof Interior's solicitor on January 29 asking that Secretary Babbitt's \npolicy guidance be modified to reflect any future adjudication of R.S. \n2477 rights-of-way claims. The Secretary later released a memorandum \ndated February 20 making this clarification in the policy statement.\n  My point in raising this matter is this: when it comes to \nestablishing a new policy on such a technical issue as R.S. 2477 \nrights-of-way, where the definition of key words and phrases--like \n``highway'' and ``construction''--is of paramount importance, the \nGovernment's own legal authorities who may have to defend those \ndefinitions should be consulted.\n  To say the least, this situation is intolerable for holders of R.S. \n2477 rights-of-ways. Attempts to rectify this situation in an amicable \nfashion, either through regulation or legislation, have proved futile. \nNow, Secretary Babbitt is skirting both the letter and spirit of recent \ncongressional direction regarding R.S. 2477 rights-of-way through his \npolicy guidance of last January. If he is serious about bringing \nclosure to this matter once and for all and in a way that is in the \nbest interests of the public and local and State governments that hold \nR.S. 2477 rights-of-way, then I encourage him to work with the \nCongress, not against it.\n  Mr. President, some claim that R.S. 2477 rights-of-ways are nothing \nmore than dirt tracks in the wilderness with no meaningful history, \nwhose only value to rural counties arises from the hope of stopping the \ncreation of wilderness areas. Nothing could be further from the truth. \nNo one is suggesting that we turn these rights-of-way into six-lane, \nlighted highways with filling stations, billboards, and fast food \nrestaurants, as Secretary Babbitt alluded to in his recent letter \nthreatening a veto recommendation if this bill is not amended. Yet, \nthese rights-of-ways constitute an important part of the infrastructure \nof the western States.\n  My colleagues can think of it this way: Let's say your front yard \nbelonged to someone else--the Federal Government, for example--and the \ngravel driveway was the only way to get to your house from the street. \nThe Secretary's policy guidance would have the effect of denying you \nthe use of your driveway. You would have to haul your groceries to your \nfront door from the street.\n  A simple illustration, perhaps, but one that shows the importance of \nthese R.S. 2477 rights-of-way to the people in the West.\n  There is no pressing environmental reason to change the R.S. 2477 \nrules other than to make Federal land more pristine than it has been \nsince the pioneers settled the West. In most cases in Utah, this is \nabsolutely impossible, since some of Utah's R.S. 2477 rights-of-way, \nlike Utah State Highway 12 near Bryce Canyon National Park, are paved \nand heavily traveled. What would those opposing the full exercise of \nthese rights-of-way have the State of Utah do--dig up the blacktop, \nremove the pavement, erase the yellow markings, and reclaim this road \nin the form it existed prior to 1866? That is ludicrous. And, we may as \nwell sell off Bryce Canyon because no one will be able to get there. \nThe right-of-way has been developed over time with improvements to it \npursued in the name of protecting public safety and welfare.\n  Mr. President, any disposition of issues related to rights-of-way \nacross public lands is of utmost concern to States like Utah with \npublic lands. These rights-of-way provide the backbone of our \ntransportation infrastructure and have deep historic and traditional \nroots in the overall development of the West. There are regulatory and \nlegal precedents that should be followed and adhered to when these \nrights-of-way are administered. The Secretary's policy guidance of \nJanuary 22 is not consistent with this law, precedent, or custom, which \nis why the language in the supplemental appropriations bill is \nnecessary.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the Bumpers amendment.\n  I thank my colleagues from Alaska and I thank my colleague from Utah \nfor their leadership on this matter, and in particular I would like to \nthank my colleague from Utah for allowing me to go first here because I \nam conducting a hearing over in the Judiciary Committee and I need to \nget back. So I am grateful to him for his courtesy in allowing me to do \nthis. I hope that our colleagues will vote down the Bumpers amendment. \nIt just plain is not fair to the West. What Secretary Babbitt is doing \nis not fair to the West. In fact, it is extreme and it flies in the \nface of many precedents of law that have existed and do currently \nexist.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that privileges \nof the floor be granted to Cordell Roy for today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Chair.\n  There is an old line in politics that applies in campaigning that \nsays when you are explaining, you are losing. And there would be those \nwho say, because of the technicalities of the explanations we have to \ngive about this fairly technical matter, we are probably losing the \nissue.\n  However, if you are explaining, it does not necessarily mean you are \nwrong. I am going to do my best to try to be as simple in my \nexplanation today because we are not wrong on this one. This is not an \nissue where the Senators from the Western States are trying to do \nsomething improper for the rest of the country, something parochial \njust for ourselves. These are fundamental issues and they should be \nclearly explained and understood.\n\n[[Page S4056]]\n\n  I would like to focus on one road and one circumstance that will help \nexplain this matter. I picked this road because it is perhaps the most \ncontroversial R.S. 2477 road in all of Utah. It has a very romantic \nname. Its been called the Burr Trail. I do not know who Burr was, and I \ndo not know what trail he or she made across this land in the first \nplace. I suppose at some point somebody will tell me all of that. \nFrankly, as I read about it in the newspapers and heard people talk \nabout the Burr Trail before I became a Senator, I had visions of a \nfootpath going through a forest. That is what a trail means to me. And \nthen I was elected to the Senate and had to get into the details.\n  This is, Mr. President, a picture of the Burr Trail. As the Presiding \nOfficer can clearly see, this is a road. It is 28 feet wide. It is a \nwell-traveled road. I have been on it. No, I did not need an all-\nterrain vehicle to get on it. I was on it in a street-legal vehicle, \ndriving along it. It is used, whatever Mr. or Mrs. Burr anticipated, as \nthe principal way the residents of Garfield County can get from one end \nof that county to another. It happens to run through the Capitol Reef \nNational Park. It was with the full consent of the Federal Government \nthat the western Burr Trail across BLM lands was improved. The lands in \ndispute have to do with the 8 miles of road that go through the Capitol \nReef National Park.\n  This sign the Presiding Officer cannot see, as far away as he is, \nsays, ``Entering Capitol Reef National Park.'' I would call your \nattention to this sign as a guidepost because I am now going to show \nyou a second picture of the Burr Trail taken somewhat after the first \none, and here again is the identifying sign to show you where we are. \nThere is one difference. If you would remember from the first picture, \nyou will see that this is a blind curve. As you are coming down the \nBurr Trail here, if there is traffic coming the other way, you are not \ngoing to be able to see it. It is a blind curve. There could be an \naccident. Under R.S. 2477, the responsibility of maintaining the Burr \nTrail lies with the county. They own it. It is a right-of-way that they \nhave received according to Federal law. The county went out and cut off \n4 feet of land. As I said, the Burr Trail is 28 feet wide. As it got to \nthis particular point, it narrowed to only 20, so the county decided to \nwiden it to 24--not 28, not widen this curve as wide as the rest of the \nroad but just take 4 feet off so you get a little bit of a view around \nthe blind curve. They did that under their existing rights established \nby the Congress.\n\n  Well, the reaction that occurred in the Interior Department would \nhave had you believe they had gone into Yellowstone National Park and \nbulldozed Old Faithful. Interior officials were sent from Washington, \nDC, to Garfield County, sat down across the table from Garfield County \nofficials and demanded that those officials immediately sign over their \nright to any meaningful management authority over the right-of-way. \nThey also assured them that if county officials did not, they could \nface the full power and force of the Federal Government in Federal \ncourts in the form of an aggressive legal action.\n  This is not the only sin these county officials committed by creating \nan opportunity to see around the corner, by taking 4 feet off of an \narea that was, they understood, legitimately within their right-of-\nway. When they took this action, they did not realize they were setting \noff such an enormous controversy.\n\n  County officials did some other things on this road. They also made \nsome improvements where the washboard effect had been created. They \nmade some improvements where there had been debris that got on the \nroad. They did changes in a normal maintenance circumstance, and for \nthis they are now in Federal court with the full force of the U.S. \nJustice Department accusing them of all kinds of terrible environmental \nsins.\n  I am sorry, Mr. President, I do not see the terrible environmental \nsin, going from the first circumstance of this kind of a curve to this \ncircumstance; of taking a road that is 28 feet wide, narrows going \naround that curve to 20, and saying, no, we will make it go around the \ncurve at 24 feet. I do not know that this merits the kind of wrath that \nhas been brought down by the Interior Department on the officials of \nGarfield County. But that is what we are faced with.\n  That is what we are talking about here, Mr. President. It has little \nor nothing to do with the road. It has little or nothing to do with the \ncounty maintaining this kind of right-of-way. It has to do with is who \nis going to make the decisions. The Federal Government is determined \nthey will make the decisions whether the Congress gives them the right \nto do it or not. They will ride roughshod over the rights of the States \nand the counties whether the Congress gives them the authority or not. \nWhen the Congress specifically refused to give them the authority, this \nSecretary of the Interior said, ``All right, if the Congress won't give \nme the authority, I will usurp it. I will take it on my own and see if \nthe Congress has the willingness to demand that I live up to prior \nagreements.''\n  That is what this amendment is all about, a demand that the \nadministration live up to prior agreements. That is what it is all \nabout, the issue of can the States depend on the acts of Congress in \nterms of maintaining their existing rights.\n  Mr. President, I would like to show you another picture. This one is \nnot as controversial as the first pictures we have just seen. Those who \nsay R.S. 2477 roads are mere trails, R.S. 2477 roads are mere \nfootpaths, here is a picture of an R.S. 2477 road in the State of Utah. \nWhy do I pick this particular one? Not because it is paved; there are \nplenty of R.S. 2477 roads in Utah that are paved. I picked this one \nbecause this is the road that millions of tourists will take when they \ncome to the newly created Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. \nThis is the road those tourists will have to use to come see the 1.7 \nmillion acres that the President spoke about so lyrically on the south \nside of the Grand Canyon last September. It runs for about 70 miles.\n  If we decide that the Secretary is right and the Federal Government \nhas jurisdiction over this road, I can tell you what the counties will \ndecide. You take away their property rights in this road and the \ncounties will say, ``Since you have taken our property rights, you \nmaintain the road. It is not our road anymore, let's allow the Federal \nGovernment maintain it.'' This is the kind of responsibility we are \ngoing to give to the Bureau of Land Management if we accept the motion \nof the senior Senator from Arkansas.\n  Frankly, as a member of the Appropriations Committee, I do not want \nthat responsibility. I do not want to take on additional Federal \nfinancial burdens. When there is a county more than willing and able to \nmaintain the road, I say, why don't we let it do it? We will not let it \ndo it because the Secretary of the Interior says, ``We want \njurisdiction. We want jurisdiction over this road. We cannot trust the \ncounty to maintain the road.''\n  I ask you, Mr. President, does this demonstrate that the county \ncannot be trusted to maintain the road?\n  No, the real issue is that there are a number of roads in rural Utah \nthat the Federal Government officials want closed. That is why they \nwant to take away the property rights of those roads away from the \ncounties, because they wants the roads closed. They want the roads shut \ndown. The impact of shutting down the roads will be that, ultimately, \npeople will move from the county because they cannot conduct commerce \nanymore. Ultimately, they would like to see southern Utah rid of human \nbeings except those who work in motels and in fast-food places, people \nwho have tourist oriented jobs. But they want no other jobs down there \nbecause they do not want any other economic activity in southern Utah \nto continue.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder if my friend from Utah will yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Isn't a good deal of this debate about exactly what a \nhighway is? And hasn't the Secretary, in effect, taken the assumption \nthat he has the authority to change the terminology of what a highway \nis?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I ask my friend from Alaska if he has a definition of \nwhat a highway is, in these circumstances. If he would share it with \nthe Senate, I will be happy to yield the floor to allow him to do that.\n\n[[Page S4057]]\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I might just add, has my friend from Utah concluded \nhis statement?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I probably concluded prior to the time when I quit \ntalking, but I got carried away.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my friend from Utah for yielding. I would like \nto highlight, specifically for the benefit of my friend from Arkansas, \nwho is back on the floor, what this debate is about. It is about what a \nhighway is.\n  Looking at the State of Arkansas, it is quite clear what a highway \nis. A highway is, as indicated on the highway map of the State of \nArkansas, extended networks of access across the State, traditionally \nused for recreation, commerce, and so forth. The question we have here \nbefore us is the definition by the Department of Interior, how they are \ndefining a highway. In 1988, the Department, after months of discussion \nand consultations with the Western States, developed its official \npolicy on the R.S. 2477 right-of-way. That policy worked in conjunction \nwith the States, as they defined historically what a highway was. I \nwill quote this definition, because this is what this debate is boiling \ndown to:\n\n       A definite route on which there is free and open use for \n     the public. It need not necessarily be--\n\n  And this is the key.\n\n       It need not necessarily be open to vehicular traffic, for \n     pedestrian or pack animal or trail may qualify.\n\n  It does not have to be for an automobile; pedestrian, pack animal, \ntrail may qualify. That is where we have been in this debate up until \nnow, and that is why it is appropriate that this be in here, to ensure \nthat we will have that definition as opposed to what the Secretary of \nInterior has arbitrarily proposed in changing it.\n  He proposes to state that, through an action used prior to October \n21, 1976, ``by the public for the passage of vehicles [cars] carrying \npeople or goods from place to place.'' That is the change. That is the \nsignificance. He is doing this arbitrarily. He is saying that no longer \nis pedestrian access or pack trail or wagon trial adequate. It must be \nvehicles.\n  Mr. President, in 1917 they did not have very many vehicles in \nAlaska. We do not have very many today. But the point is, we have \ntrails. We have to have the right, as evidenced by those trails, as we \nlook at the restrictions that Federal withdrawals have placed on our \nState. And here they are, Mr. President. How in the world are we going \nto get across Federal lands? All these colors--the brown, the green, \nthe cream--these are the Federal holdings in the State of Alaska. The \nonly thing that belongs to the State that we have access through are \nthe white areas.\n  The point I want to make is, how in the world are we going to get a \nhighway across from the Canadian border to the Bering Sea without \ncrossing Federal land? We cannot do it. How are we going to get north? \nHow are we going to cross all these Federal areas without this basic \nright that we had when we became a State 38 years ago? We are simply \nnot going to be able to do it, unless we have this law that states \nspecifically that the interpretation of a highway is for pedestrians, \npack animals, to qualify. Because, Mr. President, if you look again at \nAlaska today, this is our highway network. That is where we are. That \nis our highways, 1,300 miles. We have a road north-south to Seward, a \nroad over to the Canadian border. We have nothing to the west--\nabsolutely nothing. This is an area one-fifth the size of the United \nStates.\n\n  My point is, under the law as it is currently stated, you must have \nproof of a traditional route across public land, prior to 1976, to \nqualify. The Secretary proposes to change that. He would say you have \nto have had a road. That eliminates Alaska. It eliminates much of Utah, \nand several other Western States are affected. That is where we are.\n  I am reading from a definition of ``highway.''\n\n       The term ``highway'' is the generic name for all kinds of \n     public ways. Whether they be carriage ways, bridle ways, foot \n     bridges, turnpike roads, railroads, canals, ferries, \n     navigable rivers, they are considered highways.\n\n  But that is going to change under this definition. So, clearly what \nwe are talking about is keeping in place the law that has been for 130 \nyears in the departmental regulations as they have been codified since \n1932, and again in 1994.\n  The fact is, if R.S. 2477 was not in existence prior to October 1976, \nit will not and it cannot be, by definition, created now. So there is \nno threat here to public land. There is no threat to the parks. This is \nall a smokescreen.\n  The reality is, we will simply be assured of having the rights-of-way \nacross public land that we were promised as opposed to it being taken \naway. So I urge my colleagues to recognize the significance of what \nthis inclusion means, why it is appropriate that it be there, why it is \nan emergency right now, and why I encourage all Members to reflect on \nthe significance of this. The motion proposed by the Senator from \nArkansas should be stricken, because it simply does not belong in the \nsense of his offering the amendment to strike this section.\n  So, I see my friend, the senior Senator from Alaska, is seeking the \nfloor. I yield the floor at this time, other than again to remind all \nmy colleagues, what we are trying to do here is keep in place a law \nthat for 130 years has provided us with the protection, the assurance \nthat we would be able to cross public land if, indeed, we had valid \nproof that we had used the routes prior to 1976. So we would have the \nassurance of being able to proceed with the orderly development of our \nState.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have been involved in this issue now \nfor a substantial portion of my life. I was in the Interior Department \nduring the Eisenhower administration, 1955 to 1961. At the end of that \nperiod, I was the Solicitor of the Interior Department. During that \nperiod, we obtained statehood for Alaska. The whole question of what \nour rights would be as a State was debated at length, not only in the \nCongress but in the White House and the old Bureau of the Budget.\n  The Revised Statute 2477 was the basis for really the modernization \nof the West. And when we came to the period of the seventies--and I was \nhere as a Senator--when the proposal was made to repeal R.S. 2477 in \n1974, I had a very long debate with Senator Haskell of Colorado at the \ntime, and we subsequently did not pass the bill in that Congress.\n  In 1976, when the rights-of-way bill was brought up again, we \ndiscussed at length the protections that would assure that the \ncommitment that was being made to the Western States, in general, and \nAlaska, in particular, would be ironclad. So at my insistence, the 1976 \nact contained three specific statements.\n  The first one is in section 701(a):\n\n       Nothing in this Act, or in any amendment made by this Act, \n     shall be construed as terminating any valid lease, permit, \n     patent, right-of-way, or other land use right or \n     authorization existing on the date of approval of this Act.\n\n  Again in section 701(f):\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to repeal any existing \n     law by implication.\n\n  And in section 701(h):\n\n       All actions by the Secretary concerned under this Act shall \n     be subject to valid existing rights.\n\n  Starting in 1993, the Secretary of Interior attempted to ignore all \nof those guarantees and say that as manager of the Federal lands, he \nhas the inherent right to ignore that law and to issue regulations to \nchange this concept, so that the valid existing rights will be \ndetermined by Federal law and not by State laws as they have for 130 \nyears. There has never been, before this administration, any attempt to \ndefine the rights-of-way across Federal land by Federal law. They have \nbeen determined by the general law of each State, and ours are no \nexception in Alaska.\n  But very clearly, we have three times now spoken here in the Congress \nto try and stop this move by the Secretary of the Interior and his \nDepartment to change this tradition. We did it in the National Highway \nSystem Designation Act, we did it in the Interior appropriations bill \nfor 1996, and the Interior appropriations bill for 1997. Now, however, \nwhat we are trying to stop is his announcement of a policy which will \ngovern all Federal lands. It is not regulation, it is a statement of \npolicy now.\n\n[[Page S4058]]\n\nCongress prohibited the use of funds, we prohibited the issuance of \nregulations, but now he says he is going to announce a policy, a new \nedict, and that is that there is a Federal law pertaining to rights-of-\nway and they will define that and it will not be based on State law at \nall.\n  What we are talking about, as my colleague from Alaska has said and \nthe Senators from Utah have said, is the process by which all of the \nWest obtained the rights-of-way that ultimately became the road system \nof the West.\n  In Alaska, because of our situation prior to statehood, the Federal \nGovernment built the highways when we were a territory, and it built \none main road. It was really built for the aid of the war effort. The \nAlaska highway came up through Canada, and then came down through \nAlaska at our eastern border, and came to our major city of Anchorage. \nIt came through Fairbanks and then down into the Anchorage area. That \nwas one main road. Since then, we have built some arterials off that. \nWe had a long time convincing the Congress that we were a State and we \nought to have equal treatment under the National Highway Acts. Now we \nhave that.\n  Now we come to the period where this administration wants to assert, \nby virtue of Federal supremacy, a concept that, on over 100 million of \nacres of land that were reserved by the Congress in 1980--and, \nincidentally, they were specific in terms of recognizing valid existing \nrights at that time, too--now this administration wants to say none of \nthese rights under the Revised Statute 2477 shall be recognized on \nFederal lands in Alaska, period.\n  The Federal Government owns more than 68 percent of Alaska's land. As \nmy colleague has pointed out, the State of Alaska is a checkerboard \nwith Native land, Federal land, and State land and very little private \nland. But the right of access to the private land through the State \nland and the Native land is of necessity such that rights-of-way across \nsome Federal lands are required if we are to have a road system to \nserve the State as a whole ultimately.\n  This is not a simple question for Alaskans. What it really comes down \nto is a question of can we trust the Federal Government? We had a long \ndebate here that went on for 3 years. The record is absolutely clear \nthat the Congress, at that time, agreed that we had these rights and \nthat they had to be protected if Revised Statute 2477 was to be \nrepealed. I have to say, from 1976 to 1993, there was no question about \nit. But now, because of the onslaught of a direct mail advertising \ncampaign by extreme environmental groups who have painted us as being \nthe arch devils of management, they claim that we are trying to \nestablish some new rights across Federal lands. By definition, none of \nthe rights that could vest after 1976--they are all prior to 1976, and \nthey were protected by Congress and they were across lands that were \nnot reserved in 1976.\n\n  I think the real problem here is the people who are doing this are \nunwilling to accept the decisions made by Congress. Every Congress has \nsaid we are not going to interfere with valid existing rights. Again, \nthese rights are vital to a State such as ours. I really cannot deal \nwith it without going back over a whole history of what has been done \nin our State.\n  Let me say, our amendment is simple. It continues the same policy the \nCongress has voted on three times now, and it says this new policy \nconcept of the Department of the Interior--not a regulation, not a \nrule, both of those were prohibited by past actions, not an order that \nwas also prohibited--but this new concept of a policy, they can't do it \nin any way. If they want to do it, they can send up a proposal to \nCongress, let us debate it, and we will see what the law will be for \nthe future, and we will see as a result of what they are doing if there \nis any compensation due to the people whose rights are condemned by \nFederal action. This is a way around the whole concept of trying to \ncompensate people for the absolute extinguishment of rights that were \ncreated and protected by Congress through past actions.\n  Some have suggested that almost a million new miles of roads and \nclaims would be asserted by virtually anybody, anyone. Mr. President, I \ntire at trying to answer false statements like that. As my colleague \nhas said, we have 18,000 miles of roads in an area one-fifth the size \nof the United States now. We can only build those roads with highway \nfunds that are available, and at the cost of roads, it is just not \npossible for us to contemplate a million miles of road. We are not \ncontemplating even doubling what we have now. We are contemplating just \nsome small roads to connect various villages and communities that are \nnear the road system that exists now, and even that will be over a \nperiod of years.\n  This is a process that we believe that the Congress ought to \nrecognize. We create no new rights-of-way across Federal land. We only \nrecognize those that were in existence before 1976, and we preserve \nthose rights once more on the same basis that they have been available \nthroughout this country for 130 years based upon State law. The courts \nhave asserted, past administrations have asserted--I don't know of \nanyone, as I said, in the past who has asserted that there was a \nFederal law that determined how rights-of-way were created across \nFederal land.\n  There is the specific right-of-way concept where people are coming \nand asking permission to cross Federal land to build pipelines or build \ntransmission lines for various uses of Federal land, and that is what \nthe Trans-Alaska Pipeline Right-of-way Act was all about.\n  But we believe that in terms of what we are doing now, I am told--I \ndon't know if Senator Murkowski mentioned this--we asked the Department \nof Natural Resources of Alaska to tell us what rights-of-way might be \ncapable of being asserted. There were 1,900 originally reviewed, and \n700 were found to be on State land. Of the remaining 1,200, about 560 \nappeared to qualify as potential rights-of-way. The State deferred 400 \nof those because they crossed Federal withdrawals. That is to be looked \nat at a later time, and we are now proceeding with very few of them. I \nhave been told that so far, we have used about 10 of these rights-of-\nway in the time that we have been a State, which is now almost 40 \nyears. Mr. President, you don't use them until the highway system gets \nto the point where you can use them to extend it on out. So Congress \nprotected those rights-of-way for the future so that when the highway \nsystem starts to expand, it will be possible to get to those \ncommunities.\n  My last comment to the Senate will be this. My colleague and I labor \nhere for land that is so far away that we are closer to Tokyo than we \nare to Washington, DC. We spend a great deal of our time trying to \nconvince the Congress to keep the commitments that were made to us as \nwe sought and fought for statehood because we wanted to be partners in \nthe Union.\n  Now it seems that people from other States are doing everything they \ncan to turn us back into a federally dominated territory. That is why \nwe are here on the floor. We wanted to be a State to protect our \nrights. That is our No. 1 duty, to see to it that the commitments made \nto our State are kept by the Federal Government. And it is very hard to \ndo right now. It is very hard to do when there are people in the \nadministration who want to just be those who dictate to our State.\n  I cannot emphasize this enough to the Senate, this is not a new \nsubject. We have done in this bill what we did three times before. We \nhave acted to prevent the Secretary of the Interior continuing on this \ncourse of trying to change the law that guarantees the protection of \nvalid existing rights under Revised Statute 2477.\n  Mr. President, I mentioned my own background on this subject. But I \nhave to say, one of the reasons that I am concerned about it is \nbecause, as a young lawyer in the Interior Department, I remember some \nof the fights that existed in the 17 Western States that had public \nlands before we became a State. This same battle took place before, but \nin different ways, where agencies of the Federal Government just tried \nto block the use of lands. But no one ever thought of creating a \nFederal rights system and taking unto themselves the power to determine \nwhat rights existed prior to that time.\n  That is what the Department is trying to do now. They are trying to \nsay, ``Wait a minute. We're the managers of this land. All this land is \nstill under our domination and, therefore, we're\n\n[[Page S4059]]\n\ngoing to tell you how you cross this land.''\n  The Department of the Interior has done something--I used to tell our \npeople in the Interior Department when I was there: ``We do not own \nthis land, you and I. We are the stewards of this land. It's owned by \nthe people of the United States.'' But if you hear these people talk \nnow in the Department of the Interior, it is their land. They own it.\n  I have to tell you, Mr. President, it will be a cool day in Hades \nwhen Alaskans will allow them to do that. I hope that the Senate will \nstand by us in this battle, which is just a continuation of battles we \nhave fought here on many other issues to protect our rights as a State.\n  These rights ultimately will be used by the State of Alaska to build \npublic highways. We do not have a county system. Our population base is \nsmall. We have a borough system, but basically the roads in Alaska are \nbuilt by the State. So in our State the rights are basically protected \nby the State and the State nominates those areas where it wants to \nproceed to utilize the rights-of-way that were created prior to 1976.\n  I do think, Mr. President, that if there is anything that I would \nlike to leave with the Senate, it is that at some time or other every \nSenator is going to have to come out here and say, ``In the days gone \nby, a compromise was reached regarding an issue in my State, and the \ndecision was made and put into law.''\n  All I want you to do is recognize an act of a prior Congress in \ncommitting the United States to a course of action that must be \nfollowed now if States rights are to mean anything. This is a basic \nStates rights issue to me, to have the ability to provide the expansion \nof the transportation system to meet the growing needs of people in a \nfrontier area. If the Senator's amendment is adopted, the Secretary of \nthe Interior will be free to issue an edict that future rights in \nAlaska will be determined by the Secretary of the Interior.\n  What does that do? It returns us back to 1958, to the territorial \ndays. We would not be a State. No State is dominated by a Cabinet \nofficer. We were as a territory. We had an Office of Territories in the \nDepartment of the Interior when I was at the Department of the \nInterior. And Alaska was one of the desks in the Office of Territories. \nThat person carried all of the decisions of the Secretary of the \nInterior with regard to Alaska. As a matter of fact, Alaska used to \ncall him the ``Great White Father.'' Well, there is not a Great White \nFather for Alaska now. There are 100 Senators here and 435 people over \nthere who have something to do with making decisions regarding what \nhappens to the rights of the people of the State of Alaska.\n  I urge the Senate to stand by us and maintain the course, that we \nwill live by the law and not by edicts of changing personnel in \nchanging administrations as the years go by.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss Senator Bumpers' \namendment to strike section 310 of the supplemental appropriations bill \nrelated to rights-of-way across public lands.\n  I support Senator Bumpers' amendment because it strikes language in \nthe supplemental appropriations bill which is not only highly \ncontroversial and bad for public lands, but it also has nothing to do \nwith emergency funding--the purpose of this supplemental appropriations \nbill.\n  Rights-of-way is a principle of property use that allows for \ncontinued use of a pathway across public land when it can be proven \nthat the path existed before the land was reserved for Federal \ndesignation--so a road that existed prior to the designation of the \nYosemite National Park would be a valid right-of-way.\n  In our Nation, any individual or local government can claim a right-\nof-way. The validity of this claim must then be determined.\n  In 1988, then Secretary of the Interior Hodel developed policy \nguidelines for dealing with right-of-way claims over public land.\n  The Hodel policy effectively deferred authority over rights-of-way \ndetermination to States and provided very broad guidelines to assist \nStates in making these determinations. The guidelines allowed for a \nright-of-way to be granted if merely a large rock or vegetation was \nremoved from an area. Once a right-of-way authority is granted, a small \ndirt footpath through Yosemite National Park could be converted to a \nsix-lane paved highway.\n  The Hodel policy makes it much easier for right-of-way claims to be \nasserted through many of our most precious environmental areas--\nincluding designated national parks, wildlife refuges, and wilderness \nareas.\n  In January 1997, Secretary Babbitt revoked the Hodel policy, and \ninstituted revised policy guidelines in an effort to put the Federal \nGovernment back in charge of protecting our remaining Federal lands.\n  The Babbitt policy establishes a Federal process whereby right-of-way \nclaims are evaluated. This policy would not allow a six-lane highway to \ntear up our precious national parks. It would ensure the rights-of-way \nbe granted only for major roads that require such authority. And any \nalteration of the land would be susceptible to all Federal \nenvironmental regulations.\n  Secretary Babbitt is unable to follow normal procedure for \nregulations--proposing rules in the Federal Register, receiving public \ncomment, and promulgating final rules--because of provisions included \nin the past two Interior appropriations bill which prohibit such \nactions. In fiscal year 1996, the Secretary was entirely prohibited \nfrom promulgating rules concerning rights-of-way; and for fiscal year \n1997, the Secretary is only able to propose such rules if expressly \nauthorized by an act of Congress.\n\n  If we are not allowed to move forward with Secretary of Interior \nBabbitt's policy, States will have the authority to determine the \nvalidity of existing rights-of-way claims. We therefore create the \npotential for destruction of valuable Federal lands--lands that belong \nto all the people of our Nation.\n  Vast areas may be prohibited from wilderness designation because of \nright-of-way claims that scar the land. In my State of California, the \ncurrent number of claims is relatively low. However the potential for \nclaims is thought to be quite high. The Bureau of Land Management \nestimates that the 12 claims currently pending cover hundreds of miles \nof roads through California's unique wilderness areas.\n  Remaining land in California's Mojave Desert, Death Valley, and \nJoshua Tree poses a serious potential problem should there be a right-\nof-way claim.\n  With the California Desert Protection Act, Congress was finally able \nto protect these unique lands. The language of the bill now threatens \nthe very protection we worked so hard to achieve.\n  There are few remaining natural lands which have been held in trust \nby the Federal Government for all people to enjoy. These precious \nnatural resources must be held to a high uniform standard which protect \nonly valid rights-of-way claims while promoting environmentally \nresponsible management of our Federal lands. These are Federal lands, \nand as such should be governed by Federal policy and procedure.\n  In a letter to Chairman Stevens and Senator Byrd, Director of the \nOffice of Management and Budget Frank Raines and Secretary of Interior \nBruce Babbitt have both stated that they will recommend the President \nveto this legislation should this language be included. This is not the \ntime to risk veto of legislation which will provide necessary aid and \ndisaster relief to those who desperately need it.\n  We saw the disastrous results that occurred from the salvage logging \nrider. This amendment is just that--an unnecessary, antienvironmental \nrider which could devastate our remaining public lands.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Senator Bumpers' amendment. We must \nnot prevent the administration from establishing necessary procedures \nfor dealing with remaining right-of-way claims.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of Senator \nBumpers' motion to strike section 310 from the Supplemental \nAppropriations Act. This section should be removed from the \nSupplemental Appropriations Act for two reasons. First, it could harm \nour Nation's wilderness areas, national parks, and wildlife refuges. \nSecond, it is wrong as a matter of principle to tie controversial \nissues to\n\n[[Page S4060]]\n\nflood disaster relief. We simply should not play politics when people's \nlives are in the balance.\n  In 1976, Congress enacted the Federal Land Management Policy Act and \nthus repealed an 1866 statute that allowed practically unrestricted \nroad construction across our public lands. Congress agreed, however, to \nrecognize the legitimacy of highways constructed as of 1976.\n  In essence, the appropriations rider reinstates a 1988 policy that \nbroadly defined highways to include foot paths, pack trails, and even \ndog-sled routes. If these paths are recognized as highways constructed \nprior to 1976, then they can be upgraded and enlarged to full roads, \neven if they run through existing wilderness areas, national parks, or \nwildlife refuges. These areas are national treasures. They are visited \nby millions of Americans every year. We should not let them be roaded \nwithout careful thought and deliberation.\n  This rider hits close to home for me. This provision could allow \nroads to be built through spectacular wilderness in Montana. Often, we \nhave to speculate about what the effect of a piece of legislation will \nbe. In this case, speculation is not necessary.\n  An R.S. 2477 claim has been filed to build a road through the middle \nof one of Montana's most popular wilderness areas. Fortunately, that \nclaim was recently rejected by the Department of the Interior. If this \nrider becomes law, this and other claims could be granted with \ndevastating effect to our Nation's wilderness areas.\n  Equally disturbing, this section could prevent Montana roadless areas \nfrom being designated as wilderness in the future. I have carried bills \nin the Senate to designate Montana's spectacular Rocky Mountain Front \nas wilderness. This is an area of soaring mountain peaks, crystal clear \nstreams, and untrammeled meadows. Bills to designate this area as \nwilderness have received bipartisan support and have passed the Senate.\n  If section 310 becomes law, the Rocky Mountain Front and other \nroadless lands in those bills could be denigrated. If section 310 \nbecomes law, the Senate may lose its right to decide whether to \ndesignate those lands as wilderness.\n  And section 310 applies to more than wilderness lands. Section 310 \nwould even affect our national parks and wildlife refuges.\n  But this vote is about more than the roads that could be built across \nour Nation's wildlands.\n  This vote is also about people who have suffered through an unusually \nharsh winter in Montana and are seeking disaster relief. This vote is \nabout people in North Dakota who have suffered devastating floods.\n  Let me read what the paper in my State's capitol wrote yesterday \nabout Section 310. In an editorial entitled ``An Ugly Kind of \nPolitics,'' the Helena Independent Record writes:\n\n       This sort of thing might be business as usual in \n     Washington, but we think the specter of Clinton being forced \n     to veto a flood-relief measure because of tacked-on \n     skulduggery is way out of line. We suspect it wouldn't sit \n     too well either with flood victims in the Dakotas--and, \n     perhaps, potential flood victims in Montana as well. Politics \n     is seldom pretty, but this is downright ugly.\n\n  Mr. President, I agree with this assessment, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the complete text of this editorial be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Helena Independent Record]\n\n                        An ugly kind of politics\n\n       It might not be anything new to the halls of the Congress, \n     but that doesn't make recent stealth legislation by Alaska's \n     senior senator any easier to take.\n       Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, is chairman of the \n     Appropriations Committee, which is writing an emergency bill \n     authorizing $5.5 billion in relief for flood victims.\n       This is vital, must-pass legislation that everybody agrees \n     needs quick approval. So Stevens tacked onto the bill a pet \n     piece of new legislation that would make it far easier to \n     build roads through federal parks, refuges and wilderness \n     areas.\n       The measure, based on a Civil-War era law, would give the \n     government less control over right-of-way claims.\n       Contending the legislation would make the federal \n     government effectively powerless to prevent the conversion of \n     foot paths, sled-dog trails, jeep tracks, ice roads and other \n     primitive transportation routes into paved highways, Interior \n     Secretary Bruce Babbit urged President Clinton to veto the \n     measure if Stevens' provision remains in the bill when it \n     reaches his desk.\n       This isn't the only deceptive legislation going on. The \n     Alaska Wilderness League is complaining that Stevens and \n     other representatives from that state are trying to rig the \n     federal budget process to allow oil drilling in the Arctic \n     National Wildlife Refuge.\n       The league says lawmakers may have to vote against a \n     balanced budget deal to save the wilderness area.\n       According to oil-drilling foes, Alaskan politicians are \n     working to have colleagues include estimated oil drilling \n     revenues of $1.3 billion into budget allocations without \n     mentioning that the revenues will have to come from opening \n     the wildlife refuge to development.\n       This sort of thing might be business as usual in \n     Washington, but we think the specter of Clinton being forced \n     to veto a flood-relief measure because of tacked-on \n     skulduggery is way out of line. We suspect it wouldn't sit \n     too well either with flood victims in the Dakotas--and, \n     perhaps, potential flood victims in Montana was well. \n     Politics is seldom pretty, but this is downright ugly.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the American people are losing faith in \nour political system. And they are losing faith because of the way that \npolitics is played. Because of this type of rider.\n  How will the disaster victims in the Dakotas feel if their aid is \ndelayed because some want to play a game of poker where the stakes are \nincredibly high? Where the stakes are the blankets that flood victims \nneed to stay warm or where the stakes are pumps that are needed so that \npeople can drink clean water?\n  And what of the people in other states?\n  Oregon stands to receive almost $140 million from the Supplemental \nAppropriations bill.\n  Louisiana, $116 million.\n  For other states such as Maine, Vermont, and Virginia, the amount of \nthe funds is somewhat smaller, but the need is no doubt just as great.\n  People in all fifty states receive funds from this bill. People in \nall fifty states will be affected if we allow politics to delay this \nbill.\n  This money will help Americans who have lost their homes, their \nbusinesses, and all of their earthly possessions. To block this funding \nor to delay it through the use of these types of riders is just plain \nwrong.\n  To force the American people to accept new roads through their \nnational parks or wilderness areas, just to get their disaster relief \nis equally wrong.\n  Mr. President, the Supplemental Appropriations bill is the wrong \nplace to play politics. I ask my Senate colleagues to vote to strike \nthese riders as a matter of policy and as a matter of principle.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, as I have already reviewed in some \ndetail, section 2477 of the Revised Statutes, R.S. 2477, granted \nrights-of-way for the construction of public highways across unreserved \nFederal lands.\n  Congress passed this law in 1866 and the provision was later \nrecodified at section 932 of title 43 of the United States Code.\n  By permitting travel across Federal lands, R.S. 2477 facilitated the \nsettlement of the West. The rights-of-way granted pursuant to R.S. 2477 \nremain land access routes for rural residents.\n  R.S. 2477 was repealed in 1976 by section 706 of the Federal Land \nPolicy and Management Act [FLPMA]. Again, I point out to my colleagues, \nsection 701(a) of FLPMA expressly states that ``Nothing in this Act * * \n* shall be construed as terminating any valid lease, permit, patent, \nright-of-way, or other land use right or authorization existing on the \ndate of approval of this Act.''\n  Further, section 701(f) says that nothing in FLPMA ``shall be deemed \nto repeal any existing law by implication.'' And section 701(h) \nspecifically states that ``All actions by the Secretary concerned under \nthis Act shall be subject to valid existing rights.''\n  Three times in the same act Congress made it clear that nothing in \nFLPMA gave the Secretary of the Interior the power to terminate valid \nexisting rights. We meant it then and we mean it now. The Secretary is \nignoring the law and all existing precedents with his proposed policy \nthat effectively terminates valid existing rights under R.S. 2477, \nwhich for over 120 years have been determined under State law.\n  Regulations in place in 1976 provided that the validity of the right-\nof-way should be determined by State law. Likewise, Federal courts have \nfound State property laws control assertions of an R.S. 2477 right-of-\nway.\n  In Alaska, which we still call the Last Frontier, R.S. 2477 rights of \nway are still being used by miners, trappers, and others traveling \nacross specific tracts of unreserved public land.\n\n[[Page S4061]]\n\n  The Interior Department in the 1980's saw the need for the Federal \nGovernment to recognize these trails for what they were--public access \nroutes. Interior adopted a policy in 1988 which for the most part kept \nAlaskans out of court.\n  Elsewhere, Federal courts were being asked to quiet title on lands \nwith an R.S. 2477 right of way, and these courts looked to State law to \ndecide if there had been construction of a highway.\n  In August 1994, Interior published new proposed regulations which \nwould have established Federal definitions for key terms in R.S. 2477. \nAccording to Interior, where there was a conflict between the Federal \ndefinitions and State law, under the proposed regulations the Federal \nrules would prevail.\n  This approach would have redefined existing property rights. It would \nalso have the incongruous result of having some R.S. 2477 rights of way \nquiet title actions adjudicated under State law and others under \nFederal law.\n  Soon after Interior proposed these new rules, resolutions were \nintroduced in the House and Senate urging the Secretary to withdraw \nthem. The comment period was subsequently extended through August 1995.\n  In late 1995, Congress placed a 1-year moratorium on any rulemaking \nregarding R.S. 2477 rights of way. The fiscal year 1996 Interior \nappropriations law, enacted in 1996, also included a similar \nmoratorium.\n  Congress acted a second time in 1996. Section 108 of the General \nProvisions of the fiscal year 1997 Interior appropriations law \npermanently requires congressional authorization of any rules and \nregulations developed by agencies to address the recognition, validity, \nand management of R.S. 2477 rights of way.\n  This measure, agreed to by Congress last fall, was not vetoed, nor \nwas there ever a threat of veto that I was made aware of.\n  However, in January 1997, the Secretary sought to evade this law by \nissuing ``policy guidance'' which provides a process for recognizing \nR.S. 2477 claims only ``where there is a demonstrated, compelling, and \nimmediate need.'' This process is similar to that in the disputed \nregulations which Congress has prohibited by law since 1995. Issuance \nof this policy circumvents the legal requirement to have congressional \napproval of agency rulemaking concerning R.S. 2477 rights-of-way.\n  Section 310 of the supplemental appropriations bill, S. 672, \nprohibits the use of funds appropriated for fiscal year 1997 and \nthereafter ``to promulgate or implement any rule, regulation, policy, \nstatement or directive'' issued after October 1, 1993, regarding the \nrights-of-way Congress granted by R.S. 2477. The October 1, 1993, date \nmakes it clear that Interior cannot do by policy what it by law cannot \ndo by regulation. Under section 310, Interior can continue to implement \nFederal policy with respect to R.S. 2477, but only those policies and \nregulations previously agreed to prior to the attempted change that \nCongress has repeatedly rejected.\n  Section 310 is needed to enforce the requirement that Congress first \nauthorize any rules regarding R.S. 2477 rights-of-way. Allowing the \nJanuary 1997 policy to remain in place vitiates the Administrative \nProcedures Act and the express directives of the Congress, which were \napproved by the President.\n  Section 310 will not, as some suggest, open up Alaska's wilderness \nareas and parks to almost a million new miles of roads upon the \nassertion of claims by ``virtually anyone.''\n  First, as I have said, section 310 only tightens the standing mandate \nthat agencies obtain specific authorization from Congress, which \nincludes our elected representatives of public lands States, before \nissuing rules that would effectively deny valid, existing property \nrights under R.S. 2477 in those States.\n  In short, this provision creates no new rights-of-way across Federal \nland which were not in existence before 1976. It merely preserves \nrights-of-way which were established at least 20 years ago, but still \nhave not been recognized by the Interior Department.\n\n  R.S. 2477 rights of way are not exempted from environmental, health \nand safety, and other laws to protect the public.\n  Second, with respect to all existing rights of way, I am assured by \nthe Governor of Alaska that our State will not be paved over. The \nAlaska Department of Natural Resources completed a study recently to \nidentify the list of rights of ways my State might assert as public \nhighways under R.S. 2477.\n  Some 1,900 were initially reviewed, but 700 were found to be on State \nland and not subject to this Federal law.\n  Of the remaining 1,200, only 558 appear to qualify as R.S. 2477 \nrights of way.\n  So far the State of Alaska has filed only one quiet title action.\n  The State of Alaska also advises me that it will not file rights of \nway across section lines, unless of course there is a preexisting trail \nthat otherwise constitutes an R.S. 2477 right of way.\n  Asserting rights of way across section lines alone would be a \nfruitless exercise. Mere geography tells us that we don't need roads \nacross mountain tops.\n  Cost is another reason. I'm advised that it costs $6 million to build \n1 mile of road in my State.\n  I proposed section 310's funding restrictions in good faith, with the \nconfidence of having stood on this floor over 20 years ago debating the \nlegislation that ultimately became FLPMA.\n  On July 8, 1974, the Senate debated S. 424, the bill that the Senate \npassed in the 93d Congress and was reintroduced in the 94th Congress as \nS. 507. S. 507 was the bill that ultimately became FLPMA.\n  In July 1974, I was assured by Senator Haskell, chairman of the \nrelevant subcommittee within Interior and Insular Affairs, that our \nyoung State would have the same chance as other Western States to \ndevelop a road system based on the pattern of use its settlers \nestablished and the laws the State enacted.\n  Senator Haskell told this Chamber it was the intent of Congress that \nall existing R.S. 2477 rights-of-way would be determined according to \nthe law of the State the right-of-way was in. In fact Senator Haskell \ncited a specific North Dakota case, Koleon versus Pilot Mound Township, \nas the basis for the committee's understanding of the law. That case \nsaid an R.S. 2477 right-of-way is established ``if there is use \nsufficient to establish a highway under [the] laws of the state.'' I \nrefer my colleagues to the Congressional Record of July 8, 1974, page \nS22284.\n  Today, I am proposing that we uphold the intent of the Congress of 20 \nyears ago and the intent of the 104th Congress as well.\n  Last fall Congress agreed to a provision in the fiscal year 1997 \nappropriations law requiring agencies to seek congressional \nauthorization of R.S. 2477 rulemaking. Section 310 of the supplemental \nasks nothing new, it merely prevents Interior from doing by agency \npolicy what Congress prohibited it from doing by formal rulemaking.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment so that Interior \nunderstands it cannot circumvent the will of Congress through sleight \nof hand.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield the floor?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I was going to go to this other desk and see if I could \nget the Senator from Arkansas into a colloquy regarding the timing of \nthe votes that we might have.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I am very amenable, I say to the Senator. I would \nsuggest a 20-minute time limit on the remainder of this amendment \nequally divided.\n  Mr. STEVENS. May I ask that the cloakrooms check that out and get us \na time that is agreeable. The timeframe is agreeable to me, but I think \nsome Members may be out of the building now, and we want to get the \ntime set.\n  But why doesn't the Senator take the floor now?\n  I will yield the floor.\n  As soon as we can get worked out between the leadership on the two \nsides the timeframe that can be agreed to as to the vote on this \namendment and on the D'Amato amendment----\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I understand that our side needs to check. We have \npeople coming and going. I assume that is what the Senator has concern \nabout.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is correct.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I believe there may be a second degree pending.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. There will not be a second degree.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is my understanding that the Parliamentarian will \nrule that the other two amendments are not properly drawn under the \nprocess of cloture for those to be considered.\n\n[[Page S4062]]\n\n  I will state, though, that the suggestion made by Senator McCain was \na good one. When we get to conference, if we do with this provision, I \nintend to find some way to accommodate his suggestion that we ask the \nSecretary to come forward with a proposal to be debated that might set \nthe policy for future utilization of these rights-of-way throughout the \nWest. We will pursue that in conference.\n  But there will be no other amendment, my friend.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I will not belabor the points that have \nbeen made time and again here.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I had a Senator ask me earlier if I felt \nthat I was right about this amendment. Let me answer that question for \nany Senator who would ask the same question. I have never felt more \ncomfortable with a position in my life than I do on this. It has \nnothing to do with Alaska or Utah or Idaho. What it has to do with is \nsaying this language of the senior Senator from Alaska, No. 1, has no \nbusiness in this bill; No. 2, if it did, it is a terrible amendment; \nNo. 3, men and women of good will could sit down and work out a \nsensible policy for the Department of the Interior and require them to \nreport back to us with regulations or something else.\n  But under the existing law, what the amendment of the Senator from \nAlaska does is to return the determination of whether these thousands \nand hundreds of thousands of miles of claimed rights-of-way constitute \na highway within the definition of the Hodel policy. It is a question \nof whether or not we are going to allow rights-of-way simply because \nthey were claimed to be there before 1976 when we repealed R.S. 2477, \nwhether we are going to allow the use of those rights-of-way to cross \nwilderness areas, national parks, monuments, all kinds of protected \nFederal areas.\n  I submit to you that the people of this country, if they knew the \nsubstance of this debate, that we were actually considering the Stevens \namendment to this bill, if they knew what the implications of that \nwere, they would be up in arms. I cannot believe--not to denigrate my \ngood friends from these Western States who have a deep and abiding \ninterest, an understandable and deep and abiding interest, in this \nissue--I cannot believe that more than 3 percent of the people of this \ncountry would condone granting applications for highways across these \nareas because there was some kind of a footpath or a trail or something \nelse, even vegetation that had been tromped down.\n\n  Under the Hodel policy in 1988, Donald Hodel had a policy that said: \nIf you have cut high vegetation, you had a lot of weeds and you cut \nthem down, that constitutes a highway.\n  Have you ever heard anything as ridiculous as that in your life?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Would the Senator from Arkansas yield for a question?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Yes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my friend.\n  I wonder if the Senator from Arkansas feels it is appropriate that \nthe Secretary of the Interior arbitrarily has gone ahead and changed \nthe definition of what a highway was. Is it right for the Secretary to \ntake a previous policy that was worked out in conjunction with the \nStates where there was a definitive highway definition in the \nhistorical terms--and I quote--``as a definite route or right-of-way \nthat is freely open for all use, it need not necessarily be open to \nvehicular traffic, or a pedestrian or pack animal trail may qualify''--\nand as a consequence, isn't it true that this was the policy of the \nDepartment of the Interior until earlier this year when Secretary \nBabbitt, behind closed doors--not a public policy; behind closed doors, \nwithout consultation--unilaterally changed this definition? And isn't \nit true that the new definition now reads, ``a thoroughfare used prior \nto October 21, 1976, by the public for the passage of vehicles carrying \npeople or goods from place to place''? He changed the definition.\n\n  Is that, I ask my friend from Arkansas, appropriate and fair and part \nof a public process, or, indeed, is that not a simple dictate by the \nSecretary who arbitrarily changes the interpretation of what was \nFederal law? Is that right, I ask my friend from Arkansas, and correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Let me answer the question this way, Senator. I did not \nhear a single soul complain when Donald Hodel established his policy in \n1988. It is only the Babbitt policy of 1997 that seems to be \nobjectionable.\n  There is no question, if you want to raise the question about the \nauthority of the Secretary to issue a policy, if Secretary Hodel has \nthe right to issue a policy, why does his successor, Bruce Babbitt, in \n1997, not have the right to reverse that policy?\n  Let me go ahead and say that the Senator quoted the Hodel policy \ncorrectly, but he did not go quite far enough. Here is what Donald \nHodel's policy said about the requirements needed to prove what \nconstitutes construction of a highway: ``Construction is a physical act \nof readying the highway for use by the public according to the \navailable or intended mode of transportation, foot, horse, vehicle, et \ncetera.'' Horse--that is right--vehicle, foot, those all constitute \nhighways.\n  His policy goes on to say, here are some examples of what constitutes \nconstruction of a highway: ``removing high vegetation.'' Go out and cut \nthe weeds, it becomes a highway. ``Move a few large rocks out of the \nway,'' it becomes a highway, or ``filling in low spots''--all of those \nmay be sufficient to show construction for a particular use.\n  Now, Senator, let me ask you a question, does that make any sense to \nyou?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I will respond relative to the issue that is before \nthe Senate here, and that is the manner in which the Secretaries--Hodel \non one occasion and, today, Secretary of the Interior Babbitt--have \nacted.\n  First of all, as I indicated, Secretary Babbitt, behind closed doors, \nwithout consultation with Western States, unilaterally changed the \ndefinition. Don Hodel did not. Don Hodel worked out a policy in \nconjunction with the States defining a highway and its history, and it \nwas done in consultation with the States.\n  My friend from Arkansas should recognize that is a significant \ndifference. This Secretary is moving on his own volition to interpret \nas he sees fit. The previous Secretary of the Interior brought in the \nWestern States affected and they worked out a definition and a process. \nNow the definition has changed to any vehicles, and the appropriateness \nof that is what I question the Senator from Arkansas with regard to the \nmotivation.\n  It is here that one Secretary developed a public process.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I reclaim the floor.\n  We ought to pin a Medal of Freedom on Bruce Babbitt.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Where?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. He revoked a policy that said any time you mow high \nweeds, apply to us and we will give you a right-of-way to build a four-\nlane highway over that footpath. Move a few rocks out of the way, we \nwill consider that a highway and allow you to build on it. Fill in a \nfew low spots, we will make it a highway and you build it. Even if it \nis across a national park or across a wilderness area or across a \nnational monument, a historic area that we have set aside. Can you \nthink of anything more insane than giving States the right to build \nhighways across Federal lands no matter where they are, simply because \nsomebody mowed some high weeds or because somebody moved a few rocks?\n  While I am at it, Senator, before I get into it with you, let me also \npoint out, here is the Babbitt policy. This is the policy that reversed \nthe 1988 Hodel policy. I want you to listen to this. I have a letter \nfrom Bruce Babbitt in which he says he will urge the President to veto \nthis bill if the Stevens amendment is not taken out of it. I ask \nunanimous consent to have that printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S4063]]\n\n\n\n\n                                The Secretary of the Interior,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 30, 1997.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stevens: I am writing to express strong \n     opposition to the provision concerning Revised Statute 2477 \n     that I am informed you intend to include in the pending \n     Emergency Supplemental and to a proposed amendment by Senator \n     Craig concerning application of the Endangered Species Act to \n     the operation, maintenance and repair of flood control \n     structures.\n       In light of my strong concerns, if either of these \n     proposals or similar extraneous and controversial endangered \n     species amendments are included in the emergency Supplemental \n     when it is presented to the President for his signature, I \n     would be compelled to recommend that he veto the legislation.\n       R.S. 2477. Two decades after the repeal of R.S. 2477, the \n     profusion of unresolved pre-1976 claims presents a planning \n     and management problem for federal land managers and other \n     landowners, and uncertainty for potential right-of-way \n     holders and users of public land. My efforts over the past \n     several years have been directed to establishing a clear, \n     certain, and fair process to bring these claims to \n     conclusion.\n       I am informed that your provision would prohibit the \n     expenditure of funds in 1997 and thereafter to ``promulgate \n     or implement any rule, regulation, policy, statement or \n     directive issued after October 1, 1993 regarding the \n     recognition, validity, or management of any right of way \n     established pursuant to R.S. 2477.'' I am also informed that \n     proposed report language states that it is the intention of \n     the provision to ``restore the prior practice of deferring to \n     the law of the State in which a right of way is located for \n     purposes of determining the recognition, validity, and \n     management of such right of way.''\n       The public will be poorly served by Congressional action \n     that has the effect of rescinding the Department's current \n     orderly manner of proceeding to deal with right-of-way claims \n     and, at the same time, prevents the Department from \n     issuing final rules governing claims under R.S. 2477. The \n     proposed language does not clarify the process for \n     handling right-of-way claims under R.S. 2477, but would \n     add to the uncertainty and confusion of that process.\n       If the proposed provision requires the Department and the \n     courts to defer to state law, as the proposed report says it \n     does, the consequences could be devastating. Such a \n     requirement could effectively render the Federal government \n     powerless to prevent the conversion of footpaths, dog sled \n     trails, jeep tracks, ice roads, and other primitive \n     transportation routes into paved highways. The proposed \n     amendment could even result in a decision validating a right-\n     of-way that runs through the secure area of a military \n     installation. Under your proposal, the military could be \n     prevented from regulating traffic on these alleged rights-of-\n     way.\n       That result would be fundamentally inconsistent with modern \n     statutes that provide access to and across Federal lands, and \n     would fatally undermine the principles these laws embody, \n     such as public land retention, comprehensive land planning, \n     public involvement in land use decisions, compliance with \n     environmental laws, and mitigation of negative environmental \n     impacts.\n       The practical implications of the blanket adoption of state \n     law can be seen, for instance, in Alaska, where state law \n     first adopted in 1923 and later upheld in the state Supreme \n     Court provides for a claim of highway easement either 66 or \n     100 feet wide, across each section line in the entire state. \n     These sections cross the state on a grid one mile apart, both \n     horizontally and vertically. Thus state law purports to \n     create over 984,000 miles--almost one million miles--of \n     ``highways'' in the State of Alaska, roughly 300,000 miles of \n     which cross National Wildlife Refuges, 160,000 miles of which \n     cross National Parks, and 137,500 miles of which cross \n     conveyed lands of Native Alaskans.\n       In some states, state law may not differentiate between \n     Federal and private lands for purposes of right-of-way \n     claims. Deferring to state law could result in R.S. 2477 \n     rights-of-way being granted over private property that has \n     long since passed out of Federal ownership.\n       Endangered Species Act. Senator Craig's proposed amendment \n     would provide a broad exemption from the provisions of \n     sections 7 and 9 of the Endangered Species Act for operation, \n     maintenance, repair and reconstruction of any Federal or non-\n     Federal flood control project, facility or structure.\n       The Department agrees with the need to minimize flood \n     damages and to protect residents in flood prone areas. In \n     January 1997, the Fish and Wildlife Service implemented the \n     emergency provisions of the Endangered Species Act for the \n     California counties that were declared Federal disaster areas \n     to facilitate rapid and effective response to damaged flood \n     management systems that minimize the risks to life and \n     property. On February 19, 1997, the Director of the Service \n     issued a policy statement further clarifying and articulating \n     our emergency policy under the ESA, which allows disaster \n     response measures to be implemented immediately without \n     prior consultation with the Service under section 7 of the \n     ESA.\n       The proposed amendment goes far beyond the FWS policy and \n     the current provision of the ESA. It would waive compliance \n     with the Act in a broad range of non-emergency situations. \n     Routine operation and maintenance would be exempt if their \n     purpose was compliance with any current Federal, state or \n     local public health or safety requirement, even if there is \n     no emergency in effect or reasonably anticipated.\n       Under the amendment, for example, virtually all Federal and \n     non-Federal projects in the Columbia River basin could be \n     exempt from ESA requirements. If these projects were no \n     longer required to protect endangered fish stocks, such as \n     Pacific salmon, other public agencies and the private sector \n     would have to significantly increase their conservation \n     efforts to compensate for the expected loss of important \n     fishery resources that would occur. This could have severe, \n     long-term economic impacts for the logging, mining, \n     irrigation, navigation, water supply, recreation, and \n     commercial fishing industries in the region.\n       The Department strongly supports the proper operation and \n     maintenance of flood control facilities to avoid threats to \n     human life and property. We also strongly support the \n     protection and conservation of important natural resources. \n     The proposed amendment assumes that these two goals are \n     inconsistent and mutually exclusive. I believe they are not. \n     As the February 19 policy statement demonstrates, it is \n     possible to reconcile both goals, protecting human life and \n     property without abandoning the Nation's commitment to \n     protection of our natural heritage.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Bruce Babbitt.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Now, Mr. President, I hate to read to my distinguished \ncolleague, but it will be helpful to clarify the record about this \n``terrible'' Babbitt policy. He did not think it was a good idea to \nallow the States to come in here and claim a right-of-way simply \nbecause somebody moved a few rocks out of the way no matter where it \nwas located.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I want to talk to you about that, in particular, if the \nSenator will yield.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I yield.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is initiation of a highway. You move a few rocks, \nyou cut down the right-of-way, you eliminate--it does not say \n``weed''--the brush, and you start to build a highway. The question \nbefore Hodel at the time was, what is the initiation of highway, not \nwhat is a right-of-way?\n  I say to my friend that highways today came from wagon trails. In my \nState, some of our highways came from dog sled trails, from the trails \nthat were cut by people who did use horses in those days, or by people \nwho use snowshoes when they were delivering mail on their backs with \npacks. Some of them were developed in the 1920's, 1930's, 1940's, \n1950's, 1960's, until 1976. They are today, but we have not had the \nmoney or capability to extend the highways because there are other \nproblems of getting to those areas before we turn them into highways. \nThey are not different from the roads that lead to Arkansas or, as I \nremember my youth, the slow train through Arkansas. That is a highway \nnow. Maybe they leave Arkansas now rather than go in as they did in \nthose days, but what I am telling you is we are asking for nothing more \nthan what was the process of modernization throughout the West. It was \nby foot, by wagon, by horse trail. Then when there were vehicles, there \nwere vehicles.\n  But in our State, we have areas where vehicles have not yet been on \nthe ground. A substantial part of our State cannot be reached by road. \nYou know that. It can only be reached by air. We still have the process \nof extending those roads out into those areas so we can have surface \ntransportation.\n  You cannot turn R.S. 2477 into a right-of-way over which a vehicle \nhas gone and protect our rights.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Senator, let me answer that by saying the fact that \nAlaska was, until recently, a frontier State, as was all of the West \nnot too many years ago. To suggest that simply because the West was \nsettled by pioneers who made wagon tracks or where they had footpaths \nwhere they tried to get to the West, to suggest that all of those \nroutes across Federal lands--let me finish, sir.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That was Federal lands.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. That is the very point I am getting ready to make.\n  Simply because somebody drove a covered wagon or group of covered \nwagons over land heading west, or it was a footpath used by people who \nwalked on it, to suggest those paths now constitute a highway, simply \nby mowing weeds on it, by moving a few rocks and showing that you did \nsome construction, how foolish can we be?\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is the very basis of the western highway system \ntoday,\n\n[[Page S4064]]\n\nthose rights-of-way that went across Federal lands. The whole West was \nFederal land.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. And anything you built prior to the repeal of this law \nin 1976 is yours. Nobody is trying to take that away from you.\n  Mr. STEVENS. In 1976, Alaska was 18 years old. We were just trying to \nget in the Highway Act.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I want to make two points, one to the junior Senator \nfrom Alaska. When he talks about how Bruce Babbitt did all of this \nbehind closed doors last year--with no consultation--last year, the \nSenator will recall that we tried our very best through a public \nprocess to come up with a definition of these roads. As a matter of \nfact, the Secretary went through the process of trying to develop a \nrule as to what a road was, issued it for public comment, got over \n3,000 comments, and the Senators from Alaska went ballistic and said, \n``No, we do not want any part of that. We are not about to let you.'' \nYou remember when we blocked him from proceeding further with that.\n\n  Then you come here today saying this should have been done in a more \nsensible way, when it was the Senators from that side of the aisle who \nstopped him from doing it.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. STEVENS. There is no sensible way for an edict to come from \nWashington denying the right of a State under Federal law. I am not \nseeking a more sensible way. I am telling him No! No! No! You cannot do \nthis. If we cannot get that between us, then you do not understand me. \nYou cannot do this. This is a right of our State.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The Senator has no right to complain. He says to the \nSecretary, ``No, no, no.'' He should not come to this floor squawking, \nbecause he stopped the Secretary from trying to come up with some kind \nof a sensible rule.\n  So, in 1997, and I have been trying to get to this for about 15 \nminutes, here is the policy that the Secretary of the Interior issued. \nIt is a good, sane, sensible policy. If the Stevens amendment on this \nbill stays in, he torpedoes this policy of 1997, and we go back to the \nabomination called the Hodel rule.\n  Now, you choose. If you think the Hodel rule was right--as I say, by \nmoving a few stones, mowing a little grass, anything to try to make it \nlook like you have been doing a little construction, or you listen to \nthe policy developed by Secretary Babbitt, and here is the first item:\n\n       An entity wishing the Secretary or any agencies of the \n     Department of Interior to make a determination as to whether \n     R.S. 2477 right-of-way exists shall file a written request \n     with the Interior agency having jurisdiction over the lands \n     underlying the asserted right-of-way, along with an \n     explanation of why there is a compelling and immediate need \n     for such a determination.\n\n  Surely, nobody objects to that.\n\n       The request should be accompanied by documents and maps \n     that the entity wishes the agency to consider in making its \n     recommendations to the Secretary. If, based on the \n     information provided, the agency does not believe a \n     compelling and immediate need for the determination exists, \n     it should, without further examination, recommend the \n     Secretary defer processing until final rules are effective.\n\n  That is the policy, ``until final rules are effective,'' and there is \nabsolutely nothing wrong with that.\n  No. 2, ``The agencies shall consult the public land records, \nmaintained by BLM to determine the status of the lands over which the \nclaimed right-of-way passes. If such lands were withdrawn''--that means \nthe Federal Government took the lands out and made a wilderness area of \nthem, or a national park or some other Federal purpose; that is what is \ncalled reserving the lands--``if they determine that these lands have \nbeen withdrawn by the Federal Government or otherwise made unavailable \npursuant to R.S. 2477 at the time the highway giving rise to the claim \nwas allegedly constructed and remained unavailable through October 21, \n1976, the agencies will recommend the Secretary deny the claim.''\n  Now, all that says is, if this was not a claim for an existing right-\nof-way prior to the time we repealed R.S. 2477, it should be denied. \nNobody would argue with that. That is the reason we repealed R.S. 2477, \nwas to stop the nonsense.\n  No. 3, ``If the lands were not withdrawn, reserved or otherwise \navailable''--now, that means that the Federal Government had not taken \nthe land and used it for some other purpose such as a national park, \n``the agency will examine all able documents and maps and perform an \non-site examination to determine whether construction on the alleged \nright-of-way had occurred prior to the repeal of R.S. 2477 on October \n21, 1976.''\n  Again, the agency will deny the claim if it had not been a right-of-\nway prior to the repeal of 2477.\n  No. 4, Highway: ``The agency shall evaluate whether the alleged \nright-of-way constitutes a highway.''\n  Here is the key to this whole thing. ``A highway is a thoroughfare \nused prior to October 21, 1976.''\n  That is the date of the repeal. An alleged right-of-way constitutes a \nhighway if it was a thoroughfare prior to the repeal of 2477.\n  If the agency determines that the alleged right-of-way does not \nconstitute a highway, the agency will deny the claim. Why shouldn't \nthey? That is the reason we repealed it. We don't want any claims \ncoming in on highways that were not in existence at the time we \nrepealed the law.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Will my friend yield?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. No. I will finish reading, and then I will yield the \nfloor.\n  The role of State law: He says, ``In making its recommendations, the \nagency shall apply State law in effect from 1976 to the extent that it \nis consistent with Federal law.''\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is Federal law now.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Let me finish, please.\n  All he is saying is that in this ruling the State law will apply as \nlong as it is consistent with Federal law. To do anything else, to \nissue a rule of any other kind, gives the States carte blanche over all \nunreserved Federal land. They will decide what a right-of-way is. They \nwill decide which ones they want to build roads on.\n  Finally, ``The agency will make recommendations on the above-\ndescribed issues to the Secretary, and the Secretary will approve or \ndisapprove of those recommendations.''\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield just for one second and answer \none question?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. All right.\n  Mr. STEVENS. What the Secretary is doing now concerns taking action \nunder the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, and section 701(h) of \nthe law is specific ``All actions by the Secretary concerned * * * \nshall be subject to valid existing rights.'' By what power does he \nredefine now what was a valid existing right in 1976? He wasn't \nSecretary in 1976. What happens to the women who are out there in those \nsmall villages and cities today? They have to be flown into town to go \nto the hospital. It is going to take a few miles to get the roads to \nthem. And we are going to get the roads to them, as long as we have the \nright to build the roads. We have the ability to deliver mail by road \nrather than by air. The Senator from Arkansas and others have been \ntelling us, ``Stop that subsidy for Alaska.'' And for their mail, it \ncosts $100 million more a year to deliver mail in Alaska because it all \ngoes by air rather than similar places in the southern 48 because there \nit goes by road.\n  By what right does this Secretary of the Interior determine what was \na valid existing right in 1976?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. First, the first thing the Secretary has to do before he \ncan approve an application is to determine whether it was a valid \nexisting right before 1976.\n  Mr. STEVENS. No, he doesn't. The law is the law. There were laws in \nplace in 1976 which defined those rights. He is now going to try to \nredefine the law to determine whether they were existing rights in \n1976.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Let me ask this question. What right does Don Hodel have \nto set out what an existing right was in 1988?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am glad the Senator asked that question of me.\n  If you want to look at what happened, Secretary Hodel approved in \n1988 a series of proposals that came to him from the Bureau of Land \nManagement, the Park Service, and the Fish and Wildlife Service within \nhis Department. He did not write that. He approved the work of a series \nof bureaus in his Department. It was not what this\n\n[[Page S4065]]\n\nSecretary is doing. This Secretary is coming along as the Secretary and \nissuing an edict to change all of that. This, in 1988, was the work of \nlong-term public servants who had great experience in managing.\n\n  As a matter of fact, if you want to look at the 1993 report to \nCongress on R.S. 2477 by the Department of the Interior--I have it \nright here--you will see that there was consultation with the \nGovernors, there was consultation with the State directors in Utah and \nAlaska, the areas where there was a substantial amount of R.S. 2477 \nclaims.\n  One of the things that I might add to this, my friend, is our \nGovernor, who is a member of the party of the Senator from Arkansas, \nsent word to the current Secretary of the Interior that he was \ndisturbed because he was not consulted before this was done. In the \nprior time, when the tables were turned and there was a Democratic \nGovernor in the State of Alaska, Secretary Hodel did consult with him. \nHe consulted with him. They had memos from the State. They had memos \nfrom Utah. They had memos from the BLM, Park Service, Fish and Wildlife \nService, from throughout the West. That is what Hodel approved.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Will the Senator yield on this subject?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Hodel approved a series of papers that were presented by \nthose agencies, and said--his statement is a one-page statement, which \nthe Senator has been reading. So the words that the Senator was reading \nwere not Hodel's words. The Secretary's approval is on a memorandum \nfrom the Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife, Assistant Secretary \nfor Minerals and Management, the BLM, and it is an approval of the \npolicy statement concerning R.S. 2477. Hodel did not develop that \npolicy. The Department developed it. All the agencies developed it in \nconsultation with the States involved, and with the State offices of \nthe various portions of this Department.\n  So the Senator is overlooking that.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The Senator from Alaska is saying that Donald Hodel, who \nwas Secretary of the Interior, had nothing to do with the development \nof policy--that the Department did it. Now does the Senator separate \nthe Secretary of the Interior from the Department of the Interior?\n  Mr. STEVENS. All Hodel had to do was sign his name to one page. He \ndid not do it. It was the Department that developed this policy after \nconsultation with a series of States and a series of agencies.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Everybody knows exactly why Don Hodel came up with that \npolicy--because the Western Senators threatened him probably with death \nif he didn't. Everybody knows that policy was crazy. It was done for \npolitical purposes. We all know that. I am not going to debate that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That sounds like something people accuse me of. I have \nbeen threatened with death.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I have never accused the Senator of being political.\n  Did the Senator want to ask a question?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask if the Senator from Arkansas is \naware of the circumstances under which the Secretary of the Interior \ninitiated his arbitrary decision recognizing what the law says. I have \na chart here. I will ask my friend from Arkansas relative to what R.S. \n2477 says. The statute's authority grants right-of-way for the \nconstruction of highways over public lands not reserved for public use. \nWe have defined, if you will, what it means as far as a highway is \nconcerned.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Let me interrupt.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is defined specifically under the law as \npedestrian, or a pack animal trail may qualify. The Department's own \nregulations in 1938, state when a grant becomes self-effective. The \ngrant refers to the section becoming effective upon the construction or \nestablishment of a highway in accordance with the State law. That is \nthe law of the land, the State law over public lands not reserved for \npublic use. ``No application should be filed under R.S. 2477, as no \naction on the part of the Federal Government is necessary.'' That is \nthe law.\n  What Secretary Babbitt is doing is saying you have to file. He is \nchanging and reinterpreting the law 20 years after it was repealed.\n  I ask the Senator if that is not a correct interpretation of what \nthis Secretary is doing. He is changing the law. He is saying you must \nfile. The law says you don't have to file.\n  Is not that correct? I ask my friend from Arkansas. Is he not \nredefining the law?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. We repealed that in 1976. That law was repealed. We are \nnot debating that.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That is what prevailing regulations stated during the \nentire time that the act was in effect. What this Secretary has done, \nunlike Hodel, who met with all the other Governors--let me add for the \nRecord at this time the letter from our Governor dated January 29 to \nthe Secretary.\n\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: I wish to express my dismay about your \n     issuance of a revised policy on R.S. 2477 rights-of-way \n     determinations without consultation with the State of Alaska \n     or, to my knowledge, other Western States. The department not \n     only failed to seek comment or input from Alaska, it did not \n     even pay the courtesy of informing the state that it planned \n     such a revision. Further, the department did not even notify \n     the state when it released the revised policy publicly.\n\n  Don Hodel didn't do that. Don Hodel met, my friend, the senior \nSenator said, with a Democratic Governor of my State and consulted on \nthe policy. He did it publicly in an open process. It was the input of \nthe Western States that brought the withdrawn definition and policy \ntogether. This Secretary changed that definition and simply suggested \nthat it be the passage of vehicle traffic, and that is contrary to the \nlaw.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the letter from Governor \nKnowles be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  State of Alaska,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                     Juneau, AK, January 29, 1997.\n     Hon. Bruce Babbitt,\n     Secretary of the Interior, U.S. Department of the Interior, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: I write to express my dismay about your \n     issuance of revised policy of RS 2477 rights-of-way \n     determinations without consultation with the State of Alaska \n     or, to my knowledge, other Western states. The department not \n     only failed to seek comment or input from Alaska, it did not \n     even pay the courtesy of informing the state that it planned \n     such a revision. Further, the department did not even notify \n     the state when it released the revised policy publicly.\n       This initiative is troubling not only because it violates \n     the spirit of the Congressional prohibition on further \n     interior development of RS 2477 policy contained in last \n     year's appropriations bill, but because it expressly revokes \n     the department's 1998 policy that was negotiated over several \n     months with Alaska and other Western states. The new policy \n     undermines several provisions that were carefully crafted to \n     the Alaska situation, for instance the definition of \n     ``highway.''\n       Mr. Secretary, I wish to maintain a good working \n     relationship with the Department of the Interior, but this \n     requires a bilateral effort. I will discuss this RS 2477 \n     issue with you at our appointment next Tuesday.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Tony Knowles,\n                                                         Governor.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I don't think many minds are being \nchanged with this debate. I don't see any reason to pursue it because \nwe have a 180-degree difference of opinion on it. I personally think \nthat the law is fairly clear on it. The policy of Donald Hodel is \nclear. He didn't consult with the public. He consulted with the two \nSenators from Alaska and the Governor of Alaska, and perhaps some other \nSenators from the West, which is understandable. The only reason I know \nthat is not because I know it for a fact. It is just that I know he \nissued a policy that was very pleasing to those Senators.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield right there?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does the Senator recall who was in the majority in the \nCongress at that time?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I know who the executive branch was. I know who the \nPresident of the United States was.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Hodel did not consult with these Senators because the \nmanagement of the Congress was under the party of the Senator from \nArkansas at\n\n[[Page S4066]]\n\nthat time. If there was any complaint about what Hodel did, that should \nbe in the Record. At the time, the Congress did not object to what \nHodel did because it was the process that came through consultation \nwith Western States, Western Governors, with the agency's State offices \nthroughout the West and was sent up to him by the Assistant Secretaries \nfor Fish and Wildlife and the Bureau of Land Management up to the \nSecretary for approval. That is not what is happening now.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I have to make this point one more time. The Senator \ntalks about Don Hodel consulting with everybody. Bruce Babbitt had \n3,000 comments from the public. Why is it that Don Hodel with a few \nRepublican Senators and Congressmen around him developed a policy--why \nwas that so wonderful with a few people sitting behind a closed door to \ndecide the policy, and Bruce Babbitt gets 3,000 comments? And what \nhappens? The first thing that happens is an amendment on an emergency \nsupplemental, which has absolutely no business being there, to stop him \nfrom implementing a ruling. Three thousand people have commented on it.\n  It just depends on whose ox is being gored. We all know that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield for just a second? This has \nnothing to do with whose ox is being gored. I am surprised there are \nonly 3,000. After all, all they have to do is press a button, and say, \n``Send out another 3 million direct mail pieces to all of these people \nthat are involved in this extreme environmental movement in this \ncountry.'' And I would be surprised if it was only 3,000. But those \npeople aren't the Governors of the Western States. They aren't the \nSenators that represent Western States. And they are not the people \nwithin the BLM and others who are professionals in this field. This is \ncoming at us now as edict on high. This is supremacy of the Federal \nGovernment. I have to tell you. I have dedicated my life against that. \nI think the Senator should remember that. We have been out here before \nsaying you can't make laws from the executive branch. It must come \nthrough Congress.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me just say this to the Senator from \nAlaska. It isn't often that I say this. But when I read the Senator's \ncomment on this emergency supplemental and I realize what the effect of \nit would be, for once in my life thank God for the supremacy of the \nFederal Government.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield for just a second?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I believe the senior Senator from Alaska would like to \nmake a statement.\n  Mr. President, while my senior Senator addresses the Senate floor \nschedule, let me remind the Senator from Arkansas once again----\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. STEVENS. No. No.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:10 today there be 5 \nminutes equally divided in the usual form prior to a vote on or in \nrelation to the D'Amato amendment No. 145, to be immediately followed \nby a 4-minute time period equally divided in the usual form prior to a \nvote on or in relation to the Bumpers amendment No. 64, and that \nfurther, prior to the votes, no other amendment be in order to these \namendments or to the language proposed to be stricken.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I am not sure I understood that. We are going to have 5 \nminutes of debate on D'Amato?\n  Mr. STEVENS. There is 5 minutes equally divided on D'Amato. That was \nthe request of your side, I might say to the Senator, and then a vote \non the D'Amato amendment. And then there will be, after that vote, 4 \nminutes equally divided on the Senator's amendment to strike, and there \nwould be a vote on the Senator's amendment. Neither will be subject to \namendment after this agreement.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. And this will all begin when? The first vote will take \nplace at----\n  Mr. STEVENS. At 2:10 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if I get the agreement, I will ask later \nthat the second vote will be a 10-minute vote, but I cannot do it yet. \nI thank the Senator.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I think we have gone on perhaps long \nenough on this, but there are a few things that need to be said \nrelative to the debate that has just occurred. And while my friend from \nArkansas indicated that we had repealed FLPMA, with regard to FLPMA, I \nthink it is important the record reflect that under R.S. 2477 we \nestablished and have always maintained the basis for determining the \nright of public access across public lands.\n  So that has been maintained in the law. I think it is further \nnoteworthy to recognize that the Hodel policy recognized the historic \nuse of a route. If it was historically a footpath, it was recognized as \na footpath. If it was a wagon trail, then it was recognized as a wagon \ntrail. If it was a wagon trail that was used in general commerce over \nan extended period of time, then it justified obviously inclusion under \nthe concept of R.S. 2477.\n  In summation, Mr. President, what is happening here I think is a \nresult of what happened as late as last year in Utah where we had a \nperfect example of a small group within the administration taking it \nupon themselves to decide for all Americans how our public lands should \nbe used. As the debate has indicated, those of us from Alaska are \nparticularly sensitive, as we can speak from long personal experience \non this topic. All of the experience teaches us that decisions \naffecting the use and classification of our public lands must be left \nin the hands of a public process, not one Secretary of the Interior who \ndecides on his own as a consequence of actions within the Department, \nwithout a public policy, that he is going to change the procedure \nunilaterally and redefine what constitutes an adequate method of \ntransportation across public lands, and that is what this Secretary \ndid, unlike Secretary Hodel.\n  Actions from this administration put the public's right to \nparticipate in the decisionmaking process, as far as I am concerned, on \nthe endangered species list.\n  Mr. President, allowing this administration, and that is what the \nproposal from the Secretary of the Interior does, to rewrite public \nland law use through the enactment of regulations is much the same as \nputting the fox in charge of the chicken coup.\n  The reason we in Alaska are a little reflective upon this is the \nhistory of our State. In 1966, the Secretary of the Interior--we \nentered into statehood in 1959--Secretary Udall decided on his own to \nintercede in Alaska and simply stopped processing land selections \nauthorized under the Statehood Act. We entered into the State of the \nUnion with a commitment of 104 million acres. The land was being \ntransferred to the State. He stopped the process. He did not ask \nanyone, just did it. In January 1969, he withdrew all public lands in \nAlaska from all forms of appropriation except mining claims--no public \ninput, no congressional action. This was the so-called land freeze, \nsuperfreeze. A few other names which would be inappropriate in this \nSenate Chamber come to mind.\n  It happened again in 1978, deja vu, this time with Jimmy Carter, who \nstepped in and decided on his own what was best for the management of \nour public lands, and using the 1906 Antiquities Act he created 17 \nnational monuments. These monuments encompassed slightly more than 56 \nmillion acres of land, an area the size of the State of South Carolina. \nIt did not stop there. This was followed in short order by Secretary of \nthe Interior Cecil Andrus who withdrew an additional 50 million acres. \nIn total that arbitrary action by the Secretary of the Interior \nwithdrew\n\n[[Page S4067]]\n\n105 million acres. That is more than the entire State of California. \nAll this land was withdrawn from multiple use without any input from \nthe people of Alaska, any input from the public, any input from Members \nof Congress.\n  I ask you, can you understand why we are sensitive? With all these \nactions held over Alaska's head, we were forced to cut the best deal we \ncould. Twenty years later, the people of our State are still struggling \nto cope with the weight of these decisions. When they say you forget \nhistory, why, I say you are doomed by it, doomed to repeat it if you do \nnot remember. So as long as we stand in this Chamber people will not be \nallowed to forget what happened when the public and the Congress are \nexcluded from the public land management decisions.\n  When my friend from Arkansas says that this does not belong in this \nlegislation, that it does not belong because it is not an emergency, he \nis absolutely wrong. It is an emergency. This is an action arbitrarily \nproposed by the Secretary of the Interior now. It is contrary to law, \nand it has to be stopped.\n  Mr. President, again, the fact is if R.S. 2477 was not in existence \non October 21, 1976, it will not and it cannot by definition be created \nnow. We have no problem with that. We want that to be the case. What we \ndo not want is the Secretary to arbitrarily suddenly come to the \nconclusion that if vehicle travel has not proceeded over these routes \nprior to October 21, 1976, there is no justification for inclusion.\n  So in closing, Mr. President, I wish that we did not have to address \nthis issue at this time, but it is an emergency for the Western States. \nIt belongs on the first legislative vehicle that we can get the \nattention of the Congress relative to taking action. I thought we put \nthis to an end in a bipartisan manner last year when we enacted a \npermanent moratorium on future actions by the Department, but that was \nnot good enough for the Secretary. So behind closed doors this \nSecretary has sought to disregard the spirit and the intent of our \nprevious action.\n  We have no other alternative, Mr. President, but to pursue this in a \nmanner to continue to have available the viability of historical \ntransportation routes that were in existence across our State, so that \nwe can bring our State together, recognizing the huge amount of Federal \nwithdrawal that is evidenced on this chart by the colored areas that \nrepresent all Federal withdrawals as compared to the white areas which \nsimply address the State holdings. So one can readily see the necessity \nof having the option to establish, if you will, access routes across \ntraditional trails that existed that were dog sled routes, or \nfootpaths, that were used for commerce prior to that 1976 date. We \nsimply have to have the assurance that that will remain as the law of \nthe land and we can continue to allow, after our short 39 years of \nexistence as a State, the development of our State, we can be bound \ntogether. That is why it is an emergency and that is why I commend my \ngood friend and senior Senator for putting this in this legislation \nbecause there is no question it is an emergency of the highest nature \nin the State of Alaska and certainly affects the other Western States \nas well as we have seen the withdrawal of 1.6 million acres under the \nAntiquities Act in Utah by this administration.\n\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska, Senator.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I want to remind the Senate now, and I will do so later \njust prior to the vote, in this year's Interior appropriations bill, \nsigned by the President last fall, after serious negotiation with the \nadministration, conducted by the previous chairman of this \nAppropriations Committee, at my request this section was put in that \nbill, section 108:\n\n       No final rule or regulation of any agency of the Federal \n     Government pertaining to the recognition, management or \n     validity of a right-of-way, pursuant to Revised Statute 2477, \n     43 U.S. Code 932, shall take effect unless expressly \n     authorized by an act of Congress subsequent to the date of \n     enactment of this act.\n\n  Now, that was the compromise last year as we began this fiscal year. \nWe believe it is an emergency when we return to Washington to find that \nthe Secretary of the Interior has issued a policy, a statement, edict, \nfiat, whatever you want to call it, but he has in effect changed the \nlaw, in his opinion, purported to change the law in a way that he \nbelieves is not covered by that very strong statement:\n\n       No final rule or regulation of any agency of the Federal \n     Government pertaining to the recognition, management or \n     validity of a right-of-way, pursuant to Revised Statute 2477. \n     . . shall take effect unless expressly authorized by an act \n     of Congress subsequent to the date of enactment of this act.\n\n  That is this Congress. We have very clearly said, and the President \nof the United States agreed, that any change regarding the validity of \nrights-of-way shall be authorized by an act of Congress, and yet if we \ndo not take this action that is in this bill that policy statement will \nguide all members of the Interior Department with regard to approval of \nthe applications of Western States for rights-of-way under the law, a \nlaw that was agreed to in 1976 and expressly reserved all existing \nrights-of-way.\n  I think it is a very clear issue, notwithstanding all of the flak \nthat is out there in these direct mail pieces that are stimulating \nevery newspaper from here to Washington State. It is just too bad that \neditors have not learned how to read because if they would read what \nthe law is, I do not see how they can come to the conclusions that they \ndo in some of the editorials I have read today. I hope the Members of \nthe Senate are not swayed by those editorials because they certainly \nare not based upon the law or the facts of the situation.\n  Mr. President, I will suggest the absence of a quorum awaiting my \nfriend. We do have some matters that we can take care of. I might state \nfor the information of the Senate that we have an indication from the \nParliamentarian that only 33 of the 109 amendments that were filed are \nproper under cloture. Members should consult, if they wish to do so, \nthe staff of either side to find out the situation with regard to their \namendment. Senator Byrd and I have agreed that if we can we would like \nto cooperate with Members on matters that are true emergencies, \nparticularly for those people who are from the disaster States, and \nthere are 33 of those, Mr. President. But we are compelled to rely upon \nthe actions of the Parliamentarian under the rule unless we can find \nsome way to accommodate the changes that would be necessary to validate \nthe amendments involved. So I urge Members of the Senate to determine \nwhether the amendments they have filed prior to cloture are now valid \nafter cloture.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceed to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/07/senate-section/article/S4045-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, make no mistake about it, I support the \nprovisions that have broken the chain of\n\n[[Page S4068]]\n\nwelfare dependency, welfare that became a narcotic, and it trapped \npeople. I think that our reform of the welfare system was good, \nintended and long overdue.\n  However, there have been some unintended consequences that are \ndevastating. I do not believe we ever wanted to take 500,000 basically \nsenior citizens and say that ``you're going to be cut off,'' senior \ncitizens who are here in this country legally, receiving SSI benefits, \nwho abided by the rules, and now simply terminate them.\n  Let me give you a profile of these legal immigrants who received \ntheir notice of termination. Seventy-two percent of them are women. \nThey are over the age of 65. Forty-one percent of them are over the age \nof 75. And almost 20 percent, or close to 100,000, are over the age of \n85.\n  Are we really going to say that we are going to take close to these \nsenior citizens, the vast bulk of them women, who have infirmities, who \nhave problems with the language, and say, ``Come August 22, you are off \nthe roll notwithstanding that you came here legally, notwithstanding \nthat you met all of the requirements''?\n  What our amendment does is simply say we are giving, to October 1, \nthe continuation of assistance. And, hopefully, many of these people \nwho have these infirmities will be able to qualify as citizens. It will \ngive us additional time to deal with what otherwise would be a \ncatastrophe for many of these people.\n  Mr. President, young, able-bodied recipients should be required to \nreport to a job. They should be challenged. There should not be an \nautomatic pass to welfare assistance. But certainly not the aged, the \ninfirmed, those who need help.\n  We are a country of compassion. That is why I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment, which is sensible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, amendment No. 64 is \nnow in order. There are 4 minutes of debate equally divided.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, in 1866, Congress passed a mining law \ncalled Revised Statute 2477. Here is what it said:\n\n       The right-of-way for the construction of public highways \n     across public lands, not reserved for public uses, is hereby \n     granted.\n\n  That was the law until 1976 when we repealed it. And we repealed it \nbecause there are literally thousands and thousands of potential \nrights-of-way, which the States could claim for purposes of building a \nhighway across Federal lands. In 1988, Donald Hodel, who was the \nSecretary of the Interior at the time, established a policy. Listen to \nthis:\n\n       Under that policy, a right-of-way could be established by \n     mowing high vegetation, by moving a few rocks, by filling in \n     low spots.\n\n  The State of Alaska has passed a law making every section-line in the \nState a right-of-way, over 900,000 miles. Here is the kicker, Mr. \nPresident. These rights-of-way would cross national parks, wilderness \nareas, national monuments, and other protected areas. These highways \ncross all of those areas that we have since taken out of the public \ndomain and made national parks and other reserved areas.\n  If we don't pass this amendment, every State--but particularly \nAlaska, Utah, and Idaho--will have the right to build roads on every \none of those claimed rights-of-way, according to the language of the \nStevens amendment. This issue is not an emergency. To hold the people \nin the Dakotas and Arkansas and other States hostage for something as \nfoolish as this is, would be foolish in the extreme.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute. Alaska has not \neven been surveyed yet. There aren't many surveyed section-lines in my \nState yet, except in very few portions of the State. The Nation's \nnational parks have coexisted safely under Revised Statute 2477 for \nover 100 years. Our wilderness areas have not been paved, despite all \nthe threats we have had. We have had 30 years of the Wilderness Act \nunder Revised Statute 2477 and there has been no complaint at all.\n  Last fall, we put in the appropriations bill for the Interior \nDepartment this section:\n\n       No final rule or regulation of any agency of the Federal \n     Government pertaining to recognition, management, or validity \n     of a right-of-way pursuant to Revised Statute 2477 shall take \n     effect, unless expressly authorized by an act of Congress \n     subsequent to enactment of the date of this act.\n\n  That was agreed to by the administration. The President signed that \nbill. It came about after negotiation with the President, as a matter \nof fact.\n  Now, by edict, the Secretary of the Interior has determined a new \npolicy will go into effect and he will make\n\n[[Page S4069]]\n\nproperty laws for the Federal Government establishing how rights-of-way \nare created on Federal lands throughout the West. It should not happen.\n  I yield to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCain. Mr. President, we have heard a very spirited debate on \nthe issue of rights-of-way across Federal land today. Both sides are \npassionate.\n  On one hand, States worry that the Federal Government will exercise \ntheir authorities to invalidate, bona-fide historic rights-of-way. On \nthe other hand, the Interior Department worries that States will \nliberally define their rights-of-way which could pose environmental \nthreats to Federal lands, including parks and wildlife refuges.\n  Mr. President, I believe that there is ample room for principled \ncompromise in this dispute. States should not be denied their bona-fide \nrights-of-way, nor should excess or unreason be permitted to threaten \nour Nation's parks and pristine areas.\n  Clearly this situation must be resolved, because if this stalemate \npersists, and the Secretary is precluded from proceeding under \nreasonable parameters, I don't believe we will have any official \nprocess or method for administratively assessing a claim. Such a \nstalemate serves the interest of no one and cannot stand.\n  I've been engaged in an effort to find a process by which the \nSecretary, Governors, and local officials can work together to \ndetermine what constitutes a valid right-of-way; what methods and \nstandards will be used to recognize the claim, and how such rights will \nbe managed.\n  I believe we can achieve a reasonable compromise and an appropriate \nprocess. While time does not permit us to reach an agreement before we \nmust vote now, I will continue to work with the Senators from Alaska, \nSenator Bumpers, and the Interior Department to try and reach some \nagreement that we can all be proud of, one which will protect States \nrights, Federal interests and most of all the public interest.\n  I appreciate the Senator from Alaska's support for that effort and I \nlook forward to working with him to resolve this matter before the \nconference.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, the distinguished chairman, Senator \nStevens, and myself, Senator Glenn, Senator Lautenberg, Senator Gregg, \nand others now have worked out the Department of Commerce compromise on \nthe census. I have an amendment that reflects that compromise at the \ndesk, and I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be in order and \nthe clerk be allowed to report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. What was the request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is that the amendment from the \nSenator from South Carolina be in order.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings], for \n     himself, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Gregg, and Mr. Glenn, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 231.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 47 strike lines 14 through 18 and insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 303. None of the funds made available in any \n     appropriations Act for fiscal year 1997 may be used by the \n     Department of Commerce to make irreversible plans or \n     preparation for the use of sampling or any other statistical \n     method (including any statistical adjustment) in taking the \n     2000 decennial census of population for purposes of the \n     apportionment of Representatives in Congress among the \n     States.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, what it allows is the Census Bureau to \ncontinue to plan to conduct a census that uses statistical sampling but \nthe Congress under the leadership here of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Alaska, and our chairman and ranking member of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, which has jurisdiction as the authorizing committee, \ncan change that in the future after careful review and oversight.\n  There is a deep misgiving among some of the Members with respect to \nany kind of taking of polls or handling of numbers or statistics \nparticularly after somehow the Immigration and Naturalization Service \nat the Department of Justice naturalized a million immigrants to be \nable to vote last November. And so it is natural that they wanted to \nmake certain that the statistical sampling related to the year 2000 \ncensus be taken in a totally professional manner. We have it, we think, \non course to be as professional as it can be. Ms. Riche and the \nprofessional staff at the Bureau of the Census are just outstanding.\n  What the Members need to understand that what really occurred after \nthe 1990 census was it became clear that all kind of undercounting and \novercounting occurred, varying in areas. The undercount was especially \nsevere among low-income people, minorities, and rural areas. Congress \ntold the Census to find a way to conduct the next census in a more \naccurate way at less cost. The Census Bureau went to the National \nAcademy of Sciences. The National Academy of Sciences, after a thorough \nstudy, says go ahead, send the forms out, which are really reported \nback about some 60 percent or so. We get another 30 percent by going \naround door to door, through telephone calls, and followup. That last \n10 percent is next to impossible in some\n\n[[Page S4070]]\n\nplaces to find, in the innercity, in the rural areas, and in areas with \nhigh native American populations. Some of the census takers \nthemselves--we got some 300,000 earning around $13 an hour--they might \nget fatigued some afternoons or near a weekend, or not be willing to \nenter into some areas or buildings. The way it was handled in 1990, the \nfollowup was far too subjective.\n  So the Academy of Sciences looked at, studied, and have had the best \nof minds in a bipartisan fashion--this has not been a partisan issue--\nand they recommended that census find a new way to estimate those hard \nto reach populations. They told census to use the same statistical \nmethodologies that the bureau uses for all its products that this \nNation relies on. They recommended to go ahead with this kind of \nsampling advancing forward to take the census for fiscal year 2000.\n  We really were disturbed in the Appropriations Committee that if we \ndid not allow it to continue at this particular point--this is \nabsolutely not final, of course--that we were going to set a course \nwhereby we were going to have to spend another half a billion bucks \ntrying to go door to door with the same ailments and disturbances and \ninaccuracies that we suffered back in the 1990 census. And we would end \nup not only paying more but getting back into court with lawsuits again \nand everything else of that kind.\n  Mind you me, there is over $100 billion in Federal programs allocated \naccording to this census data, the Members of the House of \nRepresentatives are apportioned according to this census, and we want \nto be as nonpartisan and as thorough and as scientific as we can \npossibly be in its taking.\n  To the credit of the Governmental Affairs Committee, which is the \nauthorizing committee, they have been working diligently on this issue. \nOur distinguished chairman, Senator Thompson of Tennessee, I have \ntalked with him, and our ranking member, Senator Glenn. They have \nalready experienced two hearings which have more or less confirmed that \nwe are on course, but they have yet to finalize any action taken this \nparticular year.\n  So what we wanted to do at the moment in this particular emergency \nsupplemental was not stop anything but express our outright concern \nthat this particular census is not to be used politically. It has to be \ndone professionally.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman of our Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Stevens, and his distinguished staff for going along working \nwith the Department of Commerce and myself all last evening and this \nmorning. I think this particular compromise here will allow us to \ncontinue on course but not lock in the short form irrevocably. Census \ncan continue to do its planning and dress rehearsals to ensure that the \nnext census is more accurate.\n  With that said, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. GLENN. Madam President, I commend my colleagues, Senator Stevens \nand Senator Hollings, for working out this amendment, because it will \nlet the Census Bureau proceed with planning and testing of statistical \nsampling.\n  We need the best possible information before making a final call on \nthe design of the 2000 census. The language we have agreed upon, as my \ndistinguished colleague from South Carolina has just said, will let us \nget that information and get it in good shape, I believe. Thousands of \nAmericans are waiting for the disaster relief to be provided by the \nlegislation on the floor today, and they need this money to rebuild \ntheir homes and their lives. I am very relieved we are working together \nto get this aid to those needy people.\n  I know full well the Census Bureau's plan to use sampling is highly \ncontroversial. I do not like sampling any better than anybody else. The \nonly problem is, there is no better way to get a more accurate count of \nall the people in this country than by using all the regular procedures \nwe have used before plus the sampling. There is no better way, even \nthough none of us like it. We wish it were a perfect situation where we \ncould go out and count every single American, just like the \nConstitution says we are supposed to do. But, as Senator Hollings said \njust a moment ago here, you cannot do that. We normally do not get full \nreturns on all the census reports. We wind up traditionally with about \n10 percent of the people not sending returns back, even though census \ntakers call multiple times on their domicile or their businesses. So we \nwind up having to do some sampling to get a more accurate census, and \nthat is what the whole thing is all about.\n  So, it is controversial. Some people say the sampling does not meet \nthe constitutional requirement for an actual enumeration. Those are the \nwords, ``actual enumeration,'' in the Constitution. Some say sampling \nis inherently subjective because it is based on statistical \nassumptions, as it has to be.\n  We have been arguing about this ever since 1990, when post-census \nsurveys showed that 1.6 percent of the population had been missed. That \nmay not sound like a big figure, but it is big if you are laying out \nplans for Federal appropriations that have to apply to these certain \nareas. The Bush administration decided finally not to use sampling to \nadjust that census. They decided the census statistical adjustment plan \nhad too many problems. Here we are 7 years later. I must admit that, \nlike my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee, I, too, have some \nreservations about sampling.\n  But we have to remember that the Census Bureau is not looking at \nsampling because they think it is the ideal method. Quite the contrary, \nan accurate, direct count would be the best. The problem is, a direct \ncount has never worked in the past. And every census is more difficult \nthan the last one. That is because our population keeps getting larger. \nIt is more mobile. It is more culturally diverse, while public \ncooperation keeps declining. That is why the bureau is looking at new \napproaches.\n  A complete sampling ban would require the bureau to cancel current \ntesting plans and contracts, and that would just waste money that has \nalready been spent for good purposes.\n  A complete ban would require hurried development of new plans for \nnext year's Census Dress Rehearsal. That would waste more money. \nFinally, a complete ban would require hurried development of a new plan \nfor conducting the 2000 census. That would require many more census \ntakers and would cost a lot more money. This is the tragic part, it \nmight lead to a much less accurate census, more  litigation, and more \nsuspicion of Government. The language we have worked out prevents all \nthat waste and keeps all our options open. At the same time, it lets \nthe Census Bureau know the seriousness of our concerns.\n\n  Let me tell you a little bit about the 2000 census--something the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee is looking at right now. The census will \nset a new record as the largest peacetime mobilization in American \nhistory. The Bureau will hire 600,000 temporary workers, knock on 120 \nmillion doors, and count about 270 million people.\n  By statute, the entire process has to play out smoothly over 9 \nmonths. The questions will begin on Census Day, April 1, and the \nresults have to be given to Congress by December 31. Census Bureau \nofficials tell us that, if they use sampling, they can keep the cost of \nthe 2000 census down to about $4 billion, a little less than the 1990 \ncost of $25 per household. Without sampling, it will cost the taxpayers \na whole lot more--perhaps as much as another billion dollars.\n  Most important of all, the census is a highly serious enterprise. It \nis the process we use to make sure that every American--every \nAmerican--is fairly represented in the governing of this great country. \nIt is so fundamental to our democratic system that the Constitution \nspecifically requires an actual enumeration of our population once \nevery 10 years.\n  These facts tell me that the decennial census calls for our very best \nthinking, our very best planning, and the very best scientific tools \nthe statistical community has to offer. To quote the Commerce Inspector \nGeneral:\n\n       We continue to believe that, if carefully planned and \n     implemented, sampling can be employed by the Bureau in the \n     2000 census to produce overall more accurate results than \n     were produced in the 1990 census, at an acceptable cost. We \n     further believe that the Congress should allow the Bureau the \n     freedom to complete its work on sampling and then select the \n     optimal census design based\n\n[[Page S4071]]\n\n     on all of the available information. According to the \n     bureau's plan, fundamental work on all potential uses of \n     sampling will be finished by December 1997. We do not believe \n     an informed design decision can be made until this work is \n     completed and the various design components are tested during \n     the April 1998 dress rehearsal.\n\n  I think the Commerce IG gave us some very good advice, because some \nhard facts have begun to emerge from the wealth of opinion about \nsampling.\n  Fact: The Bureau has been using statistical sampling in the decennial \ncensus for decades. The census Long Form--which goes to only one in six \nhouseholds--is a perfect example of a kind of sampling that is widely \naccepted. If Congress bans sampling completely, we will not be able to \nuse sampling for the Long Form any more. But the information gathered \nby the Long Form is still required by law. So we will have to send the \nLong Form to every single household across the country. And the \nAmerican taxpayers will have to foot the bill.\n  Another fact: It is inherently impossible to count everybody \ncorrectly the traditional way. All the experts agree on that. There \nwill never be enough time or money. There will always be people not at \nhome no matter how many times the census taker calls. When President \nGeorge Washington received the first census data in 1790, he also got \nan estimate of the undercount. That has been the story ever since. In \n1990, the census missed 10 million people. It counted 6 million people \ntwice. And it counted another 10 or 20 million people in the wrong \nplace. After that experience, everyone involved agreed that a better \nplan, a scientific plan, had to be developed for 2000.\n  Another fact: The undercounted people are some of the most vulnerable \nin our society, minorities, poor people, both rural and urban, the non-\nEnglish speaking, the homeless. These are the people we are excluding \nfrom the democratic process.\n  Still another fact: Virtually all statisticians say that our \nscientific tools have been developed and tested to the point that we \ncan finally fix the undercount problem. That view is supported by GAO, \nthe Commerce IG, the National Academy of Sciences and a host of other \nprofessional organizations.\n  Yes, 1990 sampling methods were flawed. That is precisely why the \nCensus Bureau has spent 7 years developing a reliable plan for 2000. It \nis precisely why the Census Bureau needs to keep testing and planning, \nand it needs to go on with that right now and not have it cut off.\n  What about the constitutional arguments? On April 16, at one of our \ncommittee's two recent hearings on the census, we heard testimony from \nWisconsin's Attorney General James Doyle. He led the charge against \nsampling in 1990 because statistical adjustment of that census would \nhave given California an additional House seat at Wisconsin's expense. \nMr. Doyle testified recently:\n\n       I think the Constitution requires that we make the best \n     effort we can to an actual headcount, and I recognize that is \n     a very complex task, and I recognize that within that task, \n     we have to leave a good deal of discretion to the Census \n     Bureau to, in fact, make some counts where you are not \n     actually counting actual human beings.\n       For example, you go to a locked apartment building and you \n     go back there 5, 6, 7 times. At some point, somebody has to \n     make a reasonable estimate on how many people are in that \n     locked apartment building, and there are other kinds of \n     procedures that the Census Bureau has built up over time to \n     try to build that accuracy.\n       So I recognize that there has to be a good deal of \n     discretion given to do things other than summon everybody to \n     Bethlehem and count how many people are there.\n\n  At the same hearing, we also heard testimony from Stuart Gerson, the \nAssistant Attorney General who advised the Bush administration not to \nadjust the 1990 census.\n  Mr. Gerson said, and remember, this is a person who advised against \nsampling in the Bush administration:\n\n       Whatever an enumeration means, it does mean an accurate \n     count and that should be our guideline--it does appear that \n     the Constitution would permit a statistical adjustment if it \n     would contribute to an accurate count.\n\n  Note the caveat: ``if it would contribute to an accurate count.'' \nBoth of those legal experts agree, and again, one of them led the fight \nagainst adjustment in 1990, that the key to the constitutional \nrequirement for an ``actual enumeration'' is accuracy. They both agree \nthat sampling is legally acceptable under two conditions: The Census \nBureau has to make a good faith effort to count everybody the \ntraditional way; and the Bureau has to demonstrate that sampling \nimproves accuracy.\n  Let us look at whether the Census Bureau's plan can meet those \nrequirements. The plan itself was described in our committee hearing of \nMarch 11. We heard from Commerce Secretary William Daley, from Ev \nEhrlich, the Commerce Under Secretary for Economic Affairs, and from \nMartha Richey, Director of the Census Bureau. As they explained, the \nfirst proposed use of sampling is to help count people who don't send \nback their census questionnaires by mail. The Bureau won't even start \nthis sampling until after they have first made the greatest effort in \nthe history of census-taking to convince Americans to send back their \nquestionnaires.\n  First, questionnaires will be mailed to every household found on the \ncombined Census/Postal Service national address list. To insure the \nmost complete national address list possible, the Bureau will also get \nseveral updates from local governments. Every household in America will \nget precensus letters and post-mailout reminders. Questionnaires will \nbe available in town halls, post offices, community centers, and even \nstores. And finally, the Bureau plans an aggressive outreach campaign \nof school presentations, community meetings and paid advertising--all \nto give every single American every possible opportunity to participate \nand be counted in the time-honored way. I would say that passes the \nfirst test of constitutionality, a good faith effort to do an actual \nhead count.\n\n  Even with all this effort, experts project that only 65 percent of \nthe American public will be counted using these methods. Our population \nis just too big, too mobile, too diverse, and too apt to ignore \nGovernment requests for information--even when it is this important.\n  The question for the Bureau is, how do we count that last 35 percent? \nAs the lawyers have told us, the Constitution and Federal law require \nour best effort.\n  The census plan is to follow up the mail process with a large sample \nof those who did not send back a questionnaire. That sample will be \nlarge enough to make sure that census takers contact at least 90 \npercent of the people in each census tract. Yes, that means census \nenumerators will go into communities, just as they always have, to \ncount at least 90 percent of Americans in the traditional way, by \nheadcount. Then, and only then, will statistics be used to estimate the \nlast 10 percent of the population.\n  What about the second constitutional requirement? Can the Bureau \ndemonstrate that sampling improves accuracy? At our second oversight \nhearing on April 16, we heard testimony from Prof. Lawrence Brown of \nthe Wharton Business School. He strongly opposed adjustment of the 1990 \ncensus based on the sampling plan the Bureau used to generate the \n``corrected'' counts. Professor Brown didn't think the Bureau's sample \nwas large enough, and he didn't think the statistical model was valid. \nBut he told our committee last month that the Census Bureau's plan for \n2000 addresses the concerns he had in 1990. He told us the Bureau's \nplan can work. And he told us we will again have an undercount if we do \nnot use sampling.\n  On the charge that sampling is inherently subjective, Professor Brown \nsaid:\n\n       Certainly, there is some subjectivity in how the process is \n     designed and how the analysis is--conducted. But if all of \n     this planning is done in advance, it is very very hard for me \n     to see how one could direct these subjective decisions \n     towards any desired goal.\n\n  Notice the caveat: ``if all of this planning is done in advance. * * \n*'' That is just what the Census Bureau proposes to do over the next \nyear. And this new language we have agreed on today will permit that \nwork to move ahead and still give Congress the final decision.\n\n  As Professor Brown's testimony proved--even for experts who \nquestioned sampling in 1990--the Census Bureau seems to be on the right \ntrack for 2000. At this point in time, it is very hard to find even one \nstatistician who doesn't think that sampling should be able to improve \nthe accuracy of the 2000 census. The Bureau is doing its research; it \nis testing its plans; and it is having its plans reviewed by experts.\n\n[[Page S4072]]\n\n  Everything the Governmental Affairs Committee has learned so far \ntells me we need to keep the sampling debate open. And we need to give \nthe Census Bureau a fair hearing. To disrupt the planning process now \nwould set the Bureau back a year or more. And it would lock the Bureau \nand the Congress into a traditional census that we know will cost much \nmore and we know will be inaccurate.\n  I have already told you that I have some personal reservations about \nsampling. I wish it were possible to get an actual head count directly \non every single American. I am sure the American public has concerns as \nwell. We all get survey calls at home, around dinner time, usually. We \nalso know about polls--surveys that conclude one thing or another--\noften depending on who paid for the poll. We know all this. We know \nthat surveys can be used in many different ways. So, we have to agree \nthat the Census Bureau has a very heavy burden to prove to Congress and \nthe American people that its survey methods are objective and \nscientifically sound, and that they will produce accurate, reliable \ninformation. The Constitution requires no less.\n  What is critical right now is for census to continue its planning \nprocess--continue to appear before congressional committees--as it is \ndoing before our committee--and continue to explain and review its \nplans. Only after this process is complete can we decide if the 2000 \ncensus will be a success.\n  At this point in the debate, I am less worried about the \nconstitutional and scientific issues than I am about the Census \nBureau's management capacity. GAO and the Commerce IG agree with me on \nthat. The viability of sampling depends on the Bureau's capacity to \ndesign and faithfully execute a good plan. Our debate here today proves \nthat Congress is not yet sure of the Bureau's abilities.\n  The Bureau has to give us more information. And we have to be willing \nto listen. The Bureau also has to show us that they have the management \ncapacity to carry out a sampling plan if we approve it. These are the \nquestions I think we should be focusing on.\n  It is time for some plain talk--about the stakes involved here. Most \nof those people undercounted in last census were poor, and many of them \nbelong to ethnic and racial minorities. We cannot tolerate any \nundercount. Our system of government guarantees equal representation \nfor all Americans--regardless of race, ethnicity or economic \ncircumstances--certainly regardless of political affiliation. I can \nonly hope that my colleagues will not trade off this fundamental \nprinciple of democratic government for assumptions about partisan \npolitical advantage.\n\n  Let me remind you about where the undercount is found. Look at the \nStates that had high undercounts in 1990--New Mexico, 3.1 percent; \nMontana, 2.4 percent; Texas, 2.3 percent; Mississippi, 2.1 percent; \nIdaho, 2 percent. This is not a Democratic versus Republican issue. The \nundercount is a problem for every Member of this body. We undercount \npeople in rural areas--that is a third of the 1990 undercount. We \nundercount people who are renters rather than homeowners. And we \nundercount over 12 percent of native Americans who live on \nreservations.\n  Let's not throw away our opportunity to fix the undercount, without \ntaking a good hard look at whether we have to and what are our options. \nFunding formulae, equal protection, civil rights, State and local \nplanning, school building, targeted aid, business planning--almost \nevery aspect of American life--would benefit from the best possible \ncensus in the year 2000.\n  My heart goes out to all the Americans who are counting on us for the \ndisaster relief this bill will provide. I want go give them that \nrelief. I want to vote for this bill. So, I strongly urge my colleagues \nto join me in supporting this amendment. I congratulate Senator \nHollings, Senator Stevens, and their staff for working this out. Let \nthe Census Bureau get on with planning what could be the best census, \nthe finest census in American history. And let us get on with providing \nrelief to those tens of thousands disaster victims who are counting on \nus.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I commend and agree with my colleague on the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, Senator Glenn, with regard to the \npurpose of the census and how important it is. I commend Senator \nHollings and Senator Stevens for working out some language that will \nget us over this temporary hurdle and will not cause us to have to stop \nin midstream and make a decision today as to exactly what we ought to \ndo, because I do not think anybody knows exactly what we ought to do \nright now. I do not think attention has been focused on this issue.\n  We in the Governmental Affairs Committee, however, have been focused \non it for a while. When I became chairman, we had a meeting on the \nstaff level and started to engage the people at the Census Bureau and \nthe Department of Commerce and explained to them what our intentions \nwere in terms of having hearings and gathering information as to the \nright way to proceed.\n  We have had two hearings, as Senator Hollings has pointed out, \nconsidering specifically these sampling issues that we are talking \nabout, keeping in mind how important it is.\n  It is important that people have confidence in this census. Clearly, \nwe base a lot of things on it in terms of distribution of Federal \nmoneys, academic research, and things of that nature that are dependent \non it, and last, but not least, the apportionment for the House of \nRepresentatives. So we need to do it cautiously and carefully and not \nbased on who is going to benefit politically in the outcome, not based \non some supposition of what the outcome is going to be.\n  I made a commitment early on that we would hear this fairly, we would \nbring in the experts and proceed carefully, but that the administration \nwas going to have to convince us and the American people that the way \nthey were going to proceed would be a fair, objective way. Of course, \nthat brings us to the heart of the sampling issue, and it is not an \neasy issue to resolve. In fact, I think we are right in the middle of \nresolving it. We have asked for a lot of additional information in \norder that the Census Bureau can convince us that this will be done in \nthe right way.\n  Everybody is for doing something about the undercount, which I think \nmost people agree that we have. We need to do something about this. We \nneed to proceed in the fairest, most objective way in order to address \nthat particular problem.\n  But the question still is out there whether or not sampling is the \nright way to proceed. In the first place, I think we need to realize \nthat the proposal that is on the table now really involves two levels \nof sampling: 90 percent is contact directly, 10 percent is sampling, \nand then there is another level of sampling which is supposed to take \ncare of the undercount. So we have a couple of different levels of \nsampling. It has not been perfected yet.\n  Back in 1990 when they did the census, they considered adjusting the \ncensus numbers based on sampling. Based upon the information that they \ninitially had there, they made an error of one seat. One State would \nhave improperly gotten a seat and another State would have improperly \nlost a seat. They caught it in time and decided not to use sampling \nback then.\n  There are constitutional issues; there are legislative issues. It is \nnot just a constitutional question. We are familiar with the fact that \nthe Constitution requires, in some people's minds, an actual head \ncount. It is somewhat debatable, but to some legal experts, it is even \na greater question as to whether or not Congress has constructed a \nlegislative pattern that would forbid sampling.\n  There has been a lot of sampling legislation passed and some of it is \ninconsistent. It would be a tragedy, indeed, if we went through all \nthis process and we used sampling and spent $4 billion in order to \ncarry this out and then find out we did not have the constitutional \nauthority or that we have the constitutional authority but did not have \nthe legislative authority. So if we go through with sampling, I think \nwe are going to need additional legislation to clear that up.\n\n  There is another question involved as far as the expense. Some of the \nwitnesses originally told us that if we did not sample, it would cost \nus an extra billion dollars. We are getting information now which says \nthe cost would be\n\n[[Page S4073]]\n\nmuch less than that. We need to clear that up.\n  I think this is an appropriate way to proceed, but I want to \nemphasize to the administration, and I want to emphasize to the Census \nBureau, that those of us who will be dealing with this thing directly \nare going to be looking to them to convince us and convince the Senate \nand convince the American people that they will conduct this thing in a \nfair and objective way. A lot of people are concerned that this \nadministration, which has shown in times past the willingness and the \nability to use the authority of the administration for political \npurposes--witness the Immigration and Naturalization Service before the \nelection last time--that an administration that is willing to do that \nwould be willing to tamper with this process.\n  It is a matter that is somewhat new to us in this body for this \nparticular purpose--that is, one of apportionment--and it is not going \nto be something we will readily latch on to. I am not saying it is the \nwrong thing to do, but I am saying the burden is on the administration, \nthe burden is on the Census Bureau, not only that this is \nscientifically acceptable, which I think a lot of people think it is, \nbut, second, that we are not going to have to be worrying about some \npeople in a bureaucracy somewhere who are going to be having their \nfingers on the scales of justice, as has happened in other instances.\n  So, with that, I leave it for another day. I look forward to working \nwith the members on the committee and others on the Appropriations \nCommittee in trying to come up with the best system that is fair to \neverybody, not based on who benefits or who suffers from a political \nstandpoint, but based on what is fair and accurate, not only in terms \nof the result, but in terms of the process in getting to that result.\n  With that, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, the amendment that Senator Hollings has \npresented is acceptable, and I am pleased to cosponsor it. It is a \nprovision that I put in the bill, or I offered as an amendment to the \nbill when it was in committee.\n  A full count of the population for the purpose of apportioning seats \nin the House of Representatives is required by the Constitution. \nArticle I calls for an ``actual Enumeration * * * '' and section 2 of \nthe 14th amendment reads: ``Representatives shall be apportioned among \nthe several States according to their respective numbers, counting the \nwhole number of persons in each State * * *''. Title 13 U.S.C. section \n195 states: ``Except for the determination of population for purposes \nof apportionment of Representatives in Congress among the several \nStates, the Secretary shall, if he considers it feasible, authorize the \nuse of the statistical method known as ``sampling'' in carrying out the \nprovisions of this title.''\n  When the Secretary of Commerce declined to approve a statistical \nadjustment to the 1990 census, at least 50 law suits were filed. The \nSupreme Court upheld the Secretary's decision in one of these cases, \nWisconsin versus City of New York. The Court held that the Constitution \n``vests Congress with virtually unlimited discretion in conducting the \n`actual Enumeration' * * * Through the Census Act, 13 U.S.C. section \n141(a), Congress has delegated its broad authority over the census to \nthe Secretary.'' The Court noted that the adjustment being recommended \nto the Secretary in 1990 differed from other statistical adjustments \nused in 1970 and 1980 because it ``would have been the first time in \nhistory that the States' apportionment was based upon counts in other \nStates.''\n  If a sample is employed for the 2000 census, endless litigation \nchallenging the constitutionality of using this technique is likely. By \ndirecting the Census Bureau today to employ a full count, we are giving \nthe Bureau sufficient time to redirect their efforts before 2000. The \nadditional cost of a full count is estimated to be $400 million. The \nincrease is bound to be less than the Government's cost of defending \nagainst lawsuits which will result from using a sample.\n  There is also an issue of fairness. The Census Bureau will get a 90-\npercent count of a census tract and use sampling to determine the \nremaining 10 percent of the population in that census tract. An \nestimation does not seem to be a fair way of determining the \npopulation.\n  The Census Bureau has claimed a full count of the population without \nsampling will cost an additional $400 million. As soon as this \namendment prohibiting the use of sampling appeared, the cost went up to \n$1 billion.\n  I have reviewed the most recent Census Bureau cost sheet, and it \nseems to me the Census Bureau can do a full count well within the range \nof $400 to 500 million. Any attempt to claim it will cost a billion \ndollars is a red herring to deflect attention away from the real issue, \nand that is the constitutionality of conducting the count by sampling.\n  The cost of the census should not be an issue. Under the \nConstitution, Congress has the duty to direct an ``actual Enumeration'' \nof the American public for purposes of apportionment. When carrying out \nour constitutional responsibilities, cost is immaterial.\n  In 2000, The Census Bureau wants to estimate 10 percent of the \npopulation of this country. In 2010, the Census Bureau may want to \nestimate 30 percent of the population. The Census Bureau claims \nsampling will solve the problem of undercounting. It is difficult for \nme to accept that an estimation will ensure everyone is counted.\n  Concern about not counting all Americans is not a new issue. Then-\nSecretary of State Thomas Jefferson was in charge of the first U.S. \ncensus in 1790, and he was gravely concerned that there had been an \nundercount.\n  The Census Bureau, in an effort to devise new techniques to ensure \nthe most complete count possible, has determined that conducting a \nsample of nonrespondent citizens on a census tract level is the most \neffective means of achieving numerical accuracy. Which is more \nimportant? Numerical accuracy or distributive accuracy?\n  On March 20, 1996, the Supreme Court held that distributive accuracy \nwas more important than numerical accuracy in deciding Wisconsin versus \nCity of New York. In this case, the Court upheld the Secretary of \nCommerce's decision not to approve statistical adjustment to the 1990 \nCensus. The Census Bureau plans to sample in each census tract across \nthe nation. They plan to estimate who lives in a neighborhood or \nvillage based on a sample.\n  The Census Bureau claims the language in this bill as reported from \ncommittee will require them to send a long form to all households.\n  The Census Bureau says sending a long form to one out of every six \nhouseholds is a sample, and thus the language in this bill would \nrequire them to send the long form to all homes. The language in this \nbill was not intended to prohibit the Census Bureau from using the \nshort form. I would have no objection to amending the language to \nensure the Census Bureau can continue to use the long and short forms.\n  The question arose: what would happen to a census form that was \nmailed in late, after the Bureau had begun a post-census sampling \nprocess? The original answer was that the late response would be \ndiscarded because it would interfere with the sample established by the \nCensus Bureau. Since the actual enumeration of citizens has a long and \nvenerable history, this answer was a shocker.\n  The Bureau now says that a late response will be counted, even if it \ncame from a household that was not in the followup sample area. They \nadmit this will complicate the estimation process. Obviously the \ninconvenient appearance of a real person's response does damage to a \ntheoretical sampling construction.\n  The Governmental Affairs Committee has held two hearings on the plans \nfor Census 2000, including one exclusively on the legal and statistical \npropriety of using sampling. There are many troubling questions about \nthe Census Bureau's plan to implement sampling techniques in the next \ncensus.\n  The problem of undercounting in the cities has been a problem, and \nthe Bureau says sampling will help correct this undercount. But what \nabout the problem of undercounting in rural areas? Does the Census \nBureau really know what it doesn't know? We are asking to take the \nremainder of this year to scrutinize the Census Bureau's\n\n[[Page S4074]]\n\nplans for the next census, and particularly their plans to use sampling \ntechniques.\n  Sampling could well be inaccurate, illegal, or unconstitutional. \nCongress must decide whether sampling is consistent with the \nConstitution's requirement that the census should be an ``actual \nEnumeration'' of the American public for the purpose of providing a \nbasis for apportioning Congressional representation among the States.\n  In the 1990 census, the Bureau made extensive efforts to reduce the \nundercount of actual persons. It sought out ``traditionally \nundercounted populations'' and expanded assistance for non-English-\nspeaking residents. But there was no plan to create hypothetical \nrespondents, although there was an effort to statistically adjust the \ntotal. This adjustment was ultimately rejected by the Secretary of \nCommerce.\n  That is the problem now. The sampling would be the basis for an \neducated guess under the proposal that was presented to us. I am \npleased to see the text has been modified so what we are concentrating \non is the constitutional requirement to enumerate the population for \nthe next census, and on that basis, I support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, when it comes to sampling, I think \neveryone should understand that we are very familiar with it. Almost \nevery product put out by the census, or from data supplied by the \nCensus Bureau is based on sampling. We quote the gross domestic \nproduct. The Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan and others use GDP and \ninflation statistics based on very small samples. The monthly \nunemployment rate that all the members listen for. Well that is based \non sampling of some 60,000 household of the 115 million households in \nthis Nation. That is less than 1 percent. And, with the full decennial \ncensus, the Bureau has been using sampling for the long form for almost \n60 years.\n  And if there is one group that really believes in sampling, it is \nMembers of Congress. We come here with a poll taken, every one of us. \nAnd for a State my size with 3.5 to 4 million people, a sample of 870 \nto represent that number of people is readily considered authoritative. \nSo we are doing the best and we are doing it professionally. I believe \nthat we are on course now with this particular compromise.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that my complete statement \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Statement by Senator Hollings Regarding the Census\n\n       Madam President, the bill before us is an emergency \n     supplemental appropriations bill to deal with flooding, other \n     natural disasters, and support for our troops in Bosnia. It \n     also includes a provision that was inserted by the majority \n     that prohibits the Census Bureau from using funds to conduct \n     or plan to use statistical sampling in any way in the conduct \n     of the year 2000 decennial census.\n       The census of the United States is required under Article \n     I, section 2 of the Constitution. Since the original census \n     in 1791, it is a basic government function that is performed \n     every ten years. To many in this body it probably seems like \n     a dry, academic subject. The census is about data and \n     numbers. It is the sport of demographers and statisticians.\n       Yet, the census impacts Americans' daily lives in so many \n     ways. Clearly, as noted in Article I, it is the basis for \n     apportionment in the House of Representatives. It also has \n     become the basis upon which over $100 billion in Federal \n     program aid is allocated. Programs from Low Income Energy \n     Assistance to Community Development Block Grant to \n     Transportation grants all rely on census data. But, the \n     census also is the main vehicle with which we are able to \n     describe the characteristics of our democratic society. It \n     tells us how many men and women live in each State and in our \n     nation. It tells us about racial diversity and employment and \n     literacy. Having accurate and unbiased population and \n     economic statistics is a basic requirement for a democratic \n     nation as diverse and geographically varied as the United \n     States.\n\n\n                  Census Has Striven For More Accuracy\n\n       The history of the census has been one of progressively \n     seeking more detailed information about our people. And, it \n     is a history of striving for more accuracy in the accounting \n     for the residents of this nation.\n       The Senators who put this prohibition in the bill seem to \n     think that by proposing the use of statistical sampling to \n     aid the census enumeration, that the Census Bureau has broken \n     new ground. Well, that's just not the case. The accuracy of \n     the census was brought into question with the very first \n     census. When Thomas Jefferson transmitted the census data in \n     1791, he also provided his own estimates. He stated that ``we \n     are upwards of four millions; and we know in fact that the \n     omissions have been very great.'' You might say that he \n     provided the first ``post enumeration survey.'' Through much \n     of the 19th Century, the Census was run by Marshals who \n     reported to the U.S. Senate. They didn't have standard \n     procedures and census forms did not exist until the 1830's. \n     In fact, the Census Bureau itself was not created until 1902.\n       Statistical sampling dates back to 1940. In that year Dr. \n     Demming, the noted management expert who once worked for the \n     Bureau, proposed the use of sampling in the conduct of \n     census. It was adopted to reduce the number of Americans who \n     received detailed questions that we now call the census Long \n     Form. Similarly, the issue of undercounting the poor and \n     minorities always has been a problem. When this nation \n     adopted the draft to prepare for the Second World War, the \n     census first realized the magnitude of this problem. When the \n     call went out to serve the nation, we found that 3 percent \n     more men were in this country than the Census Bureau had \n     estimated in the 1940 decennial census. Among black males, 13 \n     percent more showed up to the call of duty than the census \n     said even resided in America.\n       Relative to statistical sampling, it is used in almost \n     every type of data that the Census Bureau collects and uses \n     for its products. It is used in the Long Form so that only 1 \n     in 6 Americans are asked detailed questions about employment, \n     housing, family background, etc. A very small sample is used \n     to get economic data every month so we can tell Alan \n     Greenspan and Wall Street if Gross Domestic Product \n     increased, or if inflation has increased. Take unemployment. \n     Every month every Senator listens to what the monthly \n     unemployment rate is. ``It's about jobs'' as our former Trade \n     Representative Mickey Kantor would say. Well that \n     unemployment data is collected by the Census Bureau. It is \n     based on a survey of only 60,000 households out of 115 \n     million households in this country. That is a sample of far \n     less than 1 percent! So with this census issue, let's not act \n     as though the use of statistical sampling is something new or \n     some gimmick adopted by the census. The fact is that our \n     Census Bureau is the Federal Government's premier statistical \n     agency.\n\n\n            The 1990 Census Debacle and Statistical Sampling\n\n       Now, the current situation we find ourselves in is an \n     outgrowth of the 1990 census debacle. The 1990 census was the \n     most expensive census we had every conducted and for the \n     first time it was LESS accurate than previous censuses. It is \n     widely acknowledged that it was seriously flawed. Nearly 10 \n     million people were NOT counted and 6 million people were \n     counted twice. There were lawsuits by groups that were \n     undercounted. Suits that ended up in the Supreme Court six \n     years later. So Congress told the Census Bureau to figure out \n     how to do a census that is: (1) more accurate and (2) more \n     cost effective.\n       The Census Bureau did the right thing. It went to an \n     outside group of experts. They went to the National Academy \n     of Sciences in 1993 and asked for their recommendations. The \n     Academy studied the issue and recommended that the Census \n     Bureau incorporate statistical sampling in the conduct of the \n     year 2000 census. The academy concluded that a rerun of the \n     1990 process would produce even less accurate data in the \n     year 2000 and would cost more per household, primarily \n     because voluntary citizen cooperation with the census is \n     declining. They concluded that traditional census taking \n     methods will always yield a differential undercount because \n     some populations are just hard to count, such as rural and \n     inner city poor people. The Academy recommended, in fact, \n     that the Census Bureau continue to work until it achieved a \n     70 percent response from residents and then use statistical \n     sampling for the remaining 30 percent.\n       The professionals at the Census Bureau adopted the \n     Academy's recommendation--a well designed statistical sample \n     to correct over and undercounting before the census counts \n     are finalized. The only change they made was to reduce the \n     amount of sampling. They concluded that they would work until \n     90 percent of residents were counted and use direct \n     statistical sampling to estimate the remaining 10 percent.\n       Now, Madam President, I think there is a great deal of \n     confusion on how the census is conducted and what is meant by \n     these numbers. The Federal Government sends every resident a \n     census short form. The Census Bureau makes extensive efforts \n     to get these forms returned. Approximately 65 percent of the \n     population does so. After that the greatest expense of the \n     census comes into play. The question is how much effort and \n     how much do we have to spend to get people to respond who \n     have not sent back their questionnaires. The Census Bureau \n     makes phone calls, goes door to door, and literally employs \n     an army of 300,000 census takers to find individuals and \n     households who did not respond. In the past, one of the \n     reasons for inaccurate counts, is that finding those ``hard \n     core'' of non-respondents is quite subjective. It isn't easy. \n     These are in remote rural areas and in poor urban areas. It \n     is commonly acknowledged that follow-ups are not conducted in \n     a scientific fashion. It is a well\n\n[[Page S4075]]\n\n     known fact that census takers would rather falsify data than \n     go into some of those areas.\n       In the case of the Census Bureau's plan, they are proposing \n     to estimate those remaining 10 percent of impossible to reach \n     non-respondents. They are proposing to do so in a scientific \n     way that is statistically reliable. It is a methodology that \n     takes subjective judgement out of the process.\n\n\n                    this amendment casts a wide net\n\n       The amendment in this bill not only prohibits the Census \n     Bureau from moving forward with its statistical sampling \n     plans I've discussed, but it also casts a very wide net and \n     prohibits all other statistical sampling. It would prohibit \n     the Long Form from being sent to 1 in 6 Americans. This type \n     of sampling has been underway for almost sixty years. So, the \n     Census lawyers tell us that every American would have to be \n     sent the Long Form under this congressional prohibition. It \n     would prohibit the Census from working with the Postal \n     Service and sampling to find vacant housing units that are \n     currently on address lists. It would prohibit the Census from \n     carrying out statistical sampling in its dress rehearsals \n     that are now underway. It would prohibit the Census from \n     planning to do quality assurance samples to ensure that \n     census data is not falsified by census takers. It is, in \n     short, a clumsily worded amendment that is quite far reaching \n     in its consequences.\n       Now during our debate in Committee, the Chairman criticized \n     the Long Form. I believe the gist of what he said was that \n     the Long Form asks too many questions of too many people. \n     Well, Mr. President, I'd like to know which questions. \n     Questions about industry were added in 1820. Veteran status \n     in 1840. Education in 1850. Housing in the 1930's and 1940's. \n     Income level in 1940. We added a category to determine if a \n     respondent considered themselves to be of Hispanic origin in \n     1970. Telecommunications questions began in 1980. In each \n     case these questions came about because Congress directed \n     them in statute.\n\n\n             issue belongs with the authorization committee\n\n       This amendment doesn't belong in an appropriations measure, \n     especially an emergency appropriations bill. It belongs with \n     the Committee of oversight, the Governmental Affairs \n     Committee. Now the irony is that the Senate Governmental \n     Affairs Committee has been, in fact, holding oversight \n     hearings on the year 2000 decennial census. They have heard \n     from a number of outside witnesses and they have been hearing \n     the pros and cons on statistical sampling.\n       Senator Glenn has written to Senator Stevens and Senator \n     Byrd requesting that his Committee be allowed to continue to \n     do its job. That the Appropriations Committee not interfere. \n     He is right.\n\n\n                            increases costs\n\n       What the Appropriations Committee should be concerned about \n     regarding this issue is the cost. The irony is that the \n     amendment inserted by the Chairman will greatly increase the \n     costs of the year 2000 decennial census. The current estimate \n     for the total cost of the 2000 census is $4 billion! If the \n     Census Bureau is required to make a full enumeration effort \n     and NOT allowed to sample for 10 percent, then the costs will \n     increase to $4.4 billion to $4.5 billion. That's because we \n     will keep on the payroll that army of door-to-door census \n     takers who will make around 13 dollars an hour.\n       The Commerce Department tells us that if you look at the \n     cost impact of all the ramifications of this prohibition, \n     including prohibiting sampling for the Long Form--then the \n     cost of the year 2000 census will be about $1 billion higher. \n     So through this amendment the Appropriations Committee, which \n     is supposed to be concerned about the budget and costs, will \n     be taking a $4 billion census and turning it into a $5 \n     billion census.\n       So we tasked the National Academy of Sciences to come up \n     with a methodology is more cost effective and accurate \n     census. If we approve the prohibition in this bill we will be \n     doing the opposite. We will be conducting a less accurate and \n     more costly census.\n       There is a sense of absurdity about all this. The costs I \n     have cited are the full multi-year costs of conducting the \n     census. We are starting from a fiscal year 1997 Census Bureau \n     year 2000 decennial census appropriation of only $84 \n     million. That was a cut of about 21 percent from the \n     President's FY 1997 request of $106 million. Under the \n     Census Bureau's $4 billion plan using sampling, the \n     appropriation needs to grow to $2.3 billion within three \n     years. Dollars are tight. Our section 602(b) allocations \n     for our Commerce, Justice, and State Subcommittee have \n     been billions below the President's request for our \n     Subcommittee. And, the Census Bureau competes against the \n     Justice Department and the Judiciary which now account for \n     two-thirds of our bill.\n       The reality is that Senator Stevens and the Committee are \n     not going to give us the money to fund the Census Bureau's \n     less expensive $4 billion plan using sampling let alone his \n     notion of a $5 billion census that employs no sampling.\n       And that is what disturbs me most. We have an agency that \n     is trying to economize and find a way to save costs. And here \n     is the Appropriations Committee getting into an area outside \n     our jurisdiction and then telling them to do their job in a \n     more expensive way. I truly fear that we are going to mess up \n     the year 2000 census. That it will be the least accurate \n     census ever.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       I have received a number of letters from outside interest \n     groups, from demographers and statisticians asking me to get \n     this onerous language out of the bill. Senator Glenn's \n     observations have been especially forceful. Yesterday, our \n     Committee received a letter from the Commerce Department's \n     Inspector General who has done a great deal of work on the \n     Census. I will include the full statement in its entirety, \n     but let me just quote a few lines:\n       ``We strongly disagree with this provision. We believe that \n     such a prohibition would make it almost impossible for the \n     Census Bureau to carefully research, test and implement an \n     optimal design for the 2000 census. Over the past two years, \n     we have issued reports, testified, and briefed bureau, \n     departmental, and congressional principals and their staff \n     members on our support for the use of statistical sampling in \n     the 2000 census. We continue to believe that, if carefully \n     planned and implemented, sampling can be employed by the \n     bureau in the 2000 census to produce overall more accurate \n     results than were produced in the 1990 census, at an \n     acceptable cost. We further believe that the Congress should \n     allow the bureau the freedom to complete its work on sampling \n     and then select the optimal census design based on all of the \n     available information. Halting the design effort at this \n     critical juncture would mean that the substantial effort made \n     to date would be left incomplete and unevaluated.\n       Madam President, I have been working with Chairman Stevens \n     and Senator Gregg trying to find a reasonable compromise on \n     this issue. It clearly was not their intention to require the \n     long form to be sent to every American. And, it is the \n     concern of many members on the opposite side of the aisle \n     that the Census Bureau not proceed with statistical sampling \n     for the short form in a manner that is irreversible.\n       Accordingly, I am pleased to report that we have worked out \n     a compromise amendment that achieves both aims. It allows \n     planning and preparation by the Census Bureau to continue and \n     it allows the Committee of Jurisdiction, the Senate \n     Government Affairs Committee, to continue its review and \n     oversight of the Census' plan for the year 2000 decennial \n     census. Finally, the compromise allows the Census Bureau to \n     continue to send the long form to only 1 in 6 Americans and \n     to therefore get essential data.\n       Madam President, I think this is a good compromise and I \n     trust my good friend the senior Senator from Alaska will \n     uphold the Senate position in Conference with the House.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nletter from the inspector general, the Department of Commerce, and the \nletter from Secretary Daley be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Department of Commerce,\n\n\n                                        The Inspector General,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 5, 1997.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Byrd: We have learned that S. 672, the \n     Supplemental Appropriations and Rescissions Act of 1997, as \n     reported out of the Committee on Appropriations, includes a \n     provision that would prohibit any appropriated fiscal year \n     1997 funds to be used to plan for the use of statistical \n     sampling in the 2000 decennial census. We strongly disagree \n     with this provision. We believe that such a prohibition would \n     make it almost impossible for the Census Bureau to carefully \n     research, test, and implement an optimal design for the 2000 \n     census. Over the past two years, we have issued reports, \n     testified, and briefed bureau, departmental, and \n     congressional principals and their staff members on our \n     support for the use of statistical sampling in the 2000 \n     census. We continue to believe that, if carefully planned and \n     implemented, sampling can be employed by the bureau in the \n     2000 census to produce overall more accurate results than \n     were produced in the 1990 census, at an acceptable cost. We \n     further believe that the Congress should allow the bureau the \n     freedom to complete its work on sampling and then select the \n     optimal census design based on all of the available \n     information. Halting the design effort at this critical \n     juncture would mean that the substantial effort made to date \n     would be left incomplete and unevaluated.\n       The bureau has only recently decided on the type and degree \n     of sampling to be used in the 2000 census. These decisions \n     are driving the bureau to complete the required research on \n     important details. According to the bureau's plan, \n     fundamental work on all potential uses of sampling will be \n     finished by December 1997. We do not believe an informed \n     design decision can be made until this work is completed and \n     the various design components are tested during the April \n     1998 dress rehearsal. Even if the prohibition against the use \n     of funds for sampling is lifted in fiscal year 1998, we \n     believe that the bureau will simply not have enough time to \n     develop a complete, detailed sampling design for testing in \n     the dress rehearsal. Consequently, the bureau will not be \n     able to conduct a ``one-number census'' using sampling in \n     2000 without a significant risk of reduced accuracy,\n\n[[Page S4076]]\n\n     increased cost, and delay. Some of our specific concerns are \n     discussed below.\n\n\n                    Sampling and Estimation Research\n\n       If appropriated funds cannot be used for sampling work, \n     important research needed for key sampling design decisions \n     will not occur. Various aspects of this research are \n     interdependent, with one research result feeding into others. \n     For example, according to its research plan, the bureau is \n     scheduled to decided in October on the optimal sampling \n     designs for both nonresponse follow-up and the postal vacancy \n     check. Included in this research is determining how the \n     different sampling applications affect one another at \n     different levels of geography. This information will, in \n     turn, feed into a decision on the optimal Integrated Coverage \n     Measurement survey design, scheduled for December. Aspects of \n     this decision include how to allocate the survey sample to \n     each state to ensure equity among states; which combination \n     of demographic characteristics to focus on to reduce the \n     differential undercount; and how to deal with people who have \n     moved either into or out of a household. Additionally, \n     critical work on how to combine all the different enumeration \n     methods into ``one number'' may be irretrievably delayed.\n\n\n                                Staffing\n\n       The bureau will not be able to hire or contract for the \n     expertise needed to conduct and oversee the sampling and \n     estimation work. Specifically, the bureau will not be able to \n     acquire the staff resources it needs to complete work on the \n     ``one number census;'' it will not be able to gain much \n     needed information on the effects of sampling on accuracy at \n     the block and small tract areas; and it will not be able to \n     convene an expert oversight panel this summer, as planned.\n\n\n                                 Costs\n\n       Prohibiting the use of sampling in the 2000 census would \n     drive up cost and drastically reduce the accuracy of the \n     census. Although, the cost increase cannot be precisely \n     estimated, depending on the response to the initial mailing, \n     it is clear that the additional costs would involve hundreds \n     of millions of dollars.\n       We strongly urge the Committee to allow the bureau the \n     freedom to complete its work on sampling and then select the \n     optimal census design based on all of the available \n     information. To do otherwise would leave the 2000 census in a \n     most precarious position. We are available to discuss these \n     concerns with you and/or your staff at your convenience. \n     Please feel free to call me at (202) 482-4661 or Jessica \n     Rickenbach, our Congressional Liaison Officer, at (202) 482-\n     3052.\n           Sincerely,\n     Francis D. DeGeorge.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                    The Secretary of Commerce,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 29, 1997.\n     Hon. Ernest F. Hollings,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Committee on Appropriations, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Hollings: I am writing to urge deletion of \n     language contained in the supplemental appropriations bill \n     that would prohibit the Census Bureau from using fiscal year \n     1997 money to prepare for the use of sampling in the \n     decennial census. The Administration strongly opposes this \n     provision in the disaster relief supplemental.\n       This language is premature. It would short circuit a \n     process that is underway in other Congressional committees to \n     evaluate the use of sampling in the decennial census. This \n     matter is far too important to be decided without full \n     debate. A prohibition on statistical sampling this year also \n     will seriously impair our ability to develop and plan for the \n     best possible decennial census.\n       This provision will result in a less accurate, more costly \n     Census 2000. The country deserves an accurate census count \n     that is right the first time. We should not repeat the same \n     mistakes of the 1990 decennial census which did not utilize \n     sampling. Using the failed techniques of the 1990 census \n     would result in an unacceptable undercount. This undercount \n     can be virtually eliminated with statistical sampling.\n       Congress instructed us to convene the Nation's experts \n     through the National Academy of Sciences. They concluded that \n     statistical sampling is the most reliable method for ensuring \n     an accurate census.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 William M. Daley.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank my distinguished chairman, Senator Stevens.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, the emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill contains language that prohibits the Census Bureau \nfrom preparing to use any funds in the current fiscal year to ``plan or \notherwise prepare for the use of sampling in taking the 2000 decennial \ncensus.'' I opposed this provision in the committee mark-up because the \nNational Academy of Sciences [NAS], at the request of Congress, found \nsampling resulted in a more accurate census and that without sampling, \nthe national effects have long-standing negative ramifications. I \nsupport Senator Hollings' amendment.\n  A statistical sampling study was done by the National Academy of \nSciences at the request of Congress. Others continue to question if \nsampling produces accurate data. I welcome that debate, but I believe \nthis is not an issue to be decided in the emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill. There have been several congressional hearings on \nthis subject, and I support that those committees should be given the \nopportunity to finish their work. I believe it would be unwise for \nCongress to stop further work on this issue in an emergency \nsupplemental. Other supporters of using statistical sampling include \nthe American Statistical Association, the Population Association of \nAmerica, and the National Conference of Mayors.\n  Sampling results in a more accurate census. The National Academy of \nSciences concluded from their study that sampling was necessary for an \naccurate census count, and strongly recommended its use in the 2000 \ncensus to account for nonresponding households. The census is \nresponsible for counting all residents in this country, including those \noverlooked by traditional polling methods. The process of sampling \nhelps the Census Bureau count U.S. residents that may not respond to \ntraditional outreach methods, that is, those who do not speak English \nwell, or those who can not read or write proficiently. Big cities all \nacross this country are home to many of these overlooked Americans. \nRelying solely on mailed responses and face-to-face visits, so-called \ndirect enumeration, while critical, will guarantee an inaccurate census \nbecause we will essentially be saying if we can not find you, then we \nwill not count you, and therefore you do not exist. The Constitution \ndoes not tell us to only count those who are at home, or who has time \nto fill out the form. The Constitution says every resident must be \ncounted.\n\n  Without sampling, the effects have long-standing negative \nramifications. The National Academy of Sciences found in the 1990 \ncensus racial minorities were severely undercounted, compared to \nwhites. Without sampling, the costs will increase due to added manpower \nand work hours involved. More census takers will have to be hired, \ntrained and will have to knock on more doors, requiring a greater drain \non the Nation's resources. For the 1990 census, those forms that were \nnot returned by mail cost the U.S. Government at least 6 times more to \nenumerate than those who mailed back their forms. Using field staff to \nfind the most reluctant respondents raised the cost as much as 18 \ntimes.\n  Because of California's large racial minority population, California \nwas more severely harmed by the undercount than other States. We need \nan accurate census because many important Federal programs depend on \ncensus data to allocate funding. In the 1990 census, it is estimated \nthat 837,557 Californians were not counted, which caused California to \nbe shorted more than $5 million in several Federal programs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If there is no further debate, the question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 231) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, we have five amendments that, as soon \nas Senator Feingold has presented his position on one amendment, we \nwill be able to handle by consent.\n  I urge Senators to come to the floor to see if we can work out these \namendments. We still have some 26 eligible amendments. When I am able \nto confer with the Senator from West Virginia, I do want to announce a \npolicy with regard to amendments that the Parliamentarian has indicated \nare not in order under cloture.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, what is the pending business?\n\n[[Page S4077]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the Reid amendment No. \n171.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Reid \namendment be temporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 83\n\n (Purpose: Prohibit use of funds for ground deployment in Bosnia after \n                          September 30, 1997)\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 83 and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 83.\n       On page 7, line 24, insert before the period, the \n     following: ``: Provided further, That none of the funds made \n     available under this Act may be obligated or expended for \n     operations or activities of the Armed Forces relating to \n     Bosnia ground deployment after September 30, 1997''.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I rise today to offer an amendment to \nthe Supplemental Appropriations Act that would effectively set an end \ndate for deployment of ground troops in Bosnia.\n  The Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1997 provides an additional \n$1.5 billion in fiscal year 1997 funds for the ongoing Bosnia \noperation. But what my amendment will do, Madam President, is seek to \nset a date certain for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from participation \nin the NATO-led Stabilization Force, or SFOR. Specifically, it \nprohibits the use of funding provided for under the Supplemental Act \nfor United States Armed Forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina after \nSeptember 30, 1997, the end of our current fiscal year.\n  Madam President, I recognize very sincerely that the Dayton Accord \nand the deployment of the NATO-led Implementation Force, IFOR, to \nenforce it, has not been without some real benefit. People are no \nlonger dying en masse in Bosnia. And U.S. troops, in conjunction with \ntroops from other countries, should be warmly applauded for having \nlargely succeeded in enforcing the military aspects of the agreement. \nWe should also be very thankful that there have been virtually no \ncasualties.\n  I think a special note should be made to commend the courage and the \ndedication of the U.S. military personnel in the region. These men and \nwomen continue to work tirelessly in an environment which has been \nchallenging and very complex. Service men and women from across the \nUnited States have served in this mission with distinction and there \nshould be no confusion between the honor and the admiration which they \nhave earned and, Madam President, the need to terminate this operation.\n  The issue of whether the United States should continue to deploy \nground troops in Bosnia is a separate question from the outstanding \nperformance of our military forces.\n  Madam President, I have had strong reservations about United States \ntroop deployment in Bosnia ever since it was initially announced in \n1995. As some in this Chamber may recall, I was one of only a few \nMembers of Congress, and the only Democrat in the Senate, to vote \nagainst the deployment of U.S. men and women to support the Dayton \nAccord.\n  I said then that I doubted the value of a heavy U.S. investment in \nthe region. I felt then that administration promises to have American \nmen and women out of the region within a year's time were unrealistic \nand would not be kept. And I questioned then whether or not the Dayton \nplan would level the playing field between the Serbs and Moslems such \nthat peace would reign in the region.\n  So where are we today, Madam President? United States troops have now \nbeen on the ground not just for a year in Bosnia, but for nearly 18 \nmonths. And the concerns that I had then remain with us today.\n  My concerns, Madam President, are twofold. One has to do with a \nmandate for a military operation that continues to grow, yet has \nincreasingly less value. The other relates to the ever-spiraling cost \nof United States involvement in Bosnia.\n  Let me first take up the question of the mandate under which our \ntroops are operating.\n  Madam President, when, in late 1995, the President first announced he \nwould be sending United States forces to Europe to participate in the \nIFOR mission, he and many others promised the Congress and the American \npeople that the IFOR mission would be over within 1 year. And this \npromise was reiterated by the President on several occasions and \ncontinually backed up by senior American military and diplomatic \nofficials in public statements and in testimony before Congress, \nincluding in response to my own questions in the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee. There were repeated assurances that this would be \nover within 1 year.\n  We all understood that that promise meant that our military men and \nwomen would be withdrawn from the region by December 1996, or at least \nvery shortly thereafter. But, Madam President, in November 1996, the \nPresident announced that he would extend the U.S. mission for an \nadditional 18 months. A mission that was promised to be only 1 year was \njust suddenly and very quietly extended by 18 months beyond that year \nthrough June 1998, for participation in the NATO force now known as the \nStabilization Force, or SFOR.\n\n  Despite the baptism of a new mission, Madam President, we all know \nthat SFOR, although a bit more limited in scope, in reality represents \njust an extension of the original IFOR mandate that was supposed to \nexpire within 1 year. The President's announcement of an extended \ndeadline signaled that the United States would continue to be drawn \ndeeper into a situation from which it has become harder and harder to \nextricate itself.\n  Madam President, the war in Vietnam was called a quagmire. We \nreferred to continued United States troop deployment in Somalia as \n``mission creep.'' I fear that the Bosnia operation is presenting the \nsame dilemma. With indicted war criminals still at large, refugees \nstill unable to return to their homes, and the timing for upcoming \nlocal elections still in doubt, there will obviously continue to be \nmany reasons to call for an ongoing U.S. military presence on the \nground without any clear end in sight.\n  In the meantime, in the heart of the conflict is the fact that the \nstrategic political goals of the warring factions remain unchanged.\n  Madam President, I have a copy of a November 26, 1996, editorial from \nthe Wisconsin State Journal. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Wisconsin State Journal, Nov. 26, 1996]\n\n                    Bosnia Mission Devoid of Vision\n\n       President Clinton said a year ago that most U.S. troops \n     would be out of Bosnia within a year. Now he says the United \n     States is prepared to keep troops in that shattered Balkans \n     nation for another 18 months.\n       Here's a preview of what Clinton's decision could mean for \n     those troops as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     mission in Bosnia drags on.\n       For 11 months, displaced Muslims have been waiting \n     patiently for the NATO force to deliver on the biggest \n     promise made to them through the Dayton peace agreement: The \n     right to return to their homes.\n       For refugees living in camps near the town of Celic this \n     month, patience ran out.\n       After learning that their empty homes in Gajevi and Koraj \n     were being blown up by the Serbs, the refugees tried to take \n     matters into their own hands. About 600 of them, mostly women \n     and children accompanied by some armed men, tried to walk \n     back to their villages.\n       They were turned back by American soldiers who got caught \n     in a crossfire between the Muslims and the Serbs. No \n     Americans were hit, but one Muslim man was killed by Serb \n     gunfire.\n       When the American troops returned to Celic the next day to \n     confiscate weapons from a Bosnian army storage site, an angry \n     crowd of several thousand blocked their way. ``Pretty soon \n     rocks were bouncing off helmets and soldiers were being spit \n     on,'' one soldier told the Chicago Tribune.\n       Almost a year after the Dayton peace agreement committed \n     U.S. troops to Bosnia, U.S. commanders there describe the \n     situation on the ground not as ``peace'' but rather the \n     ``absence of war.'' Almost no freedom of movement exists. Few \n     refugees have been able to return to their homes and \n     elections two months ago, while essentially fair, only served \n     to harden deep ethnic divisions.\n       Nothing has been done to make the Serbs accept resettlement \n     of the Bosnians, and NATO commanders have not been able to do \n     anything to track down war criminals responsible for ``ethnic \n     cleaning'' during Bosnia's long civil war.\n\n[[Page S4078]]\n\n       So, what's the point? Why does Clinton propose to keep \n     American troops in Bosnia, long past his original schedule?\n       U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., said he believes the whole \n     Bosnia policy was ``sold on a phony basis'' to Congress and \n     the American people. Meeting this month with members of the \n     State Journal editorial board, Feingold observed, ``Three \n     billion dollars later, we're still in this thing. We continue \n     to be drawn deeper and deeper into a situation from which we \n     appear unable to extricate ourselves.''\n       By leaving the U.S. mission in Bosnia open-ended, Clinton \n     gives the Serbs every reason to continue thumbing their nose \n     at the Dayton agreement and our European allies less reason \n     to take ownership of a peace-keeping mission that should be \n     their primary concern.\n       Members of both parties in Congress are starting to ask \n     hard questions about the goals and duration of the U.S. \n     mission in Bosnia. It's time to hold Clinton's feet to the \n     fire--before American troops find themselves caught in the \n     middle again.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Madam President.\n  This editorial, in one of our State's leading newspapers, notes as \nfollows:\n\n       By leaving the United States mission in Bosnia open-ended, \n     [President] Clinton gives the Serbs every reason to continue \n     thumbing their nose at the Dayton agreement and our European \n     allies less reason to take ownership of a peace-keeping \n     mission that should be their primary concern.\n\n  By this analysis, the presence of U.S. troops may actually serve to \nharden rather than soften the ethnic tensions in the area. The longer \nthe Moslem refugees are prevented from returning to their homes, the \nmore determined they are of the right to do so. At the same time, the \nSerbs are thwarting resettlement efforts and ignoring indictments from \nthe War Crimes Tribunal against their own leadership.\n  As this newspaper editorial reminds us, the ``U.S. commanders [in \nBosnia] describe the situation on the ground not as `peace' but rather \nas the `absence of war.' ''\n  Madam President, I believe that the open-endedness of this mission \nmay actually be helping to keep the warring parties from truly \nfulfilling their commitments under the Dayton accord.\n  Madam President, let me turn to my second major concern. And it is \nreally the crux of this amendment. That relates to the bill that the \nUnited States taxpayer is bearing with regard to the Bosnia operation.\n  Congress and the American people were originally told that the Bosnia \nmission would cost the United States taxpayer some $2 billion; a lot of \nmoney. Then sometime in 1996 that estimate was revised up to $3 \nbillion. But subsequent to the President's announcement extending the \ndeadline for troop withdrawal, we learned that cost estimates have been \nrevised again, and now, according to statements by the Department of \nDefense on this matter, the figure is estimated to be at a minimum, by \nthe middle of 1998, $6.5 billion for this Bosnia operation. Madam \nPresident, that represents a more than threefold increase from the \nadministration's original estimate.\n  To put this in perspective, the United States over the course of 30 \nmonths in Bosnia--in Bosnia alone--expects to have spent an amount \nequivalent to just over half of what our country spends in the entire \nworld in our foreign operations budget for the current fiscal year.\n  What we have here with United States involvement in the Bosnia \noperation is not just mission creep, it has become dollars creep for \nthe United States Congress and the American people. And this is all \nhappening at the very moment, at the very key moment when we are \nstraining hard to eliminate the Federal deficit. We need to plug up the \nhole in the Treasury through which funds continue to pour into the \nBosnia operation.\n  In the supplemental request before us today, the administration is \nasking the Congress now to sign off on an additional $1.5 billion for \nthe Bosnia operation. This request represents only a portion of the \nthreefold increase in the estimate. So it is clear to me--and I think \nit is clear to everyone--that this request will not be the last. It is \njust another installment on this $6.5 billion cost that we already know \nthe Bosnia operation is going to involve.\n  Madam President, what my amendment would do is retain the Bosnia-\nrelated funding in the supplemental, but it would prohibit the use of \nthose funds after the end of the current fiscal year. This amendment \nwould then effectively establish an end date for the deployment of \nground troops in Bosnia. This is the only hope we have to plug up that \nhole in the Treasury.\n  By establishing an end date for the funding of the deployment of U.S. \ntroops, I would like to think that my amendment serves a dual purpose. \nFirst, it prevents mission creep, and, second, I think it would put an \nend to the dollars creep that is beginning to become very troubling \nwith regard to the Bosnia operation.\n  At this point, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 177 to Amendment No. 83\n\n(Purpose: To change the date for prohibition of use of funds for ground \n                         deployment in Bosnia)\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, Senator Feingold's amendment, I think, \ncertainly lays down a marker. Senator Feingold and I cosponsored an \namendment--actually a resolution--earlier that asked that we have more \nparameters around this Bosnia mission because many of us were concerned \nthat we did not know enough about what would be done.\n  As you know, the administration has missed one deadline. It was \nsupposed to be a 1-year mission. That was passed 5 months ago. Now we \nare facing another commitment for a resolution that I think is June 30, \n1998. Not only has the administration said that June 30, 1998, would be \nthe end of the Bosnia mission, but Secretary Cohen has been very firm \nin saying I promise the Congress that is the end, and he is planning \nfor that. I want to make sure that is set in concrete, that Congress \nspeaks on this issue, and that Secretary Cohen has the ability to plan \nby knowing that the funds would be cut off in this supplemental \nappropriation at June 30.\n  Now, Senator Feingold has a September 30, 1997, date in his \namendment, so I am going to ask unanimous consent to call up second-\ndegree amendment No. 177 to the Feingold amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchinson] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 177 to amendment No. 83:  Strike out \n     ``September 30, 1997'' and insert in lieu thereof ``June \n     30, 1998.''\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. This is a simple amendment. It basically says what \nthe administration has promised is going to happen, and that is June \n30, let us go ahead and plan so that we can let everyone know, our \nallies know, that that is a firm date. The President has said so. The \nSecretary of Defense has said so. As Senator Feingold said earlier, I \nthink we have accomplished the mission the President wanted to \naccomplish. I do not think it serves a purpose for us to be taking \nfunds from training, from readiness of our troops for this mission in \nBosnia. In fact, that is why we are here doing the supplemental today. \nWe are trying to put the money that has gone into Bosnia back into the \ndefense budget. We need money for parts. We need money for airplanes. \nWe need money for training and retraining the troops that have come out \nof Bosnia. We need to have the money for the pay raises and the quality \nof life for our military.\n  That money has been spent in Bosnia. I am not going to quibble about \nspending the money in Bosnia because if my troops are there, I want \nthem taken care of. But I do not want to hurt our ability to train the \nother troops for readiness to make sure we are able to fight two \nsimultaneous or nearly simultaneous major regional conflicts.\n  So we have a job to do. That is what the supplemental is for. My \nsecond-degree amendment does in fact put a June 30, 1998, deadline, \nwhich is the promise of the President, onto this amendment. Then I \nthink all of us will be ready to prepare for the eventual withdrawal of \nour troops and that money going into our training and our spare parts \nand our airplanes and all of the factors to make sure that our troops \nare ready to go in case of need.\n  I thank the Chair. I appreciate Senator Feingold taking this \ninitiative\n\n[[Page S4079]]\n\nand for his work on this very important issue.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to commend the Senator from Texas \nfor her leadership regarding the issue of troop deployment in Bosnia, \nand will support her second-degree amendment.\n  The language drafted by the Senator from Texas changes the date of \nthe funding prohibitions in my amendment, as she indicated, from \nSeptember 30, 1997, which is the end of the current fiscal year, to \nJune 30, 1998, which is the date the administration is now using as its \ntarget end date for this mission.\n  Of course, Mr. President, I would have preferred the earlier date, \nthe September 30, 1997 deadline, which would effectively require the \nadministration to begin plans to withdraw at least some of our troops \nstarting tomorrow. That would be the quickest way for the United States \nto get out of a situation that, I think, is getting worse the longer we \nstay there.\n  But I, of course, recognize there are concerns from a number of \nSenators that trying to dismantle an operation the size of the United \nStates troop deployment in Bosnia within a 5-month timeframe would be \ndifficult to accomplish. I also recognize that there is more support in \nthis body for the later date that the Senator from Texas has suggested. \nThere are many Members who are willing to allow the mission to continue \nthrough June of next year if, in exchange for that, they get a solid, \nfirm, and irrevocable commitment to an end date. So I am prepared to \nsupport the end date of June 30, 1998.\n  A point I want to emphasize is that if Congress does not establish an \nend date to our involvement in Bosnia, this mission will continue to \ndrag on and on and on. Therefore, I am willing to accept the second-\ndegree amendment of the Senator from Texas. I congratulate her for her \nefforts in this area. I have joined as a cosponsor of a freestanding \nbill that she is introducing to also help us accomplish this goal. \nRegardless of the result of today's debate, she and I will continue to \npress for an end date to this deployment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the original amendment would prohibit the \nexpenditure of funds after September 30, 1997. There are no funds in \nthe bill for defense to be spent after September 30, 1997. The \namendment of the Senator from Texas would prohibit spending funds after \nJune 30, 1998. No funds in the bill will be expended after June 30, \n1998. So the amendments take on an image perspective, from the point of \nview of this Senator. I am certainly not going to oppose them on that \npoint. But I emphasize that they are just a statement of policy. It \namounts to a sense-of-the-Congress position about the expenditure of \nfunds. They would not be a barrier to the expenditure of funds under \nthe circumstances of this bill.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I know what we are really doing is supplementing the \nmoney already spent on Bosnia. But I appreciate the fact that the \nSenator from Alaska says that this is a sense of the Senate and that it \ndoes say that all of us now are serious about the end strategy, the \npreparation for the end strategy. The President has promised it and the \nSecretary of Defense promised it. Now Congress will, in a sense, be \nsaying, look, this is real, this is now something that we are all in \nagreement on; the time has come for to us make sure that we have that \nend game in sight and that the money for training and quality of life \nwill be there for our troops all along the way.\n  So I appreciate the Senator from Alaska pointing that out. I do agree \nthat it will be a sense of the Senate. I think it will be a unanimous \none, and I think it will be significant.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have been informed that others wish to \nspeak on this amendment. Under the circumstances, I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be temporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 131\n\n (Purpose: To provide funding for the Delaware River Basin Commission)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mr. Biden, Mr. \n     Reid, and Mr. Roth, proposes an amendment numbered 131.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 48, strike lines 15 through 23 and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 306. DELAWARE RIVER BASIN COMMISSION; SUSQUEHANNA RIVER \n                   BASIN COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Compensation of Alternative Members.--During fiscal \n     year 1997 and each fiscal year thereafter, compensation for \n     the alternate members of the Delaware River Basin Commission \n     appointed under the Delaware River Basin Compact (Public Law \n     87-328) and for the alternate members of the Susquehanna \n     River Basin Commission appointed under the Susquehanna River \n     Basin Compact (Public Law 91-575) shall be provided by the \n     Secretary of the Interior.\n       (b) Immediate Contribution.--As soon as practicable after \n     the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the \n     Interior shall make a contribution to each of the Delaware \n     River Basin Commission and the Susquehanna River Basin \n     Commission for fiscal year 1997 an amount of funds that bears \n     the same proportion to the amount of funds contributed for \n     fiscal year 1996 as the number of days remaining in fiscal \n     year 1997 as of the date of enactment of this Act bears to \n     the number 365.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this amendment deals with Delaware and \nSusquehanna River Basin Commissions. It was offered by Senators Biden, \nReid, and Roth. It would direct the Secretary of the Interior to \nprovide compensation to the Federal representative to the Delaware and \nthe Susquehanna River Basin Commissions, without indicating who that \nindividual would be.\n  The second-degree amendment makes the Secretary of the Interior, or \nhis designee, the representative. It does not provide for compensation \nabove that otherwise earned by that employee of the Department of the \nInterior. I trust that both amendments will be before the Senate at the \nsame time. The second one is amendment No. 224.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 224 to Amendment No. 131\n\n (Purpose: A 2nd degree amendment to amendment No. 131 providing that \nthe Federal representative to the River Basin Commissions shall be the \n               Secretary of the Interior or his designee)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for himself and Mr. \n     Domenici, proposes an amendment numbered 224 to Amendment No. \n     131.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike line 5 of amendment No. 131 and all thereafter and \n     insert the following:\n       The Secretary of the Interior or his designee shall serve \n     as the alternate member of the Susquehana River Basin \n     Commission appointed under the Susquehana River Basin Compact \n     (Public Law 91-575) and the alternate member of the Delaware \n     River Basin Commission appointed under the Delaware River \n     Basin Compact (Public Law 87-328).\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I urge adoption of Amendment No. 224.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 224) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the first-\ndegree amendment No. 131.\n  The amendment (No. 131), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n\n[[Page S4080]]\n\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 70\n\n  (Purpose: To set aside certain funds for the project consisting of \n   channel restoration and improvements on the James River in South \n                                Dakota)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mr. Johnson, for \n     himself, and Mr. Daschle, proposes an amendment numbered 70.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 19, line 6, before the period, insert the \n     following: ``: Provided further, That, of the funds \n     appropriated under this paragraph, $10,000,000 shall be used \n     for the project consisting of channel restoration and \n     improvements on the James River authorized by section 401(b) \n     of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 (Public Law \n     99-662; 100 Stat. 4128)''.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I have to my right a satellite image of \nthe James River in South Dakota; on the left, depicting the river in \nits normal course prior to the flooding. On the right is a satellite \nimage showing the current state of the James River--swollen, in places \nmiles across, with water in a circumstance where less than 5 percent of \nthe farmland in the James River Valley, from North Dakota to Nebraska, \nwill be planted this year. This imagery was provided by the aerial data \ncenter in South Dakota. I think it very ably shows the dire \ncircumstances that people in the James River area are facing.\n  Amendment No. 70 is an amendment offered by myself and by my \ncolleague, Senator Daschle, which addresses the extensive damage that \nhas taken place in the James River Valley and which needs to be \naddressed. This amendment addresses the problem, where up to 75 percent \nof the trees in this area have been lost, where bank sloughing and \nlevee sloughing has filled the channel and reduced its capability to \nhandle water. The amendment would provide a $10 million appropriation \nthrough the Corps of Engineers to the James River Water Development \nDistrict to use for the badly needed repair and restoration work on the \nJames River.\n  This is a 25-percent cost share. I am pleased that this amendment has \nbeen cleared and approved by the majority and the minority of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. I thank Senator Chafee and \nSenator Baucus and their staffs for their willingness to work with us \non these amendments. I also thank the appropriators, Senator Stevens \nand Senator Byrd, Senator Domenici and Senator Reid from the Energy and \nWater Appropriations Subcommittees and their staffs, for their \nwillingness to work with us on the language of this amendment, and to \naccept it as part of the supplemental appropriations legislation being \nconsidered by the Senate today.\n  Mr. President, this amendment will go a long way toward restoring the \nJames River and its water-carrying capacity, to restore its wildlife, \nto restore the economic life of the area on either side of this river, \nand it will do a great deal to assure residents of this area that we \nwill not see flooding of this magnitude, of this devastating scope, any \ntime soon again.\n  I had the opportunity to fly over the James River to take an aerial \nsurvey of this area this past month, flying out of Pierre, SD, flying \nover Mitchell, then back over Aberdeen, over Sand Lake Wildlife Refuge \nto gain a full appreciation of the magnitude of this flood.\n  We have a great deal of flood problems in other areas of South \nDakota, but this amendment addresses the dire circumstances that the \npeople in the James River Valley face.\n  I thank, again, my colleagues for their cooperation and their \nassistance with this amendment. It certainly is my hope that we can \nvery expeditiously pass the supplemental appropriations bill, get it to \nthe President's desk for his signature and to get on with rebuilding \nthe lives of our communities, of our businesses and of our families, in \nthis case, in the James River Valley.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time, Mr. President.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 225 to Amendment No. 70\n\n (Purpose: A second degree amendment to amendment No. 70 making funds \n  contingent upon a finding by the Secretary of the Army that channel \n     restoration and improvements of the James River constitute an \n                               emergency)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, the first-degree amendment by Senators \nJohnson and Daschle would provide $10 million of funds provided in this \nact for the flood control and coastal emergencies and would be used for \nchannel restoration and improvements on the James River.\n  My second-degree amendment inserts the requirement that the $10 \nmillion be provided only if the Secretary of the Army determines that \nthe need for channel restoration and improvement constitutes an \nemergency.\n  I urge adoption of the amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the second-degree \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 225) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I send that modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 90), as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 21, strike line 7 through the word ``fire'' on line \n     11 and insert the following: ``For an additional amount for \n     ``Resource Management'', $8,350,000, of which $3,350,000, to \n     remain available until September 30, 1998, is for fish \n     replacement and for technical assistance made necessary by \n     floods and other natural disasters and for restoration of \n     public lands damaged by fire, and of which $5,000,000, to \n     remain available until September 30, 1999, is for payments to \n     private landowners for the voluntary use of private land to \n     store water in restored wetlands.''\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer the following \namendment to S. 672. This amendment involves the New Mexico Department \nof Education's intent to take credit for $30 million of Federal impact \naid funds. I am offering this amendment on behalf of the 331,000 public \nschool children of New Mexico.\n  New Mexico is one of three States in the country which uses an \nequalization formula to distribute educational moneys among its school \ndistricts. Presently, 40 out of New Mexico's 89 school districts \nqualify for $30 million dollars' worth of impact aid. The New Mexico \nDepartment of Education relies on impact aid in calculating the amount \nof State funds which will be used to equalize educational funding among \nall 89 school districts.\n  Without this amendment, the New Mexico Department of Education would \nnot be permitted to consider $30 million of impact aid in its formula \nfor distributing State education moneys among its school districts. The \ninability to consider Federal funds would create an imbalance in the \ndistribution of educational funds between nonimpact aid school \ndistricts and impact aid school districts.\n  This amendment allows the U.S. Department of Education to recognize \nas timely New Mexico's written notice of intent to consider impact aid \npayments in providing State aid to school districts for the 1997-98 \nschool year.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to give some remarks on an \namendment being offered today by myself and by Senator Roberts as well \nas my colleagues from New Mexico, Senator Domenici and Senator \nBingaman.\n  This amendment, which is revenue neutral, is critically important to \neducation in the State of Kansas.\n  It should be noted that this amendment does not cost the Federal \nGovernment any money. In fact, it simply allows the Department of \nEducation in Kansas to grant deductibility in the school finance \nformula for impact aid funding. Without this amendment it is likely \nthat the Kansas taxpayers would have to pay an extra $6 million in \ntaxes to fully fund the State's education programs.\n  This amendment corrects for a potentially very expensive \ntechnicality. I therefore urge the timely consideration of this very \nimportant and time sensitive amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. These technical amendments were passed by the Senate \nunanimously April 16. The bill is now pending in the House. These are \namendments that are deemed to be important and should be considered on \na timely basis. That is why they are being added to the bill at this \ntime.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 144) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. I ask unanimous consent that I may speak as in morning \nbusiness for not to exceed 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/07/senate-section/article/S4068-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4081-S4082]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          GENDER SCHIZOPHRENIA\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, by all accounts, Lt. Kelly Flinn has had a \nremarkable Air Force pilot's career. Becoming an astronaut was her \nchildhood dream; becoming an Air Force pilot was an achievement \naccomplished upon completion of her basic pilot training in December \n1994. She was the most distinguished graduate of her training class, \nrated exceptionally qualified to fly a B-52 bomber, an assignment \nearned from her high class ranking.\n  Today, she is confined to a desk job, stripped of her security \nclearance, grounded, publicly disgraced. On May 20 the Air Force will \ncourt martial her for adultery.\n  The United States military has experienced its share of scandal in \nthe past 5 years. In Aberdeen, MD, a court-martial jury recently \nconvicted an Army drill sergeant of raping six soldiers under his \ncommand. In 1991 the Tailhook scandal rocked the Navy and the Marines. \nIn both instances women were physically abused by their colleagues or \nsuperiors, on military facilities or at military functions. The acts \ncommitted against these women range from the lewd to the violent.\n  Lt. Kelly Flinn stands accused of conducting an affair with a married \nman, a civilian, who lied to her about his martial status. Their \nrelationship was for all intents and purposes a private matter; they \ndid not attend military functions together or while she was in uniform. \nIf she is convicted, she\n\n[[Page S4082]]\n\nwill be grounded forever, dismissed from the Air Force and could even \nspend time in prison.\n  I call attention to this particular case because I believe it speaks \nto the highly publicized gender schizophrenia we are witnessing as the \nmilitary grapples with women's role in our Armed Forces. On one hand, \nwomen have had a traditional, but non-expanding role in the military. \nOn the other hand, we are shocked by what appears to be a pervasive \nresistance to women in the ranks, and the scandals that bear the most \nextreme illustration of this behavior and mindset. Put differently, \nassimilation to the military's rules of conduct is separate and \ndistinct from assimilation of the military's culture.\n  The Armed Forces are institutions premised on order and command, \ngoverned rigidly by rules, written and implied; by codes, some \nmemorized and some unspoken. In some instances however, the strict \napplication of military codes appears to suspend reasonable judgment \nabout the seriousness of the offense committed.\n  In this case, clearly, the punishment does not appear to fit the \ncrime. As Lieutenant Flinn says, ``I fell in love with the wrong man.'' \nFor this offense, which she committed unknowingly because Mr. Zigo lied \nabout being legally separated from his wife, her Air Force career is \nslated to come to an ignoble end.\n  Lets not forget that of those 140 Navy officers involved in Tailhook, \nnone were court-martialed.\n  It is difficult for me as an officer who served for more than 20 \nyears as an Air Force judge advocate, to imagine that no other officer \nat Minot Air Force Base has committed the offense of which Lieutenant \nFlinn stands accused.\n  Wisdom and good judgment seem clearly to demand a dismissal of the \ncriminal charges against Lieutenant Flinn and the substitution of \nnonjudicial or informal sanctions. I trust that the Air Force will \npromptly see the wisdom of this suggestion.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this morning the Federal Communications \nCommission made its ruling on implementation of the Universal Services \nFund. They passed it by a 4-to-0 vote supporting the findings of the \nFederal-State joint board. This decision by them has opened the door to \naffordable Internet access for schools, libraries, and hospitals \nthroughout this country.\n  I want to congratulate Commissioner Hundt and his colleagues on the \nCommission for their leadership and their commitment to putting \ntechnology to work in our schools and in our communities.\n  I also want to congratulate my colleagues, Senator Snowe, Senator \nRockefeller, Senator Exon, and Senator Kerrey, especially, for their \nleadership in proposing the Universal Services discount as a provision \nin the Telecommunications Act which we passed last year.\n  Their hard work on behalf of education technology was critical in \ngetting us to this point.\n  This Universal Services Fund will provide telecommunications \ndiscounts of between 20 and 90 percent, depending in part on the income \nlevels of families in the particular school communities.\n  I have done some back-of-the-envelope calculations about my State, \nand, as far as I can determine, the FCC's decision could mean a \ndiscount of more than 70 percent for many New Mexico schools.\n  Education technology is important to my State. We have all seen how \nit can allow even the smallest or most isolated school across the State \nto develop a level playing field with larger school districts and, in \nfact, with wealthier States.\n  In a cost-effective manner, education technology can provide advanced \ncourses and access to amazing amounts of information for all of our \nstudents.\n  That is why I am very proud. In 1994, we passed an act that I \nproposed entitled ``Technology in Education Act.'' That act will \nprovide $200 million to America's schools for purchase of advanced \ntechnology. It has brought $1.7 million to my home State of New Mexico \nthis year alone.\n  I support the President's request in his budget to increase the \nTechnology Literacy Challenge Fund from $200 million this year to $425 \nmillion next year.\n  The 1994 Technology in Education Act also created the Regional \nTechnology in Education Consortia, these consortia providing schools \nand school districts with the technical assistance that they need to be \nfull participants in this information age.\n  This technical assistance will be more needed than ever now that the \ntelecommunications costs will be less of an obstacle to schools seeking \nconnections to the Internet.\n  Our country has also made some progress in raising the awareness of \nthe need for high academic standards. I serve on the National Education \nGoals Panel, and, as such, I have supported the effort to build a \nnation of learners, and education technology is an important part of \ndoing that.\n  One of the things that we have to do a better job of clearly is \ntraining teachers to be comfortable with this new technology. I believe \nwe need to pursue legislation on this area this Congress. I hope to \nhave a part in that.\n  In my view, the educational technology movement will change the way \npeople teach and learn from now on.\n  Distance learning is more than delivering instruction any time and \nanywhere, although that is an important part of what is involved. It is \nalso about giving teachers the resources that they need to be effective \nas learning coaches. It is about empowering students to explore and \nlearn in ways that are best for them as individuals.\n  Today's FCC ruling is an important step forward. I urge my colleagues \nin the Senate to help ensure that our teachers and schoolchildren have \nthe best technology that we can offer as we prepare them for the 21st \ncentury.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/07/senate-section/article/S4082-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4082-S4104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS AND RESCISSIONS ACT OF 1997\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 83 and Amendment No. 177\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to \namendment No. 83 offered by the Senator from Wisconsin to S. 672, the \nunderlying bill. I gather that Senator Feingold's amendment has been \nsecond-degreed by the Senator from Texas with amendment No. 177.\n\n  In brief, the underlying amendment to the supplemental appropriations \nbill would prohibit the use of funds for ground deployment in Bosnia \nafter September 30 of this year, 1997. The second-degree amendment \nchanges the date of September 30, 1997, to June 30, 1998.\n  Mr. President, after all the debate and discussion here on the floor \nof this Senate for the last 6 years, really after all of the diplomatic \neffort by our Government and other governments in Europe and throughout \nthe world regarding the conflict in Bosnia, after all of the blood that \nhas been spilled in Bosnia with hundreds of thousands of people \ndisplaced and killed, and after the heroic service of the American \nsoldiers that have been part of IFOR and SFOR, joined with soldiers of \nother countries in separating the warring parties in the former \nYugoslavia and stopping the conflict and beginning the peaceful \nreconstruction of that land, it is fundamentally inconceivable to me \nthat the Senate here on an amendment to this supplemental \nappropriations bill would direct the military to pull out of this \nconflict, to walk away, in my opinion, before the job is done, to do \nsomething that is not in the best traditions of American diplomacy, let \nalone the American military.\n  So, Mr. President, I strongly oppose these two amendments.\n  If I may, I would like to take just a few moments to recall with my \ncolleagues some of what has happened in this Chamber, in the former \nYugoslavia, and in the capitals of the world\n\n[[Page S4083]]\n\nregarding this conflict and why it is as important as I think it is \nthat our actions are as constructive and courageous as I believe they \nare. This action would be, by virtue of this amendment, without the \nappropriate hearings by the relevant committees, without hearing from \nour military and civilian leadership, without even hearing from those \nsuch as Ambassador Holbrooke who negotiated the Dayton peace \nagreement--it would be so wrong for us to adopt these amendments.\n  Mr. President, the conflict that broke out in the former Yugoslavia \nwas one of the byproducts, if you will, of the collapse of the former \nSoviet Union. There are times, of course, when a war is over--in this \ncase I speak of the cold war--when a time of instability and \nuncertainty prevails, and there are those who will seek to take \nadvantage of that uncertainty with military force to turn the \ncircumstance to their own benefit. That is the context in which I have \nalways viewed the war that broke out in the former Yugoslavia. It is \nnot, as we have said over and over again, that there are any saints in \nthat particular region of the world.\n  But it was clear to me that there was an intentional act of war, \naggression, and genocide against people based on their religion, for \nthe most part, if they happened to be Bosnian Muslims, by Serbia. That \nraged on and on--not stopped by the powers in Europe--raged on and on, \nas we witnessed continually on our television sets one horror after \nanother. It was hard to believe that in the heart of Europe once again \nso soon after the end of the Second World War we were seeing aggression \nand genocide, even concentration camps for some period of time.\n  We debated this here at great length in this Chamber. The United \nStates, I think for reasons that were misplaced, I believe, in 1991 \nbecame part of imposing an arms embargo on the parties in the former \nYugoslavia. The aim was to try to avoid conflict or to avoid the spread \nof conflict by keeping arms out of there--apparently well intentioned. \nYet, the effect of it was horrendous and devastatingly unfair because \nthe Serbs, by virtue of the division of the country, retained most of \nthe war-fighting capacity and armaments manufacturing capacity of the \nformer Yugoslavia. The Bosnians did not have that capacity.\n\n  So, not only did the world stand by as the war went on and not \nintervene, but we were prohibiting the Bosnians, the Muslims, from \nobtaining the arms that they needed to defend their families, their \nneighbors, and their country.\n  Former Senate majority leader, Senator Dole, led the effort to raise \nthe arms embargo. It was a bipartisan effort in which I was honored to \njoin with him in which we contended, if you will, with two successive \nadministrations, one of each political party.\n  Finally, after repeated attempts, in the spring of 1995 we were able \nto obtain a majority in this Chamber to lift the arms embargo. This was \nin response to one story after another of horror in Srebrenica, in all \nof that city, mass slaughter of people, discovery of concentration \ncamps with bodies all around. And after that embargo was lifted, an act \nof real leadership by this administration, by the President, in calling \nfor NATO strikes, which so many of us here continued to say, ``Strike \nfrom the air. Make the Serbs pay for their aggression.'' No one is \ndoing anything to stop them. No one is doing anything which would \nindicate that the rest of the world cares about what is happening there \nor will care if this once again becomes a wider war in Europe, bringing \nin the neighbors all around, including the potential to bring in two of \nour allies in NATO, namely, Greece and Turkey.\n  Force was used. The Serbs responded. The Dayton peace began. \nAmbassador Holbrooke was sent in by the President in one of the most \nextraordinary exercises in diplomatic leadership that we have seen in \nrecent times, where the Dayton peace accord was signed leading to the \nso-called IFOR presence in Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, we have been at a fork in the road in Bosnia before, \nforks that would have, if we took one turn, left the people of Bosnia \nto their own devices, the outcome to be decided by brute strength and \nsavagery unknown in Europe for 50 years, risking the expansion of that \nviolence to other parts of Europe with possibly much greater harm to \nour vital interests there. The other fork is the one we ultimately \ntook, to try to stop the violence and bring peace, order, and justice \nback to the former Yugoslavia.\n  The Dayton accords happened because the United States finally \nexercised its leadership and, with NATO, used collective power to bring \nthe conflict to an end. IFOR was created to assure that territorial and \nother military-related provisions of the Dayton agreement were \nachieved. But although stopping the fighting was a necessary condition \nfor achieving the goal of assuring the continuity of the single State \nof Bosnia and Herzegovina, it was never considered as a sufficient \ncondition for achieving that goal.\n  Unfortunately, it was this part of the agreement that received the \nvast majority of the attention and debate in the United States. \nAmerican opponents of U.S. participation made dire predictions of \ndisaster and casualties, and the result was a very narrow mission \nstatement and an arbitrary 1-year time limit for IFOR deployment. I \nopposed that 1-year time limit because I believed that only when IFOR's \nsuccess could be combined with the implementation of the civilian \nelements of the agreement at Dayton--rehabilitation of infrastructure, \neconomic reconstruction, political and constitutional institutions in \nBosnia-Herzegovina, promotion and respect for human rights, return of \ndisplaced persons and pursuit of indicted war criminals--would it be \npossible for us to end our participation there.\n  When some have started to talk about withdrawing on June 30, 1998, I \nsaid again I hope that we will be in a position to do that, but has it \never made sense in a military involvement to announce the date by which \nwe are withdrawing, leaving those who would benefit from our \nwithdrawal, who would try to take advantage of it, to lay in wait until \nthat withdrawal, until that withdrawal which would leave them a clear \nfield to proceed back to war and savagery and the threat of a wider \nconflict which inevitably will cost us more than we have spent to stop \nthe conflict and prevent that wider war in the former Yugoslavia.\n  So where are we, Mr. President, in the execution of the tasks we set \nat Dayton? I would say we are part of the way to our goal. We have \nofficially declared IFOR successful and its mission complete. The first \npart of that task was accomplished magnificently by our forces. The \nviolence stopped, an environment of relative stability emerged and not \none IFOR member, thank God, was killed as a result of military action. \nThis performance was due to the skill and professionalism of the IFOR \nsoldiers, to the reputation accorded NATO and its soldiers and \nultimately to the sine quo non of all of this, which is American \nleadership.\n  But executing the essential second part of the task has not been as \nsuccessful. The progress in rebuilding Bosnia has been slow, due in \npart to the difficulty of overcoming the antagonism engendered by a \ntragic war and the effects of a creation of ethnic areas, but it is \nalso due to the fact that rebuilding a country is much harder than \nstopping the fighting, and we have given far less focus and far less \nsupport for the difficult tasks necessary to rebuild Bosnia than we \ngave to the military tasks.\n  The mission of IFOR was very narrowly stated, and we avoided many \nopportunities for IFOR to support some of the most important civilian \nparts of the agreement. Most notable to me was our failure to direct \nIFOR or some international body to apprehend the indicted war criminals \nthat bear such a large part of the responsibility for the afflictions \nof this fated land, the freedom of which, flaunting the indictment of \nan internationally constituted war crimes tribunal, will prevent \ngenuine peace in Bosnia from ever occurring. These criminals are still \nat large. They can be seen, particularly Mr. Karadzic, one of the main \nperpetrators of the war crimes, indicted by an established \ninternational tribunal, seen almost daily controlling so much of what \nhappens in the Serb part of Bosnia, still at large. And that freedom \nremains a profoundly serious impediment to attempts to build a civil \nsociety with functioning democratic institutions.\n  Still we have made progress. The efforts of Ambassador Holbrooke \nreduced\n\n[[Page S4084]]\n\nbut clearly did not eliminate the deleterious effects of the war \ncriminals. Elections for national leaders have been held. The \ngovernment is functioning. So we have reason to be extremely grateful \nfor the military and political successes that have been achieved. These \nsuccesses have been extraordinarily important.\n\n  Today we come to another fork in the road as a result of these \namendments not considered at length by this Chamber, certainly not yet. \nAs before, one fork would leave the people of Bosnia to their own \ndevices regardless of what the condition on the ground was, first on \nSeptember 30 of this year, an extraordinarily early date, and then on \nJune 30, 1998. If we take the fork that leads to withdrawal on a date \ncertain, it is axiomatic, it is without doubt that our NATO allies will \nfollow us on the way out. They have said repeatedly: We went in \ntogether; we are going to go out together. This will probably lead \neither to the renewal of violence, bloodshed, genocide, rule of those \nwilling to deploy the most savage force. At least I would guess it will \nlead to partition.\n  Some will say that does not matter, but I believe it matters a great \ndeal, not just to the people of Bosnia but to stability in Europe, \nwhich has always mattered to the United States--in fact, drew us into \ntwo world wars in this century at the cost of thousands of American \nlives.\n  I have always seen our involvement in Bosnia as preventive. It is an \nattempt to prevent a wider conflict that would cost us more in blood, \nAmerican blood, American lives and, yes, American money. As Ambassador \nHolbrooke recently pointed out in a letter in Foreign Affairs:\n\n       A single Bosnia with two entities was the essential core of \n     the Dayton agreements. The boundary line was to be similar to \n     a boundary between two American States rather than a boundary \n     between two nations. But the Serbs were at Dayton under \n     duress and few expected they would voluntarily accept such a \n     concept. Indeed, they have acted to undermine execution of \n     the political and economic tasks, and are trying to turn the \n     boundary line into a line of partition and ultimately into \n     one of complete separation.\n\n  Mr. President, why is partition, which I would see as the least \ndevastating result of a hasty American retreat from Bosnia, why is it \nwrong? In my opinion, it is wrong morally, strategically and \npolitically. Partition of Bosnia would be morally wrong because it \nwould reward the aggression and the genocide that all of us have \ndecried. But it would also be dangerous.\n  Partition is strategically wrong because it contains within it seeds \nof violence. The history of places where partition has occurred is sad \nand bloodied, and they all continue to draw us into their sadness and \nblood. Ireland and Cyprus are examples that still threaten America and \nthreaten the international order as a result of partition after many \ndecades. The problems engendered by partition in Bosnia would, in my \nopinion, be even worse because Bosnia would end up partitioned not just \ninto two parts but into three parts--the Muslim part, the Serbian part, \nand the Croatian part. The endless battles over the partition lines \nwould have a high probability of impacting others in the neighborhood--\nAlbania, Greece, Bulgaria and Macedonia. And partition is particularly \npolitically wrong because it would send a profoundly undesirable signal \nto ethnic activists in other places where boundaries were arbitrarily \ndrawn and which politically divide historic ethnic groups, and that is \nthat aggression will be rewarded with partition.\n  Mr. President, if we were to withdraw in June 1998, let alone \nSeptember 30, 1997, without successful implementation of Dayton's civil \ntasks, the Serb strategy will have succeeded. The fact is that, setting \nthese amendments aside, soon we will conduct the first of the periodic \nassessments of SFOR, the follow-on force to IFOR. While these \nassessments might be envisioned by some as opportunities to determine \nif we can withdraw our forces even faster, I believe we should use them \nin an orderly, thoughtful way as opportunities to conduct a real debate \nabout how we can successfully conclude all the tasks laid out at Dayton \nand achieve the objective we agreed on: A single Bosnia, where peace, \njustice, and the rule of law prevail.\n  Mr. President, there are lives on the line here and they are American \nlives as well as Bosnian lives. We ought not after the money we have \ninvested, the lives we have risked, the conflict we have stopped, the \nblood we have saved, the order we have returned to Europe, the larger \nwar we have avoided, by virtue of an amendment not heard by the \nrelevant committees direct the end of what up until this time has been \na signal act of American leadership, American courage, American \npreventive diplomacy, American force used in the interest of peace and \norder and justice.\n  So I strongly oppose the amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do \nthe same. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to both of \nthese amendments, notwithstanding my great respect for the Senator from \nWisconsin, and I mean that sincerely. I have great respect for him. But \nI think this is another in a series of bad ideas this floor has \nproduced over the last 5 years with regard to Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, I echo the sentiments expressed by my friend from \nConnecticut. Let me say it in a slightly different way. In my view, we \ncould have avoided the tragedy, the extent of the tragedy in Bosnia, \nhad we the courage, the foresight to lift and strike 4 years ago, had \nwe stood up to that war criminal Milosevic in Serbia and had we made \nclear to Tudjman in Croatia that we would broker no alternative but \ntheir ceasing and desisting. Every time America has spoken and followed \nup its speech with action, we have produced the results that we \nsuggested would occur.\n  It is a sad commentary, Mr. President, that there is no leadership in \nEurope. There is no leadership in Europe. And the ability of the \nEuropeans to get together and solve the problem in their own backyard \nand keep it from spreading into other people's front yards is \nnonexistent based upon their actions for the previous 5 years, until \nthe United States led, but led at a moment and a time when our options \nwere reduced relative to the ones that existed a year or two earlier.\n\n  The Senator from Connecticut and I initially never argued that \nAmerican troops should be put on the ground in Bosnia. We felt very \nstrongly that could have been avoided had we used our airpower, had we \nlifted sanctions to allow the Bosnian Government--that at that moment \nwas still multi-ethnic--to have a chance to fight for itself. But that \nis water under the bridge. That is past. We are left with Dayton, which \nwas making the best out of a bad circumstance. The end result of Dayton \nis that we will have invested about $5 billion by September of this \nyear, plus America's prestige and American forces on the ground in \nBosnia.\n  I must tell you straight up, I am opposed even to the \nadministration's announcement that we withdraw and have a drop-dead \ndate for June 1998. But I think it borders on the ridiculous for the \nU.S. Senate to instruct the President that we must withdraw as early as \nthe initial proposal called for, in September.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield right there?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will be happy to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask the Senator if he would kindly do us the favor and \nnot turn this into a motion to instruct. It merely says ``no funds can \nbe spent after June 30, 1998.'' I say to the Senator from Delaware, \nthere are no funds available after September 30, 1997, under this bill. \nThe amendment is merely a sense-of-the-Senate resolution in disguise.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Alaska. He is \nabsolutely correct. What he has said, as I translate it, is this \namendment does not mean anything in the legislative sense.\n  But I promise you, I promise you, if this amendment passes today, it \nwill mean something to the Republika Srpska; it will mean something in \nMostar; it will mean something in Belgrade; it will mean something in \nthe Balkans; it will mean something in Paris; it will mean something in \nMoscow. It will mean something where it matters, and what matters is \nwhat the rest of the world believes our resolve is.\n\n[[Page S4085]]\n\n  We sometimes do not focus closely enough, and I acknowledge I do not, \nas well. But we have a situation in Croatia right now where the \nPresident of Croatia is very ill. To call him a very strong man is \nputting it mildly, and it connotes everything that goes along with \nstrongman, a guy who is no box of chocolates. There is already a battle \nfor succession going on in Croatia between the nationalists, those who \nto this day wish to see the partition of Bosnia, and those who are \ndemocrats, who want to become part of the West.\n  If we announce now that the U.S. Senate want American troops out of \nthere, either this September or next June, we give succor to those in \nCroatia who will argue the following: ``With the United States gone, no \npeace can hold, partition is the answer, and we are going to get our \npiece.''\n  The same is taking place in Belgrade. Milosevic is a war criminal. He \nis a thug. Remember the history of why this war took place in the first \nplace. What happened there was, in effect, a referendum as to whether \nor not Bosnia would stay part of Yugoslavia. There was a vote. The \nvoters said we want to set up an independent nation-state. They set it \nup, recognized by the United Nations, and Milosevic sent the Yugoslav \nNational Army across the river. He supplied and gave cover for the use \nof force against the Muslims and Croats, and he instituted a war of \naggression. He and his cronies instituted a policy of ethnic cleansing, \na phrase I do not think any of us ever thought we would hear again. \nThey actually talked about it out loud. That was their policy.\n  Mr. President, our good friend, Mr. Milosevic, is on his last legs in \nBelgrade. Why, at this moment, are we going to indicate to him that \nthere is a consensus in this country that the United States should walk \naway? Why are we going to do that now? What possible good would that \ndo?\n\n  Secretary Cohen, a man we all respect, has guaranteed we will be out \nof Bosnia in June 1998. He has said this in private meetings, in \nprivate arguments with me, and in public discussions. The President has \nsaid it. Madeleine Albright has acknowledged it. As I said, I think \nthat, in and of itself, is a mistake. For us to come along now and \nannounce to the world that we are not going to appropriate moneys is a \nmistake--and I acknowledge these are moneys we could not appropriate \nanyway. But they are not going to understand all that. All they are \ngoing to understand is that the United States of America, the U.S. \nSenate, has told the President he has to get out of there.\n  I echo the phrase my friend from Connecticut used. He said, when has \nit ever made sense for us, in a circumstance where there is the \npotential for or the immediate past presence of war, to announce that \nwe are going to leave and give a lead time to that announcement? When \nhas that ever benefited us?\n  Our only hope for the peace process is to continue to have an \ninternational force remain in Bosnia through June 1998. At least \nthrough June 1998. By then, several things will have shaken themselves \nout, one of which is the political situation in Croatia and the other \nis the political situation in Serbia.\n  I am going to refrain from doing what I want to do, speak in more \ndepth about this, because my friend from Alaska is technically right. \nHe is right that this does not mean anything legislatively. I just want \nit to be known that there are voices in the Senate that think this is a \nvery bad policy. When this amendment is written about, when this is \ndiscussed in other capitals of the world, they should understand not \nall of us share this view.\n  This is not a sound policy. At this moment, it is my hope and \nexpectation that the administration is leaning on our European allies \nto make it clear to them that we are willing to support a European-led \nfollow-on force in Bosnia, composed of European troops, after the SFOR \nmandate ends. Remember what we said: We are going to remove American \nforces from Bosnia. We did not say we are disengaging in every military \nsense from Bosnia. The President did not say that, thank God, and I \nhope he will not say that.\n  What we should be doing now, and what I hope we are doing now, is \nmeeting with our NATO allies to explain to them that we are willing to \nhave a forward force based in Hungary to back them up. We are willing \nto use our airpower and our intelligence apparatus to assist them. We \nare willing to use the capacity of our naval forces in the Adriatic to \nhelp maintain peace and security in Bosnia. This takes time. This \namendment undercuts every possible option that exists between now and \nJune 1998 by announcing now that the U.S. Senate does not support the \ncontinued presence of the United States of America in that part of the \nworld.\n  I do not fully understand what both my friend from Wisconsin and the \nSenator from Texas are saying. I acknowledge the Senator from Alaska is \ncorrect. This is meaningless in a legislative sense. But I do not \nunderstand what my two friends hope to accomplish here. Their amendment \nsays, ``Provided further, that none of the funds made available under \nthis Act may be obligated or expended for operations or activities of \nthe armed forces relating to Bosnia ground deployment after June 30, \n1998.''\n  Does that mean we cannot use our intelligence apparatus? Does that \nmean we cannot have forward deployment in Hungary? Does that mean we \ncannot use our airpower? Maybe it does. Maybe it does not. But I tell \nyou one thing: To merely suggest that we are going to pull out U.S. \nground forces is a bit disingenuous as well.\n  So, again, I do not want to take any more time of the Senate except \nto say that this is a well-intended, very bad idea. It is a very bad \nidea. It does not serve U.S. interests. It does not serve us or aid us \nin our ability to lead an alliance in carrying out its responsibilities \nin Europe, in Bosnia. And it does not lend any support to those in both \nSerbia and in Croatia who are trying to change the political landscape \nof both those countries, which will have an impact upon the \ncircumstance in Bosnia.\n  So, again, I say as I yield the floor, with due respect to my friend \nfrom Wisconsin, I think this is a serious mistake. I hope the Senate \nwill not go along with this suggestion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I have to my right a satellite image of \nthe James River in South Dakota; on the left, depicting the river in \nits normal course prior to the flooding. On the right is a satellite \nimage showing the current state of the James River--swollen, in places \nmiles across, with water in a circumstance where less than 5 percent of \nthe farmland in the James River Valley, from North Dakota to Nebraska, \nwill be planted this year. This imagery was provided by the aerial data \ncenter in South Dakota. I think it very ably shows the dire \ncircumstances that people in the James River area are facing.\n  Amendment No. 70 is an amendment offered by myself and by my \ncolleague, Senator Daschle, which addresses the extensive damage that \nhas taken place in the James River Valley and which needs to be \naddressed. This amendment addresses the problem, where up to 75 percent \nof the trees in this area have been lost, where bank sloughing and \nlevee sloughing has filled the channel and reduced its capability to \nhandle water. The amendment would provide a $10 million appropriation \nthrough the Corps of Engineers to the James River Water Development \nDistrict to use for the badly needed repair and restoration work on the \nJames River.\n  This is a 25 percent cost share. I am pleased that this amendment has \nbeen cleared and approved by the majority and the minority of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. I thank Senator Chafee and \nSenator Baucus and their staffs for their willingness to work with us \non these amendments. I also thank the appropriators, Senator Stevens \nand Senator Byrd, Senator Domenici and Senator Reid from the Energy and \nWater Appropriations Subcommittees and their staffs, for their \nwillingness to work with us on the language of this amendment, and to \naccept it as part of the supplemental appropriations legislation being \nconsidered by the Senate today.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to take this \nopportunity to respond to remarks in opposition to Senator Hutchison's \namendment by the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from \nDelaware.\n\n[[Page S4086]]\n\n  Let me, first of all, reiterate a couple of points about my attitude \nand the attitude of most Senators about this amendment and its purpose. \nFirst of all, no one can even begin to criticize what a wonderful job \nour troops and our military have done in Bosnia. In fact, all we can do \nis offer praise and gratitude. I feel that way, in particular, about \nthe wonderful job some of our folks from Wisconsin, whom I have had a \nchance to speak with about this, have done.\n  Second, I want to reiterate that I believe this mission has \naccomplished some very, very positive things. It certainly has not \naccomplished all that would have been hoped. But to suggest somehow \nthat this mission has not accomplished anything in terms of saving \nlives and in terms of trying to resolve the situation would be wrong, \nand I do not suggest that.\n  I also want to acknowledge that the two Senators who spoke in \nopposition to the amendment, the Senator from Connecticut and the \nSenator from Delaware, are two of the great leaders on this issue, two \nof the most compassionate Senators when it comes to being concerned \nabout the tragedy in Bosnia, and I learned that fast when I came here \nto the United States Senate. I wish that we could be in agreement on \nthis particular issue about how long this mission should continue, \nbecause we have been allies on many aspects of the Bosnia operation in \nthe past.\n  In fact, Mr. President, I just remind my colleagues that when I \narrived here in 1993, the first resolution I ever submitted, was to \nsimply lift the arms embargo that was being enforced against all the \nareas in the region, all the people in the region, but, in particular, \nthe Bosnian Muslims.\n  The reason I came to that position was because of the inspiration of \nthe Senator from Delaware who had taken the lead in developing the \nconcept of lifting the arms embargo prior to my arrival in the Senate. \nWhen I got here, I joined with other Senators, in fact, I think I was \nthe first one in that Congress to introduce a resolution to lift the \narms embargo. The Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from \nDelaware and I and others all got up and talked about the important \nright of self-defense, the importance of people being able to defend \nthemselves. We thought that they should be given arms to defend \nthemselves, the right that they have, I believe, under unalienable \nhuman rights and under article 51 of the U.N. Charter to defend \nthemselves. That is where many of us wanted to go.\n  As the Senator from Connecticut indicated, we tried very hard. We won \na vote on the Senate floor on a bipartisan basis, although, \nregrettably, it was not carried all the way through. I still believe \nthat was the best answer to this situation. But, we did not get that \ndone in a timely manner and, as a result, I think we were essentially \nforced into the Dayton accord. I think some of our European allies made \nsure, in effect, that we would be forced into sending troops into the \nregion.\n  So when many of us spoke about the importance of lifting the arms \nembargo, we discussed that it was the right thing for the Bosnians. But \nit was a way to prevent us from becoming ensnared in a military \noperation that we would not be able to get out of, where American men \nand women would be forced into a situation where an end-game or \ndeparture justification would be difficult to find.\n  That is how we got to where we are today, unfortunately. That is why \nI have offered this amendment, and I believe it is one of the reasons \nthe Senator from Texas has offered her second-degree amendment.\n  When the Senator from Connecticut--and I say this with all respect, \nbecause I simply know no one who is more concerned about the situation, \nand I know at a very personal level as well, as a Senator, that he \ncares as deeply, perhaps more deeply than any other Senator about what \nis going on in Bosnia--but when he says it is inconceivable that we \nwould try to do this on this bill in this way, let me suggest what I \nconsider to be inconceivable.\n\n  It is inconceivable to me that we would not have a clear debate on \nthis issue when the initial understanding that was given to the \nAmerican people about this is that it would cost $2 billion and be over \nwithin 1 year. I took every opportunity I could in the Foreign \nRelations Committee and in every other meeting that I had on this \nsubject to ask the question: Is it truly the intent to be out of there \nin 1 year? And the answer was always yes. Even when it was just a few \nmonths before the December 1996 deadline, I asked many leading military \nand State Department officials about this. I said, ``Is it going to be \nover in a year?'' And they said, ``Well, yes, give or take a few \nweeks.''\n  The American people and the Congress were led over and over to \nbelieve that this was a 1-year operation.\n  Then, really quite quietly, it was extended. It was extended by 18 \nmonths beyond that deadline, to a minimum of June of 1998. And even \nthen, when I asked whether or not that is the end of the line for this \noperation, the remark has been simply, ``We hope so, we think so, we \nthink it's possible.''\n  What is also inconceivable to me is that we add another $1.5 billion \nin this supplemental bill and then tell the American people what we are \non track to do is to spend not just $2 billion--in fact, we are already \nin for $3 billion--but that the minimum estimate now is $6.5 billion \nthrough the middle of 1998. To me it is somewhat inconceivable that we \nwould simply move in that direction without a full and thorough debate \nwith regard to these numbers.\n  Where is the public accountability on this? Where is the \ncongressional accountability with regard to the expenditure of those \nkinds of funds and with regard to the duration of an operation that was \npromised to be over within 1 year?\n  Others have suggested today that somehow this is an unprecedented \nkind of amendment, but all I can do is refer my colleagues to what we \ndid when it came to the Somalia operation. The distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia offered an amendment, which we voted on on October \n15, 1993, that provided for a cutoff date for the expenditure of funds \nwith regard to Somalia.\n  No one knows better the power of the purse of the Congress than the \nSenator from West Virginia, and he knows that that is the heart and the \nsoul of congressional power when it comes to military operations. Both \nthe Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from Delaware voted for \nthe amendment that Senator Byrd offered that would cut off the funds \nfor Somalia by a date certain. We signaled what we were going to do in \nthat situation --we signaled it clearly--because we knew that it was \ntime for us to get out.\n  You know what is sad about that one. In the Somalia case, we waited \nuntil something bad happened. We waited until a tragedy occurred. We \nwaited until we had essentially no choice but to extricate ourselves \nfrom a situation that became a mess. I am very pleased to be able to \nsay today that we are not in that situation yet in Bosnia. I hope we \nnever will be. But to wait for that moment to signal clearly when we \nintend to get out is the worst thing we can do in terms of our \ncredibility in the world. To wait for a moment like that and then just \nrun out of Bosnia because the public support may evaporate is the worst \nthing we can do in terms of our credibility. I do not think any of us \nregard what happened in Somalia as one of the finest hours in our \ndiplomatic, military or foreign policy moments.\n  So, Mr. President, let me simply say that this is a situation where \nwe all have to decide whether we are just going to let this $1.5 \nbillion go forward without asking serious questions. The Senators who \nare opposed to me and Senator Hutchison on this said we have not had \nproper hearings on our amendment. They have indicated they want to have \na real debate on this matter.\n  That is the whole point.\n  We have not had real hearings on this. We have not had a real debate \non whether we should spend $6.5 billion on Bosnia by the middle of 1998 \nor on the possibility of even more. We have not had a real national \ndiscussion about whether we should go forward with this. I think the \nAmerican people and the Congress should be engaged in that kind of \ndiscussion.\n  So let me conclude by saying that I think this amendment is \nappropriate. It does not go too far. It does not hamstring our \nmilitary. There are opportunities for providing more funds later, if \nneeded, for extending the operation, if needed. All this does is signal \nthat neither this body nor this country is going\n\n[[Page S4087]]\n\nto simply let this continue without any real consideration and public \ndebate of where we are heading--especially since the operation is \nalready costing $6.5 billion and has already more than doubled the \nduration that was originally promised.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we should be signaling two things relative \nto Bosnia, in my judgment. The first is what this resolution would \nsignal, which is that it is our intent to have our ground combat forces \nout of Bosnia by June of next year. It is important that we send that \nsignal; it is important that we send that signal clearly. But it is \nalso important that we do an additional thing, and that is that we let \nour European allies and the world know that in the event that there is \na need for a follow-on force after June of 1998, that it is the \nEuropeans who must provide that follow-on force and it is not our \nintention to participate with ground troops in that follow-on force.\n  Will a follow-on force be necessary? I think it will be. I have \nvisited Bosnia. I have spent a lot of time there. In my judgment, there \nis no way that millions of refugees can be repatriated to their homes, \nthat war criminals can be captured and tried by June of next year. If \nthere is no follow-on force in Bosnia, the likelihood is that the \nprogress which has been made will disintegrate and will evaporate, and \nthen what we have done in Bosnia will have been to no avail.\n  We have accomplished some very important things in Bosnia, and we \nshould try, if we can, to protect them, but--and here I agree with the \nSenator from Wisconsin--we should carry out our mission, which ends in \nJune of 1998, signal to our allies clearly and tell them in advance \nthat it is our intention that our ground combat forces will be out of \nthere in June of 1998, but that we would expect that they would show \nsome leadership under a new component of NATO, called the European \nSecurity and Defense Identity, to provide the follow-on forces which \nmight be needed after June of 1998.\n  Can we do both of those at one time? Can we say that it is our \nintention that our own forces on the ground leave by June of 1998 but \nthat we expect there is a need or a likely need for a follow-on force \nand we would be supportive of that force--without having our own troops \non the ground--through logistics and intelligence and other means of \nsupporting a European follow-on force as part of NATO? Can we signal \nboth of those things at once? I believe we can. I believe we should. I \nbelieve this resolution does not do that, and that is the difficulty \nwith this resolution.\n  Because of the nature of postcloture that we are in, it is restricted \nin language to what it says, which, as the Senator from Alaska points \nout, really has no meaning whatsoever since none of these funds will be \nspent, in any event, after October 1 of 1997. They cannot be and are \nnot going to be.\n  So in one sense this resolution has no legislative meaning \nwhatsoever, through no fault of my friend from Wisconsin, by the way. \nHe had no choice. In order to be germane in a post-cloture situation, \nhe had to phrase it this way.\n  But the signal that he wishes to send is an important signal, one \nthat I happen to want to join him in sending, providing it can be sent \nwith a second signal which is so critical that we send, which is that a \nnew initiative inside of NATO be utilized for any follow-on force, and \nwe are willing to support that or at least are open to supporting that \nEuropean initiative inside of NATO.\n  I want to spend just a couple of moments on that initiative. It is \nnot well known. It is an important initiative. The Europeans have asked \nfor additional leadership in NATO for many, many years.\n  Finally, at the June 1996 Berlin North Atlantic Council ministerial \nmeeting, there was a new initiative adopted, as part of NATO. It is \ncalled the European Security and Defense Identity initiative [ESDI]. \nWhat it does, it permits the European NATO nations--these are our \nallies in NATO--with NATO consent, to carry out operations under the \npolitical control and strategic direction of the Western European \nUnion, using NATO assets and NATO capabilities.\n  So using NATO assets and capabilities under the strategic direction \nof the Western European Union, a European initiative is being put in \nplace as we speak.\n  What NATO has agreed to do is to identify the types of what are \ncalled separable but not separate capabilities, assets, headquarters, \nand command positions that would be required to command and conduct \nthese Western European Union-led operations and which could be made \navailable, subject to unanimous consent agreement in the North Atlantic \nCouncil.\n  In addition, NATO agreed to develop appropriate multinational \nEuropean command arrangements within NATO to command and conduct the \nWestern European Union-led operations.\n  And, finally, in support of these arrangements, NATO agreed to \nconduct, at the request of and in coordination with the Western \nEuropean Union, military planning and exercises for illustrative \nmissions which were identified by the Western European Union. Included \nin those missions are humanitarian assistance, conflict prevention, \npeacekeeping, and peace enforcement operations. All from peacekeeping \nto peace enforcement are included in the missions which are now being \norganized.\n  The ability of our European allies to work together so professionally \nin Bosnia, with French and British commanders responsible for two of \nthe three multinational division sectors and with the overall American \ncommander having a multinational staff, convinces me that there is no \nreason to question the ability of a European-led follow-on force to \nsucceed in Bosnia. There is no reason, either, why the Partnership for \nPeace nations should not be included as they have been in Bosnia in \nboth IFOR and SFOR.\n  So we have a mechanism now which is being planned to provide, or \nwhich could provide, to be more accurate, the follow-on force to be \nsure that peace does not unravel in the European neighborhood. The \nUnited States should remain involved with logistics, intelligence, and \nother support activities. But under this resolution there is no \nprovision for that.\n  This resolution, because of the way it had to be phrased, ends up \nsaying that none of these funds can be obligated or expended for the \nactivities of armed forces relating to Bosnia ground deployment.\n  Well, should we not consider at least a provision of intelligence \nsupport, logistics support, other support activities for a European \nfollow-on force? I think we ought to.\n  During the Armed Services Committee hearing in February on the \ndefense budget, Secretary Cohen responded to my questions by stating \nthe following:\n\n       I would agree with you that following our departure in June \n     of 1998, I believe there has to be some sort of force \n     in Bosnia. I do not think there is any possibility of \n     ending so many decades, if not centuries, of ethnic \n     conflict in a matter of two or three years.\n  Secretary Cohen continued:\n\n       So I think some international type of a force will be \n     necessary. I agree with you that the ESDI, the so-called \n     European Security and Defense Identity, is something that is \n     very worthwhile to pursue.\n\n  And he added:\n\n       I think it is something we should pursue and make it very \n     clear we are leaving and that something will have to replace \n     it, and hopefully it will be something along the lines of the \n     ESDI.\n\n  That is a double message, not a single message.\n  The amendment before us, regrettably, has the first of those two \nmessages only and is not able to cover the second part of that message. \nThat is the difficulty with the pending resolution, in my judgment.\n  General Shalikashvili, who was there with Secretary Cohen, said the \nfollowing:\n\n       Following our departure in June 1998, it is very possible \n     that a follow-on force will be required. I think a European \n     force under the WEU is certainly an appropriate candidate for \n     that.\n\n  So he, too, reached the same kind of conclusion.\n  So, Mr. President, I think that we should not at this time state in \nresolution form or any other form that we will not be willing to play a \nsupporting role in Bosnia after June 1998. Because, after this \noperation is, hopefully, turned over to our NATO allies, assuming it \ncontinues at all, which I think is\n\n[[Page S4088]]\n\nlikely then acting under the Western European Union, they, I believe, \nwill need this kind of support--not our combat forces on the ground--\nbut those other kinds of support. And that is the complexity which is \nnot reflected in this resolution.\n  Finally, it is my intent during the consideration of the defense \nauthorization bill to be offering language along the lines that I have \njust described. I hope that at that time we can have the kind of full \ndebate on the future of our forces in Bosnia that this issue really \nrequires.\n  During the authorization bill, that debate can take into \nconsideration both the need, in my judgment, to make the clear \nstatement to our allies in Europe that it is our intent to be out of \nthere in June 1998, but can also outline what we would be willing to do \nshould they determine to stay on after June of 1998 in Bosnia. And \nwhile it is complex, it is essential. While it has two points to the \nmessage, both points are, nonetheless, essential.\n  So I think, because this resolution is too narrow in its scope and \nsends only one of two messages and it is essential that both be sent \nsimultaneously, that it would be a mistake for us to adopt this \nresolution at this time in this form. But I would look forward to my \nfriend from Wisconsin working with us in the Armed Services Committee \nto design a resolution which does contain the message that he has in \nhis amendment but also the second part of that message as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be very brief because I think I may be the last \nperson to address this amendment tonight.\n  I first want to acknowledge the contribution made in the debate by \nSenators Levin, Lieberman, Biden, and others who spoke so eloquently \nabout the reasons why this amendment is ill-advised. I have great \nrespect and admiration for the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin and \nthe Senator from Texas, but I must say, passage of this amendment, as \nwell intended as it might be, is unwise. First, as the Senator from \nAlaska has noted, this amendment has no real legislative effect because \nit appropriates money only for this fiscal year ending September 30, \n1997. But it does have a profound effect in the message it sends to \npeople around the world, especially in that part of the world most \ndirectly affected by our actions and by our intentions.\n\n  For us to say unequivocally that regardless of circumstance, \nregardless of the situation, regardless of whether or not there is \npeace and the kind of stability we have been able to achieve now in the \nlast couple of years, that we are removing every vestige of U.S. \nmilitary presence, in my view, sends exactly the wrong message.\n  We need to be very careful about the message we send. We need to \nensure that our military presence there has the maximum effect for as \nlong as it may be required. It is somewhat ironic to me that the same \npeople--and I am not referring to any particular Senator in this \nregard--but many of the same people who advocate a permanent presence \nin NATO where we do not see any specific need for a U.S. presence today \nare those who are arguing against our presence in Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, I think our military efforts in Bosnia have been a \nspectacular success. And they have been successful because we have had \nstrong, bipartisan support in Congress for our military presence that \nsends a clear message to the people in the region.\n  That message says clearly that we want the genocide to stop. We want \nthe warring parties to come to terms. We want to recognize the \nextraordinary effort that has already been made by those who are \nputting their lives on the line to ensure that we succeed in retaining \nthe peace and stability and long-term political viability of the \nregion.\n  U.S. policy through the Dayton accords has succeeded stopping the \nkilling in Bosnia and in helping Bosnians forge longer term stability. \nWe have succeeded in doing something of great consequence. I just hope \nthat we recognize what a tremendous contribution it has been. While we \nall want to see that day when the United States forces are no longer \ndeployed in Bosnia, we want them to come home with confidence, knowing \nthat, regardless of whether we are there or not, we will continue to \nsee the kind of success that we have experienced since implementation \nof the Dayton accords began in December 1995. But for us to say with \ncertainty today that we know exactly when that date is, is shortsighted \nand ill-advised. I hope for those reasons the Senate will reject that \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I join the Senator from South Dakota in \nhis remarks.\n  Mr. President, I think I am going to have to call for the yeas and \nnays on this amendment because I think it is of serious import.\n  I also believe that we should be out of Bosnia. I had severe \nreservations as to going in. I ended up supporting the President, as \ndid the former majority leader, Senator Dole. But for us to say that \nunequivocally under no circumstances will American presence be there a \nlong time from now, I think would be, from a precedent-setting \nstandpoint, very dangerous and, second of all, would be a message that \nI am not sure we want to send at this time.\n  There are some very bad people in Bosnia, Mr. President, as we all \nknow. And if the administration was unequivocally on record or the \nUnited States Congress was on record as saying that under no \ncircumstances could there be an American presence in Bosnia as of a \ncertain date, I think it would have the unintended consequence of \nencouraging those very bad people.\n  Mr. President, I think it is something that we should work out with \nthe administration. It is well known that the present Secretary of \nDefense, a former Member of this body, has stated we will be out by \nJune 1998. But that is not a firm administration policy. And there are \ncertain proposals as far as a United States presence is concerned, both \non sea and in the air, as well as possibly in a neighboring country. I \nam not sure that this amendment would not affect those options as well.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee points out \nvery accurately that we do not have any money anyway at that time, so \nthis would be largely a symbolic vote. But, Mr. President, I believe \nthat if I were one of our European allies or someone who had an \ninterest in the situation in Bosnia, either as a participant or an \nobserver, I would say that this is a very strong message and one that \nwe do not want to send.\n  I also remind my colleagues that, yes, we have the right to cut off \nfunding, we have that constitutional right as a body. But it is always \nthe last resort. Cutting off funding is the last resort that we seek in \norder to salvage Americans when they are placed in great danger.\n  I suggest that this is the first option. If June 1998 begins to \napproach and it looks like the administration is in an open-ended \ncommitment, I think we would have plenty of opportunity at that time. \nWe would be considering lots of legislation in order to express our \nviews on this issue. But to act at this time, I think, would send a \nvery, very unfortunate and even dangerous signal.\n\n  I was just in conversation with the Senator from Alaska and he \npointed out that we did, indeed, cut off funding in the Somalia \nsituation, but that was also with the agreement of the administration \nthat they were leaving at that time. All of us were outraged at the \nwanton murder of some brave young Americans whose bodies were dragged \nthrough the streets of Mogadishu. There is no doubt in that situation \nthere was agreement that we were going to leave.\n  The Bosnia situation is very fluid, it is very dangerous. I want us \nout, too, but I greatly fear if we passed a resolution at this \nparticular time mandating such a thing--for example, cutting off all \nfunds--that this would be an action that would have some unintended \nconsequences associated with it. One of the major consequences I just \nmentioned is to encourage our adversaries and the enemies of peace in \nthat poor, unfortunate land, who, I think, might take this as a signal \nto just wait, rather than seek national reconciliation, wait until the \nAmericans leave and then really ignite the bloodletting and the \nconflict.\n\n[[Page S4089]]\n\n  Mr. President, I have to oppose this amendment, certainly at this \ntime, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is not a \nsufficient second.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant \nlegislative clerk proceeded to call.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask that we have the vote on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the second-\ndegree amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 177) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the first-\ndegree amendment, as amended.\n  The amendment (No. 83), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I want to state for the record what I \nbelieve the Senate just agreed to in supporting the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Wisconsin that would prohibit the obligation or \nexpenditure of funds available in S. 672, the supplemental \nappropriations bill, for operations or activities of the United States \nforces stationed on the ground in Bosnia.\n  This amendment in no way endorses the actions taken unilaterally by \nthe President to extend the presence of United States forces in Bosnia \nfor an additional 18 months beyond the 1-year time frame stipulated in \nSenate Joint Resolution 44.\n  The President never consulted with the Congress to extend the \npresence of United States forces in Bosnia, and the Senate has not \nvoted, by accepting this amendment, to approve the President's decision \nto extend the presence of United States forces in Bosnia until June \n1998.\n  The Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee in October \n1996 that United States forces would not be withdrawn from Bosnia until \nMarch 1997. They did not consult with the Congress about this short \nextension, and they assured the committee at the time that there were \nno plans to extend the presence of United States forces in Bosnia \nbeyond that time frame. However, they did note for the record that the \nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization was reviewing whether a continued \nNATO force presence was needed beyond the March 1997 time frame. The \nSecretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs promised that \nthe Congress would be consulted prior to agreeing to extend the United \nStates force in Bosnia. In fact, the President assured the American \npublic prior to the Presidential election in November that United \nStates forces would not be in Bosnia beyond the time-frame necessary to \nsafely withdraw.\n  Very shortly after the United States elections in November 1996, the \nPresident announced his intention to support a decision by NATO to \nextend the presence of a NATO force in Bosnia to implement the Dayton \nagreement. Following the recommendation of the NATO that a NATO \npresence remain in Bosnia, the President announced in December 1996 \nthat United States forces would remain in Bosnia, as part of a NATO \nforce until June 1998.\n  Once again, I want to emphasize what agreeing to this provision does \nnot do--it does not provide congressional approval for the President's \nunilateral decision to extend the presence of United States forces in \nBosnia beyond the 1-year time frame he announced in November 1995 to \nthe American public.\n  The President has not consulted with the Congress on his decision to \nextend the participation of United States forces in a NATO operation in \nBosnia. The President has not sought approval of the Congress for that \ndecision to extend the presence of United States forces in Bosnia until \nJune 1998. The Senate has not provided its approval, or authorization \nfor the President's decision to extend the presence of United States \nforces in Bosnia. The amendment merely ensures that U.S. forces are \ntaken care of, until such time as they are withdrawn in June 1998, \nwhether or not substantial progress is achieved in the civil \nimplementation of the Dayton agreement, as the President promised. The \namendment does not constitute congressional authorization or approval \nto extend the presence of United States forces in Bosnia.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I want to make clear, that had the \nSenate taken a rollcall vote on Senator Hutchinson's amendment to \nSenator Feingold's amendment, I would have voted no on the Hutchinson \namendment. I want our troops home as soon as possible, and I am \nstrongly supportive of any effort to bring them home as quickly as \npossible.\n  The President promised that our troops would be home in December \n1996. He clearly mislead the Congress and the American people when he \nmade this promise.\n  Only after the election was over did the President make his decision \nto extend our troop deployment, even though he knew full well that our \ntroops would not be coming home in December, well before the election.\n  The Bosnian mission is going to cost the taxpayers of this country \n$6.5 billion. The question is what will be changed after our troops \nhave been there this long, and we have spent this amount of money. I \ncontend that little will be changed. When the deployment was made, a \nprinciple question was whether the United States had an exit strategy. \nIt now appears that we may have no exit.\n  Again, I was strongly supportive of the Feingold amendment, and I \nwould have liked to have seen it passed without change.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 97\n\n (Purpose: To extend the dredging participation in the Small Business \n                   Demonstration Program Act of 1988)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mr. Bumpers, for \n     himself, Mr. Bond, and Mr. Warner, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 97.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriations place add the following new section:\n\n     ``SEC.   . EXPANDING SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION IN \n                   DREDGING.\n\n       ``Section 722(a) of the Small Business Competitiveness \n     Demonstration Program Act of 1988 (15 U.S.C. 644 note) is \n     amended by striking `September 30, 1996' and inserting \n     `September 30, 1997'.''\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is a simple amendment which extends \nthe expanding small business participation in dredging section of the \nSmall Business Competitive Demonstration Program Act of 1988 to \nSeptember 30, 1997.\n  I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 97) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   COLLECTION AND DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION ON PRICES \n                   RECEIVED FOR BULK CHEESE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Agriculture shall \n     collect and disseminate, on a weekly basis, statistically \n     reliable information, obtained from cheese manufacturing \n     areas in the United States on prices received and terms of \n     trade involving bulk cheese, including information on the \n     national average price for bulk cheese sold through spot and \n     forward contract transactions. to the maximum extent \n     practicable, the Secretary shall report the prices and terms \n     of trade for spot and forward contract transactions \n     separately.\n       (b) Confidentiality.--All information provided to, or \n     acquired by, the Secretary under subsection (a) shall be kept \n     confidential by each officer and employee of the Department \n     of Agriculture except that general weekly statements may be \n     issued that are based on the information and that do not \n     identify the information provided by any person.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 150 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall report to the \n     committee on Agriculture, and the Committee on \n     Appropriations, of the House of Representatives and the \n     Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, and the \n     Committee on Appropriations, of the Senate, on the rate of \n     reporting compliance by cheese manufacturers with respect to \n     the information collected under subsection (a). At the time \n     of the report, the Secretary may submit legislative \n     recommendations to improve the rate of reporting compliance.\n       (d) Termination of Effectiveness.--the authority provided \n     by subsection (a) terminates effective April 5, 1999.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask that Senators Santorum, Feingold, \nand Kohl be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am an original cosponsor of amendment \nNo. 76, offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter] which \nrequires the Department of Agriculture to collect and disseminate, on a \nweekly basis, statistically reliable information on bulk cheese prices \nthroughout the Nation. Secretary Glickman has already initiated this \nprice survey with the voluntary cooperation of cheese manufacturers \nusing existing administrative authorities of the Department. The \namendment offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania [Senator Specter] \nrequires the Secretary to continue doing so until April 5, 1999. \nHowever, because the Secretary has already implemented this cheese \nprice reporting initiative using existing authorities, I wanted to \nclarify that he can continue to collect and report this cheese price \ninformation after April 5, 1999 using the same authorities he is using \ncurrently.\n  Does the chairman of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry \nCommittee, Mr. Lugar, concur that the sunset provision in section (d) \nof amendment No. 76 in no way affects or diminishes the Secretary's \nexisting authority to continue the voluntary collecting and reporting \nof cheese price information from cheese manufacturers after April 5, \n1999?\n  Mr. LUGAR. I concur with the Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold].\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this deals with the collection and \ndissemination of information on prices received for bulk cheese. It \nrequires the Secretary of Agriculture to collect and disseminate \nstatistically reliable information from milk manufacturing plants on \nprices received for bulk cheese and requires a report to Congress on \nthe rate of reporting compliance.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 76) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, earlier today, I voted against the \nD'Amato amendment, which would reinstate SSI benefits for legal \nnonresidents. I think 11 Senators voted against that amendment.\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to make a statement about why I voted against \nthat amendment. I know a lot of people said they voted for it because \nit is part of the budget package that was agreed to by the leadership \nof Congress and the President. They wanted to reinstate that. They said \nthey might as well do it anyway because the budget is going to pass and \nthe benefit will be reinstated. That may well be. These individuals \nwill lose their benefits for 2 weeks in August and the month of \nSeptember--6 weeks--if that happens. But I didn't think that was the \nreason why it should be put in the urgent supplemental.\n  Some colleagues probably voted with me on that because they didn't \nthink it belonged in there, that it can be included in the budget \npackage. It may well be included in a budget package. That is when we \nwill do the entire budget.\n  So my point is--I informed my colleagues on this side of the aisle--\nif we have other amendments on this supplemental that try to pull out \nvarious pieces of the budget package and put it into the supplemental, \nand they say, ``Everybody has agreed, the leadership has agreed, that \nwe are going to spend more money for education, let's go ahead and put \nit in the supplemental, we are going to spend more money for children \nthat do not have health care, we will put into a supplemental''--I \ndisagree. This is supposed to be an urgent supplemental. It is supposed \nto be helping people with disaster assistance, and not to be prefunding \npart of the budget package.\n  At least I for one--and I am the only one--in the future, if we find \nother amendments that try to maybe prefund the budget agreement, I am \ngoing to object.\n  Also, I want to touch on this a little bit. Some people said, ``Well, \nwe need to undo part of this welfare package.'' I happen to be one that \ndisagrees with that. We passed significant welfare reform, and I think \nrightfully so. We said, yes, we are going to provide more benefits for \ncitizens than noncitizens. Somebody said they are here legally. That is \ncorrect.\n  Let me give a couple of facts. Since 1882, an alien who was likely to \nbecome a public charge has been subject to exclusion from the United \nStates. Since 1917, an alien who becomes a public charge within 5 years \nof entry has been subject to deportation from the country. That \ncontinues to be the immigration policy, that aliens within our Nation's \nborders should not depend on public resources to meet their needs, but \nrather rely on their own capabilities and the resources of their \nfamilies and their sponsors. That is the way it should be.\n  Families of immigrants who enter the United States signed affidavits \nof support. By these affidavits of support they pledge to provide for \nthe immigrants themselves and not put them on public assistance. That \nis a pledge. That says they will not become a public charge. That is to \nmake sure that when people come to the United States, they are seeking \ncitizenship and freedom, and not seeking welfare.\n  We found with this program, unfortunately, despite these policies, \nthat large numbers of sponsors have failed to live up to their \nobligations, both their moral obligations and their financial \nobligations.\n  Just a couple of facts: In 1986, just over 200,000 noncitizens were \nreceiving SSI welfare benefits. In 1996, that figure had grown to \n800,000, 4 times as many in a period of 10 years. It didn't double or \ntriple--4 times as many; it went from 200,000 to 800,000 in the last 10 \nyears. The Social Security Administration predicts that the number of \nnoncitizens receiving benefits would grow to 1 million by the end of \nthe decade.\n\n[[Page S4091]]\n\n  So this is exploding. A lot of people are bringing their families \nover, saying, ``Yes, you can be on welfare. You can be on welfare for \nlife. You get cash payments, cash assistance, several hundreds of \ndollars per month, and be eligible for Medicaid concurrently.'' It is a \npretty good deal. A lot of people said, ``I want in on that.'' So they \nwould come over and totally ignore the affidavits of support that they \nand their families pledged they would not became a public charge.\n  In the welfare bill that we passed last year, they should get around \nthis by becoming citizens. Now, I know a lot of people are becoming \ncitizens. Some people said, ``Well, the States don't have the \nresources. Not everybody can become a citizen.'' You have minimal \nEnglish requirements. Maybe they are not able to make that. The States \nsave millions, and collectively the States save billions of dollars in \nthe welfare changes we made last year. There is plenty of money to \nprovide assistance to those people that really need some help.\n  Total noncitizen applications for SSI alone increased almost 600 \npercent from 1982 to 1994, compared to just a 49-percent increase \namongst citizens. Most noncitizens apply for welfare within 5 years of \narriving in the United States.\n  Mr. President, I want to make these comments. I know that in the \nbudget package we have--I hope that we will pass a budget package--we \nare going to address this issue. I know, in all likelihood, for most \nnoncitizens we will be continuing SSI payments for those noncitizens \nwho are already here or already here at the time of enactment of the \nwelfare bill. That may well be. I might support it as part of an \noverall package.\n\n  But I voted in opposition to this being added to the supplemental \nbecause I didn't want to cherry-pick a few of the things out of the \nbudget package and say, ``Let's put it on this supplemental too.'' This \nwasn't going to happen. No one would lose benefits now for another 3 \nmonths. Our objective is to pass the reconciliation bill to implement \nthe balanced budget by July 4, a full month and a half before you would \nhave discontinuance of benefits. So we would have time to rectify the \nsituation if we have not reached the budget agreement.\n  So, Mr. President, I just make mention of that, and maybe forewarn my \ncolleagues. At least this Senator's intention is to object strenuously \nif future efforts are made to put parts of the budget package onto this \nurgent supplemental.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 107\n\n    (Purpose: To strike earmarks for unrequested highway and bridge \n          projects, parking garages, and theater restoration)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 107.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain) proposes an amendment \n     numbered 107.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 39, starting on line 22, strike all that appears \n     after ``1997'' through page 40, line 21, and insert in lieu \n     thereof ``.''.\n       On page 42, starting on line 11, strike all that appears \n     through page 43, line 4.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment strikes earmarks to fund \nfor highway projects:\n  $3.6 million for the 2002 Olympics planning in Utah;\n  $450,000 for the ATR Institute to continue the Santa Teresa border \ntechnologies project in New Mexico;\n  Additional funding for Warrior Loop project in Alabama;\n  $12.6 million to complete the William H. Natcher Bridge in Maceo, KY;\n  Additional funding for Highway 17 Cooper River bridges replacement \nproject in South Carolina;\n  $100,000 for 86th Street Highway Project in Polk County, IA;\n  And discretionary authority to spend additional funds to repair or \nreconstruct any portion of Highway 1 in San Mateo, CA, that was \ndestroyed in 1982 and 1983;\n  The set-aside of $12.3 million for discretionary authority to \nconstruct the parking garage at a VA medical center in Cleveland, OH;\n  Earmark of $500,000 from previously appropriated funds for a parking \ngarage in Ashland, KY, to instead restore the Paramount Theater in that \ncity.\n  Mr. President, this supplemental appropriations bill was an emergency \nappropriations bill. The title, as we all know, is an emergency \nsupplemental bill.\n  Mr. President, the earmarks I find included in this bill and others \nare not, in my view, of an emergency status. Let me talk about a few \nother earmarks that are in this bill.\n  Language that makes College Station, AR, eligible for rural housing \nservice program assistance.\n  By the way, Mr. President, I understand that College Station, AR, has \nbeen badly damaged by a tornado, and that is probably a project that \nwould qualify under emergency supplemental parameters.\n  It makes the cost of repairing the Wapato irrigation project \nnonreimbursable;\n  $15 million emergency funding for research on environmental risk \nfactors associated with breast cancer. Report language lists Rhode \nIsland, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Utah, New York, and \nCalifornia as States which should be considered for ``competitive \ngrants.'' In other words, the other States are not considered for \ncompetitive grants.\n  There is a $10 million earmark for phase 2 of nonemergency \ntransportation planning at Yosemite Valley which is offset by \nrescission of clean coal technology funding;\n  $5 million for development of the Legislative Information System in \nthe Office of Secretary of the Senate which is transferred from other \nSenate appropriations.\n  Let me say on that particular one, Mr. President, that I think the \nLegislative Information System in the Office of Secretary of the Senate \nis important. I do not think it qualifies as an emergency.\n  Earmarks funds for highway projects, including $3.6 million for 2002 \nOlympic planning in Utah;\n  $1.95 million earmarked for Colorado to provide security for the \nDenver Summit of Eight;\n  Set-aside of $12.3 million for discretionary authority to construct a \nparking garage, which I mentioned earlier;\n  $3 million earmarked from the Justice Department counterterrorism \nfund for Ogden, UT, preparation for 2002 Winter Olympics.\n  By the way, Mr. President, we are going to start totaling up how much \nFederal money is going to be spent on the Olympics in Utah. I would \nguess that it will match or exceed the amount of Federal dollars that \nwere spent in Atlanta.\n  Mr. President, I am proud that these Olympics are being held in the \nUnited States and that we win these competitions for having the \nOlympics held here in the United States of America. Mr. President, I \nthink the taxpayers ought to know what the cost is to the taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, I am reminded, as I look over this list, of the need \nfor the line-item veto.\n  This is another graphic example of why the line-item veto is \nnecessary. These projects do not qualify as emergencies, yet they are \nplaced in.\n  For many years I have come down here and complained about this kind \nof activity. I don't think it does us any good, Mr. President, to do \nthese things and call them emergency supplementals. What it does is \nprovide grist for the talk show mill. It provides ammunition for those \nwho believe we do not act in a responsible fashion. It makes it more \ndifficult for us to go home and say that we are trying to be careful of \nevery dollar we spend that the taxpayers so much care about--things \nlike EPA to provide a Federal grant to Middlebury, VT, to complete a \nproject in 1997;\n  Direct expenditures for study of flood control mitigation at \nLualualei Naval Magazine in Hawaii;\n  Special emphasis on need for flood prevention efforts at Devils Lake \nand Ramsey County Rural Sewer System.\n\n[[Page S4092]]\n\n  We can't afford to do this. We are trying to embark on an effort to \nbalance the budget by the year 2002. We are going to ask the American \npeople to make sacrifices as we embark on this effort. There will be \nsome reductions in spending.\n\n  Yet, at the same time we are appropriating $250,000 to replace salmon \nfry killed during an April snowstorm in New England, and $1.1 million \nto complete fire restoration at Bosque Del Apache National Wildlife \nRefuge.\n  So the bill has grown, I am told, from around $4.4 billion to over $8 \nbillion. Much of that is necessary spending.\n  Let me repeat again. In no way do I believe that we have any other \nobligation but to help those people who are victims of natural \ndisasters. We have that obligation. It is a proper role of Government.\n  If some of these projects that I mentioned are important and \nworthwhile projects, I believe they should be subject to the normal \nauthorization and appropriations process. So my amendment would \neliminate a few of those.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is my intention, Mr. President, to move to table this \namendment at a later time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise in support of the McCain, \namendment numbered 107, and state that I am not here to oppose any of \nthe emergency relief being put forward. I think that is important and I \nthink it is appropriate.\n\n  I also think we ought to pay for it as we go along. We are going to \nevery year somewhere in this country have a disaster. Each year we do \nthis and then we have a disaster and we do not pay for it and it adds \nto the deficit and we create this mortgage disaster for the country on \na long-term basis. We really ought to pay for it. That is another \nseparate debate.\n  I am here to support this issue and this amendment in removing those \nitems that are not emergency appropriations. I do not want to speak \nabout the validity or the need to do any of these specific projects \nthat are in here. I think that can rest for another day. But the \nquestion is, are these emergencies or not? Are they things that should \nappear in an emergency appropriations bill?\n  I think Senator McCain has articulated very well the list that he has \nput forward in this amendment. I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record that list that Senator McCain has been working on, and we \nhave worked in support of his amendment, to put this in as a part of \nthe Record that these may be good promises.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Objectionable Provisions in S. 672, Senate-Reported Fiscal Year 1997 \n                    Supplemental Appropriations Bill\n\n\n                             bill language\n\n       P. 25: Makes costs of repairing Wapato irrigation project \n     nonreimbursable.

These projects may be worthwhile. They may be things \nthat we should finance, even though we are over $5.4 trillion in debt. \nMaybe they are things we need to do, but they are not emergencies. This \nis an emergency supplemental. We should remove the name ``emergency'' \nfrom it if that is the case, and we are just going through on a regular \nsupplemental proceedings bill.\n  I know a lot of people worked very hard in putting these together. At \nthe end of the day, I think as you go down Senator McCain's list and \nask, is the $250,000 to replace salmon fry killed during an April \nsnowstorm in New England, is that truly an emergency? Are some of the \nthings he listed, spoke about, truly emergencies? I think one would \nhave to conclude under any reasonable review of those that they are not \nemergencies. They may be things we ought to do, but they are not things \nwe should do here. They are not things we should do in this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the McCain amendment, to not table \nthis issue, and pull these out and deal with these in the regular \nprocess in which they should dealt with.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to strongly \noppose the McCain amendment to strike the funding designation for two \nitems I have proposed to the legislation being considered, the Natcher \nBridge and the grant redirection for the Paramount Theater in Ashland.\n  The proponents of this amendment are wrong to characterize these two \nprovisions as wasteful and unnecessary. The fact of the matter is that \nthese are important projects to the communities of Owensboro and \nAshland, KY. Elimination of these two provisions will not save a single \ndime. In fact, this amendment would unnecessarily waste more tax \ndollars.\n  Mr. President, in 1992, a special purpose grant was included in the \nVA-HUD appropriations bill giving $1 million to the city of Ashland to \nconstruct a parking garage. City officials have studied this proposal \nfurther and determined that it would be more cost effective to purchase \nexisting lots. This alternative will add more parking spaces overall \nand at a lower price. The city has requested that the remaining funds \nbe used to restore a downtown landmark, the Paramount Theater.\n  Now, if the McCain amendment passes, the city of Ashland would be \nleft with a grant mandating that they build a parking garage that will \nyield fewer spaces at a greater cost. Mr. President, this makes no \nsense.\n\n[[Page S4093]]\n\n  Mr. President, this supplemental appropriations bill also provides \nfor a long overdue funding correction in Federal-aid highway funding. \nThis bill will provide Kentucky with $29.8 million to correct the \nfunding shortfall. I was able to include language that directs the \nState of Kentucky to provide $12.6 million of the $29.8 million \nallocated for completion of the Natcher Bridge. This will ensure the \ncompletion of Natcher Bridge.\n  Again, by striking the language, not one dime will be saved and the \nbridge will be left unfinished. Keep in mind every year this bridge is \nleft unfinished the total cost of the project increases. So again, this \namendment would waste scarce tax dollars and delay the completion of \nthis important project.\n  Mr. President, I believe the supporters of the amendment have \nmischaracterized this amendment and are doing a disservice to taxpayers \nand the citizens of Kentucky. I strongly oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have to oppose the amendment of the \nSenator from Arizona.\n  With regard to the funds for the Paramount Theater, for instance, in \nKentucky, these are funds that were already made available for a \nparking garage there in the same area, and those funds are being \nreprogrammed to another project that is involved in the same area which \nis a historic landmark.\n  We have another funding request here concerning the VA hospital. \nThese funds were appropriated in 1997 for this project, but \nunfortunately the authorizing language was left out of the Veterans \nHousing Act. What we are doing is going through the act again and \nreappropriating it with authorizing legislation. That is a \ntechnicality, really.\n  We do have the money, and there are highway funds allocated, in \naddition to those already allocated in Utah, that will be allocated for \nthe planning and engineering design of projects for the Olympics. These \nare the Winter Olympics for 2002, a very historic thing to have \nOlympics in our country. Just as every country, we have to have special \nparking lots, special entrances, security involved in roads, streets, \nand highways in connection with the Winter Olympics. That is a noble \nuse of funds for those projects. Of course, the highways and roads and \nparking lots are usable afterward. I do not argue about that. There is \nno question about the need for getting going now to allocate those \nfunds for those highway projects that do meet the criteria of past \nallocations.\n  We have a whole series of other problems that the Senator mentioned. \nI only say that some of them may be small disasters, such as the salmon \nproblem which the Senator has mentioned. Others are items that we put \nin the bill because of the timeliness of the construction that is \nrequired.\n  I will probably be making comments further tomorrow on other matters \nof the bill to try to explain some of these items. There are items here \nin several departments, and the Senator has pointed them out, that are \nnot disaster related. That is why this is an emergency and supplemental \nappropriations bill. These amendments go to the supplemental portion, \nnormal supplemental allocation of funds for items to be completed this \nyear. These are moneys to be used in the remainder of fiscal year 1997.\n  I am sad to say I do oppose the amendment of the Senator. I \nunderstand what he is doing. For the Senator's benefit, I hope he \nunderstands what I am saying. Senator McCain has become the chairman's \nlarge image on the wall, and I have to tell everyone that has an \namendment that is presented to our committee in connection with \nsupplementals or even annual bills, ``You better be sure we have the \njustification to get these by the Senator from Arizona because he is \nour watchdog.'' We need watchdogs and we appreciate them, but I have to \nsay I will be glad to tell the Senator sometime about the 1,000 \namendments we did not approve. We had more than 1,000, I might add, \nsuggested to our committee. These are the ones that survived.\n  I defend what we have done, and under the circumstances, it would be \nmy intent to table when the Senator is finished with his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think it is important to point out that the Senator \nfrom Alaska has been very cooperative and has been very helpful. I \nappreciate that. I also appreciate the various influences that the \nSenator is under. I appreciate his understanding. I look forward to \nworking with him as we go through the process. He and I, I believe, \nalong with the Senator from West Virginia, have a clear understanding \nof where they stand and where I stand, and that relationship is \ncharacterized by nothing but respect and, indeed, affection. I \nappreciate the Senator from Alaska and I do not intend to call for a \nrecorded vote on the motion to table.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I do ask that the amendment be tabled, and I move to \ntable this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the amendment No. 107.\n  The motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 107) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay it on \nthe table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                   U.S. Courthouse in Montgomery, AL\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senator from \nRhode Island for his assistance with several issues affecting the U.S. \ncourthouse to be constructed in Montgomery, AL. Last fall, $6 million \nwas included in Public Law 104-208 to help offset cost escalations \nresulting from: An error made by GSA during its Time Out and Review \nexercise; inflation; required security upgrades; historic preservation; \nand, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning improvements.\n  Because this supplemental project funding cannot be obligated by GSA \nwithout authorization by the Committee on Environment and Public Works, \nI have worked closely with Senator Chafee and other members of the \nauthorizing committee to secure their approval. Appropriately, Senator \nChafee and others wanted to make sure that this additional funding \nwould not cause the project in Montgomery to exceed the GSA \nbenchmarking and project budgeting process. At my and Senator Chafee's \nrequest, GSA confirmed in a letter dated April 21, 1997, that this \nadditional $6 million will not cause the Montgomery project to exceed \nits benchmark. That is, this additional funding is necessary for GSA to \ncomplete the very critical and basic features of a modern courthouse \nfacility.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The Senator from Alabama is correct. After numerous \nconversations with GSA officials, and after receiving the GSA letter my \ncolleague referred to, I have confirmed that the $6 million included in \nlast year's Omnibus Appropriations Act is necessary and appropriate for \nthe courthouse project in Montgomery. Indeed, the additional $6 million \nwill not cause this project to exceed its GSA benchmark cost. As such, \nI have no objection to GSA obligating these funds and encourage the \nagency to move expeditiously on this project.\n  Mr. President, let me make it clear that absent the extraordinary \ncircumstances faced by this project, I would insist upon authorizing \nthe additional money through the committee resolution process, in \naccordance with the 1959 Public Buildings Act. As the Senator from \nAlabama mentioned at the outset, this project has already incurred cost \nincreases as the result of delayed construction starts. A GSA budgeting \nerror on Montgomery has yielded inflationary cost increases of $2.6 \nmillion. In addition, the project recently suffered a bid bust which \nthreatens to delay construction further unless additional funds are \nprovided expeditiously. This project must proceed as soon as possible \nto prevent further wasteful expenses.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I appreciate the Senator from Rhode Island's assistance \non this matter and am thankful for his recognition of the special \ncircumstances. As the former chairman of GSA's appropriations \nsubcommittee, I am fully aware and supportive of the need to abide by \nnational project cost standards.\n\n\n                       agricultural credit issues\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, many farmers and ranchers in South Dakota \nhave contacted me over the past few months to express their concerns \nwith the eligibility requirements and availability of Department of \nAgriculture\n\n[[Page S4094]]\n\ndisaster loans. I had hoped these could be addressed in the \nsupplemental appropriation bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I share the concerns of my colleague from South Dakota. \nOur States have witnessed the most devastating series of winter storms \nand spring flooding in memory. Our producers need help in rebuilding \ntheir farming and ranching operations. However, I am afraid the credit \nneeds of many farm and ranch families are not being met.\n  For example, some producers cannot access USDA's Emergency Disaster \nLoan Program, even though they have a qualifying disaster loss. Others, \nNative American tribes, do not have a loan program available to them to \nreplace livestock lost during the disaster. I believe it is important \nthat we give them an opportunity to rebuild their lives and \nlivelihoods, by giving serious consideration to updating the programs.\n  These are the reasons I filed amendments cosponsored by Senators \nDaschle, Conrad and Johnson.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am sensitive to the concerns expressed by \nmy colleagues. At the same time, significant reforms were made to USDA \nlending programs by the 1996 FAIR Act. I want to maintain the integrity \nof these reforms, and therefore believe that any measures which would \nsubstantially alter the basic terms of the lending programs should be \nsubject to review by the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and \nForestry.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I support the amendments offered by my colleague from \nNorth Dakota but understand the concerns of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Indiana. Would my colleague from Indiana agree to a review by the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, of these and other \ndisaster related credit issues affecting farmers and ranchers?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I believe that is a constructive idea. The \ncommittee will review not only the issues raised by the Senator from \nSouth Dakota and our other colleagues, but potentially also other \nissues relating to rural credit, including the effectiveness of certain \nUSDA loan guarantee programs, an issue brought to my attention recently \nby several community bankers.\n  Mr. DORGAN. While I would prefer to see passage of my amendments, I \nalso understand the chairman's concern and will not offer them today. I \nwould encourage the Senator from Indiana to move expeditiously. Rural \nAmericans from our region need some help soon.\n\n\n                 1997 DISASTER IN THE RED RIVER VALLEY\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, a good deal has been said about the \nterrible devastation in Minnesota in the Red River Valley and along the \nMinnesota River. When we visualize the disaster, we picture communities \nlike Ada, Granite Falls, East Grand Forks, Montevideo, Breckenridge, \nMoorhead, and Warren submerged in river water. I have seen most of \nthese communities first hand and have at once anguished over their loss \nand admired them for their courage. We tend to overlook some other \nfolks in Minnesota who were equally devastated by the terrible floods \nthat came so soon on the heels of a very long and blistering cold \nwinter. We tend to overlook the same folks who, year-in and year-out, \nare charged with an enormous responsibility: feeding the world.\n  It is estimated that over 3 million acres of prime farmland were \nunder water at the height of the flooding. These are the same acres \nthat Minnesota farmers use to produce much of the world's supply of \npotatoes, wheat, sugar, barley, corn, and soybeans. In short, without \nany exaggeration, this disaster upset the bread basket of the world.\n  But, I am inexpressibly proud to report to my colleagues that it \ntakes more than ``hell and high water,'' as the Grand Forks Herald put \nit, to keep Minnesota's farmers down. As a matter of fact, despite the \nabsolutely staggering statistics--3 million acres under water, the loss \nof 2,300 farm homes, 2,500 farm buildings, 3,400 pieces of farm \nequipment, countless fences, 10,000 head of cattle, hogs, and sheep, \n130,000 poultry, 2.3 million pounds of milk, and 15 percent of \nMinnesota's stored crop--Minnesota farmers have not shrunk from their \noccupation, or indeed, their avocation. Minnesota farmers have not \nshrunk from their job of feeding the world. In fact, I want my \ncolleagues here to know that within 1 week of this calamity, every \nfarmer that could manage, was back in the field. Mr. President, when \none reflects on all the adversity Minnesota farmers have experienced in \nrecent years--highlighted by the drought of 1988, the floods of 1993, \nthe harsh winter storms in 1996 and 1997, and now the flooding--it \ninstills in me a solid respect for our Minnesota farmers who work \nthrough whatever Mother Nature throws at them--and sometimes even get \nthe best of her.\n  But, just like everyone else, even the hardiest of people need a hand \nfrom time to time. And, this is such a time. That is why I am pleased \nthat the disaster relief we now consider provides some $18 million in \nadditional emergency loan assistance and $77 million in emergency \nconservation cost-share dollars. I am also pleased this legislation, \nwhich I trust will have speedy consideration and passage, provides $50 \nmillion for a livestock indemnity program to help livestock producers.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of Minnesota farmers and ranchers, I am \ngrateful for the commitment Congress and the President have made to \nthose who guarantee America has the most abundant, most affordable, and \nmost wholesome food supply in the world.\n\n  Consistent with this commitment, I hope the administration, \nparticularly the Department of Agriculture, will help our farmers \nthrough this difficult time. Specifically, in recent days, I have \nexpressed to the Secretary of Agriculture my concern and the concern of \nmany farmers and Farm Service Agency personnel in Minnesota over some \nvery important matters. First, I am concerned the existing emergency \nloan assistance (ELA) Program may not assist all our disaster-stricken \nproducers as the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Small \nBusiness Administration assist homeowners and businesses. Second, under \ncurrent Federal Crop Insurance Corporation regulation, I am concerned \nthat farmers may not be able to plant in time to ensure their crops are \nfully insured until fully harvested. And, third, I am concerned about \nmany of our farmers who lost program or non-program crops in storage \nsince these crops were largely uninsured. In the interest of equity for \nMinnesota's disaster-stricken farmers, I hope the Secretary will use \nhis existing authorities to work with me to prevent these inequitable \nresults.\n  Mr. President, some time ago, Rudyard Kipling fondly wrote about the \none who could:\n\n       watch the things [he] gave [his] life to, broken, and stoop \n     and build 'em up with worn-out tools . . . [or] make one heap \n     of all [his] winnings, and risk it on one turn of pitch-and-\n     toss, and lose, and start again at [his] beginnings, and \n     never breathe a word about [his] loss.\n\n  I suspect Rudyard Kipling would have had a profound respect for \nMinnesota farmers.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the supplemental appropriations bill \nshould allow the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] to spend \nadditional funding on commercially available explosive detection \nsystems for the Nation's airports, rather than for only one type of \nsystem as proposed by the House. The House bill provides an additional \n$40 million for the FAA to purchase this one system, while the Senate \nbill provides no additional funding. When the conference report returns \nto the Senate floor, however, we should make sure that any additional \nfunding given to the FAA can be used to purchase whatever explosive \ndetection equipment it believes will do the best job.\n  The development and deployment of various devices that can detect \nexplosives are a key component of the overall security for commercial \naviation. Unfortunately, the House version of the supplemental \nappropriations bill does not move us in this direction because it \nearmarks additional funding for only one type of explosive detection \nsystem. This earmarking does not provide for a multilevel approach to \nsecurity as recommended by the White House Commission on Aviation \nSafety and Security. In its recent report, the Commission suggested \nthat various explosive detection systems should be implemented at the \nNation's airports because each one has its strengths and weaknesses. \nThe Commission also urged FAA to deploy commercially available systems \nwhile continuing to\n\n[[Page S4095]]\n\ndevelop, evaluate, and certify such equipment. Additionally, the \nGeneral Accounting Office has criticized the FAA for ignoring a \nstrategy more heavily focused on integrating several different \nprocedures and technologies for detecting explosives. Explosive \ndetection devices vary in their ability to detect the types, \nquantities, and shapes of explosives. For example, one device excels in \nits ability to detect certain explosive substances but not others. \nOther devices cannot detect explosives in certain shapes.\n  The FAA believes that the greatest threat to aviation is explosives \nplaced in checked baggage. It was an explosive placed in a checked bag \nthat brought down Pan Am 103 more than 8 years ago with the loss of 270 \nlives. In response to this tragedy, the Congress approved the Aviation \nSecurity Improvement Act of 1990. Among other things, the legislation \ndirected the FAA to certify explosive detection equipment. It also \nestablished a goal of having new explosive detection equipment in place \nby November of 1993. The TWA Flight 800 accident last July, however, \nhighlighted the fact that no new explosive detection devices had been \ndeployed in the United States since the Pan Am bombing. Congress \nresponded, in part, in the Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996 \nby mandating that the FAA immediately deploy commercially available \nexplosive detection equipment.\n  The threat of terrorism against the United States has increased and \naviation is, and will remain, an attractive terrorist target. The \nterrorist threat faced by the United States overseas has been with us \nfor some time, as illustrated by the bombing in Saudi Arabia of the \nUnited States barracks. However, other incidents, such as the bombings \nof the World Trade Center in New York and the Federal building in \nOklahoma City have also made terrorism an issue at home. In 1994, the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation reported that the most important \ndevelopment concerning terrorism inside the United States was the \nemergence of radical terrorist groups with an infrastructure that can \nsupport terrorists' activities. That same year, the State Department \nreported an increase in attacks by radical fundamentalist groups, who \noperate more autonomously than state-sponsored, secular terrorist \ngroups. Fundamentalist groups are more difficult to infiltrate. \nConsequently, it is difficult to predict and prevent their attacks.\n  Given the potential for a terrorist act against aviation, explosive \ndetection systems should be deployed as quickly as possible. As the \nGeneral Accounting Office reported in January 1994, terrorists' \nactivities are continually evolving and present unique challenges to \nthe FAA and law enforcement agencies. The bombing of Philippines \nAirlines Flight 434 in December 1994, which resulted in the death of \none passenger and injuries to several others, illustrates the extent of \nterrorists' motivation and capabilities as well as the attractiveness \nof aviation as a target. According to information that was uncovered by \naccident in early January 1995, this bombing was a rehearsal for \nmultiple attacks on specific United States flights in Asia.\n  Today, various explosive detection devices are commercially available \nfor checked and carry-on baggage and could improve security. Some of \nthese devices are already being used in foreign countries such as the \nUnited Kingdom and Israel. Other devices are under development and may \nsoon be available. We must untie the FAA's hand and allow them to \ndedicate additional resources to the technologies they believe would be \nthe most effective in detecting explosives. To see that this occurs as \nquickly as possible, any additional funding appropriated by the \nCongress should be available to purchase commercially available \nexplosive detection devices. By taking such action we can move toward \ndeploying the best systems for the Nation's airports.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to thank \nSenator Stevens, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and \nSenator Harry Reid, the ranking member for the Subcommittee on Energy \nand Water Development, for their help in obtaining the Senate's \nunanimous consent for an amendment I had requested to the disaster \nsupplemental appropriations bill.\n  The Senate on Tuesday accepted the amendment offered by Senator \nStevens for Senator Reid that would allow the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers to conduct emergency dredging and snagging and clearing of \nthe San Joaquin River, CA, as well as the Truckee River, NV, channels. \nFunding for this operation would be obtained from available balances \nfrom the $137 million appropriated by the Senate for operations and \nmaintenance for corps navigation projects.\n  I had previously requested $10 million for this operation for about \n20 sites along the San Joaquin River, which filled with debris and \nsediment from the January 1997 floods in California. As a result of \nthis flooding, the capacity of the San Joaquin was severely diminished \nand poses a threat of continued flooding before the flood season is \nover. The scope of this debris and fill was not evident until the river \nflows had receded. At that point, however, the emergency authority for \ncorps' clearing operations had passed.\n  The hazard to navigation and to flooding posed by the debris fill is \nnow quite obvious. What is less obvious is the obstruction that the \ndeposited debris and sediment created to the migration and passage of \nanadramous and other fish, some of which are federally listed as \nendangered or threatened.\n  I appreciate Senators Stevens' and Reid's help on this amendment and \nurge their continued support for this provision when we conference with \nthe House.\n\n\n             funding for u.s. arrears to the united nations\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to discuss a provision in the fiscal \nyear 1997 supplemental appropriations bill which has received little \nattention so far, but would fund $100 million to begin paying U.S. \narrears to the United Nations.\n  As the chairman of the Subcommittee on International Operations, I \nbelieve U.N. reform should be one of Congress' top foreign policy \npriorities this year. I know that this view is shared by the Republican \nleadership and other influential Members in both the House and Senate.\n  There is general consensus among Republicans, and, perhaps, even some \nagreement among Democrats, that the only way to get real reforms \nenacted at the United Nations is by linking the payment of U.S. \narrears, in legislation, to their achievement. The appropriation of \n$100 million in fiscal year 1997, which is even earlier than the \nadministration had requested, for a down payment on U.S. arrears \ndemonstrates congressional seriousness on this issue.\n  I want to thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator \nStevens, and Senator Gregg, chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee \non Commerce, Justice, State and Judiciary, for working so closely with \nthe Foreign Relations Committee on this provision.\n  In the past, there has not always been such a cooperative spirit \nbetween the authorizing and appropriating committees on funding for \nforeign affairs and, therefore, I very much appreciate the efforts that \nSenators Stevens and Gregg have made to consult with those of us on the \nForeign Relations Committee.\n  Indeed, I am supporting this fiscal year 1997 appropriation to pay \nU.S. arrears because the bill specifically states that such funding \nmust be subsequently authorized. The language reads that ``none of the \nfunds appropriated or otherwise made available by this Act for payment \nof U.S. arrearages to the United Nations may be obligated or expended \nunless such obligation or expenditure is expressly authorized by the \nenactment of a subsequent act.''\n  This language explicitly reinforces the role of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee in authorizing or approving any funding for U.S. arrears. \nTherefore, let me make absolutely clear what I believe must happen \nbefore this $100 million appropriation for fiscal year 1997 can be \nexpended.\n  First, as I stated earlier, any legislation authorizing payment of \nU.S. arrears must condition such payment on the achievement of \nspecific, meaningful U.N. reforms.\n  Second, legislation authorizing any payment of U.S. arrears must be a \ncomprehensive, multiyear plan. I would not support a 1-year \nauthorization bill, which would simply allow the $100 million \nappropriated in fiscal year 1997 to be expended, but would fail to \noutline a\n\n[[Page S4096]]\n\nlonger-term vision for how this issue should be addressed.\n  U.S. arrears provide crucial and unique leverage that can help \nencourage the United Nations and its member states to finally enact \nbudget, personnel, and structural changes that will have a lasting, \npositive impact on how the United Nations functions. We should not \nsquander or dilute this leverage by failing to enact comprehensive \nlegislation that lays out exactly what the United States expects from \nthe United Nations in exchange for almost $1 billion.\n  Republicans have developed and proposed a 5-year plan to repay all \nlegitimate arrears to the United Nations as long as specified reforms \nare achieved. This 5-year plan is fiscally responsible because it gives \nCongress a reasonable opportunity to find funding for U.S. arrears \nwithin the international affairs budget, known as the 150 account. It \nis sensible because it gives the United Nations a realistic timetable \nfor enacting some of the more difficult reforms. And it is accountable \nto the American taxpayers by ensuring that the dollars the United \nStates sends to the United Nations will go toward a more efficient \norganization.\n  Just last year, President Clinton proposed a 5-year repayment plan \nfor U.S. arrears. But this year, the administration has declined to \nsupport our responsible approach and, instead, insisted that it wants \nall arrears paid in full by the end of fiscal year 1999.\n  As part of this request, the administration asked that Congress \nprovide $100 million for arrears in fiscal year 1998 to give it \ndiplomatic leverage in negotiating U.N. reforms. With the provision in \nS. 672, Congress has indicated that it is willing to begin paying back \narrears even sooner, provided that an authorization bill is enacted and \nprovided that the United Nations meets the reform conditions stipulated \nin that bill for the release of arrears in fiscal year 1997.\n  Mr. President, in the next few weeks, the Foreign Relations Committee \nwill be moving toward its markup of the fiscal year 1998-99 State \nDepartment authorization bill. Included in that bill will be our 5-year \nplan for paying U.S. arrears in exchange for U.N. reforms. If the \nadministration wishes to have funding available to pay arrears in \nfiscal year 1997 or in future years, it would do well to give this \nlegislation more serious consideration and embrace its commonsense \nprovisions to advance meaningful reform at the United Nations.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I cannot announce there will be no more votes, but it is \nnot our intention to call upon amendments that would require votes \ntonight. We do expect to start very early in the morning and have a \nvote at approximately 10 o'clock in the morning on one amendment and \nthen a period of debate on Senator Byrd's amendment to strike the \ncontinuing resolution proposal in the supplemental emergency bill. We \nwill have a vote on that. It is our intention to finish this bill \ntomorrow evening.\n  I might say to Senators who have amendments, I urge them to come and \npresent their amendments and try to work out, to the extent we can, \ntime agreements on obtaining time tomorrow. It will be very much in \nshort supply, Mr. President. We are going to move to go to third \nreading at or around 6 o'clock. I say that again: We are going to move \nto go to third reading at or around 6 o'clock if that is \nparliamentarily possible at that time. I think it will be.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 169\n\n (Purpose: To increase the number of units available for FHA insurance \n    under the HUD/State Housing Finance Agency Risk-Sharing program)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send amendment No. 169 to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a pending amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. For the purposes of the remaining amendments, I ask the \nReid amendment not come before the Senate before tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will read the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mr. Bond, Mr. \n     Sarbanes, Mr. D'Amato, and Ms. Mikulski, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 169.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In Title III, Chapter 10, add the following new section:\n       Sec.   . The first sentence of section 542(c)(4) of the \n     Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 is amended by \n     striking out ``on not more than 12,000 units during fiscal \n     year 1996'' and inserting in lieu thereof: ``on not more than \n     12,000 units during fiscal year 1996 and not more than an \n     additional 7,500 units during fiscal year 1997.''.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. This is to increase the number of units available for \nFHA under the HUD/State Housing Finance Agency Risk-Sharing Program. It \nis a matter that deals with adding units for 1997.\n  It is cosponsored by, as I understand it, by Senators Sarbanes, \nD'Amato and Mikulski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask the amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 169) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote and I move to lay it on \nthe table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 232, 233, and 234, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that three \namendments on behalf of Senator Conrad be considered and agreed to en \nbloc. I am going to send those amendments to the desk in a minute. \nThese amendments have been cleared by the chairman and ranking member \nof the subcommittee. They provide additional emergency disaster funding \nfor farm operating loans and flood plain easements and offset these \nadditional amounts.\n  I send these three amendments to the desk and ask they be considered \nen bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] for Mr. Conrad, \n     proposes amendments Nos. 232, 233 and 234, en bloc.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 232, 233, and 234), en bloc, are as follows:\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 232\n\n (Purpose: To make an additional $10,000,000 available for the cost of \n subsidized guaranteed farm operating loans under Title II, Chapter 1)\n\n       On page 9, line 21, strike ``emergency insured'' and insert \n     in lieu thereof ``direct and guaranteed''.\n       On page 9, line 25, strike ``$18,000,000, to remain \n     available until expended'' and insert in lieu thereof \n     ``$28,000,000, to remain available until expended, of which \n     $18,000,000 shall be available for emergency insured loans \n     and $10,000,000 shall be available for subsidized guaranteed \n     operating loans''.\n       On page 10, line 3, strike ``$18,000,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$28,000,000''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 233\n\n (Purpose: To reduce funding for The Emergency Food Assistance Program \ncommodity purchases to offset emergency disaster funding for subsidized \nguaranteed farm operating loans and additional funding for flood plain \n                               easements)\n\n       On page 74, between lines 4 and 5, insert:\n\n\n                       Food and Consumer Service\n\n                 The Emergency Food Assistance Program\n\n       Notwithstanding section 27(a) of the Food Stamp Act, the \n     amount specified for allocation under such section for fiscal \n     year 1997 shall be $80,000,000.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 234\n\n       On page 13, line 1, strike ``$161,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$171,000,000''.\n       On page 13, line 15, strike ``$10,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$20,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

The question is on agreeing to the amendments \nen bloc.\n\n[[Page S4097]]\n\n  The amendments (No. 232, 233, and 234), en bloc, were agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                            interior portion\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would like to engage my colleague Senator Gorton, the \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Interior and Related Agencies, in a \ncolloquy on the Interior portion of the bill.\n  Mr. GORTON. I am happy to do so.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. As the Senator knows, the Dakotas and many upper \nMidwestern States were battered by a series of storms this winter and \nspring. Many of the States affected by weather-related emergencies are \nstill battling and will not have a complete or accurate assessment of \nthe damage until later this spring. Indian tribes, many of which live \nin remote areas, are among those whose communities suffer most in this \nkind of disaster.\n  Mr. GORTON. I fully appreciate the sentiments of the Senator from \nSouth Dakota. The President's request for emergency funding for the \nBureau of Indian Affairs is $10,800,000. The Appropriation Committee's \nrecommendation, based on updated information about the costs associated \nwith these storms, is $20,566,000. Of the additional amount included in \nthe committee-reported bill, $1,059,000 is directly attributable to the \nefforts of Senator Daschle.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I want to thank the committee for adding $1,059,000 to \nthe supplemental spending bill for the Bureau of Indian Affairs. I am \nparticularly grateful to the efforts of Senators Gorton, Stevens and \nByrd in working to ensure sufficient funding in this bill to mitigate \nthe impacts of this year's weather disasters on so many tribes, \nincluding those in South Dakota. It is my hope that of the funds \nappropriated in the bill for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Bureau \nwill consider the additional needs of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe \nfor welfare assistance costs, the Mni Sose Intertribal Water Rights \nCoalition to support their work in helping the tribes of my region \nobtain disaster assistance, the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe for snow \nremoval, and the Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe for snow removal.\n  Mr. GORTON. I agree that the Bureau should consider the additional \nneeds you have identified in distributing the funds provided.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Since the markup, I have received a request for an \nadditional $1,200,000 for emergency assistance for the Crow Creek Sioux \nTribe in South Dakota. The Crow Creek community of Fort Thompson \nsuffered damages that require road repairs, monitoring and cleanup of \nsewage, repairs to the tribal administration building, and repair to \nthe irrigation pump on the tribal farm. Is it the chairman's belief \nthat these repairs can be accomplished within the funding provided?\n  Mr. GORTON. Within the $20,566,000 provided for the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs, an estimated $4,736,000 has been identified for emergency \nneeds in South Dakota, including emergency assistance for the Crow \nCreek Sioux. In distributing these amounts, I agree that the Bureau \nshould take into consideration additional needs, including those of the \nCrow Creek Sioux, to the extent that Bureau policy regarding historical \npriorities for funding Indian roads, tribal administration buildings \nand irrigation projects is met. In addition, the Bureau must consider \nthe availability of funding through other Federal agencies, including \nthe Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Federal Highway \nAdministration's emergency road program [ERFO].\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I concur with the Subcommittee Chairman that \nthe Bureau should give consideration to the additional requirements \nidentified by the Crow Creek Sioux tribe, as well as other tribes. The \nfunds provided are to address the most critical health and safety and \nemergency response needs associated with the disasters. If the \nadditional emergency appropriations are not sufficient to address all \nrequests from all tribes, the Bureau of Indian Affairs will have to \nprioritize the requests, but they are encouraged to consider the \nparticular needs in South Dakota.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 59\n\n                     (Purpose: To strike title VII)\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order \nfor me to call up amendment No. 59.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 59.\n       On page 81, beginning with line 1, strike all through page \n     85, line 9.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the very last sections of this bill, title \nVII, beginning on page 81, line 1, through page 85, line 9, contains \nlanguage which its proponents call the Government Shutdown Prevention \nAct. I believe it could be more aptly dubbed the Adequate Oversight \nPrevention Act. During a committee markup of this emergency disaster \nassistance bill, after considerable debate, my motion to strike this \nproposal was defeated by a party line vote of 13 yeas to 15 nays.\n  The language of title VII is the same language as is contained in S. \n47, which was introduced some weeks ago by Senators McCain, Hutchison, \nStevens, and others. The provisions provide that if any of the 13 \nregular appropriations bills for fiscal year 1998 do not become law \nprior to the beginning of the fiscal year on October 1, there will be \nan automatic appropriation for each such program, project or activity \ncontained in that bill at the arbitrary rate of 98 percent of the \nfunding that was provided for the program, project or activity in the \ncorresponding regular appropriations act for fiscal year 1997. This \nlevel of funding would continue for each appropriation bill for the \nentirety of fiscal year 1998, unless another continuing resolution or a \nseparate appropriation bill is enacted into law to replace it.\n  If these provisions were in effect for the entire fiscal year for all \n13 regular appropriations bills, the effect could be cuts totaling $35 \nbillion, or 7 percent below President Clinton's discretionary budget \nrequest. This level of cuts would cause severe devastation to worthy \nnational efforts in law enforcement, education, transportation and \ntransportation safety, Health and Human Services, and a host of other \nprograms throughout the Federal Government.\n  Mr. President, I am especially concerned about the impact that this \nso-called Government Shutdown Prevention Act would have on our law \nenforcement agencies and the Federal courts. For these agencies, this \nproposal would, in fact, be a shutdown bill. It would itself be a \nsevere setback in the war on crime and illegal narcotics. We finally \nhave seen positive results from our efforts to bolster the Justice and \nTreasury Departments and our anticrime programs. The Bureau of Justice \nStatistics' most recent crime reports show that we are finally turning \nthe corner on violent crime in America. They report a decline of 12.8 \npercent in violent crime--rape, robbery and assault. There is far too \nmuch crime in America. But we are starting to win the war, we hope. We \nshould be enhancing our efforts, as the President's budget proposes. \nInstead, this shutdown proposal would hurt our law enforcement \nagencies, our men and women in uniform, as much as any terrorist or \nMexican drug cartel or gang or organized crime figure could hope to. It \nwould cause an about-face and undercut Federal law enforcement right in \nthe midst of battle.\n  Let us look briefly at what this shutdown proposal would mean to \nspecific Federal law enforcement agencies. These are conservative \nestimates that were supplied by the agencies themselves.\n  This proposal would cut the Federal Bureau of Investigation by $261 \nmillion below the President's budget request. It would eliminate at \nleast 2,281 positions, including 965 FBI agents and 1,316 support \nstaff. Reductions would\n\n[[Page S4098]]\n\ninclude 199 agents that investigate domestic terrorism and 175 agents \nthat develop capabilities to counter the threat from chemical, \nbiological, and nuclear materials. We have been adding positions to the \nFBI to deal with terrorist acts like the bombings in Oklahoma City and \nat the Atlanta Olympics. This would reverse the gains that we have made \nin mobilizing a Federal response to domestic and international \nterrorism.\n  Funding would not be available to complete the new FBI laboratory at \nQuantico, VA. We are all concerned with reports of problems in the \noperations of the current laboratory at headquarters. The FBI must have \nstate-of-the-art facilities and continue to be the world's premier law \nenforcement forensic laboratory. We need to complete this $130 million \nlaboratory, which is so important to Federal, State and local law \nenforcement.\n  Funding would not be available to continue the telephone carrier \ncompliance effort called for under the Communications Assistance For \nLaw Enforcement Act. All Senators know just how rapidly the \ntelecommunications industry is changing. Telephones are now portable, \nand they are adopting digital technologies. Without funding for \nretrofitting telephone switches, we will be unable to conduct court-\nordered wiretaps of drug dealers and organized crime and national \nsecurity threats. This shutdown proposal would cut the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration by $106 million. It would require the DEA to absorb $36 \nmillion in must-pay bills for cost-of-living adjustments, inflation and \ncontract costs. It would force DEA to stop hiring agents, and we would \nnot be able to provide for the 168 new special agents that are proposed \nin the President's budget.\n  DEA would have to cut back, rather than increase, its efforts to \ncombat methamphetamine, or ``meth,'' as it is known, and drug \ntrafficking in cocaine and heroin by the Colombian and Mexican cartels. \nDEA estimates that this bill would require a reduction in force of up \nto 263 special agents. It would stop dead in the water DEA's efforts to \nexpand mobile enforcement teams that sweep through rural communities to \nweed out drug dealers. And it would severely set back our efforts to \ncombat illegal narcotics on the southwest border, in Texas, California, \nNew Mexico and Arizona.\n\n  This shutdown proposal would strike a blow against our efforts to \nmake American borders secure against illegal immigration and drug \nsmuggling. It would devastate the Customs Service and the Department of \nthe Treasury and the Immigration and Naturalization Service in the \nDepartment of Justice. The proposal would cut $64 million and 201 \nagents from the U.S. Customs Service. It would result in reductions in \nantismuggling and drug-interdiction efforts, efforts that are important \nin keeping American borders safe and secure.\n  But reductions in staffing are only one component of keeping the \nborders secure. The reduction would also delay acquisition of high-\nenergy detection systems and eliminate funding for border passenger \nprocessing systems. These systems identify attempts to smuggle illegal \nchemicals, refrigerants, and illegal aliens across the border. The \nreduction would also delay funding for the automated targeting system, \nwhich increases Customs' capability to conduct intensive border \ninspection.\n  This proposal would destroy the progress that we have made in \nbuilding up the capability of the Border Patrol and the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service. These efforts really started with hearings on \nillegal immigration that I held in 1994 when I served as chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee. The INS advises that this bill would \nrequire the reduction of $385 million and would severely impact major \nenforcement programs such as detention and deportation, investigations, \nwork site enforcement, and the apprehension of illegal aliens. This \nbill would stop dead in their tracks our efforts to build up the Border \nPatrol by 1,000 agents per year. We just reaffirmed this commitment in \nlast year's immigration bill. The Border Patrol and INS advise that if \nthey have to operate at 2 percent below current levels during fiscal \nyear 1998, they will have to eliminate at least 1,671 personnel that \nwere added just this year.\n  One of the real success stories in Federal law enforcement has been \nour Bureau of Prisons. We are putting away more criminals under lock \nand key and keeping them away from the public for longer periods. I \nfear that this shutdown bill would reverse this progress. The prison \nsystem advises us that this bill would require a reduction of $119 \nmillion from the President's budget request. They would be unable to \nactivate a new medium security prison in Beaumont, TX. There would be \nno funds for the annualization costs of six new prisons scheduled for \nactivation this year, resulting in the loss of more than 7,300 beds. We \nhave been funding new construction. Now we need to have the money to \nstaff and operate these institutions. Overcrowding would increase to 23 \npercent for the overall Federal prison system, rather than the planned \ngoal of 12 percent for fiscal year 1998. Of course, we have learned \nthat overcrowding is unsafe and often leads to institutional \ndisturbances. Mr. President, we should not and we must not risk the \nsafety of our dedicated correctional officers who serve in the Federal \nprisons throughout this country.\n  This shutdown proposal would require the reduction of $110 million \nand at least 280 personnel at the U.S. attorney offices across the \ncountry. This would impact our ability to prosecute violent criminals \nand criminal aliens. In case after case, from the current Oklahoma City \nbombing case in Denver to the World Trade Center bombing case, we turn \nto dedicated assistant U.S. attorneys to represent the people of the \nUnited States. All our investigations by the FBI, DEA and other \nagencies will come to naught; our investigations of the Mafia, drug \ntraffickers, terrorists and violent criminals will be meaningless if we \ncannot rely on our prosecutors to fight in court and gain a conviction \nfor these criminals. This provision would reduce prosecutors, increase \ncaseloads, and delay prosecution.\n  This is a bad idea. This proposal would force the U.S. marshals to \neliminate 61 positions hired in fiscal year 1997. The marshals are \nresponsible for custody of presentenced Federal prisoners, finding \nfugitives, administering the court security program, and protection of \nFederal judges. They have advised us that with this reduction of $28 \nmillion, they would be unable to complete security improvements and \nprojects at prisoner transportation holding areas. Since Oklahoma City, \nwe have tried to build up court security with equipment and security \nguards, and we must not let down our guard.\n  I would be remiss if I did not discuss this proposal's impact on the \nFederal judiciary, our third branch of the Government. In short, the \nimpact would be devastating. It would require a reduction of $425 \nmillion from the budget request for the courts. It would require the \nreduction of over 3,500 positions. The judiciary estimates that \nappellate and district courts would be reduced by almost 1,200 \npositions. There would be reduced staff in courtrooms for filings, \nmotions, pleadings and scheduling of cases. The bankruptcy court's \nclerk's offices would be forced to eliminate approximately 1,000 \nclerks. This reduction would increase the backlog in issuing \ndischarges, closing cases and processing claims. Probation and pretrial \nservices would be reduced by approximately 1,330 positions. The \nsupervision of offenders and defendants would be cut in half. Panel \nattorney payments would have to be suspended as early as July 1998. Mr. \nPresident, what we are talking about is failing to provide for basic \nconstitutional rights like the right to be represented by counsel.\n  For education, the effects of full-year funding for 1998 at 98 \npercent of 1997 levels would also do great harm. College aid would be \ncut by $1.8 billion, 400,000 students would lose Pell grants, 52,000 \nchildren would be cut from Head Start, and aid to 2,000 local school \ndistricts would be cut.\n  For Health and Human Services, dramatic cuts would occur to the NIH, \nRyan White and the Indian Health Service and, moreover, WIC would serve \nseveral hundred thousand fewer women, infants and children in 1998, and \nthe Veterans Administration would have to deny care to 200,000 \nveterans.\n  In the area of transportation safety, the FAA would be unable to hire \nthe\n\n[[Page S4099]]\n\nadditional 500 air traffic controllers, 325 flight inspection and \ncertification personnel and 173 security staff included in the 1998 \nbudget.\n  Why anyone would think that enacting such a measure is a good idea is \nbeyond me. Should we fail to enact one of the 13 bills, this so-called \nautomatic measure would go into effect for up to 1 year, making \nmindless cuts in many beneficial programs like the ones I have \nmentioned, and yet all the while continuing funding in other programs \nthat may have been slated for elimination because they are no longer \nneeded.\n  This is mindless legislating. It is very much like saying because we \nhave missed the deadline for the budget resolution, which we have by \nmore than 2 weeks this year already, we should enact legislation which \nsays we will just use last year's budget resolution minus 2 percent \nacross the board and get on with our business.\n  Furthermore, the same delayed budget resolution has made it highly \nlikely the Senate will be unable to pass all of the appropriations \nbills in a timely fashion and, therefore, highly likely that this \nautomatic provision will be used. This is not to mention the obvious \npossible misuse of the automatic provision which could be employed by \nthe majority if it were intent on cutting certain programs and could \nnot get the minority or the President to go along. All that has to \noccur is for an appropriations bill to conveniently bog down beyond \nOctober 1, and the cuts I have previously mentioned could very \nmagically occur without further consideration by the Appropriations \nCommittee and without any further vote by the Senate.\n  I appreciate the ingenuity and the political acuity demonstrated by \nthe authors of this device, but I would like to remind us all that \nmaking political trump cards on an emergency disaster bill may not be \nappreciated by the American people, especially the disaster victims who \nare waiting for our help.\n  It should be obvious to everyone that this is some kind of political \nploy, else the attempt would not be made to attach it to a bill the \nPresident naturally would find very difficult to veto. In fact, if one \ncan believe what one reads in the press, the reasons for this proposal \nare set out rather starkly in an article which appeared in the April \n18, 1997 issue of a publication called Inside the New Congress. That \npublication discusses this so-called automatic CR provision under a \nheading entitled ``Automatic PR.''\n  Mr. President, I will continue my statement in support of my \namendment on tomorrow. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I understand the concern of the Senator \nfrom West Virginia. I hope that he will then understand why the Senator \nfrom Texas, Senator Hutchison, and I have an amendment to raise the \nspending to a full 100 percent of the previous year rather than 98 \npercent, rather than force the impact that the Senator from West \nVirginia, as always, so eloquently described. So, therefore, I hope \nthat the Senator from West Virginia will have no objection to a \nunanimous-consent request to lay aside his amendment so I can bring up \nmy amendment, No. 112, which calls for 100 percent funding at the \nprevious year's level and, that way, I hope that most of the concerns \nthat the Senator from West Virginia has will be allayed and he then, of \ncourse, hopes that many of his concerns he voiced will be addressed.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the pending \namendment and call up amendment No. 112.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I object for the time being. It might not be \nthat on tomorrow morning I will have objection. I am not sure. I would \njust like----\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to the Senator from West Virginia, if he will \nyield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I, of course, will have to make a motion to table the \namendment of the Senator from West Virginia and ask for an immediate \nvote, because I believe that it is only fair to raise the spending \nlevel to 100 percent. I think that it is important for us to do that. I \nthink the Senator from West Virginia, or his staff, knew that Senator \nHutchison and I had planned on doing that when the original schedule \nwas we were going to bring up his amendment and ours tomorrow morning.\n  So I hope that the Senator from West Virginia will agree to allow our \namendment for 100 percent funding to be considered and his amendment be \nlaid aside.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as I say, I might not object tomorrow \nmorning, but as of now, I would like to object and give the matter a \nlittle thought.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Arizona \nhas the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I intend to talk for quite a while on the \nissue and hope that perhaps sometime this evening the Senator from West \nVirginia will find it agreeable to raise the spending level, which is a \nvery important part of this legislation, to 100 percent.\n  Frankly, I do not understand the rationale of why we cannot go ahead \nand just have that done and move forward with the debate on the issue \nitself. The issue itself is whether we are going to subject the \nAmerican people, citizens, both Federal workers and non-Federal \nworkers, to the hardship and the incredible discomfort and sometimes \nthe wrecking of entire lives as a result of a shutdown of the \nGovernment.\n  In 1995, there were thousands of people in my State, non-Federal \nworkers--non-Federal workers--who, unfortunately, were dislocated \nbecause of the shutdown of the Government and, therefore, not allowed \nto ever recover as the Federal workers were.\n  Some people have questioned what we are trying to do here and why. \nPerhaps their memories are not as good as mine as to the impact on my \nState and the Nation. I received this information from the Office of \nManagement and Budget.\n  The National Park Service facilities were closed. On an average day, \n383,000 people visit National Park Service facilities. Potential per \nday losses for businesses in communities adjacent to national parks \ncould reach $14 million due to reduced recreational tourism.\n  As a result of the closing of Yosemite National Park, Mariposa County \ndeclared a state of emergency and asked Governor Wilson of California \nto declare the county an economic disaster area and, therefore, \neligible for State aid.\n  Access to and use of national forests was restricted. The Forest \nService-operated campgrounds, monuments and visitor centers were closed \nin the 155 national forests. No timber sales activities, including \npreparation, advertising and award of sales, occurred. Harvesting \ncontinued for sales awarded prior to the shutdown.\n  FHA mortgages and housing vouchers were halted. On an average day, \nthe Federal Housing Administration processes 2,500 home purchase loans \nand refinancing totaling $230 million worth of mortgage loans for \nmoderate- and low-income working families nationwide.\n  Last January of 1996, HUD was unable to renew 49,000 vouchers and \nother section 8 rental subsidies for low- and moderate-income \nhouseholds, which could have led to the eviction of those families.\n  Applications for passports were not processed. Foreign visitors were \nunable to obtain visas. On an average day, the State Department \nreceives 23,000 applications for passports. On an average day, the \nState Department issues 20,000 visas to visitors, who spend an average \nof $3,000 on their trips, for a total of $60 million. Foreign students \nstudying in the United States and home for the holidays were unable to \nobtain visas to return to the United States for their classes.\n  Veterans' benefits were not delivered. When the continuing resolution \nprovided funding for certain benefits and payments, it expired and \nconsequently contractors providing services and supplies to hospitals \nwere not paid and benefits for January were not paid in February.\n  In addition, approximately 170,000 veterans did not receive their \nDecember Montgomery GI bill education benefits and did not receive \nbenefits in January. Funding had lapsed for processing veterans' \nclaims, for rehabilitation counseling, and veterans were unable to \nobtain VA guaranteed home loans.\n\n[[Page S4100]]\n\n  Programs for the elderly were at risk. Some 600,000 elderly Americans \nfaced the loss of Meals on Wheels, transportation, and personal care \nprovided by the Health and Human Services Administration on Aging \nbecause the continuing resolution was not passed.\n  Contractors that handled Medicare claims were not paid. Approximately \n24,000 contracting employees were involved in paying Medicare claims \nwhich averages about $3.5 billion per week, and most had to self-\nfinance payrolls and other expenses or stop their activities. Federal \nfunds to States for Medicaid were limited and will be limited in the \ncase of another shutdown. In December 22 States received only 40 \npercent of the estimated quarterly payment for Medicaid. Without \nfurther action, the Federal match for Medicaid and its 36 million \nbeneficiaries, including 18 million children, would have run out in \nlate January.\n  Mr. President, I intend to talk more about the impact of the shutdown \nlast time and the potential impact this time of a shutdown.\n  Let me just say that in some quarters, the Congress of the United \nStates is not held in the highest esteem. When we shut down the \nGovernment because of our failure to agree with the President of the \nUnited States, that esteem plummets even further. What we did to the \nAmerican people, average citizens who had no control over the \nsituation, in December of 1995, is unconscionable and should not and \ncannot be repeated.\n  The whole purpose of what Senator Hutchison and I are trying to do, \nwith the able leadership and assistance of the Senator from Alaska, is \nto make sure it does not happen again. We cannot let this kind of thing \nhappen again. Too many innocent lives are injured and harmed \npermanently.\n  I understand the very eloquent statement of the Senator from West \nVirginia about what a shutdown would do at 98 percent. That is why the \nSenator from Texas and I are willing to raise it to 100 percent of the \nprevious year's funding. Every program will be funded at the previous \nyear's funding level until such time as there is agreement.\n  Mr. President, there are many other arguments that have been made \nagainst this shutdown-of-the-Government provision, one of them being \nperhaps there would be no incentive for the executive branch and \nlegislative branch to agree on an appropriations bill.\n  We all know that there are many, many issues addressed in \nappropriations bills, far more than I would like, many of which I have \ncomplained about from time to time. There are policy changes, if I may \nbe so crass, a great deal of earmarked spending which I have objected \nto from time to time.\n  It is still clearly in the interest for there to be an agreement. And \nit is still clearly in our interest to work together with the President \nof the United States. But, Mr. President, the option of such \nirresponsible behavior on the part of both branches that we would shut \ndown the Government again is not thinkable and inexcusable, and I will \nnot be a party--I will not be a party--to a situation again where the \ncitizens of my State, who I am responsible for, when I have that \nresponsibility will suffer as they did.\n  I note that the Senator from Wyoming is in the chair as the Presiding \nOfficer. He knows the devastation that was wreaked in the national \npark--I believe Grand Teton in Jackson Hole--when the national park was \nshut down. We cannot have that repetition, and will not. And I would \nhope that the administration would continue to negotiate with us so we \ncan avoid this and at the same time come to an agreement where we can \nprevent a future shutdown of the Government.\n  I would hope that the Senator from West Virginia would change his \nmind and agree to setting aside his amendment so that we may take up \nthe 100 percent funding. And I intend to make that motion in a very \nshort time again.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from \nArizona for his leadership in this area, because actually the Senator \nfrom Arizona and I have talked about this ever since the Government \nshutdown and then last year when we did not have a shutdown, but it \nreally was not the normal course of negotiations when you get toward \nthat September 30 deadline.\n  We have a freestanding bill that will in fact take care of the needs \nof Government after September 30, if we do not have an appropriations \nagreement. But then when we started looking at the fact that this is \nthe supplemental appropriations bill, the first bill that has really \nhit the floor from the Appropriations Committee--it is May--if we \nwaited much later than this I think perhaps agencies could say, ``Well, \nbut we can't plan.''\n  I think it is important that the Federal agencies know exactly what \nis going to happen. I think it is important that we lay the groundwork \nin the first bill that we have on the floor in May before the September \n30 deadline of how the process of appropriations is really going to \nwork.\n  So that is why Senator McCain and I introduced this, which we \nactually thought and hoped would have bipartisan support. We thought \nthat if we did something that would say this is the way we are going to \ndo it, if we put it on the table, that everybody would agree, because \nclearly no one wants to shut down Government. The President certainly \ndoes not. I am sure the distinguished minority leader from North Dakota \ndoes not. I am sure that Senator Byrd from West Virginia would not want \nto shut down the Government, and neither do any of us.\n  So what we are trying to do is say, how can we accomplish this in an \norderly way? Senator McCain and I and Senator Lott and Senator Stevens \nbelieve that this is the time to do it, so that we are not talking in \nthe heat of a negotiation that is not going well on September the 29th \nof this year. What we are saying is we are going to run Government \nresponsibly.\n  We had 98 percent of the 1997 expenditure level. Since that original \namendment was filed, there has been a budget agreement. There has been \na budget agreement between the President and Congress that has yet to \npass Congress but nevertheless it is laying some parameters of higher \nspending levels going into 1998. But what we do not have is exactly \nwhat the policy is going to be in that 1998 level of expenditure. So \nthere still is going to be negotiation about where the appropriations \ngo within an agency's budget and what the policies might be.\n  So it is very important that we continue to work on making sure that \nwe do not have a Government shutdown because there may be legitimate \ndisagreements that cannot be solved by September 30. Of course, we hope \nthey will be solved, but we all have seen that many times this has not \nhappened because we have a President who is a Democrat and we have a \nCongress that is Republican, and sometimes our priorities are \ndifferent. And we need the ability to negotiate in good faith without \nthe hammer of a shutdown of Government over our heads.\n  So since we had the budget agreement that came into play that does \nhave higher spending levels for 1998, Senator McCain and I are willing \nto go from 98 percent to 100 percent, because letting the agencies \ncontinue to spend at the same levels that they are spending now seems \nto be reasonable since we now know that the levels will be higher.\n  There was a time last year when the President submitted his budget \nthat the spending levels were not higher. Congress, in its original \nbudget resolution, did not have the same 1998 level of expenditures. \nThey are higher. So now that we know that, I think the 100 percent of \npresent spending is certainly reasonable.\n  You know, I go back to what I said in the first place. If you cannot \ncontinue to run Government at a 2 percent discount or 100 percent of \nwhat you had last year, then you probably should not be managing a \nFederal agency because everybody has had to cut their budgets from time \nto time. They have had to cut them a lot more than 2 percent in small \nbusinesses around our country, in families that are trying to make ends \nmeet because they have two kids in college at the same time. People \nhave to stretch. And they do not quite understand why their hard-earned \ntax dollars are out there and we cannot cut\n\n[[Page S4101]]\n\nback 2 percent on Government expenditures that are actually their \nexpenditures because they are paying for this Government.\n  But 100 percent, since we are going to be going to higher levels, is \nfine and I can go along with that. I am certainly willing to try to \nmake sure that we do not disrupt Government, but I think we need to \ntake the step. I think we need to go forward and say, here is how we \nare going to run the appropriations process. I think every American can \nunderstand that if we do not have the ability to negotiate, without the \nthreat of shutting down Government, that we are not going to be able to \nstand on our principles. Perhaps the President does not feel that he \ncan stand on his principles. And we would like to be able to do that \nand come to terms in the normal course of business.\n  So that is why we are trying to plan ahead. That is why we are trying \nto make sure that the Government is not shut down, that Federal \nemployees who would like to come to work, but cannot because it is a \nlaw that they cannot, are not in any way put to the test of wondering \nif they are going to be able to make ends meet because their salary \nwill not be there. I cannot imagine, in my wildest dreams, that \nCongress would not pay the salaries of people who would like to come to \nwork but cannot because of some artificial deadline that says \nGovernment stops if we do not have an appropriations bill.\n  So we are trying to keep that from happening so that Federal \nemployees will not be forced to take leave, so that veterans will not \nworry whether their benefits are going to be there, so that people who \nare traveling back from college to home will not be unable to do that \nbecause perhaps they do not have their passport, so that people will \nnot be inconvenienced with their long-awaited family vacation to the \nGrand Canyon or the Washington Monument. I think it is important that \nwe take this process step.\n  There is one other point I think is very important to make. And \nSenator Stevens has made it many times on the floor, but I think it \nbears repeating, because there is somehow the implication that the \nflood victims in North Dakota, with whom all of us have great sympathy, \nmight not get the payments they need to start rebuilding.\n  In fact, Mr. President, they are getting the money now. There is no \nholdup in the emergency money that the flood victims are getting for \nrebuilding their homes or their office buildings. In fact, they are \ngetting that money now. What we are talking about is a supplemental \nappropriations that would refill the coffers of the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency so that it will be ready for the next emergency. And \nwe are trying to make sure that we cover all the expenditures that we \nare having to make right now.\n  But does anyone, for 1 minute, think that the loan processors and the \npeople who are processing the claims of the flood victims in North \nDakota are sitting there waiting for an appropriations bill to come \nthrough? Does anyone really believe that that is not going forward \nright now? I hope not, because nothing could be further from the truth.\n  In fact, the Federal Emergency Management Agency is on the job. They \nare on the spot. They are beginning to rebuild in North Dakota. And the \nmoney is there for them, as it should be. But what we are talking about \nis making sure that the money that is being spent now is replenished. \nSo we have time to do this in the right way.\n  I think many people are concerned that there are other parts of this \nbill besides the emergency appropriations supplemental for North Dakota \nflood victims and for the people who are serving in Bosnia that--in \nfact, I would just make the same point for those in Bosnia who are \nserving there. They are not not getting what they would have. It is not \nas if this billion dollars that we are appropriating is going to do \nsomething that they do not now have. We are giving our young men and \nwomen who are protecting our country--if they are deployed to Bosnia on \nthat mission, they are getting everything that they need to do that \njob.\n  But what we are talking about in this supplemental appropriations is \nreplenishing the money that has been taken out of the Department of \nDefense for training, for equipment, for spare parts, for quality of \nlife issues, such as housing and pay raises for our military.\n  We are putting the money back in that has been spent from the \nDepartment of Defense. And the Department of Defense does indeed need \nthat money. And we are going to make sure that it goes in so that we do \nnot interrupt the training and the equipment purchases and the spare \nparts purchases and the airplane purchases that are needed for our \nDefense Department.\n\n  So we are replenishing the coffers, but no one that is on a mission \nin Bosnia or a flood victim in North Dakota is not getting the services \nthat have been authorized in previous legislation, previous bills for \nthe Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n  So I want to make sure that everyone understands the money is going \nout. But there are some concerns among many of our colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle about some of the other parts of the bill. There are \nsome clearly nonemergency, nonsupplemental needs that are being met in \nthis bill. And I think some people are questioning whether maybe that \nshould be put off to an appropriations process that is not in any way \nsupplemental but is just the normal course of business.\n  So I think certainly debate is warranted. We do not want to in any \nway rush something through, because the people that need this money are \ngetting the money that they need. I hope that we will be able to move \nforward on this.\n  I hope that at some point all of us will be able to vote on a \ncontinuing resolution that will assure that our Government goes along \nin an orderly way, that we also are able to negotiate in an orderly way \non September 30 of this year if we do still have differences. We need \nto provide for those differences in an orderly way. And that is what \nour bill is trying to do.\n  I certainly appreciate the leadership of the Senator from Arizona. I \nam certainly with him on the McCain-Hutchison Government Shutdown \nPrevention Act which we believe very strongly is a matter of principle, \nit is a matter of responsible Government, it is a matter of fulfilling \nour responsibility to the Federal employees who serve our country, to \nthe men and women in uniform that serve our country, to the people of \nour country who depend on Government services, such as running the \nparks and passports and veterans' benefits. All of these people deserve \nto know that we will make sure that they are taken care of in an \norderly way, even if we have not been able to come to agreements on \nsome appropriations bills by September 30.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I certainly appreciate once again the Senator from Arizona coming up \nand trying to make sure that we talk about this in an orderly way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I want to thank the Senator from Texas for her commitment \nto the people of her State and her efforts now for a long time to make \nsure that never again do we put the American people through the trauma \nof a Government shutdown.\n  I, as a conservative, believe in a minimal role of Government, but I \nam not a Libertarian. I do believe that there is a role for Government, \nand that is to provide basic and fundamental services to our citizens. \nThat did not happen during the Government shutdown. I think we have an \nobligation to see that it does not happen again.\n  Mr. President, I want to point out again, we have been in \nnegotiations with the White House on this issue. I believe the \nPresident of the United States, along with the Senator from West \nVirginia, who has many Federal workers in his State and many people who \nare dependent on the Federal Government, does not want another shutdown \nof the Government. I am still hopeful that at some point before we have \na real showdown here and a possible veto of this very much needed \nsupplemental appropriations bill, emergency supplemental appropriations \nbill, that we can get an agreement worked out that would prevent a \nshutdown of the Government ever again.\n\n[[Page S4102]]\n\n  I have a lot to say, and I know that the Senator from West Virginia \ndoes, too. In fact, we were discussing the outlines of a unanimous \nconsent agreement where the Senator from West Virginia would consume \nabout 2\\1/2\\ hours tomorrow on this issue before we would vote on it. I \nlook forward to that debate. I do not think we will need that much \ntime.\n  I always pay attention to the arguments and discussions of the issues \nas articulated by the Senator from West Virginia. There is no one more \nrespected in this body than the Senator from West Virginia. Some day he \nmay leave, I am sure it will be after I do, but if and when he ever \ndoes, we will lose the corporate memory and the standards of conduct \nand behavior that was handed down to us by our predecessors. That flame \nis kept alive by the Senator from West Virginia. Over the past 10 years \nwhen I have been in the Senate in the company of the Senator from West \nVirginia, we have engaged in spirited but always respectful debate, \noccasionally on issues that the Senator from West Virginia feels the \nmost passionate about--the line-item veto, of course, comes to mind.\n  I must admit again--I am almost sorry I brought it up--but I must \nadmit again that the Senator from West Virginia has won the first \nround, a major victory in a Supreme Court decision concerning the line-\nitem veto. I say to my friend from West Virginia the words of the \nfamous philosopher Casey Stengel, ``It isn't over till it's over,'' and \nI am glad the U.S. Supreme Court has expedited their procedures to give \nus a final rendering on this issue.\n  I yield to the Senator from Texas for a question.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I correct the Record, because it was \nin fact the great philosopher Yogi Berra who said, ``It ain't over till \nit's over.'' I did not want that to go unchallenged.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Texas, who is always in tune \nwith the world's great philosophers, for correcting me on that, and I \nappreciate that.\n  But back to the issue at hand, I hope the Senator from West Virginia \nrecognizes that I do take to heart his admonitions concerning a 98-\npercent funding as opposed to a full funding. It is clearly our \nintention to make this 100 percent funding, and that we could debate \nthis issue on those parameters. I think it would be not as useful for \nus to be conducting this debate on this issue of the Prevention of the \nShutdown of Government Act under conditions which would not prevail in \nthe event of a final vote on this issue.\n  I respectfully, again, request the Senator from West Virginia if he \nwould allow me to raise this to 100 percent and perhaps we could \nadjourn and discuss this issue tomorrow where we would have more \nattention from our colleagues and the American people. I do not mind \ndebating and discussing this issue tonight, and the Senator from West \nVirginia and I have spent many evenings in debate and discussion, but I \nthink with the importance of this issue, that it deserves tomorrow \nwhere we have, frankly, our friends in the media who will pay more \nattention and perhaps report this issue to the American people in a \nmore accurate fashion than tonight.\n  So, having said all that, I request of my friend from West Virginia \nif I could make a unanimous consent agreement to set aside the pending \namendment and call up amendment 112 for purposes of consideration and \nvoice vote, and then return to the amendment of the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object, first of all, I appreciate \nvery much the kind remarks that the distinguished Senator from Arizona \nhas made in my direction. I can reciprocate by saying there is no \nSenator in this body who works harder, and few, perhaps, who work as \nhard and as effectively as does the distinguished Senator from Arizona. \nHe amazes me with his ability to come up with amendments on almost \nevery bill, and he seems to be conversant on virtually any subject to \ncome before the Senate. I admire him for that.\n  Mr. President, whether it is 98 percent or 100 percent, I have to \noppose such an amendment. I join with the Senator in expressing the \nhope that we can discuss this tomorrow where we, hopefully, will have a \nlarger audience.\n  I prefer not to accede to his request tonight. I have lined up \nseveral speakers who are ready to speak on this language that is in the \nbill, and that is the language I attempted to strike in the committee \nearlier when we had markup. The Senator will get a vote one way or \nanother on his proposal, I am sure. I hope, however, he would not press \nthe request tonight, and let us return in the morning and think about \nit overnight. It may be I would accede to the request then, or I might \nnot. But whether I do, he will find ways to get a vote on his \namendment, or, as he says, he will move to table mine. He has several \nalternatives open to him. I hope we would not press the matter tonight, \nand we will come back, and, after a good night's rest, I will be \nprepared to take another look at it.\n  So I am constrained to object tonight, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am, of course, disappointed in the \nresponse of the Senator from West Virginia. I guess at this time I have \nto contemplate an amendment to table the motion of the Senator from \nWest Virginia based on the grounds that if other speakers came and \nspoke on this issue, Mr. President, they would not be speaking about it \nin its entirety, in its actuality, when the entire Senate would decide \non this issue.\n  In fact, I have already gotten a taste of that debate by saying that \nit would make all these draconian cuts to different programs, et \ncetera. I do not feel it is appropriate not to have an agreement that \nwe should debate the issue as the Senator from Texas and I intended. I \nsay that with all respect. I do not think it is appropriate not to have \na debate and discussion until the true parameters and the intention of \nthe sponsors of the amendment are taken into consideration.\n  So, Mr. President, in a moment I will suggest the absence of a quorum \nand then decide as to whether I will move to table, and call for a \nrecorded vote at this time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant \nlegislative clerk proceeded to call.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We had almost arranged for an amendment to be called up \nat 9 o'clock, to be voted on at 10 o'clock, and I discussed with \nSenator Byrd, does the Senator have any objection if we set aside this \nsituation now and took up that other amendment and have it argued \nbetween 9 o'clock and 10 o'clock and come back to this amendment at 10 \no'clock.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think that would be a reasonable compromise. I thank \nthe Senator for his indulgence.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am informed another Senator involved in that cannot be \nhere before 10 o'clock.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I do not see any other option I have except to move to \ntable the amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, under the circumstances, under the \ninformal agreements we have entered into before, I ask the vote on that \nmotion to table be carried over until 10 o'clock in the morning; is \nthat agreeable?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The vote will not occur tonight, and we will try to work \nin another amendment and take up this vote on this motion to table at a \nlater time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say, in due respect to the Senator from Alaska, I \ncannot agree at this moment that we will not have a recorded vote on a \nmotion to table tonight. I have to reserve that right.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is correct, because we still have to ask for \nunanimous consent, Senator, and we have not gotten that. I stated that \nis our intent not to have a vote tonight. We will try to work out this \ntriangle and see if we can get the other amendment in before the vote, \nand if we can, we will do our best.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant \nlegislative clerk proceeded to call.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S4103]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to make it clear to the Senator \nfrom West Virginia that I am not trying to preclude debate and \ndiscussion on his amendment, and I would like to have an agreement \nwhich would allow, obviously, what the Senator from Texas and I are \nseeking, and that is raising to a 100 percent level, but also I would \nnot presume, after all these years, to make a motion to table which \nwould prevent the Senator from West Virginia in making full use of \nwhatever time he feels necessary to debate this very important issue. I \nwant to make that clear.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for his \ncharacteristic courtesy and generosity. I would hope that we could wait \nuntil tomorrow so we could have more time, so that others on my side \ncould be here to participate in the debate. And may I say, it may very \nwell be that, by the time the sun rises on tomorrow, I may decide to \nremove my objection and let the Senator proceed with his amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. May I inquire if the Senator would agree that we could \ncome in and start the debate earlier? I know the Senator didn't want to \nvote until later because of other Senators' arrival. Would the Senator \nagree that we could come back on the bill before 10? We are trying to \nfinish by 6 o'clock tomorrow night. So the proceedings at that time \ncould start.\n  Mr. BYRD. Could we begin at 9:30?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would be delighted. I shall convey that to the leader. \nThat will not be a vote; that will be continued debate.\n  Mr. BYRD. Exactly. Leave everything in the status quo until that \nmoment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We have other agreements we may get tonight pertaining \nto other Members. I will go back to a quorum call if everybody is \nfinished.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment of the Senator from West Virginia be set aside and the \namendment which is at the desk, No. 112, be called up for immediate \nconsideration.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. I hope that \nthe Senator will simply ask unanimous consent that the ``98 percent'' \nbe changed to ``100 percent'' so that my amendment may not be set \naside.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be raised from ``98 percent'' to ``100 percent'' of funding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. For clarification, the words ``98 percent'' \nappear on line 19 of page 81; is that where you are changing that?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes. I asked that it be changed to 100 percent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous-consent \nrequest?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, again, I thank the Senator from West \nVirginia, as always, for his courtesy. I look forward to a spirited \nelocution and informative debate on tomorrow.\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to associate myself with comments \nmade previously by my colleagues, Senator McCain and Senator Hutchison. \nI rise in support of the Government Shutdown Prevention Act and the \nefforts to add this to the supplemental appropriations bill. This \nprovision will create a statutory continuing resolution to safeguard \nFederal and military pay in the event of a Government shutdown. \nFurther, it would provide for continuing appropriations for key \nGovernment functions in the event of a spending impasse like we \nsuffered in 1995.\n  This provision, when attached to the emergency supplemental, will \nonly take effect if the appropriations acts do not become law or if \nthere is no continuing resolution in place at the beginning of the new \nfiscal year on October 1.\n  Although I am a strong supporter of the balanced budget and the \nreconciliation process, I am deeply concerned that our Federal \nemployees could again be held hostage to the politics of the budget \nprocess between the Congress and the administration. Our Nation's \ndedicated civilian and uniformed Federal personnel should never again \nbe penalized for the inability of Congress and the administration to \nagree on spending priorities.\n  As stated in a 1991 GAO report on Government shutdowns, closing the \nGovernment does not save money. In fact, the GAO reported that a mere \n3-day workweek shutdown would cost taxpayers between $245 and $600 \nmillion. In this time of tight budgetary constraints, such \nirresponsible actions make no sense.\n  Mr. President, with more than 300,000 Federal employees and retirees \nin the Commonwealth of Virginia, the effects of a Government shutdown, \neven one of a short duration, would be devastating to our local \neconomy.\n  The impact of the shutdown over the 1996 Federal budget spread beyond \njust our Federal employees in the metropolitan Washington region. It \ncaused a ripple effect well beyond the Capital Beltway. From trips \ncanceled due to lack of passports; to the closure of our National Parks \nand the economic impact on those communities who depend on tourists for \ntheir economic well-being; to our prisons and VA hospitals that must \nask vendors to supply food on credit--the shutdown created havoc.\n  Federal employee are not the only group that is affected by a Federal \nGovernment shutdown. Thousands of companies, who contract with the \nGovernment, would be impacted unless a safety net is in place. These \nfirms are dependent upon revenues for services and goods rendered, in \norder to keep their doors open and to continue paying their employees.\n  By an overwhelming majority, the American people are still fearful of \nthe reoccurrence of a Government shutdown. Our Federal employees \nremember November 14, 1995, and the following 6-day shutdown as \nCongress feuded over the 1996 Federal budget, at a total cost to the \ntaxpayer of $800 million. They remember December 15, 1995, when the \nGovernment shut down again, this time for 21 days, at a total cost of \n$520 million.\n  I applaud the Republican leadership of Senator McCain and Senator \nHutchison. By providing this safety net against a potential trainwreck, \nwe are changing the way that Government does business. We cannot \ncontinue business as usual when we play politics and appear cavalier in \nattitude toward our Federal employees--both civilian and military.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, the bill before us addresses the effects \nof natural disasters which occurred in the Midwest and California. I \nwould like, right now, to address a portion of the bill that is \ndesigned to prevent a man-made disaster. That provision, the safety net \ncontinuing resolution for fiscal year 1998, would, as Senator McCain \nhas made clear, prevent a Government shutdown in the event the regular \nannual appropriation bills are not enacted into law by October 1.\n  Mr. President, just over a year ago, on April 26, 1996, President \nClinton signed legislation which ended a 7 month budget stalemate. That \nstalemate involved no fewer than 15 continuing resolutions, 2 full-\nfledged Government shutdowns--one lasting a record 27 days--and \nnumerous Presidential vetoes. By President Clinton's own account, it \ncost the taxpayers $1.5 billion.\n  But the costs of this shutdown went beyond this $1.5 billion. \nThousands upon thousands of Federal employees were furloughed. \nThousands of small businesses, particularly those near national parks \nclosed during the Government shutdown, suffered crippling loss of \nbusiness. And American citizens suffered innumerable inconveniences, \nmany of them quite serious.\n  For example, Mr. President, 10,000 new Medicare applications, 212,000 \nSocial Security card requests, 360,000 individual office visits and \n800,000 toll-\n\n[[Page S4104]]\n\nfree calls for information and assistance were turned away each day. \nHundreds of thousands of ordinary Americans were inconvenienced, or had \nto temporarily forego benefits for which the Government requires things \nlike Social Security cards, because we could not reach a budget \nagreement.\n\n  And the problems did not stop there. Some of our most vulnerable \npeople suffered from the Government shutdown: 13 million AFDC \nrecipients, 273,000 foster care children, over 100,000 children \nreceiving adoption assistance services and over 100,000 Head Start \nchildren had their services delayed. And I have not even mentioned the \n9 million Americans whose vacations and outings were ruined because \nthey were turned away from our national parks and museums.\n  Mr. President, we must prevent this situation from occurring ever \nagain. The Government shutdown caused inconvenience, occasional trauma, \nand a wide-spread increase in the cynicism of the American people, now \nmore convinced than ever that our executive and legislative branches of \nGovernment are incapable of doing their jobs.\n  We can do our jobs, Mr. President, and we must see to it that we do \nthem without allowing the Federal Government to again shut down. We \nmust come to grips with the fact that, under current rules, Government \nshutdowns are a risk that must be addressed. 1995 was not the first \nyear in which we had a Government shutdown. Over the last 20 years \nthere have been numerous such occurrences, and even more numerous \nstopgap funding bills passed at the last minute to prevent them.\n  Part of the problem Mr. President, is our complicated budget process. \nAs currently constituted, this process seems designed to confuse the \npeople as they seek to understand what we are doing and exactly who is \nholding up agreement. In addition, Mr. President, the American people \nhave elected divided government. They have chosen a President with one \nset of priorities, and a majority in Congress that in some ways has \nsignificantly different priorities.\n\n  As a result of a convoluted process and conflicting priorities, we \nare in the midst of a 2-year budget stalemate. I sincerely hope that \nthe budget agreement announced on Friday will produce tax relief for \nthe American people, a balanced budget by 2002, sufficient funding for \nour national defense, and much-needed spending restraint. If it \nincludes these things, Mr. President, we may at last see an end to the \nbudget stalemate.\n  But we cannot sit idly by in the hope that all will be well. We can \nand must strive in the meantime to ensure that this year no shutdown \nwill occur even if the budget deal breaks down.\n  That is why I am urging my colleagues to support provisions in this \ncontinuing resolution that would put a safety net under our Government, \nand under the American people. It would create a statutory continuing \nresolution, triggered only if the appropriations acts do not become law \nor if there is no governing continuing resolution in place. This \nlegislation would ensure that the Government does not shut down by \nfunding Government programs next year at 98 percent.\n  What this means, Mr. President, is that the Federal Government, in \ncase of a budget impasse, would be funded at a level sufficient to \ncontinue essential services--sufficient to prevent any real \ninconvenience to the American people--without undermining the incentive \nto pass appropriations bills on time.\n  It is my hope that we will not need this provision. It is my \nconviction that we should enact it so that the American people will \ncontinue to receive the services they expect from their Federal \nGovernment even if there is a budget impasse. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this important, safety net provision.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my pending \namendment be set aside temporarily.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in the bill insert the following \n     new language:\n       Sec.   . Section 45301(b)(1)(A) of title 49, United States \n     Code, is amended inserting before the semicolon ``and at \n     least $50,000,000 in FY 1998 and every year thereafter''.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the \nproponents of amendments Nos. 95 and 96 agree to this language. This \nnew language is to be a substitute for the proposals before the body \nregarding international flight user fees. It has been agreed to by both \nsides and, therefore, is ready for passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 235) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/07/senate-section/article/S4082-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, last Friday's Wall Street Journal \npublished the results of an April 1997 poll it conducted with NBC News. \nOne of the questions in the survey deserves special attention.\n\n[[Page S4105]]\n\n  The poll asked whether the American people support increasing \ncigarette taxes by 43 cents a pack, and returning much of the revenues \nto the States to provide health care for the Nation's uninsured \nchildren.\n  An overwhelming 72 percent of the respondents favored this proposal, \nwhich is contained in the legislation that Senator Hatch and I \nintroduced last month.\n  The detailed breakdown of the responses shows that the plan has broad \nsupport among people of all ages, incomes, races, educational \nbackgrounds, party affiliations, and geographic regions. Support is at \nleast two-to-one in all 36 groups, and it is three-to-one or even four-\nto-one in 17 of the groups.\n  North and South, East and West, the American people support the \nHatch-Kennedy bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the detailed breakdown of the Wall \nStreet Journal-NBC News poll may be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Question: Two Senators, a Republican and a Democrat, have \n     proposed increasing cigarette taxes by 43 cents a pack, and \n     giving much of the money raised to help states provide health \n     insurance for uninsured children.

Mr. President, the Conservation Reserve Program, a \nprogram vitally important to my State and many others, has recently \nbeen threatened on many fronts. I would like to make clear my \nintentions and views on several matters relating to the CRP.\n  Last week Congressman Bob Smith was successful in passing H.R. 1342, \nlegislation requiring USDA to reenroll winter crop land not accepted in \nthe new CRP for one year. For the record, H.R. 1342 has received strong \nsupport from producers in my State and like Chairman Smith, I, too, am \nvery concerned for winter crop producers throughout the country. \nUnfortunately, we have received a loud message from the President that \nhe strongly objects to the bill and would veto the measure if passed by \nCongress.\n  Knowing the President would veto H.R. 1342, I felt it necessary, at \nthe very least, to send a letter to Secretary Glickman requesting that \nhe permit producers to begin preparing CRP ground immediately for fall \nplanting. I would like producers in my State to know that I will \ncontinue to work with Secretary Glickman to see that he addresses this \nproblem. Further, let it be known, that I will oppose any attempt to \ncap or earmark enrollments to the Conservation Reserve Program.\n  Yesterday, 13 Senators joined me in sending a letter to Secretary \nGlickman outlining 3 critical issues concerning the Conservation \nReserve Program. Let me now outline the issues raised in the letter.\n  First, producers throughout the country are currently faced with \nserious uncertainty as to whether or not their bids to enroll land in \nthe CRP will be accepted. I believe it is very important for Secretary \nGlickman to notify producers this month whether their offers are \naccepted. I understand that Secretary Glickman is sympathetic to this \nproblem and has announced he will notify all producers by late May. I \nhave expressed my concern to Secretary Glickman and have encouraged him \nto allow producers to immediately begin preparing their land for fall \nplanting of winter crops without penalty. This will allow producers to \nbegin ground preparation in the event they are not accepted into the \nprogram. Producers in my State are concerned they will not have enough \ntime nor enough moisture in the ground to grow winter crops if they do \nnot begin preparing their land immediately. Simply put, time is running \nout for producers in my State. I understand that Secretary Glickman is \nwilling to help solve this problem and I am hopeful that he will \naddress this situation in a timely fashion.\n  Second, the House Appropriations Committee has placed a provision in \nthe Emergency Disaster Supplemental bill capping CRP enrollments at 14 \nmillion acres. Many Senators, including myself, believe that this cap \nthreatens the environmental commitment we made when we passed, and the \nPresident enacted, the 1996 Farm Bill. As a member of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, I will work hard to see that this provision \nis omitted during the Emergency Disaster Supplemental Conference.\n  Third, the President has proposed reducing CRP enrollments by 2 \nmillion acres to pay for the development rights of Crown Butte, Inc. I \nbelieve, as do many other Senators, that any cap or reduction in CRP \nenrollments would jeopardize the commitment Congress made to improve \nwater quality, enhance wildlife habitat, and reduce wind and soil \nerosion.\n  In closing, I thank my colleagues for their support. The CRP is a \nvitally important program and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues and Secretary Glickman as we address these concerns.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous connsent that our letter to Secretary \nGlickman be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n            Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 6, 1997.\n     Hon. Dan Glickman,\n     Secretary of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: We are writing to bring to your \n     attention three matters of concern regarding the Conservation \n     Reserve Program (CRP).\n       First, it is critically important that you fulfill the \n     pledge you made in your April 29 letter to House Agriculture \n     Committee Chairman Bob Smith that producers will be notified \n     by late May of whether their offers to enroll land in the CRP \n     have been accepted. As you are well aware, growers whose \n     offers are not accepted into the program will not have enough \n     time, nor the appropriate weather conditions, to prepare \n     their current CRP acreage for fall planting. We understand \n     that you are sympathetic to this unfortunate predicament and \n     ask that you rectify this situation immediately. We seek your \n     prompt approval of ground preparation practices necessary for \n     fall planting of winter crops on all expiring CRP acreage \n     without loss of payments. Specifically, we request that \n     producers be permitted to remove cover crops without penalty \n     beginning immediately.\n       Second, we applaud your opposition to any effort that would \n     cap or earmark CRP enrollments. Like you, we believe the \n     provision by the House Appropriations Committee to cap CRP \n     enrollments at 14 million acres would jeopardize USDA's \n     efforts to improve water quality, enhance wildlife habitat, \n     reduce wind and soil erosion, and enroll additional acres \n     under the Department's continuous signup initiative. We will \n     be working hard to see that this provision, or any similar \n     effort, is struck during the Emergency Supplemental \n     Appropriations Conference. We welcome your support in this \n     effort.\n       Third, we do not support President Clinton's proposal to \n     reduce CRP enrollment by 2 million acres to pay for the \n     development rights of Crown Butte Mines, Inc. We believe that \n     limiting CRP enrollments would threaten the substantial \n     environmental commitment we made when Congress passed and the \n     President enacted the Federal Agriculture Improvement and \n     Reform Act of 1996.\n       We strongly encourage you to address the time sensitive \n     nature of our request. Winter crop producers throughout the \n     country are in serious jeopardy and if they so choose, should \n     be allowed to prepare their land for fall planting \n     immediately.\n       We look forward to hearing from you and appreciate your \n     support for an extremely important program.\n           Sincerely,\n     Richard G. Lugar.\n\n[[Page S4106]]\n\n     Slade Gorton.\n     Gordon Smith.\n     Dirk Kempthorne.\n     Patty Murray.\n     Sam Brownback.\n     Chuck Hagel.\n     Tom Harkin.\n     Larry E.

A bill to protect private property rights guaranteed by the \nfifth amendment to the Constitution by requiring Federal agencies to \nprepare private property taking impact analyses and by allowing \nexpanded access to Federal courts; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n\n\n               THE PRIVATE PROPERTY FAIRNESS ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Private \nProperty Fairness Act of 1997. This bill will\n\n[[Page S4107]]\n\nhelp ensure that when the Government issues regulations for the benefit \nof the public as a whole, it does not saddle just a few landowners with \nthe whole cost of compliance. This bill will help enforce the U.S. \nConstitution's guarantee that the Federal Government cannot take \nprivate property without paying just compensation to the owner.\n  The dramatic growth in Federal regulation in recent decades has \nfocused attention on a very murky area of property law, a regulatory \narea in which the law of takings is not yet settled to the satisfaction \nof most Americans.\n  The bottom line is that the law in this area is unfair. For example, \nif the Government condemns part of a farm to build a highway, it has to \npay the farmer for the value of his land. But if the Government \nrequires that same farmer stop growing crops on that same land in order \nto protect endangered species or conserve wetlands, the farmer gets no \ncompensation. In both situations the Government has acted to benefit \nthe general public and, in the process, has imposed a cost on the \nfarmer. In both cases, the land is taken out of production and the \nfarmer loses income. But only in the highway example is the farmer \ncompensated for his loss. In the regulatory example, the farmer, or any \nother landowner, has to absorb all of the cost himself. This is not \nfair.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is an important step toward \nproviding relief from these so-called regulatory takings. I know my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Hatch, intends to introduce an omnibus \nprivate property rights bill, and I look forward to working with him. \nMy bill is a narrowly tailored approach that will make a real \ndifference for property owners across America. It protects private \nproperty rights in two ways. First, it puts in place procedures that \nwill stop or minimize takings by the Federal Government before they \noccur. The Government would have to jump a much higher hurdle before it \ncan restrict the use of someone's privately owned property. For the \nfirst time, the Federal Government will have to determine in advance \nhow its actions will impact the property owner, not just the wetland or \nthe endangered species. This bill also would require the Federal \nGovernment to look for options other than restricting the use of \nprivate property to achieve its goal.\n  Second, if heavy Government regulations diminish the value of private \nproperty, this bill would allow the landowners to plead their case in a \nFederal district court, instead of forcing them into the U.S. Court of \nFederal Claims. This means, for example, that Nebraskans can have their \ncase heard in a Nebraska courthouse; they won't have to travel to \nWashington, DC, at their own expense to seek relief. This bill makes \nthe process easier, less costly, and more accessible and accountable so \nall citizens can fully protect their property rights.\n  For too long, Federal regulators have made private property owners \nbear the burdens and the costs of Government land use decisions. The \nresult has been that real people suffer.\n  Joe Jeffrey is a farmer in Lexington, NE. Like most Americans, he is \nproud of his land. He believed his property was his to use and control \nas he saw fit.\n  Then he met the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Army Corps of \nEngineers.\n  In 1987, the long arm of the Federal bureaucracy reached onto Mr. \nJeffrey's property in the form of wetlands regulations. Mr. Jeffrey was \nnotified that he had to destroy two dikes on his land because they were \nconstructed without the proper permits. Nearly 2 years later, the corps \npartially changed its mind and allowed Mr. Jeffrey to reconstruct one \nof the dikes because the corps lacked authority to make him destroy it \nin the first place.\n  Then floods damaged part of Mr. Jeffrey's irrigated pastureland and \nchanged the normal water channel. Mr. Jeffrey set out to return the \nchannel to its original course by moving sand that the flood had \nshifted. But the Government said ``no.'' The corps told him he had to \ngive public notice before he could repair his own property.\n  Then came the Endangered Species Act.\n  Neither least terns nor piping plovers--both federally protected \nendangered species--have ever nested on Mr. Jeffrey's property. But \nthat didn't stop the regulators. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \nwanted to designate Mr. Jeffrey's property as ``critical habitat'' for \nthese protected species.\n  The bureaucrats could not even agree among themselves on what they \nwanted done. The Nebraska Department of Environmental Control wanted \nthe area re-vegetated. But the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service wanted \nthe area kept free of vegetation. Mr. Jeffrey was caught in the middle.\n  This is a real regulatory horror story. And there's more.\n  Today--10 years after his regulatory struggle began--Mr. Jeffrey is \nfaced with eroded pastureland that cannot be irrigated and cannot be \nrepaired without significant personal expense. The value of Mr. \nJeffrey's land has been diminished by the Government's regulatory \nintrusion--but he has not been compensated. In fact, he has had to \nspend money from his own pocket to comply with the regulations. The \nFish and Wildlife Service asked Mr. Jeffrey to modify his center pivot \nirrigation system to negotiate around the eroded area--at a personal \ncost of $20,000. And the issue is still not resolved.\n  Mr. President, we do not need more stories like Joe Jeffrey's in \nAmerica. Our Constitution guarantees our people's rights. Congress must \nact to uphold those rights and guarantee them in practice, not just in \ntheory. Government regulation has gone too far. We must make it \naccountable to the people. Government should be accountable to the \npeople, not the people accountable to the Government.\n  What this issue comes down to is fairness. It is simply not fair and \nit is not right for the Federal Government to have the ability to \nrestrict the use of privately owned property without compensating the \nowner. It violates the principles this country was founded on. This \nlegislation puts some justice back into the system. It reins in \nregulatory agencies and gives the private property owner a voice in the \nprocess. It makes it easier for citizens to appeal any restrictions \nimposed on their land or property. It is the right thing to do. It is \nthe just and fair thing to do.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 709\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       The policy of the Federal Government is to protect the \n     health, safety, and general welfare of the public in a manner \n     that, to the extent practicable, avoids takings of private \n     property.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to simplify \nthe method of payment of taxes on distilled spirits; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n      the distilled spirits tax payment simplification act of 1997\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today with Mr. Bryan, Mr. D'Amato \nand Mr. Frist to introduce the Distilled Spirits Tax Payment \nSimplification Act of 1997, a bill more readily known as All-in-Bond. \nThis bill would streamline the way in which the government collects \nfederal excise tax on distilled spirits by extending the current system \nof collection now applicable only to imported products to domestic \nproducts as well.\n  Today wholesalers purchase foreign bottled distilled spirits in \nbond--tax free--paying the Federal excise tax directly after sale to a \nretailer. In contrast, when the wholesaler buys domestically bottled \nspirits--nearly 86 percent of total inventory--the price includes the \nFederal excise tax, pre-paid by the distiller. This means that hundreds \nof U.S. family-owned wholesale businesses increase their inventory \ncarrying costs by 40 percent when buying U.S. products, which often \nhave to be financed through borrowing.\n  Under my bill, wholesalers would be allowed to purchase domestically \nbottled distilled spirits in-bond from distillers just as they are now \npermitted to purchase foreign produced spirits. Products would become \nsubject to tax on removal from wholesale premises. This legislation is \ndesigned to be revenue neutral and includes the requirement that any \nwholesaler electing to purchase spirits in bond must make certain \nestimated tax payments to Treasury before the end of the fiscal year.\n  All-in-Bond is an equitable and sound way to streamline our tax \ncollection system. I hope my colleagues will join me in cosponsoring \nthis important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 711\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for a system to classify information in the \ninterests of national security and a system to declassify such \ninformation; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                   THE GOVERNMENT SECRECY ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague \nfrom North Carolina, Senator Helms, in introducing the Government \nSecrecy Act of 1997. Congressmen Larry Combest of Texas and Lee \nHamilton of Indiana are introducing companion legislation in the House \nof Representatives this afternoon. The four of us, along with eight \nother distinguished individuals, served for the past 2 years on the \nCommission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy.\n  Earlier today, the four of us testified together at a hearing of the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs called by Chairman Thompson to review \nthe Commission's report, issued in March. The legislation that we \nintroduce today is intended to implement one of the core \nrecommendations of that Commission: The need for a statute establishing \nthe principles to govern the classification and declassification of \ninformation. The remarks that follow track my testimony before the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee this morning.\n  We begin by defining our subject. ``Secrecy is a form of government \nregulation.'' It can be understood in terms of a now considerable \nliterature concerning how organizations function. Begin with the German \nscholar Max Weber, writing eight decades ago in his chapter \n``Bureaucracy'' in ``Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft'' (Economy and \nSociety):\n\n       Every bureaucracy seeks to increase the superiority of the \n     professionally informed by keeping their knowledge and \n     intentions secret. Bureaucratic administration always tends \n     to be an administration of ``secret sessions''; in so far as \n     it can, it hides its knowledge and action from criticism. The \n     pure interest of the bureaucracy in power, however, is \n     efficacious far beyond those areas where purely functional \n     interests make for secrecy. The concept of the ``official \n     secret'' is the specific invention of bureaucracy, and \n     nothing is so fanatically defended by the bureaucracy as this \n     attitude, which cannot be substantially defended beyond these \n     specifically qualified areas.\n\n  Normal regulation concerns how citizens are to behave. As the \nadministrative state developed in the United States, beginning with the \nProgressive Era at the turn of the century and expanding greatly under \nthe New Deal, legal scholars began to ask just what these new rules \nwere. Were they laws? If not, then what? In 1938, Roscoe Pound, \nchairman of the American Bar Association's Special Committee on \nAdministrative Law and former Dean of the Harvard Law School, attacked \nthose ``who would turn the administration of justice over to \nadministrative absolutism . . . a Marxian idea,'' and inveighed against \nthose ``progressives, liberals, or radicals who desire to invest the \nNational Government with totalitarian powers in the teeth of \nconstitutional democracy . . .''\n  We managed to get a handle on that system, in no small measure \nthrough the efforts of Erwin Griswold, also a dean of the Harvard Law \nSchool, and others who decried the fact that administrative regulations \nequivalent to law had become increasingly important to everyday life \nand yet were not available to the public. One year after Professor \nGriswold published a seminal article calling for the publication of \nsuch rules and regulations, Congress enacted the Federal Register Act \nof 1935. Eleven years later, in 1946, working from the recommendations \nmade in 1941 by the Attorney General's Committee on Administrative \nProcedure, chaired by Dean Acheson, Congress enacted the Administrative \nProcedure Act.\n  Thus, today our system of public regulation is public indeed. \nRegulations are both widely accessible and subject to the APA's set of \nprocedural requirements--bringing a degree of order and accountability \nto this regime.\n  Secrecy, by contrast, concerns what citizens may know, but the \ncitizen does not know what may not be known. Our Commission states:\n\n       Americans are familiar with the tendency to overregulate in \n     other areas. What is different with secrecy is that the \n     public cannot know the extent or the content of the \n     regulation.\n\nThus, secrecy is the ultimate mode of regulation; the citizen does not \neven know that he or she is being regulated. It is a parallel \nregulatory regime with a far greater potential for damage if it \nmalfunctions.\n  Flowing from this understanding of secrecy as regulation is the \nrecognition that, to paraphrase Justice Potter Stewart's opinion in the \nPentagon Papers case, when everything is secret, nothing is secret. We \nstate:\n\n       The best way to ensure that secrecy is respected, and that \n     the most important secrets remain secret, is for secrecy \n     to be returned to its limited but necessary role. Secrets \n     can be protected more effectively if secrecy is reduced \n     overall.\n\n  It is time to reexamine the foundations of that secrecy system. The \nInformation Security Oversight Office report to Congress last week \nestimated the direct costs of secrecy at $5.2 billion in 1996 alone. \nThe same Office reports that in 1995 we had 21,871 original new top \nsecret designations and another 374,244 derivative top secret \ndesignations. Meaning that, in a single year, roughly 400,000 new \nsecrets were created at the Top Secret level alone--the disclosure of \nany one of which would cause exceptionally grave damage to the national \nsecurity.\n  It is also time to examine the appropriateness of security \narrangements\n\n[[Page S4111]]\n\nput in place during an earlier age, when the perceived threats were so \ndifferent from those of today. In 1957, the only previous commission \nestablished by the Congress to examine the secrecy system--the \nCommission on Government Security--issued a report that, for any number \nof reasons--in particular the fact that its core recommendation that \namounted to prior restraint of the press--did nothing to change the \nprevailing mode. Although the Commission did understand classification \nas a cost; its report ``stresses the dangers to national security that \narise out of overclassification of information which retards scientific \nand technological progress, and thus tend to deprive the country of the \nlead time that results from the free exchange of ideas and \ninformation.''\n  When the Commission on Government Security presented its report to \nPresident Eisenhower and the Congress, we still were consumed with \nconcerns about a Federal Government infiltrated by ideological enemies \nof the United States. Today, the public and its representatives have \nfew such concerns; indeed, today it is the U.S. Government that \nincreasingly is the object of what Edward Shils in 1956, in ``The \nTorment of Secrecy,'' termed the ``phantasies of apocalyptic \nvisionaries.''\n  We are not proposing putting an end to secrecy. It is at times \nterribly necessary and used for the most legitimate reasons. But \nsecrecy need not remain the only norm: We must develop a competing \nculture of openness, fully consistent with our interests in protecting \nnational security, but in which power is no longer derived primarily \nfrom one's ability to withhold information.\n  I am struck in this regard by a most remarkable letter that I \nreceived on March 25 from George F. Kennan, professor emeritus at the \nInstitute for Advanced Study in Princeton, NJ, in response to our \nCommission report. As lucid and thoughtful as ever at age 93, Professor \nKennan builds a compelling case for the proposition that much of our \nsecrecy system arose out of our efforts to penetrate the obsessively \nsecretive Soviet Communist regime of the Stalin era. And that the \nsystem we put in place remains largely intact today, even as that \nadversary has disappeared. Professor Kennan writes:\n\n       It is my conviction, based on some 70 years of experience, \n     first as a government official and then in the past 45 years \n     as an historian, that the need by our government for secret \n     intelligence about affairs elsewhere in the world has been \n     vastly over-rated. I would say that something upwards of 95% \n     of what we need to know about foreign countries could be very \n     well obtained by the careful and competent study of perfectly \n     legitimate sources of information open and available to us in \n     the rich library and archival holdings of this country.\n\n  I ask unanimous that the full text of Professor Kennan's letter be \ninserted in the Record.\n  I should note further that Professor Kennan's conclusion about the \nshare of information available from open sources also has been reached \nby other notable observers of the secrecy system--the estimable George \nP. Shultz among them.\n  Developing a culture of openness within the Federal Government \nrequires that secrecy be defined in statute. A statute will not put an \nend to overclassification and needless classification, but it will help \nby ensuring that the present regulatory regime cannot simply continue \nto flourish without any restraint. Classification should proceed \naccording to law; classifiers should know that they are acting lawfully \nand properly. We need to balance the possibility of harm to national \nsecurity against the public's right to know what the Government is \ndoing, or not doing. We should establish by statute that secrecy \nbelongs in the realm of national security and must serve that interest \nalone. It should not be employed as a badge of office or a status \nsymbol.\n  Thus we propose this statute, the Government Secrecy Act of 1997. As \nnoted, Representatives Combest and Hamilton are cosponsoring a \ncompanion measure in the House of Representatives. This legislation--\ndefining the principles and standards to govern classification and \ndeclassification, and establishing within an existing agency a National \nDeclassification Center to coordinate responsibility for declassifying \nhistorical documents--is drawn directly from the Commission's \nrecommendation for such a statute, as set out in the summary and in \nchapter I of our report.\n  I look forward to reviewing the legislation, as well as the other \nfindings and recommendations of the Commission, with Members of this \nbody, as well as our colleagues in the House of Representatives, \nexecutive branch officials, and interested persons outside of \nGovernment, in the weeks ahead.\n  I send the bill to the desk and ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record and be referred to the appropriate committee.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 712\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Government Secrecy Act of \n     1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n       It is the purpose of this Act to promote the effective \n     protection of classified information and the disclosure of \n     information where there is not a well-founded basis for \n     protection or where the costs of maintaining a secret \n     outweigh the benefits.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The system for classifying and declassifying national \n     security information has been based in regulation, not in \n     statute, and has been governed by six successive Executive \n     orders since 1951.\n       (2) The Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government \n     Secrecy, established under Public Law 103-236, issued its \n     report on March 4, 1997 (S. Doc. 105-2), in which it \n     recommended reducing the volume of information classified and \n     strengthening the protection of classified information.\n       (3) The absence of a statutory framework has resulted in \n     unstable and inconsistent classification and declassification \n     policies, excessive costs, and inadequate implementation.\n       (4) The implementation of Executive orders will be even \n     more costly as more documents are prepared and used on \n     electronic systems.\n       (5) United States taxpayers incur substantial costs as \n     several million documents are classified each year. According \n     to figures submitted to the Information Security Oversight \n     Office and the Congress, the executive branch and private \n     industry together spent more than $5.2 billion in 1996 to \n     protect classified information.\n       (6) A statutory foundation for the classification and \n     declassification of information is likely to result in a more \n     stable and cost-effective set of policies and a more \n     consistent application of rules and procedures.\n       (7) Enactment of a statute would create an opportunity for \n     greater oversight by the Congress of executive branch \n     classification and declassification activities, without \n     impairing the responsibility of executive branch officials \n     for the day-to-day administration of the system.\n\n     SEC. 4. CLASSIFICATION AND DECLASSIFICATION OF INFORMATION.\n\n       (a) Classification For National Security Reasons.--The \n     President may, in accordance with this Act, protect from \n     unauthorized disclosure information in the possession and \n     control of the executive branch when there is a demonstrable \n     need to do so in order to protect the national security of \n     the United States. The President shall ensure that the amount \n     of information classified is the minimum necessary to protect \n     the national security.\n       (b) Procedures for Classification and Declassification.--\n       (1) In general.--The President shall, to the extent \n     necessary, establish categories of information that may be \n     classified and procedures for classifying information under \n     subsection (a). The President shall, concurrently with the \n     establishment of such categories and procedures, establish, \n     and allocate resources for the implementation of, procedures \n     for declassifying information previously classified.\n       (2) Publication of categories and procedures.--\n       (A) The President shall publish notice in the Federal \n     Register of any categories and procedures proposed to be \n     established under paragraph (1) with respect to both the \n     classification and declassification of information, and shall \n     provide an opportunity for interested agencies and other \n     interested persons to submit comments thereon. The President \n     shall take into account such comments before establishing the \n     categories and procedures, which shall also be published in \n     the Federal Register.\n       (B) The procedures set forth in subparagraph (A) shall \n     apply to any modifications in categories or procedures \n     established under paragraph (1).\n       (3) Agency standards and procedures.--The head of each \n     agency shall establish standards and procedures for \n     classifying and declassifying information created by that \n     agency on the basis of the categories and procedures \n     established by the President under paragraph (1). Each agency \n     head, in establishing and modifying standards and procedures \n     under this paragraph, shall follow the procedures required of \n     the President in paragraph (2) for establishing and modifying\n\n[[Page S4112]]\n\n     categories and procedures under that paragraph.\n       (c) Considerations in Determining Classification and \n     Declassification.--\n       (1) In general.--In determining whether information should \n     be classified or declassified, the agency official making the \n     determination shall weigh the benefit from public disclosure \n     of the information against the need for initial or continued \n     protection of the information under the classification \n     system. If there is significant doubt as to whether \n     information requires such protection, it shall not be \n     classified.\n       (2) Written justification.--\n       (A) Original classification.--The agency official who makes \n     the decision to classify information shall identify himself \n     or herself and shall provide in writing a detailed \n     justification for that decision.\n       (B) Derivative classification.--In any case in which an \n     agency official classifies a document on the basis of \n     information previously classified that is included or \n     referenced in the document, that agency official shall \n     identify himself or herself in that document.\n       (d) Standards for Declassification.--\n       (1) Initial classification period.--Information may not \n     remain classified under this Act for longer than a 10-year \n     period unless the head of the agency that created the \n     information certifies to the President at the end of such \n     period that the information requires continued protection, \n     based on a current assessment of the risks of disclosing the \n     information, carried out in accordance with subsection \n     (c)(1).\n       (2) Additional classification period.--Information not \n     declassified prior to or at the end of the 10-year period \n     referred to in paragraph (1) may not remain classified for \n     more than a 30-year period unless the head of the agency that \n     created the information certifies to the President at the end \n     of such 30-year period that continued protection of the \n     information from unauthorized disclosure is essential to the \n     national security of the United States or that demonstrable \n     harm to an individual will result from release of the \n     information.\n       (3) Declassification schedules.--All classified information \n     shall be subject to regular review pursuant to schedules each \n     agency head shall establish and publish in the Federal \n     Register. Each agency shall follow the schedule established \n     by the agency head in declassifying information created by \n     that agency.\n       (4) Assessment of existing classified information.--Each \n     agency official responsible for information which, before the \n     effective date of this Act--\n       (A) was determined to be kept protected from unauthorized \n     disclosure in the interest of national security, and\n       (B) had been kept so protected for longer than the 10-year \n     period referred to in paragraph (1),\n     shall, to the extent feasible, give priority to making \n     decisions with respect to declassifying that information as \n     soon as is practicable.\n       (e) Reports to Congress.--Not later than December 31 of \n     each year, the head of each agency that is responsible for \n     the classification and declassification of information shall \n     submit to the Congress a report that describes the \n     application of the classification and declassification \n     standards and procedures of that agency during the preceding \n     fiscal year.\n       (f) Amendment to Freedom of Information Act.--Section \n     552(b)(1) of title 5, United States Code, is amended to read \n     as follows:\n       ``(1)(A) specifically authorized to be classified under the \n     Government Secrecy Act of 1997, or specifically authorized, \n     before the effective date of that Act, under criteria \n     established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the \n     interest of national security (as defined by section 7(6) of \n     the Government Secrecy Act of 1997), and (B) are in fact \n     properly classified pursuant to that Act or Executive \n     order;''.\n\n     SEC. 5. NATIONAL DECLASSIFICATION CENTER.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--The President shall establish, within \n     an existing agency, a National Declassification Center, the \n     functions of which shall be--\n       (1) to coordinate and oversee the declassification policies \n     and practices of the Federal Government; and\n       (2) to provide technical assistance to agencies in \n     implementing such policies and practices, in accordance with \n     this section.\n       (b) Functions.--\n       (1) Declassification of information.--The Center shall, at \n     the request of any agency and on a reimbursable basis, \n     declassify information within the possession of that agency \n     pursuant to the guidance of that agency on the basis of the \n     declassification standards and procedures established by that \n     agency under section 4, or if another agency created the \n     information, pursuant to the guidance of that other agency on \n     the basis of the declassification standards and procedures \n     established by that agency under section 4. In carrying out \n     this paragraph, the Center may use the services of officers \n     or employees or the resources of another agency, with the \n     consent of the head of that agency.\n       (2) Coordination of policies.--The Center shall coordinate \n     implementation by agencies of the declassification policies \n     and procedures established by the President under section 4 \n     and shall ensure that declassification of information occurs \n     in an efficient, cost-effective, and consistent manner among \n     all agencies that create or otherwise are in possession of \n     classified information.\n       (3) Disputes.--If disputes arise among agencies regarding \n     whether information should or should not be classified, or \n     between the Center and any agency regarding the Center's \n     functions under this section, the heads of the agencies \n     concerned or of the Center may refer the matter to the \n     President for resolution of the dispute.\n       (c) National Declassification Advisory Committee.--\n       (1) In general.--There is established a 12-member National \n     Declassification Advisory Committee. 4 members of the \n     Advisory Committee shall be appointed by the President and 2 \n     members each shall be appointed by the majority and minority \n     leaders of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, and the minority leader of the House of \n     Representatives.\n       (2) Membership.--The members of the Advisory Committee \n     shall be appointed from among distinguished historians, \n     political scientists, archivists, other social scientists, \n     and other members of the public who have a demonstrable \n     expertise in declassification and the management of \n     Government records. No officer or employee of the United \n     States Government shall be appointed to the Advisory \n     Committee.\n       (3) Duties.--The Advisory Committee shall provide advice to \n     the Center and make recommendations concerning \n     declassification priorities and activities.\n       (d) Annual Reports.--The Center shall submit to the \n     President and the Congress, not later than December 31 of \n     each year, a report on its activities during the preceding \n     fiscal year, and on the implementation of agency \n     declassification practices and its efforts to coordinate \n     those practices.\n\n     SEC. 6. INFORMATION TO THE CONGRESS.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed to authorize the \n     withholding of information from the Congress.\n\n     SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this Act--\n       (1) the term ``Advisory Committee'' means the National \n     Declassification Advisory Committee established under section \n     5(c);\n       (2) the term ``agency'' means any executive agency as \n     defined in section 105 of title 5, United States Code, any \n     military department as defined in section 102 of such title, \n     and any other entity in the executive branch of the \n     Government that comes into the possession of classified \n     information;\n       (3) the term ``Center'' means the National Declassification \n     Center established under section 5(a);\n       (4) the terms ``classify'', ``classified'', and \n     ``classification'' refer to the process by which information \n     is determined to require protection from unauthorized \n     disclosure pursuant to this Act in order to protect the \n     national security of the United States;\n       (5) the terms ``declassify'', ``declassified'', and \n     ``declassification'' refer to the process by which \n     information that has been classified is determined to no \n     longer require protection from unauthorized disclosure \n     pursuant to this Act; and\n       (6) the term ``national security of the United States'' \n     means the national defense or foreign relations of the United \n     States.\n\n     SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act shall take effect 180 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                     Institute for Advanced Study,\n\n\n                                 School of Historical Studies,\n\n                                    Princeton, NJ, March 25, 1997.\n     Senator Daniel P. Moynihan,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: Thank you for your note of the 7th, and for \n     the copy of your recent talk at Georgetown, which I have read \n     with deep appreciation.\n       There are several points you touched on in that talk which, \n     were we sitting at leisure around a fireside, I would like to \n     pursue. I cannot treat them all here. But there is one matter \n     on which you did not specifically mention but which lies \n     close to the subject you had in mind, and on which I am moved \n     to say a word. It is a matter on which I have long looked \n     for, but never found, a suitable chance to comment publicly.\n       It is my conviction, based on some 70 years of experience, \n     first as a government official and then in the past 45 years \n     as an historian, that the need by our government for secret \n     intelligence about affairs elsewhere in the world has been \n     vastly over-rated. I would say that something upwards of 95% \n     of what we need to know about foreign countries could be very \n     well obtained by the careful and competent study of perfectly \n     legitimate sources of information open and available to us in \n     the rich library an archival holdings of this country. Much \n     of the remainder, if it could not be found here (and there is \n     very little of it that could not) could easily be non-\n     secretively elicited from similar sources abroad.\n       In Russia, in Stalin's time and partly thereafter, the \n     almost psychotic preoccupation of the Communist regime with \n     secrecy appeared to many, not unnaturally, to place a special \n     premium on efforts to penetrate that curtain by secretive \n     methods of our own. This led, of course, to the creation here \n     of a vast bureaucracy dedicated to this particular purpose; \n     and this latter, after the fashion of all great bureaucratic \n     structures, has endured to this day, long after most of the \n     reasons for it have disappeared. Even in the Soviet time, \n     much of it was superfluous. A lot of what we went to such \n     elaborate and dangerous means to obtain secretly would have \n     been here for the having, given the requisite quiet and \n     scholarly analysis of what already lay before us.\n\n[[Page S4113]]\n\n       The attempt to elicit information by secret means has \n     another very serious negative effect that is seldom noted. \n     The development of clandestine sources of information in \n     another country involves, of course, the placing and the \n     exploitation of secret agents on the territory of that \n     country. This naturally incites the mounting of a substantial \n     effort of counterintelligence on the part of the respective \n     country's government. This, in turn, causes us to respond \n     with an equally vigorous effort of counterintelligence in \n     order to maintain the integrity of our espionage effort. \n     But for a variety of reasons, this competition in \n     counterintelligence efforts tends to grow into dimensions \n     that wholly overshadow the original effort of positive \n     intelligence procurement that gave rise to it in the first \n     place. It takes on aspects which cause it to be viewed as \n     a game, played in its own rights. Unfortunately, it is a \n     game requiring such lurid and dramatic character that it \n     dominates the attention both of those that practice it, \n     and of those in the press and the media who exploit it. \n     Such is the fascination it exerts that it tends wholly to \n     obscure, even for the general public the original reasons \n     for it. It would be interesting to know what proportion of \n     the energies and expenses and bureaucratic involvement of \n     the C.I.A. is addressed to this consuming competition, and \n     whether one ever stacks this up against the value of its \n     almost forgotten original purposes. Do people ever \n     reflect, one wonders, that the best way to protect against \n     the penetration of one's secrets by others is to have the \n     minimum of secrets to conceal?\n       One more point. At the bottom of the whole great effort of \n     secret military intelligence, which has played so nefarious a \n     part in the entire history of great-power relationships in \n     this passing century, there has usually lain the assumption \n     by each party that if it did not engage to the limit in that \n     exercise the other party, working in secret, might develop a \n     weapon so devastating that with it he could confront all \n     others with the demand that they submit to his will ``or \n     else''.\n       But this sort of anxiety is now greatly outdated. The \n     nuclear competition has taught us that the more terrible the \n     weapons available, the more suicidal becomes any conceivable \n     actual use of them. With the recognition of the implications \n     of this simple fact would go a large part of the motivation \n     for our frantic efforts of secret intelligence. In this \n     respect, too, this is really a new age. It is time we \n     recognized it and drew the inescapable conclusions.\n       There may still be areas, very small areas really, in which \n     there is a real need to penetrate someone else's curtain of \n     secrecy. All right. But then please, without the erection of \n     false pretenses and elaborate efforts to deceive--and \n     without, to the extent possible--the attempt to maintain \n     ``spies'' on the adversary's territory. We easily become \n     ourselves, the sufferers from these methods of deception. For \n     they inculcate in their authors, as well as their intended \n     victims, unlimited cynicism, causing them to lose all \n     realistic understanding of the interrelationship, in what \n     they are doing, of ends and means.\n       Forgive me for burdening you with this outburst. I am not \n     unloading upon my friends, in private letters, thoughts I \n     should probably have brought forward publicly long ago. I \n     have to consider that this is the only way I can put some of \n     these thoughts into words before, in the case of a person 93 \n     years of age, it becomes too late.\n       Warm and admiring greetings.\n           Very sincerely,\n                                                    George Kennan.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. I am pleased to join Senator Moynihan today in introducing \na bill that would for the first time place in statute the Government \nsystem for the classification of information. To date this has been \naccomplished solely through Executive order.\n  The statute is based on the recommendations contained in the report \nof the Commission to Protect and Reduce Government Secrecy chaired by \nmy colleague Pat Moynihan, the senior Senator from New York. The \nSecrecy Commission achieved a unified report of recommendations--a feat \nthat should not be underrated, especially in Washington.\n  The Commission, by law, had the twin goals of studying how to protect \nimportant Government secrets and simultaneously reducing the amount of \nclassified documents and materials. All Commissioners began their \ndeliberations with the premise that Government secrecy is a form of \nregulation that, like all regulations, should be used sparingly, and \ncertainly never for the goal of keeping the truth from the American \npeople. Commissioners also began the process recognizing that over-\nclassification can actually weaken the protections of those secrets \nthat truly are in our national interest.\n  All the same I am obliged to begin with a reiteration of the \nobvious--that the protection of true national security information \nremains vital to the well-being and security of the United States. The \nend of the cold war notwithstanding, the United States continues to \nface serious and long-term threats from a variety of fronts. While \nCommunist and anti-American regimes, such as North Korea, Cuba, Iran, \nand Iraq, continue to wage a war of espionage against the United \nStates, new threats have arisen as well.\n  Most alarming, perhaps, is the growing trend of espionage conducted \nnot by our enemies but by American allies. Such espionage is on the \nrise especially against U.S. economic secrets. According to a February \n1996 report by GAO, classified military information and sensitive \nmilitary technologies are high priority targets for the intelligence \nagencies of U.S. allies.\n  At first blush, a push to reduce Government secrecy may seem at odds \nwith these increasing threats. I am convinced it is not. The sheer \nvolume of government secrets--and their cost to the taxpayers and U.S. \nbusiness--is staggering. In 1996 the taxpayers spent more than $5.2 \nbillion to protect classified information. We know all too well from \nour own experiences that when everything is secret nothing is secret.\n  Secrecy all too often then becomes a political tool used by executive \nbranch agencies to shield information which may be politically \nsensitive or policies which may be unpopular with the American public. \nWorse yet, information may be classified to hide from public view \nillegal or unethical activity. On numerous occasions I, and other \nMembers of Congress, have found the executive branch to be reluctant to \nshare certain information, the nature of which is not truly a national \nsecret, but which would be potentially politically embarrassing to \nofficials in the executive branch or which would make known an illegal \nor indefensible policy.\n\n  I have also found that one of the largest impediments to openness is \nthe perverse incentives of the Government bureaucracy itself in favor \nof classification, and the lack of accountability for those who do the \nactual classification. I strongly endorse the Commission's \nrecommendation of adding individual accountability to the process by \nrequiring original and derivative classifiers to actually identify \nthemselves and include within the documents a justification of the \ndecision to classify.\n  The only way to change a bureaucracy is to reverse the incentive to \nclassify. A good example of how to change this lack of bureaucratic \naccountability is a provision contained in H.R. 3121--legislation which \nwe approved in the Foreign Relations Committee last year that was \nsigned into law. Previously, details on U.S. commercial arms sales to \nforeign governments were not made available to the public unless a \ncitizen requested that the State Department make it public. The \nincentive therefore was to keep the information closely regulated. H.R. \n3121 provides that all arm sales will be made public unless the \nPresident determines that the release of the information is contrary to \nU.S. national security interest. Although this may appear to be a small \nnuance, the bureaucratic incentive is changed enormously to favor \nopenness. Shifting the burden in this way can introduce more openness \ninto the system and force the bureaucracy to identify true national \nsecurity threats.\n  I am convinced, however, that the single most important \nrecommendation of our Commission that Congress should focus on is the \nconcept of creating a life cycle for secrets. This means that all \ninformation, classified and unclassified alike, has a life span in \nwhich decisions must be made regarding creation, management, and use. \nThis kind of rationalization would shift the burden to favor openness \nand reduce some of the costs associated with declassification.\n  I would add a note of caution to the Commission's work on \ndeclassification, however. In the course of the 2 years of its work, \nthe Commission became very interested in the declassification of \nexisting documents and materials. In a perfect world, if information \nremains relevant to true U.S. national interests it should remain \nclassified indefinitely. Information that does not compromise U.S. \ninterests and sources should be made public. We all realize, however, \nthat this is a tremendously costly venture. In fact, the Commission was \nunable to come up with solid data on the true cost of declassification.\n  In this era when Congress has finally begun to grasp the essential \nneed to reduce Government spending and balance the budget, the issue of \nbalancing costs\n\n[[Page S4114]]\n\nand benefits is an essential one. The financial costs to the American \ntaxpayers must be balanced against the necessity of the \ndeclassification. The real lesson to take from the work of this \nCommission is the need to redress for the future the problems of over \nclassification and a systematic process for declassification, so that \nthe costs and timeliness of declassification does not pose the same \neconomic and regulatory burdens on future generations. At the same \ntime, it may be too costly to declassify all of the countless \nclassified documents now in existence.\n  With this caveat in mind, I hope the Congress will focus on bringing \ngovernment-wide rationalization to the classification process. It is an \narea where tough congressional oversight is long overdue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Hollings, \n        Mr. Wellstone and Mr. Jeffords):\n\n  S. 714. A bill to make permanent the Native American Veteran Housing \nLoan Pilot Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n  REAUTHORIZATION OF THE NATIVE AMERICAN VETERAN HOUSING LOAN PROGRAM \n                              LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a measure which \npermanently authorizes the Native American Veteran Housing Loan \nProgram. I am pleased that Senators Daschle, Inouye, Hollings, \nWellstone, and Jeffords have joined me in cosponsoring this important \nmeasure.\n  In 1992, I authored a bill that established a 5-year pilot program of \ndirect home loans to assist native american veterans who reside on \ntrust lands. This pilot program, administered by the Department of \nVeterans Affairs [VA], provides direct loans to native American \nveterans to build or purchase homes on trust lands. Previously, native \nAmerican veterans who reside on trust lands were unable to qualify for \nVA home loan benefits. This disgraceful treatment of native American \nveterans was finally corrected when Congress established the native \nAmerican Direct Home Loan Program.\n  Despite the complexities of creating a program that addresses the \nneeds of hundreds of different tribal entities, VA has successfully \nentered into agreements to provide direct VA loans to members of 46 \ntribes and Pacific Island groups, and negotiations continue with other \ntribes. Since the program's inception, 127 native American veterans \nhave been able to achieve home ownership, and none of the loans \napproved by the VA have been foreclosed.\n  Unfortunately, the authority to issue new loans under this remarkably \nsuccessful program will cease on September 30, 1997. This would be \ntragic and devastating to a number of native American veterans who want \nto participate in this program. Although VA has proposed a 2-year \nextension for the program, it fails to address the basic reason this \nprogram exists--equity. Native American veterans who reside on trust \nlands should be afforded the same benefits available to other veterans. \nWithout this program, home loan benefits to native Americans living on \ntrust lands will cease. This is the only program available for native \nAmerican veterans who live on trust lands to finance a home for \nthemselves and their families. There are no alternatives available.\n  Permanent authorization of this program will ensure that native \nAmerican veterans are provided equal access to services and benefits \navailable to other veterans. I urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 714\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a Joint United States-Canada Commission \non Cattle and Beef to identify, and recommend means of resolving \nnational, regional, and provincial trade-distorting differences between \nthe countries with respect to the production, processing, and sale of \ncattle and beef, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n          legislation to establish cattle and beef commission\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill of critical \nimportance to our Nation's cattle industry. The joint United States-\nCanada Commission on Cattle and Beef is designed to resolve some of the \nexisting differences in trade practices between the two countries.\n  I want to thank a number of my colleagues who are joining me as \noriginal cosponsors of this legislation. The cosponsors of this bill \ninclude Senator Baucus, Senator Burns, Senator Gorton, Senator \nKempthorne, and Senator Enzi.\n  As a former rancher, I have a firsthand understanding of the \nchallenges that face the cattle industry. The prolonged down cycle is \nespecially troubling because it affects the livelihoods of thousands of \nranching families in Idaho and across the country.\n  These beef producers are the largest sector of Idaho and American \nagriculture. Over 1 million families raise over 100 million head of \nbeef cattle every year. This contributes over $36 billion to local \neconomies. Even with the extended cycle of low prices, direct cash \nreceipts from the Idaho cattle industry were almost $620 million in \n1995. These totals only represent direct sales; they do not capture the \nmultiplier effect that cattle ranches have in their local economies \nfrom expenditures on labor, feed, fuel, property taxes, and other \ninputs.\n  Over the years, cattle operations have provided a decent living and \ngood way of life in exchange for long days, hard work, and dedication. \nWhile the investment continues to be high, the returns have been low in \nrecent years.\n  The problems facing the cattle industry in recent years are complex. \nThe nature of the market dictates that stable consumption combined with \nincreased productivity and growing herd size yield lower prices to \nproducers. This, combined with high feed prices and limited export \nopportunities, has caused a near crisis.\n  Many Idahoans have contacted me on a number of cattle industry \nissues. Some suggest the Federal Government intervene in the market to \nhelp producers. However, many others have expressed fear that Federal \nintervention, if experience is any indication, will only complicate \nmatters and may also create a number of unintended results. I tend to \nagree with the latter. Time and again, I have seen lawmakers and \nbureaucrats in Washington, DC, albeit well intentioned, take a \ndifficult situation and make it worse. This does not mean that I \nbelieve Government has no role to play. I have supported and will \ncontinue to support Government involvement in areas like trade, where \nindividual producers cannot help themselves.\n  This bill recognizes a number of barriers to international trade that \nadversely affect American beef producers.\n\n[[Page S4115]]\n\nThe bill is meant to elevate the importance of all trade issues and \nspecifically address some of the pending cattle trade issues between \nthe United States and Canada.\n  The United States-Canada Commission on Cattle and Beef is a measure \ndesigned to provide immediate, short-term solutions to some of the \nserious trade problems facing the cattle industry. Specific cattle \nissues that could be resolved with further discussion include animal \nhealth requirements and the availability of feed grains. The bill \ncreates a commission composed of three people from each country along \nwith a number of other nonvoting advisors. Within 30 days of passage, \nthe Commission must be in place and within 6 months must issue a \npreliminary report on how to resolve the existing differences between \nUnited States and Canadian trade.\n\n  I know that a number of my colleagues have legislation pending in \nregards to the cattle market. I would comment that I see this bill as a \nstarting point, not an ending point for cattle industry issues and I \nurge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 716\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. JOINT UNITED STATES-CANADA COMMISSION ON CATTLE \n                   AND BEEF.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--There is established a Joint United \n     States-Canada Commission on Cattle and Beef to identify, and \n     recommend means of resolving, national, regional, and \n     provincial trade-distorting differences between the United \n     States and Canada with respect to the production, processing, \n     and sale of cattle and beef, with particular emphasis on--\n       (1) animal health requirements;\n       (2) transportation differences;\n       (3) the availability of feed grains; and\n       (4) Other market-distorting direct and indirect subsidies.\n       (b) Composition.--\n       (1) In general.--The Commission shall be composed of--\n       (A) 3 members representing the United States, including--\n       (i) 1 member appointed by the Majority Leader of the \n     Senate;\n       (ii) 1 member appointed by the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives; and\n       (iii) 1 member appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture;\n       (B) 3 members representing Canada, appointed by the \n     Government of Canada; and\n       (C) nonvoting members appointed by the Commission to serve \n     as advisers to the Commission, including university faculty, \n     State veterinarians, trade experts, and other members.\n       (2) Appointment.--Members of the Commission shall be \n     appointed not later than 30 days after the date of enactment \n     of this Act.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the first \n     meeting of the Commission, the Commission shall submit a \n     report to Congress and the Government of Canada that \n     identifies, and recommends means of resolving, differences \n     between the United States and Canada with respect to the \n     production, processing, and sale of cattle and beef.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Lott, Mr. Kennedy, \n        Mr. Coats, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Gregg, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Frist, Mr. \n        DeWine, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Hutchinson, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Collins, Mr. \n        Warner, Mr. McConnell, and Mr. Reed):\n  S. 717. A bill to amend the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct, to reauthorize and make improvements to that Act, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n   THE INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT AMENDMENTS OF 1997\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today along with 16 of my colleagues, I \nam introducing the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \nAmendments of 1997. This legislation is the product of 4 months of \nintensive discussion among members of the committee, the House \nCommittee on Education and the Workforce, and officials from the U.S. \nDepartment of Education.\n  The process followed in developing this legislation was unprecedented \nand demonstrates the high priority all involved place on the importance \nof the education of children with disabilities, their parents, and \ntheir educators.\n  Many people and organizations have helped us to develop this \nlegislation. I would like to name just a few.\n  First and foremost, I wish to thank the Majority Leader Trent Lott \nfor his unwavering support, and, in particular for the assistance of \nhis Chief of Staff, Dave Hoppe. It is my firm belief that without their \ncommitment to the process that we could not have produced this bill.\n  I would also like to thank my colleagues Senators Kennedy, Coats, \nHarkin, and Gregg, and especially, Chairman Goodling, Mr. Clay and our \nother colleagues in the House, and Secretary Riley, and Assistant \nSecretary Heumann.\n  I also wish to especially thank Senator Frist, who set the direction \nand standard that led us in our efforts to reauthorize IDEA in the last \nCongress.\n  I introduce this bill in a much different climate than the one in \nwhich Congress first addressed the issue. In 1975, responding to \nnumerous Federal court cases, Congress passed Public Law 94-142 which \nguaranteed all children with disabilities a ``free and appropriate \npublic education,'' and promised that the Federal Government would \ncontribute 40 percent of the costs of special education. It is 22 years \nlater and today we are on the threshold of honoring that commitment.\n  Our efforts in drafting this legislation are driven by a common \nbelief that education is our No. 1 national priority, and that meeting \nthe needs of our children includes meeting the needs our 5.1 million \nchildren with disabilities. In this bill we address several important \nissues: How to increase the flow of Federal dollars to local school \ndistricts; how to expand opportunities for children with disabilities \nto participate and succeed in the classroom along with their \nnondisabled peers; and how to ensure the appropriate participation of \nchildren with disabilities in State and district-wide assessments of \nstudent progress.\n  I hope all of my colleagues will support this legislation when it is \nconsidered. It's importance has been demonstrated by the collaborative \nprocess in which it was developed, and the valuable group of Americans \nit is intended to serve.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n

Res. 85\n\n       Whereas individuals with breast cancer need a support \n     system in their time of need;\n       Whereas breast cancer is a disease of epidemic proportions, \n     with 43,900 individuals in the United States expected to die \n     from breast cancer in 1997, and 1 out of every 8 women in the \n     United States expected to develop breast cancer in her \n     lifetime;\n       Whereas the millions of family members, including spouses, \n     children, parents, siblings, and other loved ones of person's \n     with breast cancer can offer strong emotional support to each \n     other in addition to the support they offer to patients and \n     survivors dealing with their challenges;\n       Whereas it is important that the United States as a whole \n     support the family members and other loved ones of \n     individuals with breast cancer in addition to supporting the \n     individual with breast cancer; and\n       Whereas 1997 brings the 25th anniversary of the National \n     Cancer Program providing research, training, health \n     information dissemination, and other programs with respect to \n     the cause, diagnosis, prevention and treatment of cancer, \n     rehabilitation from cancer, and the continuing care of cancer \n     patients and their families: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that an \n     environment be encouraged where--\n       (1) the family members and loved ones of individuals with \n     breast cancer can support each other in addition to the \n     individual with breast cancer; and\n       (2) everything possible should be done to support both the \n     individuals with breast cancer as well as the family and \n     loved ones of individuals with breast cancer through public \n     awareness and education.\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

With \nMother's Day coming up this Sunday, May 11, it seems especially \nappropriate that we recognize the extent to which our society is \naffected by this disease, as well as the\n\n[[Page S4117]]\n\nimportance of supporting breast cancer patients and their family \nmembers and friends who are all meeting the challenges of this disease \nat the side of their loved one.\n  In 1997, it is estimated that 1 out of every 8 women will develop \nbreast cancer in her lifetime and nearly 44,000 individuals will die of \nthe disease this year. In New Hampshire alone there are 12,700 women \nliving with breast cancer, and 230 women are expected to die of this \nterrible disease in 1997. With each of these individuals come loved \nones who are also impacted. It is imperative to have a strong support \nsystem not only for individuals with breast cancer but for the family \nand friends who make up their support system. Our recognition of the \nmillions of people who are dealing with similar struggles can help both \nthe breast cancer patients and their loved ones to stay strong during \ntheir times of need.\n  With this resolution, we hope to encourage an environment in New \nHampshire, and across the Nation, where support is provided to both the \nindividuals with breast cancer as well as their family and friends \nthrough public awareness and education, and where family members and \nloved ones of individuals with breast cancer support each other in \nalong with the individual facing breast cancer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/07/senate-section/article/S4116-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4117-S4128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nTHE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN PREVENTION ACT SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS AND \n                        RESCISSIONS ACT OF 1997\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        CONRAD AMENDMENT NO. 175\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. CONRAD submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill (S. 672) making supplemental appropriations and rescissions \nfor the fiscal year ending September 30, 1997, and for other purposes; \nas follows:\n\n       In lieu of the matter to be inserted by said amendment, \n     insert: On page 31, line 22, after the word ``facilities,'' \n     insert the following: ``: Provided further, That of the funds \n     made available under this heading, up to $20,000,000 may be \n     transferred to the Disaster Assistance Direct Loan Program \n     for the cost of direct loans as authorized under section 417 \n     of the Robert T.

as \nfollows:\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC.   . CHILDREN'S VIOLENCE PROTECTION.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Children's Protection from Violent Programming Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Television influences children's perception of the \n     values and behavior that are common and acceptable in \n     society.\n       (2) Broadcast television, cable television, and video \n     programming are--\n       (A) uniquely pervasive presences in the lives of all \n     American children; and\n       (B) are readily accessible to all American children.\n       (3) Violent video programming influences children, as does \n     indecent programming.\n       (4) There is empirical evidence that children exposed to \n     violent video programming at a young age have a higher \n     tendency to engage in violent and aggressive behavior later \n     in life than those children not so exposed.\n       (5) Children exposed to violent video programming are prone \n     to assume that acts of violence are acceptable behavior and \n     therefore to imitate such behavior.\n       (6) Children exposed to violent video programming have an \n     increased fear of becoming a victim of violence, resulting in \n     increased self-protective behaviors and increased mistrust of \n     others.\n       (7) There is a compelling governmental interest in limiting \n     the negative influences of violent video programming on \n     children.\n       (8) There is a compelling governmental interest in \n     channeling programming with violent content to periods of the \n     day when children are not likely to comprise a substantial \n     portion of the television audience.\n       (9) Age-based ratings systems do not allow parents to block \n     programming based solely on violent content thereby rendering \n     ineffective any technology-based blocking mechanism designed \n     to limit violent video programming.\n       (10) If programming is not rated specifically for violent \n     content and therefore cannot be blocked solely on the basis \n     of its violent content, then restricting the hours when \n     violent video programming is shown is the least restrictive \n     and most narrowly tailored means to achieve a compelling \n     governmental interest.\n       (11) Studies show that warning labels based on age \n     restrictions tend to encourage children's desire to watch \n     restricted programming.\n       (12) Technology-based solutions may be helpful in \n     protecting some children, but may not be effective in \n     achieving the compelling governmental interest in protecting \n     all children from violent programming when parents are only \n     able to block programming based on the age of the child and \n     not on the violent content of the programming.\n       (13) Absent the ability to block programming based \n     specifically on the violent content of the programming, the \n     channeling of violent programming is the least restrictive \n     means to limit unsupervised children from the harmful \n     influences of violent programming.\n       (14) Restricting the hours when violent programming can be \n     shown protects the interests of children whose parents are \n     unavailable, unable to supervise their children's viewing \n     behavior, do not have the benefit of technology-based \n     solutions, or unable to afford the costs of technology-based \n     solutions.\n       (c) Unlawful Distribution of Violent Video Programming.--\n     Title VII of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 701 et \n     seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 718.

Mr. President, it is my pleasure today to express \nmy deep gratitude and pride in recognizing the Wenatchee National \nForest as a recipient of the Salvage Sale Showcase Award under the U.S. \nForest Service's Fiscal Year 1995 Timber Salvage and Recovery Program.\n  The Wenatchee National Forest encompasses 2.2 million acres of \nWashington's finest forest lands--lands providing for an abundance of \nrecreational activities and employment and resource opportunities for \nWashington State residents. In July 1994, however, a lightning storm \nfollowed by a severe fire, threatened to suddenly demolish this \nmajestic landscape within days.\n  When the last flame had been extinguished, the damage was daunting. \nThree fires of unprecedented intensity had consumed 186,000 acres of \nWenatchee National Forest lands, destroying 37 homes and 76 \noutbuildings and threatening the lives of human beings who had dared to \ncross its massive path. Firefighters from various parts of the country, \n8,000 in all, fought valiantly to save the precious resources \nendangered by runaway wildfires. It is to their credit that so many \nhomes, communities, and human lives are intact today.\n  Determined and resolute, the employees of the Wenatchee National \nForest went to work. Less than 2 months after the first spark ignited, \nthe largest emergency rehabilitation effort ever undertaken by the \nForest Service was launched with the cooperation of other Federal, \nState, county, and local agencies. The rehabilitation effort addressed \nand executed projects which included erosion control, road \nrehabilitation, wildlife habitat, helicopter seeding, and collaborative \nlearning. The effort was successfully completed by mid-November 1994, \nfor $18 million--$2 million under budget.\n  With the worst behind them, Forest managers looked ahead toward long-\nterm forest health and sustainability. Interdisciplinary teams \nconsisting of personnel from all six ranger districts combined their \nknowledge and know-how to develop the necessary environmental \ndocuments. Within 11 months, these teams assembled an astounding 10 \nenvironmental analyses and 1 environmental impact statement. Science-\nbased decisionmaking rendered a total of 22 timber sales, resulting in \nlandscape level fuel treatment on over 30,000 acres. Nearly 138 million \nboard feet of fire killed or damaged timber was offered for sale.\n  Salvage was the key to this vision. Removing dead and dying trees \nprovided the much needed opportunity to reduce stress and preserve \nlarger, healthier trees. In addition, salvage logging in the Wenatchee \nhas enhanced wildlife habitat and supported the perpetuation of ancient \nforest conditions. Mr. President, it is for this very reason that I \nsponsored timber salvage legislation in the spring of 1995. Not only \nwas the forest able to begin healing and promoting catastrophic fire \nprevention through salvage operations, it was also able to provide a \nsignificant amount of timber for the public benefit.\n  In conclusion, I want to congratulate and commend the efforts of all \nof those who contributed to the successful and innovative restoration \nof the Wenatchee National Forest. Their accomplishments over the past 3 \nyears are proof positive that we can effectively balance environmental \nand economic concerns in our national forests if we give local forest \nmanagers the flexibility they need to do their jobs. The employees of \nthis forest are outstanding examples of the teamwork desperately needed \nthroughout our national forest system. Because of their \nprofessionalism, tenacity, and courage, the Wenatchee National Forest \nis on its way back to health and sustainability. My congratulations to \nthem on a job well done. Keep up the good work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/07/senate-section/article/S4129-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4129-S4130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           WEST VIRGINIA MOTHER OF THE YEAR, KELLY L.

She works \nvery hard to provide a spiritual foundation for her children, and she \nalso takes on the enormously important task of teaching strong family \nvalues.\n  But this is not all that Kelly George does. Like my wife Sharon, \nKelly balances her tasks as a mother with her duties in an active \ncareer. Kelly has an impressive list of accomplishments outside the \nhousehold. She is on the Thomas Hospital Board of Trustees, is a \nKanawha County Parks and Recreation Commissioner, and chair of the West \nVirginia Board of Risk and Insurance Management. She is also a life \nmember of General Federation of Women's Clubs and the National \nCommittee of State Garden Clubs, as well as international chair for the \nPilot International World Association. On top of all this, she is a \nlegislative analyst, a historian, and the author of ``Rhythms, \nRemembrances and Recipes.''\n\n[[Page S4130]]\n\n  Imagine combining all of these activities with her educational \nbackground in the West Virginia public schools, Marshall College, \nCambridge School of Radio and Television, and Drake School of Drama and \nwith the tremendous job of being a mother. Most of us would find \ndifficulty in staying active just in these tasks outside the home, but \nKelly is able to balance those with her role as a mother.\n  I know Kelly personally and know that she is a phenomenal person who \nis enormously talented. I am proud to say that Kelly George is the West \nVirginia Mother of the Year for 1997-98. And I congratulate her on this \ntremendous achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/07/senate-section/article/S4129-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING ARMAND D'AMATO, SR.\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to my \nfather, Mr. Armand D'Amato, Sr. of Island Park, NY. He is being honored \non May 8, 1997 for his role as the founder of the Island Park Chamber \nof Commerce, which celebrates its 50th anniversary this month. I would \nlike to take this opportunity to commend my father for his lifelong \ncommitment to making his community a richer, more prosperous and safer \nplace to live.\n  One of Armand D'Amato's most im-portant and lasting contributions to \nhis community was the founding of the Island Park Chamber of Commerce \nin 1947. The chamber was, and remains today, a vital tool in developing \nthe economic potential of Island Park. As a small businessman and the \nfirst president of the chamber of commerce, serving in that position \nfor 9 years, dad recognized that economic prosperity should not be \ntaken for granted and that only through vigilance and hard work is a \ncommunity's economic well-being safeguarded.\n  Armand D'Amato was born in Newark, NJ, the second of nine children \nborn to Italian immigrants who traveled to America from Avalino, Italy \nwhile still teenagers. As a child, he rarely heard English spoken in \nhis home. It was not until he attended elementary school at the age of \n5 that he began to learn English. At a time when Italian immigrants in \nAmerica were subjected to unfair discrimination, the obstacles dad \nencountered as a child taught him valuable lessons about the realities \nand hardships of life, and instilled in him a determination to succeed.\n  After earning his bachelor's degree from Montclair State Teachers \nCollege and his master's from New York University, Dad served his \ncountry overseas during World War II. He and my mother, Antoinette, \nsettled in Island Park in 1945. Since that time, he has been \nenergetically involved in the public life of Island Park.\n  Armand D'Amato's dedication to his community did not stop with the \nfounding of the Island Park Chamber of Commerce. He was also \ninstrumental in founding the American Alliance to Combat Crime and \nViolence, an organization sponsored by the Island Park Chamber of \nCommerce dedicated to making Island Park a safer place to live and \nraise a family. He also founded the Island Park Taxpayer Association in \n1953, the Tri-Community Council of Island Park in 1954 and served as \ndistrict governor of the Nassau County Lion's Club in 1963.\n  During the 1970's and 1980's, dad served as director of business \nresearch at the nassau County Department of Commerce and Industry and \norganized the Business Resource Center at Nassau Community College.\n  My father's vigorous commitment to public service and the values he \nhas instilled in his family are reflected by the career paths chosen by \nhis two sons. My brother, Armand D'Amato, Jr., served in the New York \nState Assembly for fourteen years. And my own career in public service \nwas certainly inspired by his active involvement in the community.\n  Armand D'Amato has worked his entire life to make Island Park a \nbetter place to live. His dedication and commitment to the concept of \ncommunity service has had an immeasurable impact on the lives of the \ncitizens of Island Park. My father personifies the spirit of community \nleadership to which others should aspire, and I am proud to join in \nhonoring him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/07/senate-section/article/S4130-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL ARSON AWARENESS WEEK\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to highlight National \nArson Awareness Week, a massive community based arson prevention \nprogram sponsored by the Federal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA], \nwhich began Sunday, May 4, and continues through Saturday, May 10.\n  This program is of particular importance to me because a city in my \nown State--Macon, GA--has been chosen as one of the three pilot cities. \nThe program will focus on a week of special events aimed at educating \nhigh-risk neighborhoods on how to prevent arson and on the importance \nof getting community members involved. The success of this program is \nvital not only in Macon but in the other two pilot cities, Charlotte, \nNC, and Utica, NY, because they will serve as models for future \nAmerican cities.\n  National Arson Awareness Week was inspired by the national arson \nprevention initiative, which was announced by President Clinton on June \n19, 1996, in response to the rash of church burnings, most of which \noccurred in the South. The President asked James Lee Witt, Director of \nFEMA, to coordinate, in partnership with the Department of Justice, the \nDepartment of the Treasury, and the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, available Federal, State, local, and private resources for \narson prevention.\n  Arson is a growing national problem. One out of every four fires in \nthis country is intentionally set. Over 500,000 arson fires occur each \nyear, causing an estimated 750 fatalities and over $2 billion in \nproperty damage.\n  These acts of violence can destroy the very base of a community, but \nthey can be prevented. Mr. President, I ask that you and all of my \ncolleagues recognize this week and the three cities for taking firm \nhold of this problem and proudly pulling their communities together to \nprevent future arson fires.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/07/senate-section/article/S4130-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         C.W. ``MAC'' McCLELLAN\n\n   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay my respects \nto a longtime dear friend, C.W. ``Mac'' McClellan. Mac passed away on \nSunday, May 4th, at his home in Harbor Springs, MI, following a long \nand valiant fight with cancer.\n  My wife Jane and I came to know Mac during his countless years of \nvolunteer service to the Michigan Republican Party. While I have met \nmany exceptional people during my time in politics, I have yet to \nencounter anyone more dedicated to the causes they believed in as was \nMac, nor do I anticipate I will anytime soon.\n  To his wife Ruth and son David, my deepest sympathies. Please know \nyou and your loved ones are in my thoughts and prayers.\n  Any one of a litany of titles could aptly describe Mac: Army Air \nCorps pilot, Air Force Reserves lieutenant colonel, General Motors \nexecutive, civic activist, father, and husband, to name just a few. For \nme, Mac will always be warmly remembered as my friend.\n  Mac McClellan never asked any more of others than he was willing to \ngive of himself. He was blessed with a tireless devotion and a \nboundless spirit, and those who knew Mac are indebted to him for \nleaving our lives richer than he entered them. He will be greatly \nmissed, but not soon forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/07/senate-section/article/S4130-3", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4130-S4131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   KOSRAE AND THE FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA: OUR FRIENDS IN THE \n                           SOUTHWEST PACIFIC\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, for the last two weeks, I have had \nthe great pleasure of sponsoring two Congressional fellows from the \nisland of Kosrae. Mr. Lyndon Jackson and Mr. Charleton Timothy, \nlegislative aides for the Government of Kosrae, have been working in my \noffice since April 22 and will be leaving on May 9. They have been sent \nto Washington at the request of the speaker of the Kosrae State \nLegislature, the Honorable Hiteo S. Shrew, to learn more about our \nNation's legislative and governmental processes.\n  For their benefit, I thought I might take this opportunity to make \nsome observations about Kosrae. As some of my colleagues know, Kosrae \nis one of the most beautiful islands in the Pacific, located just 5 \ndegrees north of the\n\n[[Page S4131]]\n\nequator, about 2,500 miles southwest of Hawaii. While only 42 square \nmiles in size, it is well known throughout the region for its lush \ntopography, beautiful beaches, clear blue waters, and rich coral reefs.\n  I should tell my colleagues that the splendor of Kosrae is not \nexaggerated. My one and only visit to Kosrae took place fifty years ago \nthis year, shortly after the end of World War II, when I had the good \nfortune to help crew the Morning Star, a schooner sent by the churches \nof Boston, MA, as part of a Christian mission to islands in Micronesia. \nThe island was remarkably beautiful at that time, and I have been told \nthat this continues to be the case.\n  Although experiencing significant cultural changes over the past \nseveral decades, Kosrae's 8,000 inhabitants enjoy a casual, family \noriented lifestyle. Fishing is a significant recreational and \ncommercial activity. Kosrae is a major exporter of tuna to Guam and \nother Pacific islands. The island also has an abundance of citrus \nproducts and is particularly known for its sweet tangerines. And Kosrae \nhandicrafts, such as their unique coconut baskets and trays, are \nrenowned throughout the region.\n  Kosrae is a single-island state that is part of the Federated States \nof Micronesia [FSM], formerly known as the United Nations Trust \nTerritory of the Pacific Islands. As trustee of the territory in the \nyears following World War II, the United States was responsible for \npreparing the islands for eventual self-government, by helping develop \ntheir political, economic, and social institutions.\n  In 1978, the four territorial districts of Yap, Chuuk, Pohnpei, and \nKosrae organized to form the Federated States of Micronesia, an action \nwhich became effective 1979 after the adoption of the Federation's \ndraft constitution. The Federated States comprise 607 small islands, \ntotaling only 270 square miles of land, spread across more than 1 \nmillion square miles of the Pacific.\n\n  In 1986, after years of negotiations with our government, the FSM \nentered into the Compact of Free Association. The trusteeship was \nterminated at that time. The United States exercised no further \nadministrative responsibility, and the island nation became fully self-\ngoverning. The terms of the compact generally provided for a framework \nof United States assistance, in return for which the FSM delegated \nsecurity responsibility to the United States. This agreement has been \nin effect since November of 1986 with renegotiation of its financial \nprovisions to start in November of 1999.\n  Mr. President, in the period since the signing of the Compact, the \nclose relationship between the United States and FSM has in some \nrespects become stronger. The FSM has established constitutional \ngovernments at the national, state, and municipal levels that are \npatterned after our own. And in appreciation for our investment in \nMicronesia's quest for self-sufficiency, the FSM has reciprocated by \nmaintaining strong political, economic, educational, and cultural ties.\n  The FSM has also been a strong supporter in the United Nations on key \nissues of concern to the United States For instance, the FSM has \nconsistently voted with the United States on such major issues as the \nsituation in Bosnia, the Middle East peace process, and human rights in \nIran and Iraq.\n  Mr. President, I expect the strong relationship between the peoples \nof Micronesia and the United States to grow stronger and richer in the \nyears ahead, as the FSM's experiment in American-style democracy \ncontinues. As the November 1999 date for renegotiating the compact of \nFree Association draws closer, I hope that my colleagues who have not \nyet had an opportunity to do so will take the opportunity to visit this \nunique and lovely place, and to acquaint themselves with the needs of \nMicronesia's people as well as the unique opportunities that the region \noffers our nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/07/senate-section/article/S4130-4", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FAMILY-FRIENDLY TELEVISION\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I wish to talk about yet \nanother sign of the decline of American culture.\n  What ever happened to the family hour? This is the complaint I have \nheard from many moms and dads in Missouri.\n  It wasn't so long ago that parents could sit down with their school \nage and even preschool children to watch television from 7-8 p.m. and \nnot be worried about the content of the programs.\n  For many years, the major television networks voluntarily ran \nprograms during the first hour of prime time that were considered \nfamily friendly, that is, without profanity, violence, or adult themes.\n  Shows like ``Happy Days,'' ``MASH,'' ``The Waltons,'' ``Little House \non the Prairie,'' and ``The Cosby Show'' gave us wonderful family \nentertainment in the evening, not to mention the fact that they were \ngreat revenue producers for the networks.\n  Now, however, if you turn on the television at that time, you are met \nwith images so graphic, so sexual, or so violent, that you have to \nchannel flip to keep your children from seeing them, or have them leave \nthe room, or turn the television off.\n  The Media Research Center here in the Washington area will issue a \nreport later today on the content of family hour programming.\n  Last year they found that vulgar language was used commonly during \nthe first hour of prime time. They found that sex outside of marriage \nwas portrayed during the family hour eight times more often than sex \nwithin marriage.\n  Mr. President, American families have enough forces working against \nthem--struggling to make ends meet, competing priorities, not enough \ntime together--not to be able to relax together during the evening and \nenjoy a television program that isn't violent, or graphic, or full of \nprofanity.\n  That is why I am joining with many other Senators and Congressmen to \nask Hollywood television executives to bring back the family hour. \nWe're not mandating this. We're not passing a law to force it. We're \nsimply putting a little polite pressure on the networks to ask them to \nthink about American families when they set their programming.\n  Now, they may take the line that it is up to parents to make sure \nthey monitor their children's TV watching. And I agree. But, what we \nare saying is, give parents some good choices. Give us programming that \nwe can watch together, as a family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/07/senate-section/article/S4131-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ARSON EDUCATION\n\n Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, arson poses a serious but \npreventable threat to our society. This week, the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency [FEMA] is launching a community-based campaign \nentitled, ``Target Arson.''\n  Developed by FEMA in conjunction with the National Arson Prevention \nInitiative, ``Target Arson'' will educate young people on the dangers \nof fire, the importance of parental control of access to matches and \ncigarette lighters, and the need for adults to set good examples for \nchildren. I have long been a supporter of efforts to prevent and combat \narson. During my second term in the Senate, I sponsored legislation \nthat was enacted that requires the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n[FBI] to include arson statistics in its Uniform Crime Reports. This \nlegislation increased our ability to detect, prevent, and prosecute \narson crimes.\n  One out of four fires is intentionally set. More than 500,000 fires \nwere set deliberately last year, over one-half of which were set by \njuveniles. These fires killed more than 500 people and caused \napproximately $1 billion in property damage. Through this education \ncampaign, ``Target Arson'' will emphasize the 100 percent preventable \nnature of this offense.\n  Mr. President, I join FEMA and its director, James Lee Witt, in \nsupporting this important educational program. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport arson education in the schools in their States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/07/senate-section/article/S4131-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4131-S4132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 APPOINTMENTS BY THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
