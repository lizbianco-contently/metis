Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume consideration of S. 1033, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1033) making appropriations for Agriculture, \n     Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related \n     Agencies programs for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     1998, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Pending:\n\n       Wellstone amendment No. 972, to provide funds for outreach \n     and startup of the school breakfast program.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 972\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By previous order, we have 10 minutes on the \nWellstone amendment: 5 minutes controlled by the Senator from Minnesota \nand 5 minutes controlled by the floor manager of the bill.\n  Who seeks time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Greg \nRenden, an intern in my office, be allowed to be on the floor for the \nduration of today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I offered this amendment last night. We had a fairly \nthorough discussion. I don't think this is an adversarial relationship \nwith my colleague from Mississippi.\n  Let me just briefly summarize.\n  This amendment revives what is called the Outreach and Start Up Grant \nProgram for school breakfasts. Let me point out to my colleagues what \nthis is about.\n  This is a Children's Defense Fund poster. ``Remember these hungry \nkids in China? Now they are in Omaha.'' They could be in any of our \nStates.\n  We have 5.5 million American children who do not regularly get enough \nto eat. There was a $5 million outreach program that we eliminated last \nyear in the welfare bill. I don't think colleagues knew what they were \nvoting on. They did when it came to the overall welfare bill. But this \nwas one tiny provision.\n  The argument that was made about this outreach program was that it \nwas too successful. That is to say, we have 8 million children who \ncould qualify for the School Breakfast Program but don't receive it \nbecause many school districts and States aren't yet able to set it up.\n\n  This $5 million outreach program made a huge difference. It was very \nsuccessful, and, indeed, the School Breakfast Program is credited as \nbeing one of the most successful nutritional programs in our country.\n  I fear that too many of my colleagues do not understand that there \nare children in our country who go to school hungry, and we are not \ndoing very much about it. When children go to\n\n[[Page S7988]]\n\nschool hungry, they don't do well in school, and when they don't do \nwell in school they can't learn, and when they are adults later on they \ncan't earn.\n  It is very shortsighted that we eliminated this program. We should \nnot have done so.\n  Mr. President, there are 8 million children spread across 27,000 \nschools who go to school hungry or are malnourished or without enough \nto eat. The distinctions aren't that important. We can do better.\n  For $5 million we can have an outreach program that will enable more \nof our States and more of our school districts to provide a school \nbreakfast, a nutritious meal, to children before they start school.\n  Mr. President, again this is an extremely effective program. Study \nafter study has really pointed out that the School Breakfast Program \nmakes an enormous difference. It makes an enormous difference in terms \nof overall test scores. It makes an enormous difference in terms of \nwhether students drop out of school or not, whether they arrive at \nschool on time, and how well they do.\n  Clearly this amendment speaks to priorities. Surely we can find $5 \nmillion.\n  Mr. President, the offset is from funds allocated to the crop \ninsurance companies for which right now the total amount is $202 \nmillion. In the Senate we have $24 million more than the House \nappropriated. We have $52 million more than the President appropriated.\n  The GAO in a very critical report of this insurance program pointed \nout that there is $81 million more than the companies' expenses for \nselling and servicing crop insurance.\n  I am very careful to maintain the integrity of this program--a mere \n$5 million transfer, $5 million out of $24 million more than the House \nallocated, $5 million out of $52 million we have more than the \nPresident asked for, which could go to an outreach program for school \nbreakfast.\n  I make this appeal to colleagues. There are too many children in our \ncountry who are malnourished. There are too many children who cannot \nlearn. There are too many children who have rotting teeth because they \ndon't get the decent meals that they deserve and the adequate meal that \nthey deserve and the nutrition that they deserve. There are too many \nchildren who aren't able to concentrate in school. There are too many \nchildren who suffer from health care problems because they don't have \nan adequate diet.\n  We never should have done that. We never should have done this. We \neliminated the most successful outreach program--total cost for the \nwhole Nation, $5 million.\n  Surely it is not asking too much of my colleagues to allocate a \ntransfer of this small amount of money to make sure that we provide \nchildren with an adequate breakfast, with a decent meal, so that they \ncan start school on the right foot and do well.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume \nto remind Senators that this is an issue that came up during the \nwelfare reform debate. The President proposed repeal of these startup \ngrants during last year's welfare reform debate.\n  In addition, the Democratic substitute welfare reform bill and the \nRepublican welfare reform bill contained a provision to repeal these \ngrants. Funds were taken from the grant program to expand the school \nbreakfast and summer food service programs.\n  Additionally, the Senate voted on a similar proposal to the Wellstone \namendment on the Department of Defense authorization bill on July 9 and \ndefeated it by a vote of 65 to 33.\n  The question is not whether we need to do more in terms of \nacquainting students and school districts and parents with the \navailability of these important nutrition programs. The question is: Do \nwe need Federal dollars that could otherwise go to the feeding programs \nthemselves to be diverted for that purpose, or do we need to divert, as \nthe Senator suggests, funds from other parts of this appropriations \nbill which are needed for other matters?\n  Our suggestion is that we try to do a better job of working with \nlocal school districts, with parent groups, with the schools \nthemselves, to make sure that all students are aware of the \navailability of these programs.\n  We have increased funding for all of the food nutrition programs as a \nwhole. The WIC program, for example, has over $200 million increased \nfunding in this bill to guarantee that the current participation rate \nwill not be compromised as a result of our effort to reduce spending \nand balance the budget.\n  We are protecting those who are vulnerable. We are protecting those \nwho need assistance to meet their nutrition needs in this budget.\n  This is a sensitive bill on this subject, and I urge all Senators to \nvote against this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  I move to table the Wellstone amendment, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the vote on the amendments under the \norder will commence at 10 a.m. We have not yet reached that hour.\n  Let me, for the information of Senators, remind them that we have \nother amendments that were stated in the order as subject to votes \nbeginning at 10 o'clock this morning with 2 minutes for debate between \neach amendment, which will be stacked with time equally divided.\n  Those amendments under the order are the Wellstone amendment; the \nmanagers' package, which was adopted last night; the Bingaman amendment \non CRP, which we are advised will not be offered; the Robb amendment on \nfarmers' civil rights, which we hope will be resolved on a voice vote. \nWe have proposed an alternative to the Robb amendment which is under \nconsideration now, we are told, and a Johnson amendment on livestock \npackers' issues. We are advised that that will not be offered.\n\n  So, with the vote on the motion to table the Wellstone amendment, and \nif we do not need a vote on the Robb amendment, then we will move to \nfinal passage immediately after the vote on the motion to table the \nWellstone amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that David \nSchindel, a legislative fellow in my office, be granted floor \nprivileges for the remainder of the day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                         Farmers' Civil Rights\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I have an amendment that we have been \nworking very hard to work out. I commend and appreciate the cooperation \nof the chairman and the ranking member of the Agriculture Committee.\n  It is an amendment that has been requested specifically by the \nSecretary of Agriculture to address a very serious problem. We have had \ndocumented discrimination by the U.S. Department of Agriculture against \nminority and impoverished farmers over an extended period of time. A \nreport that he requested that took 90 days to compile again documented \nthe same problem. We have reports going back to 1995 to document the \nproblem.\n  To the best of my knowledge, no Senator who has worked with me or \nworked on this particular problem has suggested in any way, shape, or \nform that the problem does not exist and that we do not have an \nobligation to solve it. The only difficulty that we have run into is \nidentifying the precise offset. The offset that the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Agriculture recommended is one in terms of a very small \nreduction in the crop insurance Program, taking it down from 28 to \n27.9, I believe it is.\n  I hope that by the time the vote will actually be required we will \nhave resolved this particular question. If we do not, I say and I \npledge to those involved on both sides of the aisle that\n\n[[Page S7989]]\n\nwe will do everything we can between now and conference to ensure that \nwe have an offset that is consistent with the programs that the various \nMembers are interested in protecting but, most importantly, addresses \nthis situation.\n  The bottom line is that the investigative unit in the Department of \nAgriculture, unbeknownst to the farmers who were affected by the \ndiscrimination, was abolished 13 years ago, and they were relying on \nthat. The Department of Agriculture says they need this particular \nremedy to solve the problem.\n  We will work with the committee and work with the conferees, if \nnecessary, if we can't come up with the right offset. But I hope that \nthis can be accepted, and if it is not, I hope that we get a vote on \nit--a very positive vote on it. We will certainly work hard to make \nsure that we have the appropriate offset at the appropriate time.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am happy to hear the remarks of the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia, and I am encouraged by his \nattitude to try to work this out so that we will not have to prolong \nthe time of Senators this morning on a rollcall vote if it is not \nnecessary. We think that this is a matter of importance as well, and we \nhope that adequate funds can be made available so that there can be in \nthe office of civil rights in the Department of Agriculture funds \nneeded to carry on this important work.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 972, as modified\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I have just been conferring with my colleagues from \nKansas and Arkansas. I ask unanimous consent that I be able to modify \nmy amendment that the offset be from travel and administrative costs \nwithin the Department of Agriculture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I have no objection.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Will the Senator send the modification to the desk.\n  The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 972), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 47, line 6, strike ``$7,769,066,000'' and insert \n     ``$7,774,066,000''.\n       On page 47, line 13, insert after ``claims'' the following: \n     ``: Provided further, That not less than $5,000,000 shall be \n     available for outreach and startup in accordance with section \n     4(f) of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. \n     1773(f))''.\n       On page 66, between lines 12 and 13, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 728.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to the \nAgriculture appropriations bill that will provide USDA with the \nresources to reestablish the Department's investigative unit and to \nimprove outreach efforts, ensuring equal access for all farmers in USDA \nprograms. This amendment will allow the Department of Agriculture to \nresolve the backlog of complaints made by farmers who have suffered \nracial discrimination at the hands of USDA, and will provide the \nDepartment with the resources necessary to eradicate discrimination and \nimprove small and minority farmers' participation in agricultural \nprograms.\n  Mr. President, discrimination of any kind is offensive. But it is \neven more repugnant when it is practiced by people within the Federal \nGovernment--the very body that is supposed to come to the aid of the \ndisadvantaged and the dispossessed. Sadly, Mr. President, the \nDepartment of Agriculture has had a long history of discrimination \nagainst minority and disadvantaged farmers, as well as minority and \nwomen employees.\n  Mr. President, for too long serving the needs of small and \ndisadvantaged farmers has clearly not been a priority for USDA, and \nuntil recently the Department had not supported any coordinated effort \nto address this problem. In fact, despite decades of documented \ndiscrimination in program delivery and employment, USDA acknowledges \ntoday they have a backlog of nearly 800 racial discrimination \ncomplaints by farmers, some of which have been pending for over 7 \nyears. Even Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman admits that for ``far \ntoo long USDA has turned a blind eye to serious, pervasive problems \nwith [the] civil rights system.'' Fortunately, Secretary Glickman is \ncommitted to fixing this long-standing problem, but he needs the tools \nto accomplish the task.\n  Mr. President, I have discovered that although studies, reports, and \ntask forces from 1965 to 1997 have all documented discrimination and \nmistreatment of minority and socially disadvantaged customers, as well \nas agency employees, many do not know the extent of these long-standing \nproblems plaguing the Department.\n  The reality is black farmers in the United States are dwindling at \nthree times the rate of farmers nationwide--nearly to the point of \nextinction.\n  In December 1996, after a group of black farmers demonstrated outside \nthe White House calling for fair treatment in agricultural lending \nprograms, Secretary Glickman promptly called for a national forum, and \nappointed a Civil Rights Action Team to conduct a thorough audit of \nUSDA civil rights issues inside and outside the department.\n  Within 90 days, the Civil Rights Action Team published a 121-page \nreport confirming not only that small and minority farmers had often \nnot been served at all, but in many cases the service provided by USDA \nappeared to be detrimental to their survival. Minority farmers have \nlost significant amounts of land and potential farm income as a result \nof discrimination by USDA agencies.\n\n  Secretary Glickman came to the Capitol just last week and addressed \nthe House Agriculture Committee on racial discrimination. The Secretary \nadmitted that his Department has ``a long history of both \ndiscrimination and perceptions of unfairness that go back literally to \nthe middle of the 19th century.'' The Secretary acknowledged that USDA \ndoes not fully practice what they preach, and during field hearings he \nhad spoken to people who had lost their farms and lost their family \nland, as he said, ``not because of a bad crop, not because of a flood, \nbut because of the color of their skin.'' The Secretary went on to \nstate his desire to close this chapter of USDA's history and stated his \ngoal is ``to get USDA out from under the past and have it emerge in the \n21st century as the Federal civil rights leader.''\n  I commend the Secretary for his leadership in candidly and openly \naddressing an issue that for too long has plagued the U.S. Department \nof Agriculture. I am convinced that his commitment to eradicating \ndiscrimination at USDA is genuine, but before we can solve the problem \nprospectively, we have to focus on the problem at hand, the nearly 800 \npending complaints.\n  I initially intended to offer an amendment to the Agricultural \nappropriations bill that would give USDA the necessary authority and \nresources to eliminate any legal impediments and expedite the \nsettlement of the nearly 800 pending discrimination complaints by \nfarmers against the Department of Agriculture.\n  After speaking to Secretary Glickman on Monday, the Secretary \nindicated that he intends to settle claims out of the Judgment Fund and \nthat he does not view the identification of a funding source as an \nimpediment to entering into appropriate settlements. Because he is \npersuaded that existing mechanisms can be used to provide appropriate \nremedies to those aggrieved, my original amendment, at this time, will \nnot be necessary.\n  The Secretary did alert me to two areas where he urgently needs \nadditional funds, however. These two areas are directly related to \nresolving the current backlog of racial discrimination complaints by \nfarmers, and my current amendment addresses this need.\n  In 1983, the civil rights investigative unit at USDA was simply \nabolished.\n\n[[Page S7991]]\n\n For 14 years, farmers were led to believe their cases were being \ninvestigated when in truth they were not. As a result, determinations \nwere being made on some cases based on preliminary findings often \ncompiled by the person accused of discrimination and the backlog of \ncases has grown to 798 complaints.\n  Without investigation, virtually none of the complaints can now be \nsettled. That's why the Secretary needs to reestablish the \ninvestigative unit to finally resolve the longstanding problem plaguing \nthe Department of Agriculture. The Secretary's goal is to establish a \n34-person investigative unit to address the backlog by July 1998 and to \nensure timely resolution of all future complaints, and my current \namendment provides the Secretary with $2 million for that purpose.\n  Mr. President, the process for resolving complaints has failed our \nNation's farmers. Today, we have to give the Secretary the necessary \nresources so that he may back up his sympathetic words with action. We \nhave to begin investigating these complaints so the farmers' cases, \nsome over 7 years old, can finally be settled.\n  Mr. President, the Secretary has also indicated that the funding \nlevel currently in the Agriculture appropriations bill for the Outreach \nfor Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers Program is \ninsufficient. My new amendment provides USDA with an additional $1 \nmillion to improve USDA outreach efforts. The Department acknowledges \nthat poor outreach efforts are central to the USDA's failure to meet \nthe needs of minority farmers. Increased funding, as well as improved \ntargeting, will improve minority participation in USDA programs and \nwill demonstrate the Department's commitment to serving their needs.\n  Virginia farmers have told me the importance of this outreach effort \nand I agree, equal program access for all farmers is crucial.\n  Before President Clinton can lead this country in a discussion about \nrace relations, we must first confront the discrimination within our \nFederal Government. We must resolve the underlying civil rights \nproblems at USDA to make the system work for both customers and \nemployees. Congress can help those individuals at the U.S. Department \nof Agriculture actually interested in improving USDA's ability to serve \nagriculture and our Nation with the necessary resources to provide \nappropriate remedies for those aggrieved. For it is only after USDA \nmakes amends for its past injustices that they can face the bigger \nchallenge of eradicating discrimination at all levels within the \nDepartment of Agriculture.\n  Mr. President, if reluctance to resolve these longstanding issues \ncontinues much longer, then the problem may well sadly resolve itself. \nWithout immediate action we could lose all of our minority farmers and \nan important part of our heritage forever. I would certainly hope that \nno Member of Congress would want to see that happen.\n  Mr. President, very briefly, I thank the chairman and the ranking \nmember of the Agriculture Committee. A number of Members in \nagricultural States presented difficulties with the original proposed \nsolution, none more important than the current Presiding Officer who \napprised this Senator of concerns about one of the original offsets. We \nhave now worked it out, where there is agreement on both sides. It is \nsupported by the administration.\n  Basically, this reestablishes the investigative unit for the \nDepartment of Agriculture.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is precisely \ncorrect.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may we have order in the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President. As I say, this amendment will \nreestablish the investigative unit for the Office of Civil Rights. It \nwill provide the additional money necessary for the outreach for \nminority and socially disadvantaged farmers. This is precisely what the \nSecretary of Agriculture said is necessary to solve a vexing problem \nthat has been with the department for decades. Literally it has been \ndocumented time and time again.\n  I thank all Senators who worked on finding the appropriate offsets so \nwe could provide the funding that the department has requested. I \nbelieve it has been cleared and approved on both sides.\n  With that information, I urge adoption of the amendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 977) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ROBB. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                             PEANUT PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my continued \nsupport for the peanut program.\n  Mr. President, just last year the Senate completed a comprehensive \nreview of all federally sponsored farm programs. This review prompted \nextensive debate in this chamber--debate in which divergent positions \nwere articulated and competing interests were expounded. Ultimately, \nafter much hard work, consideration and compromise, the Senate produced \nthe landmark 1996 farm bill.\n  The farm bill sets Federal farm policy through the year 2002 and \ncontains fundamental changes which have impacted every facet of Federal \ninvolvement in farm programs--from crop subsidies, conservation \npractices and rural subsidies to credit, research and trade policies. \nIncluded in this legislation were provisions that specifically covered \nthe peanut program, provisions which made considerable changes to the \nprogram.\n  This year, despite the significant work that went into putting the \nfarm bill together, despite the fact that the farm bill reforms of the \npeanut program have only been on the books for little over a year and \nhave only affected one crop, and despite the fact that thousands of \nfarmers have made significant financial and farming commitments through \nthe year 2002 in reliance upon the provisions of the farm bill, some \nMembers have discussed undoing the work of the sponsors of the farm \nbill and dismantling the peanut program.\n  Mr. President, I feel any attempt to change the peanut program is \nunnecessary, misguided, and would ultimately destroy American peanut \nfarming and American peanut farmers.\n  Mr. President, the peanut program helps support more than 16,000 \nfamily farmers, many of whom live in some of the poorest, most \nagriculturally dependent areas in the United States. Mr. President, the \npeanut program provides American consumers with a steady and large \nsupply of safe and cheap peanuts and peanut products.\n  Mr. President, the peanut program works for American peanut farmers \nand American consumers. It has been significantly revised in recent \nyears and these revisions will only serve to enhance the program if \nallowed to stand. We must allow farmers who have relied on the farm \nbill an opportunity to work within the new peanut program.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Cochran, the chairman \nof the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, and Senator Bumpers, the \nranking member, for bringing to the Senate Floor the Fiscal Year 1998 \nAppropriations Bill. This bill will provide funding for all activities \nof the Department of Agriculture, except those of the Forest Service, \nand the functions of the Food and Drug Administration, the Farm Credit \nAdministration, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n  This bill, as reported by the Appropriations Committee, provides \n$50.7 billion in total obligational authority for the coming year. That \nis nearly $1.1 billion more than the bill reported by the House \nAppropriations Committee, and $1.6 billion below the President's \nrequest. It is within the subcommittee's 602(b) allocation.\n  This bill is $3.2 billion below last year's level, due largely to \nreductions in mandatory accounts. The subcommittee's discretionary \nallocation in budget authority was increased from $13.1 billion in \nfiscal year 1997 to $13.8 billion in this bill.\n\n[[Page S7992]]\n\n  This bill provides funding for programs vitally important to all \nAmericans. These include agricultural research necessary to keep our \nfarmers competitive in the global marketplace, conservation programs to \nprotect the environment and productivity of the land, rural development \nprograms to serve the millions of Americans who live outside our \ncities, and programs to promote U.S. agricultural products throughout \nthe world. Funding in this bill for the Food Safety Inspection Service \nand the Food and Drug Administration ensures we will have safe food and \nblood supplies and that pharmaceuticals and medical devices will be \nsafe and effective.\n  I would like to specifically remark on the inclusion of funding for \nthe second year of the Potomac Headwaters Land Treatment Watershed \nProject, a program to protect the Potomac River and its headwater \nfeeder streams from a possible harmful accumulation of agricultural \npollution. I am aware that some Members of Congress have expressed \nconcern about the June 1, 1997, Washington Post article and an American \nRivers' report that, in part, attributed pollution in the Potomac to \nWest Virginia poultry production. These reports raised concerns but \nwere one-sided in that they did not address the responsible actions \nalready underway to mitigate possible problems that can be associated \nwith poultry waste. Funding in this bill will continue the exemplary \nefforts by public officials and West Virginia small family farmers to \nbalance economic interest with environmental goals by providing Federal \nmoney for technical assistance and loans to help family farmers design \nand institute the type of measures necessary to prevent pollution in \nrivers and streams. The program achieves benefits for a broad base of \ninterests, extending from my beautiful state to the Chesapeake Bay, and \nis an example of government at its best. I thank the members of the \ncommittee for recognizing the widespread concerns held by the millions \nof people who draw their drinking water from the Potomac, and for \ntaking action to alleviate these concerns.\n  In all this is a very good bill, and I am happy to support its \npassage. Again, I congratulate Senator Cochran and Senator Bumpers for \ntheir hard work. I also commend the work of the subcommittee staff: \nGalen Fountain and Carole Geagley, for the minority, and Rebecca \nDavies, Martha Scott Poindexter, and Rachelle Graves, for the majority.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, before we complete action on the \nAgriculture and Related Agencies appropriations bill, I wanted to \ncompliment the chairman, Senator Cochran, and the ranking member, \nSenator Bumpers, for their very hard work and very able leadership.\n  All the Members know of the many demands placed on the subcommittee \nto fund many worthwhile projects. We also know that the discretionary \nspending available to the Agriculture Subcommittee has been reduced \nsubstantially over the last several years. This very limited funding \nmakes it difficult to fund all the many excellent proposals that have \ncome to the subcommittee for consideration.\n  Mr. President, while I understand the limitations of the subcommittee \nto fund all good projects, I would be less than frank if I did not \nmention my disappointment with a number of items that were left out of \nthis bill. One of those projects not funded by this bill is an \nExtension Service training project to help bring behavioral and mental \nhealth services to rural areas.\n  As the Members know, the Extension Service is a long and well \nestablished institution that exists across the country in almost every \ncounty in America. In the minds of most people, the Extension Service \nand the Extension agents are focused on agricultural and farm issues. \nWhile this impression is true the facts also reveal that the Extension \nService is called on more and more to help meet family, health, and \nsocial service needs of our rural residents. The array of services \noffered by the Extension Service is established at the State level by \nState priorities. In my State, and I am sure in other States, as well, \nthe Extension Service is doing a great job in meeting rural needs for a \nbroad array of services.\n  In Florida, for example, following Hurricane Andrew, our Extension \nagents were trained to provide threshold counseling services to rural \nresidents who were under severe emotional stress following the storm. \nThe agents were trained to identify problems, provide initial \ncounseling and to refer severe cases to appropriate professionals. This \ntraining was provided by the University of Florida and the program \nreceived a USDA award. The University of Florida was recently invited \nto North Dakota to train Extension agents following the floods. Initial \nreports from the Director of the Extension Service in North Dakota is \nthat the program ``exceeded expectations''.\n  Mr. President, for a very small amount of money this bill could have \ncreated a small program or center to be a national resource for the \nExtension Service. This center would train the agents from the various \nStates to be better able to provide the counseling services that they \nare more and more being called on to provide. The demand for these \nservices is due in large part to the lack of service providers in rural \nareas.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope and expectation that the Department will \nlook at this proposal very carefully and reprogram some funds or \ninclude it in the Department's next budget request. It is a program \nthat has been proven to work. It is a program that meets a very large \nneed in our rural areas. In the process of this review I would also \nexpect that the Department meet with the appropriate officials at the \nUniversity of Florida who have a track record in this area.\n\n\n                FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION PROVISIONS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, there is growing awareness of the huge \npotential savings to consumers and taxpayers from the prompt approval \nof generic drugs, a fact which was one of the reasons that Congress \npassed the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of \n1984. That statute created a legal structure that benefits both \nconsumers and the generic industry while providing strong incentives \nfor continued investment by the brand companies in research and \ndevelopment.\n  Unfortunately, the success of the act has been limited by the \ninability of the Food and Drug Administration to comply with its \nstatutory mandate to approve generic drug applications within 180 days. \nIn fact, generic drug approvals now are taking an average of \napproximately 23 months, nearly four times the statutory requirement, \nand the number of personnel at the agency responsible for this mission \nhas been significantly reduced. This latter fact is especially \ntroubling since the personnel levels in several administrative areas \nhave grown significantly.\n  The Appropriations Committee has taken action to address this \nfailure. Last year, the committee directed the FDA to expend sufficient \nresources to ensure compliance with its statutory mandates. This year, \nthe committee has further directed the agency to provide the relevant \ncongressional committees 90 days after the beginning of the fiscal year \nwith a plan that explains how the agency will meet the statutory review \ntime for generic drug applications.\n  The House Appropriations Committee, apparently losing patience with \nthe FDA, included an extra million dollars in the fiscal 1998 bill for \nthe express purpose of increasing the speed of generic drug reviews. \nThe committee report noted that health care costs have increased to \nextraordinary levels and that the timely approval of generic drugs \ncould save billions of dollars. The committee also reports that FDA \ncosts related to administrative functions were excessive, pointing out \nthat expenditures for the Office of the Commissioner in fiscal year \n1997 far exceeded total expenditures for the offices of the Secretary \nand all the Under and Assistant Secretaries at the Department of \nAgriculture.\n  It is my strong desire that the conference will give serious \nconsideration to the House Committee's direction of funds for generic \ndrug approvals. It is obvious that if the FDA complies with its \nstatutory mandates, patients will be the winners, especially in terms \nof the tremendous savings that consumers could reap if generic \ncompetitors are sent to market more quickly. Mr. President, this \nseemingly small and perhaps even insignificant corner of the Federal \nbudget has the potential to help every family in our country by \nreducing the cost that we all must pay\n\n[[Page S7993]]\n\nfor life-saving pharmaceutical products, and I hope the conferees will \ngive it serious weight.\n  In closing, I want to commend you, Chairman Cochran, for the splendid \njob you have done in crafting this legislation, and pay particular \ncommendation to Rebecca Davies of your staff, who is indeed such an \nasset to the committee.\n\n\n                        Northeast Dairy Compact\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to again focus as I did yesterday on \nthe study of the Northeast dairy compact that will be contained in the \nappropriations bill as it winds its way through conference with the \nHouse and then comes back to the Senate.\n  Under the Senate proposal, the Director of OMB will do a study on \ndairy, retail store, wholesale, and processor pricing in New England.\n  As I mentioned yesterday, many Senators are very concerned that when \nthe price that farmers get for their milk drops that the retail price--\nthe consumer price--often does not drop. Study after study shows this \nresult.\n  Wholesale or retail stores appear to be simply making more profits at \nthe expense of farmers. This is one of the issues OMB should examine.\n  But it is very important that OMB not just give us numbers. It will \nnot be helpful to Congress, and will be misleading, if OMB just says, \nfor example, that the average price of milk in stores during the first \n6 months of the compact was a certain amount higher than some earlier \namount.\n  It will not assist decision makers at all if OMB then simply \nmultiplies that difference by the number of gallons bought by persons \non Food Stamps and concludes that the product of the multiplication is \nthe ``harm'' to the food stamp program.\n  It is important for OMB to put the information in context or they \nshouldn't even do the study. I do not want information that I cannot \nuse in deciding on legislative options.\n  To continue with the food stamp example, if the cuts in the welfare \nreform bill enacted last year are 10 times, or 20 times, or 30 times \nmore--not 30 percent more, but 30 times more--than any impact of the \ncompact then perhaps the best legislative solution is to reduce the \nwelfare reform cuts by one-thirtieth rather than dealing with the \ncompact since the compact has positive benefits.\n  It will be extremely important, from a policy perspective, to make \nthese types of comparisons. Also note, I do not think that any increase \nthat shows up in retail stores is justifiable under the compact after \nsuch a huge decrease in farm prices. But, if OMB assumes some we should \nknow if the national system of milk marketing orders, or if store \nprofits, dwarfs the impact of the compact. This will help us with \npolicy decisions.\n  A 1991 study by GAO showed a huge variation in regional pricing of \nmilk in retail stores. Just those variations may far exceed any impact \nof the compact. We need OMB to look at these issues.\n  Without this more detailed analysis we will only be able to announce \nnumbers on the Senate floor to support positions, but we will not be \nable to use the OMB study to come to good policy conclusions.\n  In addition, the purchase of fluid milk represents only a small \nfraction of total food expenditures. One study showed that fluid milk \nrepresents 3 percent of total food expenditures of the typical family. \nIf use of discount coupons for a variety of foods, or the purchase of \nstore brands, or shopping at less expensive stores dwarf the impacts of \nthe compact, that should also be analyzed.\n  It makes a big difference if the impact of the compact is equivalent \nto one-fourth of 1 percent of a family's food purchasing power versus, \nlet's say, 5 percent of the family's food purchasing power.\n  I also want OMB to look at the drop in food purchasing power, \nadjusted for inflation, that will be caused by full implementation of \nthe welfare reform bill for our lower income households. Food stamp \nfamilies live below the poverty level and these comparisons will be \nhelpful for possible legislative solutions.\n  You should also look at whether some stores price dairy products to \nincrease their profits when they already have a reasonable return on \nmilk. Are the profit margins on dairy products higher, or lower, than \nfor other items? Do the profit margins far exceed any potential impact \nof the compact? Or are they less?\n  It will be interesting and very helpful to see how milk prices change \nduring the entire duration of the compact. There are news reports that \nsome retailers are taking unfair advantage of the compact. If this is \naccurate, these effects should be temporary as the normal competitive \nforces take over. It is important to note that economists who have \nanalyzed the compact determined that over time it could lower consumer \nprices by stabilizing the price that stores pay for milk.\n  Many reports show that stores build in an extra margin to protect \nagainst increases in milk costs since it is costly to routinely change \nprices. If no extra margins are required it is very likely that \ncompetitive forces would lead stores to reduce those extra margins.\n  Researchers such as Henry Kinnucan, Olan Forker, Andrew Novakovic, \nBrandon Hansen, William Hahn and others have looked at how price \nvolatility at the wholesale level can result in increases in consumer \nprices for milk higher than would have occurred had wholesale prices \nbeen stable. In the New England area I am told some stores sell gallons \nof milk for $1.99 and some sell them for $3.29--that is a large \ndifference and none of the difference goes to farmers.\n  OMB should look at that difference to help us with our policy \ndecisions. That could, indeed, be a major contribution to better \nunderstanding the impact of the compact, or milk marketing orders, or \nretail store pricing--how can such a difference exist?\n  It is my view that the compact over time can reduce that need for \nextra margins since stores will not have to build in that cushion to \nprotect against feared higher prices. And many economic studies support \nthat point. My view is that no increase should have occurred especially \nafter the major drop in milk prices to farmers starting late last year. \nI want to touch on one more issue. The statutory language talks of the \ndirect and indirect effects of the compact.\n  I am a strong supporter of the compact and believe it has very \npositive indirect effects in addition to stabilizing the price of milk. \nThe Secretary of Agriculture has also addressed these positive indirect \neffects.\n  I have detailed these effects in correspondence to the Secretary of \nAgriculture and will provide these to OMB at a later date.\n  I want to mention again a point I raised yesterday. The prices \nfarmers get for their milk dropped substantially last November \nnationwide. They dropped quickly, and have stayed low for months.\n  It amounted to a 35-cent to 40-cent drop on a per gallon basis. Yet \nretail stores did not lower their prices to consumers except by a few \npennies. This pricing practice for milk is well documented in the \nresearch and in the press.\n  Does this failure to drop prices by 35 cents, or even just 25 cents, \na gallon have a major impact on consumers?\n  Will it be more than any hypothetical impact on consumers of \nthe compact? In many areas of the country there is now a $1.40/gallon \ndifference between the raw milk price--which farmers get--and the \nretail price of milk. Is that justified?\n\n  OMB should look at what that difference represents in terms of \nprofits for transporters, stores, and wholesalers.\n  The Wall Street Journal pointed out that the value of milk for \nfarmers plunged by 22 percent since October 1996--but that no \ncomparative decline occurred in the price of milk. Another point I made \nyesterday was that the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times have \nexposed retail store overcharging for milk. This should be examined.\n  Farmers got one-fifth less for their milk, and someone, I presume, \nmade a bundle. Some studies show that the dairy case is now the most \nprofitable part of a supermarket. This should be carefully examined \nsince most families consider milk a necessity.\n  Also, the time period that OMB examines may completely determine \ntheir conclusions. Something this important should not be determined by \nthe luck of the draw.\n\n[[Page S7994]]\n\n  In this regard, under the compact, farmers in New England are getting \nless for their milk than the average price they got for their milk last \nyear.\n  It will be important for OMB to look at all the factors which affect \nthe price of fluid milk including farm prices, labor, transportation, \nmilk marketing orders, retail profits, co-op returns, marketing \nstrategies, feed costs, farm expenses, and wholesaler profits.\n  I want to also quote from a letter that I sent to the Secretary \nregarding the compact relating to the indirect benefits of the compact.\n  You should note that a lack of farm income resulting from low dairy \nprices is cited as the major reason dairy farmers leave farming in New \nEngland. Production costs in New England are much higher than in other \nareas of the Nation while the value of the land for nonfarm purposes is \noften greater than its value as farmland.\n  This is very different as compared to vast areas of the Midwest and \nUpper Midwest where land is sometimes worth little except for its value \nas farmland. As the Vermont Economy Newsletter reported in July 1994:\n\n       In the all important dairy industry, the decrease in farm \n     income has come from a continuation of the long term trends \n     the industry has been facing. Should these trends persist, \n     and there is every expectation they will, Vermont will \n     continue to see dairy farms disappearing from its landscape \n     during the 1990's.\n\n  One of the consequences of the exit of dairy farmers in New England \nis that land is released from agriculture. Given the close proximity to \npopulation centers and recreational areas in New England, good land is \nin high demand, and as a result there is often a strong incentive to \ndevelop the land.\n  What are the consequences of land being converted from farm to \nnonfarm uses?\n  One consequence is that the rural heritage and aesthetic qualities of \nthe working landscape are lost forever. The impact of this loss would \nbe devastating to Vermont and to much of New England. The tourists from \nsome of America's largest urban centers are drawn to rural New England \nbecause of its beauty, its farms and valleys, and picturesque roads.\n  Strip malls and condominiums do not have the same appeal to \nvacationers.\n  The Vermont Partnership for Economic Progress, noted in its 1993 \nreport, ``Plan for a Decade of Progress: Actions for Vermont's \nEconomy,''\n\n       There are many issues that will influence the [tourism] \n     industry's future in Vermont . . . including our state's \n     ability to preserve its landscape.\n\n  The report went on to list among its primary goals: Maintain the \nexisting amount of land in agriculture and related uses; and preserve \nthe family farm as part of our economic base and as an integral factor \nin Vermont's quality of life. This is taken from ``A Plan for a Decade \nof Progress.''\n  The priority of these goals show that preserving farmland and a \nviable agriculture industry are important for the overall economic \nhealth of the region from Maine, to rural parts of Connecticut, Rhode \nIsland, and Massachusetts, to Vermont and New Hampshire.\n  Other consequences of farm losses are equally destructive. The \nAmerican Farmland Trust has completed cost of community services \nstudies in four New England towns, one in Connecticut and three in \nMassachusetts.\n  These studies show the cost of providing community services for \nfarmland and developed land. It is true that developed land brings in \nmore tax revenues than farmland, especially when farmland is assessed \nat its agricultural value, as it is in most New England States. \nDeveloped land, however, requires far more in the way of services than \nthe tax revenues it returns to the treasuries of municipalities.\n  For example, residential land in these four New England towns \nrequired $1.11 in services for every $1 in tax revenue generated while \nthe farmland required only $0.34 of services for every $1 of revenue it \ngenerated. This demonstrates the major impact that losing dairy \nfarmland has on rural New England.\n  National Geographic recently detailed the risk of economic death by \nstrip malling otherwise tourist-drawing farmland. New England should be \nallowed to try to reverse this trend--especially in ways that help \nneighboring States such as under the compact.\n  The American Farmland Trust Study pointed out that agricultural land \nactually enhanced the value of surrounding lands in addition to \nsustaining important economic uses.\n  Farming is a cost effective, private way to protect open space and \nthe quality of life. It also supports a profusion of other interests, \nincluding: hunting, fishing, recreation, tourism, historic \npreservation, floodplain, and wetland protection. ``Does Farmland \nProtection Pay?'' is the name of that study.\n  Keeping land in agriculture and protecting it from development is \nvitally important for all of New England which is one reason all six \nNew England States have funded or authorized purchase of agricultural \nconservation easement programs to help protect farmland permanently. \nUnlike much of the Midwest, for example, once farms go out of business, \nthe land is converted and is lost forever for agricultural purposes.\n  Other economic uses, from condominiums and second homes for retired \nor professional people from New York, Boston, or Philadelphia to \nshopping malls to serve them, are waiting in the wings. The pressure to \ndevelop in New England is voracious.\n  A 1993 report from the American Farmland Trust called ``Farming on \nthe Edge'' showed that only 14 of the more than 67 counties in New \nEngland, were not significantly influenced by urban areas.\n  In fact, eight New England counties were considered to be farming \nareas in the greatest danger of being lost to development because of \ntheir high productivity and close proximity to urban areas. The \nChamplain and Hudson River Valleys were considered to be among the top \n12 threatened agricultural areas in the entire country according to \nthis study. ``Farming on the Edge'' is the name of that study.\n  As we go to Conference I will further explore the goals and intent \nbehind this language.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote by which the bill was \npassed.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, let me thank all Senators for their \ncooperation and assistance in the passage of this bill, particularly \nthose members of our subcommittee and the full Committee on \nAppropriations. Those who had amendments and helped improve the bill, \nwe appreciate their help as well. I also want to make a special point \nto commend and thank the members of our staff--on our side of the aisle \nRebecca Davies, who is the clerk of the subcommittee; Martha Scott \nPoindexter, who assisted her; Rachelle Graves-Bell; and our intern, \nJustin Brasell, who also was a help in the preparation of this bill. We \nhad a lot of hearings. We did a lot of work developing this \nlegislation. We appreciate the help that we got.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me echo the laudatory comments the \nSenator from Mississippi has just paid to the majority staff. I would \nlike to also pay tribute to the minority staff as well as the majority \nstaff. They worked extremely well with us. They were helpful to us as \nwell as the chairman of the committee. On our side of the aisle, I want \nto especially thank Galen Fountain, who is seated at my left and who \nwas my personal agricultural aide for many years before he joined the \nappropriations staff, and pay special tribute to him and Rebecca \nDavies, who probably know on a magnitude of about five times more about \nthis bill than Senator Cochran and I do. We simply could not function \nhere and get a bill like this through without the very able assistance \nof those people. But in addition to Galen, I also want to pay tribute \nto Carole Geagley and to my own personal staff member, Ben Noble. They \nhave done a magnificent job.\n  Again, my sincere thanks to Senator Cochran, who is the chief \narchitect of this bill. He did a magnificent job. If you watched here, \nas always when these appropriations bills are coming through, you see \nthe Senators all gathered around here pleading with Senator Cochran and \nme to accept this amendment and that amendment. We would love to accept \nthem all. It is always that way in appropriations. But the money \nconstraints keep us from doing that. But we like to help other \nSenators.\n  As I said yesterday afternoon on the floor, it is not pork. Sometimes \nit is pure, unadulterated research from which the entire Nation \nbenefits. But having said that, I think it is a good bill. We will do \nour very best to honor all the Senate's wishes in the conference \ncommittee. I think we will come back here with a good bill from \nconference.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Agriculture appropriations bill just \napproved by the Senate includes funds for many important programs, and \nI deeply appreciate the work of Chairman Cochran and Senator Bumpers in \nputting together this bill. While I appreciate their good work, I \ndeeply regret that funds are not included to provide the final Federal \nmatching funds for several Cooperative State Research, Education, and \nExtension Service buildings, including one at North Dakota State \nUniversity, for which State and local matching funds have been \nprovided.\n  I believe this is especially unfortunate because of unique \ncircumstances faced by NDSU in their attempt to complete this important \nproject. The Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee provided an \ninitial planning grant for this building in fiscal year 1992. After \nthat, the subcommittee provided $1.65 million in the fiscal year 1994 \nbill as a down payment on the Federal share of this $10 million \nfacility. Unfortunately the House Agriculture Appropriations \nSubcommittee indicated in its fiscal year 1996 report that the \ncommittee would no longer provide Federal funding for these buildings \nif the projects did not have their state and local matching funds in \nhand by the time Congress prepared the appropriations bills the \nfollowing year for fiscal year 1997.\n  Mr. President, this decision created a serious problem for North \nDakota because our State legislature only meets every other year. That \nmeant North Dakota State University did not even have an opportunity to \nseek the State matching funds between the time the House subcommittee \nissued its notice in the summer of 1995 to provide no additional \nfunding and the time the fiscal year 1997 appropriations bill was \nconsidered last summer. The first time our State legislature met \nfollowing the House subcommittee's decision was January 1997, at which \ntime the legislature provided the State match for this building. In \nother words, the State provided its share of funds for this building at \nthe first opportunity they had following the announcement by the House \nsubcommittee.\n  This facility is extremely important because the existing facilities \nat NDSU were constructed in the 1960's and do not meet USDA standards, \ncausing animal health and production research to be curtailed. The new \nfacility would allow expanded research into fighting anti-biotic \nresistant viruses, enhancing reproductive efficiency in farm animals, \ndeveloping safer, more effective pharmaceuticals, improving meat animal \nresearch to improve food quality, and other important areas of \nresearch.\n  Mr. President, it is my strong desire that we are able to find a \nresponsible solution to this situation. I believe terminating Federal \nfunding for this building is premature, and I will continue to work \nwith NDSU, USDA, and my colleagues in the House and Senate to see that \nthis building is completed. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that my remarks be considered as \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS.

Mr. President, everybody knows that I am sort of a \nJohnny-one-note on the space station. I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record an article that appeared in this morning's \nWashington Post, the headline of which is ``Russia Wonders If Manned \nFlight Is Worth Cost.'' One of the reasons I wanted to put it in the \nRecord is because it echoes precisely what I said on the floor, in \nspades, 2 days ago.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Russia Wonders if Manned Flight is Worth Cost\n\n                          (By Daniel Williams)\n\n       Moscow, July 23.--With the immediate crisis on the Mir \n     space station largely resolved for now, space officials here \n     have turned their attention to tangled problems on Earth.\n       They may be as hard to fix as the ones on Mir.\n       Lack of money, the bane of a space enterprise that was once \n     Moscow's pride, is the major problem. The space program also \n     is suffering from a battered public image that makes rallying \n     support difficult.\n       Debate over the future of Mir has ignited a finger-pointing \n     spree in newspapers over who is to blame for a recent series \n     of mishaps including a fire, a collision with a supply craft \n     and the erroneous disconnection of a computer system that \n     threw Mir out of position and drained much of its power.\n       The central issue of the controversy here is one that also \n     surfaces from time to time in the United States: What price \n     manned space travel, especially when compared with unmanned \n     expeditions?\n       Unmanned expeditions offer more scientific benefits per \n     dollar, except for learning about the capabilities of human \n     beings in space. And as painful as the failure of unmanned \n     satellite launches, space probes and robotic landings may be, \n     a dead satellite is not the same as a dead astronaut. That \n     element alone makes manned flights not only more dramatic, \n     but also more expensive as systems are piled on systems for \n     safety's sake.\n       Mir is the space equivalent of an old used car, but Russia \n     appears unwilling to give up manned flight, even temporarily. \n     To surrender a human toehold in space is to give it up \n     permanently, officials here argue, ``If we drop space, we \n     will lag behind in this field forever,'' said Yuri Baturin, \n     secretary of the Russian defense council.\n       One reason for sticking with Mir, even if it requires \n     repeated tinkering under the hood, is that it makes money. \n     The United States alone is paying Russia about $400 million \n     for\n\n[[Page S8005]]\n\n     continual use of the space station by NASA astronauts to \n     conduct scientific experiments in space.\n       Although figures for how much Russia spends in space are \n     difficult to come by, everyone agrees that the program is \n     short of cash. On Monday, contractors and scientists held a \n     meeting in advance of Russia's next launch on Aug. 5. Each \n     speaker said that key preparations for the launch were \n     complete, but several also complained they had not been paid \n     for their work, an observer at the meeting recounted.\n       Economic dealings in Russia are plagued by delayed payments \n     and unfulfilled contracts, and the space program is no \n     exception.\n       Parts of the modular station are 11 years old, more than \n     double their original life expectancy. Russian space \n     officials have taken pains to assure everyone that the Mir \n     was viable and in no need of being scrapped.\n       ``I would fly to Mir,'' Sergei Krikalev, a cosmonaut and \n     emerging spokesman for the space program, said recently.\n       In the past, it was highly unusual for officials here to \n     publicly air the detail that has been made available about \n     Mir. In the Soviet era, only successes were widely reported; \n     operational specifics--not to mention failures--were hidden \n     as much as possible. Although the democratic atmosphere in \n     contemporary Russia explains some of the current openness, so \n     too does the perception of a need for public relations.\n       Foreigners fly on Mir, and secrecy about conditions on the \n     space station would be unacceptable to the foreign patrons of \n     the flights, Russian officials say. In the United States, \n     some politicians oppose the trips as dangerous and of little \n     use; secrecy probably would fuel criticism there.\n       Inexperience with public scrutiny has led to tension with \n     the Russian press. A few weeks ago, space officials invited \n     reporters to witness work at the Star City cosmonaut training \n     complex. As reporters clustered around Anatoly Solovyov, one \n     of the next cosmonauts to go up, a scientist frantically \n     tried to push them away. ``What if someone sneezes'' he cried \n     out. ``What if the cosmonaut catches a virus? All this \n     preparation will go to waste!''\n       Russian space officials have accused the Russian press of \n     scandal-mongering, although many reports they initially \n     denied were later confirmed. For example, Izvestia, regarded \n     as the country's leading newspaper, reported that news about \n     a death in the family of Vasily Tsibliev, the commander of \n     Mir, had been withheld from him.\n       Russian officials stopped denying the story only after the \n     Reuter news agency reported from Tsibliev's home town that \n     the family had kept the death secret.\n       Space officials expressed irritation with articles about \n     conflicts among different departments of the space program: \n     Mission Control, the cosmonaut training center and Energia, \n     the enterprise that designs, builds and launches rockets and \n     space vehicles.\n       Newspapers reported that Energia officials blame Tsibliev \n     for the June 25 Mir collision with a cargo vessel. The crash \n     damaged one of the modules and resulted in an emergency \n     reduction of about half of Mir's power.\n       Sergei Gromov, a spokesman for Energia, said this week that \n     such a report was nonsensical given the interlocking \n     structure of the Russian space program. Almost every one \n     works for everyone else, and Energia had a big say in who was \n     to fly.\n       ``The cosmonauts are affiliated with the Air Force and the \n     cosmonaut training center, but they are also personnel of our \n     organization,'' he said. ``We choose them and pay them; they \n     are half ours. It would be like blaming ourselves.''\n       Space officials acknowledged that Tsibliev probably faces a \n     loss of bonus money for the flight because of the collision \n     as well as the later episode that caused the temporary loss \n     of all power on Mir: last week's accidental unplugging of a \n     computer cable.\n       ``He may lose some of his bonus. But he is not on trial \n     here,'' cosmonaut Krikalev said.\n       Solovyov and another cosmonaut due to relieve the exhausted \n     Mir crew prepared today for the Aug. 5 launch and for the \n     repairs they will conduct later in the month on the crippled \n     spacecraft.\n       The drumbeat of bad news about Mir prompted Izvestia to \n     question whether openness in space was worth the national \n     loss of morale.\n       The news from space ``makes one feel disappointed rather \n     than proud of the country, which has opened the doors to \n     another state secret,'' said the commentary published \n     Tuesday.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the Senator from Utah for yielding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/24/senate-section/article/S8004-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8005-S8007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         UTAH SESQUICENTENNIAL\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is a unique privilege and distinct honor \nfor me to recognize, today, on the floor of the U.S. Senate, the 150th \nanniversary of the arrival of the Mormon Pioneers in the Valley of the \nGreat Salt Lake on July 24, 1847.\n  It was spring, by the calendar, in late March of the year 1846, as \nsome 3,000 people in 400 wagons struggled west across the rolling hills \nof Iowa, through snow and drizzling rain. The muddy track was nearly \nimpassable as they lumbered on, far behind schedule and nearing \nexhaustion. Behind them lay the last few villages of organized \nterritory; before them, the great unknown. Somewhere, over the horizon, \nbeyond the sheltering forests and the waving grasslands, lay the Rocky \nMountains. Previous maps showed the way into the wilderness, while \nscouting reports told of the romantic landscape ahead: Black clouds of \nbuffalo sweeping across the prairie swells, great rivers and snow-\ncapped peaks, the endless sky, and the lonely stars. Most of these \nwagons had never been this far West; perhaps a few had reached \nMissouri--Independence or Clay County. But that was no comfort. Few \npeople in this wagon train cared to think much of Missouri--where the \nstench of massacre and betrayal had but recently overwhelmed the sweet \nscent of fresh gardens and new-mown hay. Now, as history repeated \nitself, their last refuge--their beautiful Nauvoo--was besieged by \nhateful mobs, and there seemed no other solution than to flee, yet \nagain. These wagons were the vanguard; hundreds were on the road behind \nthem, and thousands more, gathered on the banks of the Mississippi, \nwere making ready to follow.\n  Barely 26 years before, young Joseph Smith, by his own account, had \nentered the woods near his father's farm to pray, when ``Suddenly, a \nlight descended, brighter far than noonday Sun, and a shining, glorious \npillar o'er him fell, around him shone, while appeared two heav'nly \nbeings, God the Father and the Son.'' Now, scarcely grown to the \nfulness of his prophetic calling, this towering leader lay dead in a \nmartyr's grave, and the faithful who had responded to the restored \nGospel entrusted to him were scattered and driven, with only one hope, \nexpressed in the hymn that would become their inspiration and epitaph: \n``We'll find the place, which God for us prepared, far away in the \nWest, where none shall come to hurt, or make afraid. There, the Saints \nwill be blessed.''\n  They came from everywhere, these honored pioneers--New England, Old \nEngland, the lands of the North--wherever believers could spread the \nword. Some were already crusty pioneers--the likes of Daniel Boone or \nthe Green Mountain boys --whose ancestors had settled the Tidewater \ncounties or landed at Plymouth Rock. Others had only recently left the \ncoal mines of Wales and the sweatshops of Manchester to take their \nfirst draught of fresh air in the New World. A few were professionals, \nwho could doctor, or teach, or play music to ease the rigors of the \ntrail; many were artisans--carpenters, wheelwrights, shoemakers--whose \nskills were sorely needed. But for all their skills and preparations, \nfar too few were ready for the bone-deep weariness, the numbing cold, \nor birthing in the open air.\n  Critics might say that they brought their misery upon themselves--\nthrough blind faith and foolhardy dreams. Such was the litany of those \nwho mobbed and burned and killed without mercy. Yet the saints were \nmoved by a destiny their detractors could not have understood. It came \nfrom the lips of their fallen prophet:\n\n       I prophesied that the Saints would continue to suffer much \n     affliction * * *, many would apostatize, others would be put \n     to death by our persecutors or lose their lives in \n     consequence of exposure or disease, and some of you will live \n     to go and assist in making settlements and build cities, and \n     see the Saints become a mighty people in the midst of \n     the Rocky Mountains.\n\n  As summer came to western Iowa the vanguard paused to build and plant \nfor those who would follow, and, thus further delayed, found it \nnecessary to spend the winter of 1846-47 on the banks of the Missouri, \nupriver from Council Bluffs, in Indian territory. Here, at winter \nquarters, they gathered and regrouped. On the 7th of April 1847, the \nadvance company, led by Brigham Young, was once more on the move, \nfollowed in June by approximately 1,500 people organized after the \nBiblical model as the ``Camp of Israel.'' By July 21, after nearly 4 \nmonths on the trail, a scouting party reached the Valley of the Great \nSalt Lake, followed on the 22d by the main body of the advanced \ncompany. Two days later, Brigham Young himself reached the foothills at \nthe edge of the Great Basin. Surveying the valley before him, as if in \na vision, he finally spoke the now-famous words of approbation: ``This \nis the right place. Drive on.''\n\n[[Page S8006]]\n\n  Over the next 150 years, the vision was verified and the prophecy \nfulfilled. Upward of 70,000 people crossed the plains in wagons and \nhandcarts. Many a journey started from Liverpool where the faithful \nfrom throughout Europe embarked for Zion, fulfilling, as they believed, \nthe words of the prophet Isaiah:\n\n       And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the \n     mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top \n     of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and \n     all nations shall flow unto it. And many people shall go and \n     say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, \n     to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his \n     ways, and we will walk in his paths * * *.\n\n  Six thousand died along the way. Some lost heart and turned back, or \nshrank before the daunting task of taming the harsh land and moved on \nto the greener pastures of Oregon and California. But more than 300 \nsettlements in Utah and surrounding States, as well as colonies in \nCanada and Mexico, testify to the courage and determination of that \nvast majority who persevered.\n  Today, the desert blossoms with the fruits of their labor, while \ntheir descendants continue to build upon their firm foundation. A \nyearlong celebration, with the theme ``Faith in Every Footstep,'' is \nnow in progress to honor their memory. Well-wishers and admirers in \ntowns and cities along the trail and throughout the world have joined \nwith Latter-day Saints in commemorating this milestone of human \nhistory--with the dedication of buildings and monuments in hallowed \nplaces, with theater and music, historical displays, and a vivid \nreenactment of the trek itself. It has been, and continues to be, a \njoyful celebration, as befits the memory of those whose sacrifice has \nindeed given birth to ``a mighty people.''\n  Mr. President, I would like to add my tribute by quoting the words of \na Mormon hymn which reflects--I think, appropriately--the joy and the \nguiding faith of those marvelous Saints who, 150 years ago, put their \nfate in the hands of God and turned their faces West:\n\n     The Spirit of God like a fire is burning!\n     The latter-day glory begins to come forth;\n     The visions and blessings of old are returning,\n     And angels are coming to visit the earth.\n     We'll sing and we'll shout with the armies of heaven,\n     Hosanna, hosanna to God and the Lamb!\n     Let glory to them in the highest be given,\n     Henceforth and forever, Amen and amen.\n\n  Mr. President, my forebears were part of these pioneers who came \nacross this vast territory, who suffered untold privations. My great-\ngreat-grandfather was killed by a mob. I have to say that when they \ncame to Utah, they followed the leadership of Brigham Young and went \nwherever they were told to go. They believed in what they believed. \nThey had faith in what they had faith in. And they lived up to the \nprinciples that literally made Utah such a great State and much of the \nWest greater than it would have been.\n  So I am very grateful for these pioneers. I am grateful for those who \nmade that commemorative trip this year and have gone through the \ndeprivations and privations to show just a little bit what some of \nthese early pioneers had gone through.\n  Last but not least, a number of them expressed themselves and said \nthat this experience of going on that pioneer trek, walking it, riding \nin covered wagons, riding horses, and pulling handcarts was one of the \ngreatest experiences of their lives. Unfortunately, it wasn't perhaps \nthe greatest experience for our early forebears, the pioneers, because \nof the many travails and problems they had. These trails they had to \nbreak themselves, in many respects, and they did it and I am grateful \nfor it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, like my \ncolleague, I may be allowed to proceed as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I had not expected to be here in the \nSenate today. I had made plans to be in Salt Lake City where the \ncelebrations are going on for a historic event marking the 150th \nanniversary of the entry of Brigham Young into the Salt Lake Valley. As \nSenate business has been pressing, combined with a bad cold that you \ncan hear in my throat, I decided wisdom meant that I should stay here, \neven though my heart is in Utah.\n  Mr. President, we have heard a lot from the senior Senator, \nappropriately, about the trek and what went on. Like him, I have \nforebears who were part of that great movement, which began with \nBrigham Young in 1847, but continued until the coming of the railroad \nin 1869. My grandfather, John F. Bennett, was 3 years old when his \nparents and his grandparents took him out of the slums of Liverpool, \nwhere they were born and raised in what would be considered the lower-\nlower class, walked across the great American plains to try to find a \nnew life and a new religion in a new place. Out of that family that \ncame from that little boy, who had no education, no hope, and in the \nclass-ridden status of England at the time, no chance of opportunity \nfor advancement, have come two United States Senators, a number of \nsuccessful businessmen, a series of college graduates, and a tremendous \nfamily of achievement and family happiness of which I am a beneficiary.\n  There was indeed something magic about that trek that called people \nnot only from the United States, but from all over the world, to go \nforward in the name of their religion and their faith to a place that \nwas picked because no one else wanted it. Indeed, their leader chose \nthis place because he had been literally driven out of the United \nStates--some say solely because of his religion, others say because of \npolitical problems, and others say because the Mormons weren't good at \ngetting along with their neighbors in Missouri, Illinois, and the other \nplaces where they tried to settle permanently.\n  I won't try to rehash that history because it doesn't really matter. \nWhat matters is that they stayed together, they traveled together, they \nspread their version of the Gospel of Jesus Christ throughout the \nworld, and they called their adherence from all over the world to join \nwith them in that tremendous sacrifice, to find a place where they \ncould be left alone to flourish.\n  They were not successful. They were not left alone. Within 2 years \nafter Brigham Young arrived, gold was discovered in California and the \nworld started going through Utah on its way for riches. Not everyone \nfound their way to riches, but they did help, economically, build a \nState--an ironic twist of events for Brigham Young, who wanted to be \nalone.\n  We have had a great deal said during this sesquicentennial year about \nthe tremendous physical sacrifice involved in that trek. As I think of \nmy 3-year-old grandfather, I can barely identify with how physically \ndifficult that must have been for him and for his parents and his \ngrandparents. I have just gone across country with a 5-year-old \ngrandchild, courtesy of Delta Airlines, and it was a whole lot easier \nthan taking him in a covered wagon for hundreds, if not thousands, of \nmiles.\n  So I pay tribute today to the legacy that I owe to those people and \nwhat they did and what they endured. I have been back to England and \nhave looked at my relatives who stayed there and compared what happened \nto those of us who are descendants of the people who were willing to \nmake that trek with what happened to those who stayed in what they \nthought would be the comfort of the British Isles. It is one of the \nthings I offer thanks for in my personal prayers, that I am descended \nfrom that branch of the family that endured that trek.\n  I want to make one final point about this, which I think is the \nimportant point out of this entire experience as we pay tribute to the \npeople and who they were and what they did. As impressive as their \nphysical sacrifice and performance was, there is something else that I \nwant to mention that I think, in many ways, is more distinctive and \nmore instructive for us today in our world. This was a group of \npeople--at least the core group--who had been physically driven from \ntheir homes several times. They had been physically driven from Ohio. \nThey sought refuge in Missouri; they did not find it. They were \nphysically driven from Missouri and ended up penniless, with nothing \nbut the clothes on their backs, in the State of Illinois. They started \nover again. They built the largest and, by some accounts, most \nbeautiful city in Illinois. They were physically driven from there and, \nagain,\n\n[[Page S8007]]\n\nstarted out with very little to go someplace where they could be left \nalone.\n\n  In today's world, when we see articles in books constantly written \nabout how we are all victims, we could expect that they would have \nspent their time lamenting over that which they lost and focusing on \ntheir resentments and their bitterness and that which other people owed \nthem. They did not. Oh, I am sure that there was some of that. It would \nonly be human that there would be some regrets and tears shed for homes \nleft. But that was not their focus. That was not their driving force. \nThey were not driven by hatred, a desire for revenge, a sense of \nvictimhood and petitions to get everything back that had been taken \naway from them.\n  Instead, their focus was on the future. Senator Hatch has already \nquoted the third verse of the hymn that they wrote and sang to \nthemselves again and again as they endured the physical difficulties. I \nwant to repeat it here in this context. It was not a hymn of mourning \nor longing for the past.\n  They said:\n\n     We'll find a place which God for us prepared,\n     Far away in the West, where none shall come to hurt,\n     or make afraid.\n     There, the Saints will be blessed.\n     We'll make the air with music ring,\n     Shout praises to our God and King, above the rest.\n     This tale will tell, all is well, all is well.\n\n  Mr. President, we look around the world today in Bosnia, in Northern \nIreland, in the Middle East, and we find people who have suffered \nancient wrongs, sometimes terrible, unforgivable wrongs, at the hands \nof their fellow men, in the name of politics or religion, or just plain \nethnic hatred. We find people in the Middle East who remember the \nCrusades and feel offended by something that happened a thousand years \nago and are sworn to set right those ancient grievances.\n  I say to them and to all of us that those who made their way across \nthe plains 150 years ago had reason to hold grievances, but they looked \nnot to the past but to the future. And as I rise today to pay tribute \nto their memory, I pay tribute not only to their physical courage in \nundergoing that trek and express my gratitude for the privilege of \nbeing descended from them, but I express my greater gratitude for what, \nin my view, is a greater legacy: that I have grown up in a circumstance \nwhere these people, however much they talk about the history of the \npast, are willing to forgive the past; that they are not viewing \nthemselves anymore as that first generation, as victims, as obsessed \nwith redressing old wrongs or attacking old antagonists. The legacy \nthat is of greatest value to me and to the people of my State that came \nfrom those who were engaged in that great trek was their legacy of hope \nand optimism and a willingness to forgive and forget and look to the \nfuture.\n  That is what we are celebrating today as we look back on 150 years \nsince the time they finally found their place faraway in the West, \nwhich God had in fact for them prepared, where they have indeed been \nblessed. Senator Hatch and I would like to be with them today, but we \ncannot because of our duties here in the Senate. But we thank the \nMembers of the Senate for their indulgence in allowing us to take the \ntime of the U.S. Senate and make this recognition of significant events \nin American history.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, before I proceed with the formal business \nof the Senate, I just want to congratulate and acknowledge the Senators \nfrom Utah in their extraordinarily moving and thoughtful and brilliant \nstatements on the importance of today and the history of Utah and the \nMormon Church, which has so reflected effectively the history of this \ncountry. The tempo and culture of that experience has been one which \nhas been intertwined with our Nation's strengths and, unfortunately, \nsome of our Nation's failures.\n  Their statements today, I think, as well as anything that I have ever \nheard, reflect the energy and enthusiasm and vitality and warmth that \nthat church presents to its parishioners and which makes it such a \ndynamic force in the faith of many people across this country and \nacross the world. So I congratulate them for their truly extraordinary \nstatements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/24/senate-section/article/S8005-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8007-S8040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDEPARTMENTS OF COMMERCE, JUSTICE, AND STATE, THE JUDICIARY, AND RELATED \n                   AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1998\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nturn to S. 1022, the Commerce, Justice, State, and Judiciary \nappropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1022) making appropriations for the Departments \n     of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related \n     Agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1998 and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nits immediate consideration.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask further unanimous consent that with \nrespect to the Feinstein amendment regarding the ninth circuit court, \nthere be 4 hours of debate on the amendment equally divided between the \nchairman and the ranking member or their designees with no second-\ndegree amendments in order to the amendment. I further ask unanimous \nconsent that following the expiration or yielding back of time, the \nSenate proceed to a vote on or in relationship to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing Appropriations Committee staff members be granted floor \nprivileges during the consideration of this bill: Jim Morhard, Paddy \nLink, Kevin Linskey, Carl Truscott, Dana Quam, Josh Irwin, Scott Gudes, \nEmelie East, Karen Swanson-Wolf, Jay Kimmitt, Luke Nachbar, and Vas \nAlexopoulos.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. This request I just made also includes both majority and \nminority staff.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce this bill, S. \n1022, for the fiscal year 1998 appropriations for the Departments of \nCommerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and related agencies. This \nyear we have taken great strides to obtain bipartisan support for this \nbill and to be responsive to the needs of the people within the budget \nthat we are provided. I think we have achieved this goal.\n  I want to especially acknowledge and thank the ranking member of this \ncommittee who for many, many years has served on this committee and \nwhose cooperation, effort, and knowledge has been a core element in \ndeveloping this bill and achieving progress in making these agencies \nfunction effectively. And that, of course, is the Senator from South \nCarolina [Mr. Hollings].\n  The bill before us includes $31.6 billion for programs administered \nby the Commerce, State, and Justice Departments, the Judiciary, and \nrelated agencies. That is a lot of money, $31.6 billion, but I would \nnote that it is a bill that is frugal. It is $4 billion less than what \nthe President's budget request, and it is over $100 million less than \nwhat the House will have passed in its bill in this area.\n  The essential thrust of this bill is to make sure the committee \nadequately funds the activities of our criminal justice system and to \nmake sure that the States receive adequate funding to undertake an \naggressive posture to control the spread of violence and crime in our \nNation. As a result, we have increased funding for the Department of \nJustice by 5 percent over 1997 levels. This represents a fairly \nsignificant commitment to that Department, obviously.\n  Within the Justice Department, top priorities include fighting crimes \nagainst children; providing assistance to State and local law \nenforcement; countering terrorism activities; bolstering drug control \nefforts; and pursuing new juvenile programs.\n  As chairman, I directed the committee to take a close look at the \nneeds of the juveniles in our country. In hearings this year, it was \nbrought to my attention the threats our children face when surfing the \nInternet. While the Internet can be a place for the world to be at play \nand to be at the access of children's fingertips, that world can also \nhave its shady side where predators lurk to exploit our children if \ngiven the opportunity.\n\n  The Federal Bureau of Investigation [FBI], along with organizations \nlike the Center for Missing and Exploited\n\n[[Page S8008]]\n\nChildren, has worked to combat pedophile activity on the Internet. In \nour legislation we provide funding to continue these efforts: $10 \nmillion for the FBI to apprehend the pedophiles who use the Internet in \ntheir criminal activities; $2.4 million to the local and State law \nenforcement agencies to form specialized cyber units to investigate and \nprevent child sexual exploitation; and $6.2 million for the National \nCenter for Missing and Exploited Children to continue their efforts to \neducate and work with law enforcement officials in handing child \nexploitation cases.\n  Also, the committee believes it is in the national interest to \nimprove the skills of our law enforcement personnel on all levels and \nsupports initiatives to do this. The Community Oriented Policing \nServices, or COPS Program, is funded at $1.4 billion so that 100,000 \nextra police can be hired by our States and our communities. The \nPresident's request did not include any funding for the local law \nenforcement block grant. However, we have provided $503 million so that \nlocalities could obtain funding for initiatives to reduce crime and \nimprove public safety.\n  Also, in response to a number of requests from law enforcement \nofficials, we have added $10.5 million to the President's request for a \nregional information sharing system so that law enforcement officers \nthroughout the country can have increased access to national crime \ndatabases.\n  This year the committee has taken a strong stance against the violent \nacts that are directed toward women and children.\n  Our support includes a $67.3 million increase in the funding for the \nViolence Against Women Act grants. We recognize the need to enhance and \nexpand current women's assistance programs as violent crimes against \nthem continue. Violence Against Women Act grants will be given to the \nStates to develop and implement effective arrest and prosecution \npolicies to prevent, identify, and respond to violent crimes against \nwomen. This funding provides domestically abused women and children \nwith additional support services. This includes access to specially \ntrained prosecutors and law enforcement officials. Only 20 States \nreceived Violence Against Women grants in 1996. We believe there should \nbe sufficient funding for more States to participate in this program. \nConsequently, we have appropriated funds for this effort. And while we \nhave given significant funding to the Violence Against Women Program, \nother grant programs still receive funding--the Motor Vehicle Theft \nPrevention Program, the State Prison Grant Program, and the Missing \nAlzheimer's Patient Program, just to name a few.\n  The Counterterrorism Fund received $29.5 million so that the law \nenforcement officials can counter, investigate, and prosecute those \npeople who are involved in terrorist activities. In addition, the funds \nwill be used to conduct terrorism threat assessment against Federal \nagencies and their facilities. Additional funds have been provided in a \nclassified portion of the bill, which is available to all Members.\n  Like many Members of Congress, the committee is concerned about the \nproliferation of illegal drugs coming across our borders and its impact \non our children. In an effort to support law enforcement efforts to \ncombat the rampant spread of illegal drugs, the committee devoted $16.5 \nmillion to combat the trade in methamphetamine and $10 million to the \neffort to reduce heroin trafficking. The committee also provided \nsubstantial funding for the Drug Enforcement Administration program to \nprovide adequate equipment for its agents. It does no good to hire new \nagents--and we are hiring a large number of new agents in this bill--if \nthey do not have the equipment needed to do the job. So this bill takes \ncare of that issue.\n  Over the last few years, the infrastructure needs of organizations \nfunded by this bill have been neglected. We have made a point of \nproviding funds to repair buildings throughout our agencies. Over $300 \nmillion will go to the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and \nthe Bureau of Prisons to make much-needed infrastructure improvements. \nThis money covers the costs of a new FBI forensics lab at Quantico, \nState prison grants to help States build new prisons, and facilities \nfor 1,000 new Border Patrol agents we have funded through the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service.\n\n  As last mentioned within the Justice portion of the bill, the \ncommittee sets aside funding for a Juvenile Block Grant Program, \nsubject to the authorization of the Judiciary Committee. It is our \nunderstanding that the authorization may address such issues as the \nneed for increased penalties for criminal street-gang activities and \nprosecuting violent youth offenders as adults at the discretion of the \nprosecutor. This funding should assist in undertaking that effort.\n  This is just a brief summary of a wide range of Justice provisions \nthat will help law enforcement combat the threats that Americans face \nin our daily lives.\n  In the area of the Commerce Department, we have made some difficult \ndecisions, but I think they are constructive ones. We have, for \nexample, provided strong support for the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration (NOAA), which provides high-quality research \nand provides technical data to our economy. In particular, the bill \nincreases funding for the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is \nimportant to all coastal and Great Lakes States and provides funding \nfor estuarine research. Since 75 percent of our Nation's population \nlives near the coastline, placing a priority on preserving our \nestuarine areas is important. Equally important is the need to conserve \nthe resources that live in our estuaries and oceans.\n  The bill increases funding for protected species research. The Sea \nGrant Program, which conducts research of regional importance through \ncolleges and universities, is strongly supported in this bill. While we \nbelieve NOAA is doing essential work for America, sometimes we disagree \nwith our House colleagues on the level of funding. We intend to address \nthis in conference, and we will go to conference with a strong bill.\n  The committee provides increased funding for the National Weather \nService, also. Many of us are concerned that this agency has the \nresources necessary to ensure timely warning of severe weather, \nespecially hurricanes and tornadoes. The bill contains funding for \nsatellite improvements which are critical to monitoring and predicting \nthe weather. The committee supports the modernization of the Weather \nService and looks forward to working with the Department of Commerce to \nensure the orderly deployment of technology needed to improve \nforecasting and warnings.\n  The largest increase in the Department of Commerce is the \nadministration's request for additional funds to prepare for the \ndecennial census. We have had previous discussions on the Senate floor \nabout whether or not to use a sampling technique to conduct the census \n2000. The bill contains language on this issue developed on a \nbipartisan basis during the consideration of the Supplemental \nAppropriations bill earlier this year. The increase for fiscal year \n1998 does not require a decision on whether or not to employ sampling.\n  The committee also funds the trade development and enforcement \nresponsibilities of the Department of Commerce at or slightly above the \nadministration's requests. The Bureau of Export Administration has two \nnew requirements which deserve mention. First, the Department of \nState's encryption export control responsibilities have been \ntransferred to the Export Administration.\n  Second, with the ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention \n(CWC), the Export Administration will have the primary responsibility \nfor enforcing the convention. While funds are provided at the requested \nlevel to support the Export Administration's enforcement \nresponsibilities, any additional funds which may be needed during \nfiscal year 1998 should be provided by the Department of Defense or the \nDepartment of State. There is some concern that the administration has \nunderestimated the funds needed to enforce CWC. The Department of \nCommerce should not be required to shoulder all the costs of Chemical \nWeapons Convention enforcement.\n\n  Many Senators will be glad to hear that the committee did not agree \nwith the administration's request to zero out public telecommunication \nfacility\n\n[[Page S8009]]\n\ngrants. We went ahead and provided $25 million for this program based \non the strong bipartisan support it enjoys.\n  In the judiciary area of the bill, the committee had to confront some \ndifficult issues, but I believe we have provided the American people \nwith a better judiciary through our efforts. The appropriation is \nsufficient to maintain current judicial operation levels and takes into \naccount the increase in bankruptcy caseloads and probation population. \nWe are also providing the Justices and judges with a 2.8-percent cost-\nof-living adjustment requested by the President.\n  The largest change--and it is a change I think will be for the best--\nis that the ninth circuit Federal court will be split into two \ncircuits, reducing the caseload level in each to a manageable level. \nDuring the 1996-97 session, the Supreme Court overturned 96 percent--96 \npercent--of the decisions reviewed by the ninth circuit. This high \noverturn rate is a beacon that the Ninth Circuit is not meeting the \nneeds of the people it serves. Last Congress, Chief Judge Wallace \nstated in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee that ``it \ntakes about 4 months longer to complete an appeal in the ninth circuit \nas compared to the national median time.'' The caseload continues to \nincrease yearly.\n  Justice Kennedy of the Supreme Court testified before our committee \non April 17 that there are ``very dedicated judges on that circuit, \nvery scholarly judges. * * * But, [he thinks] that institutionally, and \nfrom a collegial standpoint, that it is too large to have the \ndiscipline and the control that is necessary for an effective \ncircuit.''\n  While some of my colleagues may disagree, the facts lead me to \nbelieve it is past time for the ninth circuit to be split, and we are \ngoing to hear a considerable amount of debate on that issue later \ntoday.\n  Lastly, for the judiciary, we are providing an additional $2.2 \nmillion to the Supreme Court for renovations in an effort to comply \nwith safety regulations and with the Americans With Disabilities Act at \nthe Supreme Court building.\n  Moving on to the State Department, we have fully funded to the best \nof our abilities, the operations carried out by this Department. We \nmade sure that the day-to-day functions of the State Department are \nfunded at an acceptable level, and we are going a long way toward \nupdating their outdated technology systems.\n  Maintaining infrastructure was a top priority of mine in funding this \nbill. To do this, we are providing $40.4 million above the President's \nrequest for the Capital Investment Fund so that desperately needed \nupgrades on information and communications systems can be done. It is \nquite alarming to hear that the State Department is still using Wang \ncomputers and that oversees, about 82 percent of the radio equipment, \n55 percent of the computer equipment, and 40 percent of the telephone \nsystems are obsolete. These are the people who are representing us in \nforeign countries and they deserve to have up-to-date equipment.\n  As a final noteworthy item, this bill covers the U.N. arrears as \nagreed to during the budget talks this year, in addition to supporting \nthe bicameral U.N. reform package found in S. 903, the Foreign Affairs \nReform and Restructuring Act of 1997. The international organization \nand peacekeeping efforts are also included in this appropriation.\n  This is a very quick rundown of a very complicated and expansive \npiece of legislation. I believe it is an extremely strong bill, \ncomplying with the ideas that have been guiding the budget process over \nthe last few months. As I mentioned earlier, it is under the \nPresident's request and under the House bill. Yet I believe it still \nrepresents a sound and strong commitment to the agencies which it has \nto cover.\n  Before turning this over to my esteemed colleague and ranking member, \nI want to recognize the contributions of my staff, which have been \nextraordinary, the members of my staff that I outlined earlier, Kevin \nLinsky, Paddy Link, Vas Alexopoulos, Jim Morhard, Carl Truscott, Dana \nQuam, Josh Irwin, and Luke Nachbar; and I also want to acknowledge the \nranking member's staff, who do such a super job--Scott Gudes, Emelie \nEast, and Karen Swanson-Wolf. Their help has made a tremendous \ndifference, and we would not have gotten to this point without their \nassistance.\n  I yield to my ranking member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank our distinguished chairman.\n  Mr. President, this Commerce, Justice, and State appropriations bill \nis probably the most complicated of the 13 appropriations bills. In it \nwe fund programs ranging from the FBI to our embassies overseas, to \nfisheries research to the Small Business Administration. It requires a \nbalancing act--considering the priorities of our President, our \ncolleagues here in the Senate, and our Nation, in equitably \ndistributing our subcommittee 602(b) allocation to the many programs in \nthis bill. I think Chairman Gregg has done a masterful job in putting \nit together, and I support him in bringing this very solid bill before \nthe Senate.\n  I would especially like to recognize the majority staff who are all \nnew to this bill--Jim Morhard, Paddy Link, Kevin Linskey, Carl \nTruscott, and Dana Quam, and our Democratic staff--Scott Gudes, Emelie \nEast, and Karen Swanson-Wolf. They have been working night and day to \nput together this bill. They have done a truly outstanding job, and \nhave ensured a bipartisan spirit was maintained throughout this entire \nprocess.\n  In total, this bill provides $31.623 billion in budget authority. \nThat is about half-a-billion dollars below the President's budget \nrequest * * * and it is right at our section 602(b) allocation. The \nbill is $1.4 billion above this year's appropriated levels.\n\n\n                                justice\n\n  Once again, our bill makes it clear we're not fooling around with \nJustice and law enforcement priorities. The bill provides \nappropriations totaling $17.3 billion--an increase of $862 million \nabove last year. Including fees we provide the Department, the total \nJustice budget comes to $19.3 billion.\n  It might be well to note historically that some 10 years ago the bill \nwas right at $4 billion. We in the Congress run around everywhere, \n``Cut spending, cut spending, cut spending.'' If you want to know where \nthe increases in spending occur, you can look at the space program. I \nfollowed the thought, of course, of the distinguished Senator from \nArkansas--who has been up in space. They say the interest is trying to \nget Senator John Glenn back in space. My interest is trying to get the \nSenator from Arkansas, Senator Bumpers, out of space. He has been up \nthere for 2 days. But he has been doing a masterful job, trying to save \nmoneys there.\n  Now, with respect to the Justice Department, the DEA, hundreds of \nmore FBI agents, a new laboratory there, Cops on the Beat, 1,000 more \nBorder Patrol, half a billion more in prisons--we are building prisons. \nIf you haven't gotten a prison in your State, call us; we will be glad \nto build you one. Because we are not building schools in America, we \nare building prisons everywhere. So, everybody ought to understand, in \nthe 10-year period under the leadership here of this Congress, trying \nto cut spending, we have veritably quintupled the Justice Department.\n  Of this amount, our Federal Bureau of Investigations, the FBI, is \nprovided $3.1 billion, and we have funded completion of its new \nlaboratory at Quantico as well as $10 million to enhance efforts to \ncombat child pornography on the Internet.\n  As, I said, we've made sure the INS will keep our borders secure, by \nproviding an additional, 1,000 Border Patrol agents in the Immigration \nand Naturalization service. Furthermore, the bill extends section 2451 \nof the Immigration Act. These fees allow adjustment of status for legal \nimmigrants in the United States and result in the Immigration Service \ngetting almost $200 million per year for border enforcement and \ncombating illegal immigration. This is important to both INS which \nneeds the funding, and the State Department which no longer has the \nconsular officers overseas to provide for adjustment of status in \nembassies.\n  Within the Justice Department, we also provide $1,033 billion for our \nprosecutors, the U.S. attorneys. That is an increase of $55 million. \nI'm pleased to note that it provides for activation of\n\n[[Page S8010]]\n\nthe National Advocacy Center to train our Federal and State \nprosecutors, and it continues State and local violent crime task forces \nwhich report to our U.S. attorneys.\n  So, looking at the Justice grant programs: the COPS Program is \nprovided $1.4 billion; the local law enforcement block grant is $503 \nmillion; $590 million is recommended for State prison grants; $264 \nmillion for violence against women grants; $580 million is provided in \nByrne grants and; $380 million is provided for juvenile justice \nprograms which is over twice the amount as this year.\n\n\n                                commerce\n\n  On the Commerce Department, the bill provides $4.169 billion for the \nCommerce Department. That is an increase of $368 million over this \nyear. Within this Department, the bill provides $659 million for the \nCensus, which is an increase of $314 million. This bill does not \nprohibit statistical sampling, though we will continue to monitor this \nissue closely.\n  We have provided $25 million for the Public Broadcasting facilities \ngrants and have rejected the administration's proposal to terminate \nthis program which assists public television and radio.\n  The recommendation includes $200 million for the NIST Advanced \nTechnology Program and $111 million for the Manufacturing Extension \nProgram. So this bill supports the bipartisan budget agreement which \nspecifically made these technology programs a priority. Another program \nof interest, the International Trade Administration, has been provided \nwith $280.7 million.\n  The biggest account in the Department of Commerce, NOAA, has been \nprovided with $2.1 billion. We have included $473 million for Weather \nService operations, an increase of $23 million above the request. This \nensures that we won't have a repeat of all the problems we have seen \nthis year. LIke cutting the National Hurriance Center. And this bill \ncontinues support for the NOAA oceans programs and the NOAA fleet.\n  I just attended the commissioning of the most modern research vessel \nin the fleet, the Ronald H. Brown. I am pleased to report that, rather \nthan the interest up here--310 million miles away whether or not some \nlittle instrument ran into a rock--in contrast, the NOAA fleet is out \nresearching seven-tenths of the Earth's surface, the oceans and \natmosphere, mapping the ocean floor and harbors and conducting surveys \nof living marine resources so that the NOAA fleet is alive and well. \nAnd we are not going to scuttle it as has been proposed here \npreviously.\n\n\n                                 STATE\n\n  In our title for the State Department and international programs, we \nhave included some $4 billion for the Department of State, and have \nsupported the consolidation of our international affairs agencies. We \nhave assigned, again, a priority to the operations and facilities of \nthe State Department, for example we included $105 million to modernize \ncomputer and telecommunications systems.\n  We have included $100 million for United Nations and peacekeeping \narrearages as part of the agreement that was reached with the \nAdministration on the Foreign Relations authorization bill. The \nrecommendation also includes $20 million for renovating housing and the \nU.S. Embassy in Beijing.\n  I have just had a conversation with the Ambassador Designate to the \nCourt of Saint James, which has a magnificent residence there. It was \ndone over by Walter Annenberg. It looks like a beauty to me. It doesn't \nlook like it's falling down. But they are going to close it and get \ninto a multimillion-dollar renovation program over 2 years, while they \nare in squalor in Beijing.\n  I can tell you here and now, we have to do something about the \nProperty Division over in that Department of State, so that we can at \nleast have decent housing for those who are willing to sacrifice and \nlead this Nation's foreign policy, particularly now in the most \nimportant nation with respect to foreign affairs, the People's Republic \nof China.\n  There is almost $400 million in the bill for international \nbroadcasting, $200 million for international exchanges. That is the \nfirst time, of course, Mr. President, that the Fulbright and other \nexchanges have gotten an increase. It should be noted that no funds are \nincluded for the National Endowments for Democracy, and the \ndistinguished chairman and I are well able to defend that particular \ninitiative now. I imagine we will be hearing from our colleagues with \nan amendment. But if they want to bring this up and talk about pork, I \nnever heard of worse ones--although we have had it. This Senator at one \ntime opposed it; at one time supported it at the request--at the fall \nof the wall. We didn't have an entity that could really bring \nnewspapers and printing presses and election fliers for democratic \nelections where in countries they had never held a democratic election. \nIt looked to me it might be an exception.\n  The Department of State, we ought not to be embarrassed, the \nDepartment of State ought to be, really, about its front-line position, \nnow, with the fall of the wall, in promoting democracy, individual \nrights, and the American way the world around. And we need not fund the \nchairman of the Democratic Party, the chairman of the Republican Party, \nthe Chamber of Commerce and the AFL. I think that here we can make a \nsavings of several million dollars.\n  Mr. President, this is a good bill. I support it. We have had to make \nsome tough decisions, but under the leadership of Senator Gregg, I \nthink we have made the proper decisions. It is nice to have worked on \nthis State, Justice, Commerce bill, and I urge my colleagues to join in \nits passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 979\n\n    (Purpose: To authorize the Administrator of General Services to \n transfer certain surplus property for use for law enforcement or fire \n                          and rescue purposes)\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 65, strike lines 3 through 9 and insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 119. Section 203(p)(1) of the Federal Property and \n     Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 484(p)(1)) is \n     amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(A)'' after ``(1)''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:\n       ``(B)(i) The Administrator may exercise the authority under \n     subparagraph (A) with respect to such surplus real and \n     related property needed by the transferee or grantee for--\n       ``(I) law enforcement purposes, as determined by the \n     Attorney General; or\n       ``(II) emergency management response purposes, including \n     fire and rescue services, as determined by the Director of \n     the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n       ``(ii) The authority provided under this subparagraph shall \n     terminate on December 31, 1999.''.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask that the previous amendment that \nhas been proposed be set aside and I have an amendment that I will send \nto the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 980\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit certain corporations from participating in the \n                      Advanced Technology Program)\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask that the pending amendment be set \naside. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n\n[[Page S8011]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Brownback] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 980.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in title VI, insert the following:\n       Sec. 6  . Section 28(d) of the National Institute of \n     Standards and Technology Act (15 U.S.C. 278n(d)) is amended \n     by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(12) For each fiscal year following fiscal year 1997, the \n     Secretary may not enter into a contract with, or make an \n     award to, a corporation under the Program, or otherwise \n     permit the participation of the corporation in the Program \n     (individually, or through a joint venture or consortium) if \n     that corporation, for the fiscal year immediately preceding \n     that fiscal year, has revenues that exceed $2,500,000,000.''.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, this amendment deals with the Advanced \nTechnology Program which was established to spur high-risk \nprecompetitive research and development. It was intended to make U.S. \nbusinesses more competitive in the global marketplace by assisting them \nin developing technologies which they wouldn't fund on their own.\n  It was not established to fund research and development which would \nhave been funded in the marketplace anyway. No one believes that the \nFederal Government should be in the business of taxing American \nfamilies to subsidize product development, research spending for rich \ncorporations. I think this would be in anybody's definition what former \nSecretary of Labor Robert Reich qualified and stated was ``corporate \nwelfare.''\n  I have grave concern that the Advanced Technology Program has become \njust that, a corporate welfare program. While recognizing the \nimportance of a strong Federal role in research and development, I am \nvery concerned that the ATP program is providing too much money to \ncompanies that have clearly adequate resources of their own to fund any \nresearch that is worth their doing.\n  My amendment is a simple one, and it should have broad bipartisan \nsupport. My amendment says that no company with revenues in excess of \n$2.5 billion--revenues in excess of $2.5 billion--can receive Federal \nfunding through the Advanced Technology Program. We are talking about \nrevenues. This is gross revenues of a company of $2.5 billion--so this \nis a pretty large company we are talking about--above which you can't \nreceive funding from the Advanced Technology Program. I think if you \nare having revenues of $2.5 billion or more a year, you can afford to \nfund your own research and development program, and you don't need the \nAdvanced Technology Program.\n  We use the $2.5 billion revenue threshold because it would exclude \nthe 500 largest companies in America, the so-called Fortune 500, from \nreceiving welfare dollars.\n  I think if you are a Fortune 500 company, you can do without \ncorporate welfare dollars. In the word of one Silicon Valley \nexecutive--and there have been a number out there to support this \nprovision; we have a letter signed by over 100 CEO's from startup \ncompanies in Silicon Valley which say terminate the entire ATP program, \nget rid of the whole thing. We are saying let's hold it to the largest \ncorporations.\n  One executive said this:\n\n       If you were General Motors with annual sales of $160 \n     billion and $20 billion in the bank, why don't you fund this \n     great idea yourself and patent it yourself?\n\n  I think the answer to this question is pretty simple, and that is, if \nthere is a Federal subsidy program which will fund corporate R for \nfree, even if the company has enough corporate R resources, and if \nthat company's competitors are taking the money from the Federal \nGovernment, why not take the money from the Federal Government \nyourself? Therefore, we need to close that loophole so their \ncompetitors can't get it and they be forced to take it as well.\n  What may be most troublesome is that for every grant given to a huge \ncompany with a multibillion-dollar budget and CEO making tens of \nmillions of dollars, there is a small company who may have a good idea \nbut can't raise the capital and will do without Federal assistance. The \nsmall companies will do without, while the big corporations get it. \nWhat we are saying is let's keep it from going to the megacorporation \nand have more available to the small corporation, which is what we are \ntrying to target in the first place.\n  We are not talking about a program that gives money exclusively to \nsmall business, entrepreneurs or inventors working in their garages. \nSome ATP money goes to small companies and universities. This amendment \nwould make it more available to them. But the top five companies that \nparticipate in the greatest dollar volume of grants from the ATP \nprogram are some pretty familiar names: IBM, General Motors, General \nElectric, Ford, Sun Microsystems. I think they can afford to fund these \nprograms on their own. They don't need corporate welfare, and we should \nbe making more of this available to small companies.\n  Maybe they get it because they have a great idea or maybe they get it \nbecause they have a lobbyist in Washington that watches for these \nthings. That may be part of it as well. Whereas, a small startup \ncompany is just busy in their garage, or wherever, trying to hustle \nenough to make this thing go. We want to make it more available to the \nsmall companies, the entrepreneurs and keep it out of the hands of the \nFortune 500, all of which have large lobbying staffs to get hold of \nthat here.\n  According to the Department of Commerce, more than 40 percent of \nsingle-applicant grants currently go to large companies--40 percent. \nOther ATP recipients are AT, Black & Decker, 3M, DuPont, MCI, Xerox, \nCaterpillar, Kodak, United States Steel, Honeywell, Allied Signal, and \nthe list goes on. These industrial giants have the time and the money \nto fill out ATP applications, but also have the money to fund these \nprojects on their own.\n  I also take this opportunity to commend Secretary Daley for \ninitiating a review of the ATP program. As he and I have discussed, I \nbelieve this review is long, long overdue, and I appreciate that it was \ninstigated very early on in his tenure. The Secretary recognized in his \nrecent report on the program that the question of whether huge \ncorporations should participate in ATP grants to the exclusion of some \nsmaller ventures is a legitimate concern and one that he is concerned \nabout as well. As a result of the Secretary's review, he has proposed \nchanges in the match for single-applicant-large companies to a 60-40 \nmatch from the current 50-50 and encourage joint ventures over single \napplicants.\n  That is a laudable start, but, my goodness, that is just not far \nenough when we are talking about a company that has $2.5 billion in \nrevenues, huge companies. They can afford to do this on their own. It \njust doesn't go far enough. At most, this would reduce the amount a \nlarge company will receive in grants by $65,000 a year, and that is not \nmuch of an incentive for companies like IBM with revenues of $76 \nbillion annually.\n  To its credit, this year the Department of Commerce requested input \nfrom the public on the ATP. Among the public responses were, listen to \nthis one:\n\n       ATP awards large companies even though a smaller company, \n     as a single applicant, may have a better technical and \n     business proposal. In some cases, the large company tries to \n     get the award in a new research file just to shelf the idea \n     and prevent someone from doing the research because it will \n     compete with its existing markets.\n\n  Another one:\n\n       ATP should not be a time-consuming, expensive proposal \n     preparation contest which it is now.\n\n  Another one:\n\n       ATP does not provide much assistance for individuals or \n     shoestring startups which need assistance most.\n\n  While I am not offering an amendment to kill this program today, I do \nhave grave concerns about it primarily because I believe there is ample \nprivate capital for good ideas. Last year alone, the venture capital \nindustry pumped more than $10 billion into new ventures. Last year, \ncompanies raised more than $50 billion from initial public stock \nofferings. The top four winners of ATP grants invested more than $20 \nbillion of their own corporate resources on research and development. \nWe are talking about a total program, the total ATP program of right \naround or under $300 million.\n\n[[Page S8012]]\n\n  I don't think I have the support this year to eliminate this program \non an appropriations bill. Many of my colleagues believe that would be \nmore appropriate for the authorizing process, which I think would be as \nwell and a good place to do it as well.\n  So let me reiterate, today I am not offering a killer amendment. This \nisn't even an amendment to reduce the funding of this program. It does \nnothing to the funding of ATP. I am offering an amendment which will \nmake a small change in the program to better enable it to meet its \nmission of providing funds for high-technology research without \nreplacing private dollars.\n  I want to note something else, Mr. President, if I can, about people \napplying for ATP grants and companies that are applying for ATP grants. \nThis is according to a GAO report when they were looking at whether \npeople try to find these first outside the Government. This is the GAO:\n\n       When we asked if they had searched for funding from other \n     sources before applying to ATP, we found that 63 percent of \n     the applicants said they had not--\n\n  Sixty-three percent--\n\n     [and] 65 percent of the winners had not looked for funding \n     before applying to ATP.\n\n  In other words, they are going first right to the Federal Government, \nto the ATP program. These are huge corporations with over $2.5 billion \nin revenues, the only ones we are targeting, and they are saying, ``Let \nus take it there first.''\n  This is a simple amendment and will help the small entrepreneur. It \nwill bring some sanity back to the process. It will start to address \nthe issue of corporate welfare, and this is a perfect case.\n  So, Mr. President, I think this is an appropriate amendment. At the \nappropriate time, I will urge its adoption and ask for the yeas and \nnays. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Is there further debate on the \namendment?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am reminded of a little ditty they \nused to have on the radio each Saturday morning for my children: ``All \nthe way through life, make this your goal; keep your eye on the donut \nand not the hole.''\n  The distinguished Senator from Kansas is really, with this amendment, \ntrying to reduce it to a corporate welfare program. The goal, and the \neye ought to be on it, was commercialization of our technology, not \nresearch. In fact, the research arm of the Defense Department, DARPA as \nwe call it, which has billions of dollars that come over--Greg Fields, \nworking with the National Institutes of Standards and Technology--this \nis now back in the late seventies because I authored this particular \nprogram--in the late seventies in talking with Mr. Fields and the \nauthorities at the National Bureau of Standards, at the time we called \nit, found that we had all kinds of technology backed up in research at \nthe National Bureau of Standards on the civilian side that was not \nbeing commercialized. In fact, what they call the rapid acquisition of \nmanufacturing parts--it is a wonderful type program--was developed and \ncame really out of the Bureau of Standards. A ship broke down in the \nPersian Gulf that was 25 years of age, and they weren't making the \nparts anymore, so the ship couldn't function. It took several months or \na year to get the part back out to get the ship moving again and \neverything else.\n\n  The computerization and manufacturing at the defense level of all \nparts are immediately on the board. Within days, they knew how to punch \nthe computer, get the particular manufacturer, get the part back and \ngoing again. That came out of the Department of Commerce that my \ndistinguished colleague has been bent on trying to abolish.\n  Back to the commercialization. In the late 1970s, down in Houston, \nTX, they developed the superconductor, and right to the point, with the \nresearch initiative, these particular scientists won the Nobel Prize. \nBut the actual commercialization was caused by our Japanese friends who \ncorrelated some 22 entities and immediately started developing and \ncommercializing it. Oh, yes, the American scientists won the Nobel \nPrize; the Japanese entrepreneurs won the profits.\n  We are going out of business in this country. This has nothing to do \nwith small companies or large companies. The staff, of course, has \nprovided me--but I do not want to get into that because I support DARPA \nvery much. But if we had this particular amendment and it took, then we \ncould put it to DARPA and all other research over in the Defense \nDepartment, and then we could grind research to a halt. Because the \nreality is that the larger companies do have the better research \nentities. And the larger research companies also have the stock-market-\nturnaround, get-in-the-black, get-your-stock-increase kind of pressure.\n  Talk to the CEO of AT, a multibillion dollar company. One of the \nlargest corporations ever in the world is in trouble because the \nchairman that they had momentarily, barely a year, could not turn it \naround and get it into the black and get it going. He is gone.\n  Now, Senator Danforth and I, working on this commercialization, said \nnow we are not going to have welfare and we are not going to have pork. \nSo we put in unusual safeguards which this Senator from South Carolina \nhas had to fight personally to maintain.\n  One safeguard coming with the particular research endeavor was that \nwe had to have this particular request approved, bucked right over to \nthe National Academy of Engineering, and saying, ``Wait a minute. Does \nthis really contribute to the Nation's particular research?'' We did \nnot just want company research to increase the profits of a particular \ncompany; we wanted a research endeavor that meant something to the \nbasic research technology advancement of the United States of America. \nThis is a national program; it is not a welfare program; it is not a \ncorporate-profit program.\n  So this is No. 1. The corporation has to come with at least 50 \npercent of its money. They have to have upfront money they are willing \nto put in, then bucked over to the National Academy of Engineering for \nits approval on a national basis, then going back for a third \nparticular test of competition of which were the most deserving because \nthis has been very, very, very limited.\n  Look at our agricultural boards. They have multimillions in there for \nCalifornia raisins and ``Don't drink the wine before its time,'' Gallo, \nand all of those other things. The farm boys around here know how to \nget things done, but the technology boys are out researching and making \nmoney and continuing to research. Then, like GE coming through my \noffice and saying, ``We don't have time to turn this particular \naround,'' so go sell it to the Saudis because they have the money and \nthey can develop it.\n  Mr. President, 15 years ago, I put in a bill to cut out the quarterly \nreporting. That is one of the real bad devices--all this quarterly \nreporting. The market is going up; the market is going down. Greenspan \nsays something, it goes up billions, it goes down billions, costs or \nwhatever it is. We have to understand the global competition has to \nsteady the boat in this land financially. One of the great initiatives \nto have it steadied is to do away with quarterly reports.\n  We all fault the American entrepreneur and corporate leader \nin saying, oh, he won't invest in the long range. Our Japanese \ncompetition, they know how. In Korea, Japan, the competition in the \nPacific rim, they get long-range planning. The American corporate head \ncannot do it under this structure. He has to get in and somehow take \nthe best profits, the bigger profits, go for it. You might have a \ntechnology, but if it takes over 3 years, forget it, ``We don't have \ntime. We don't have the money. Sell it to somebody else, get a joint \nventure with the Germans or the Brits or whatever it is.''\n\n  We are exporting our technology. And the security of the United \nStates of America depends on our superiority of technology. We do not \nhave as many Americans as they do Chinese. Someday we are going to find \nthat out, Mr. President.\n  Running around with a little boat in the Taiwan Straits, I was on one \nof those aircraft carriers up in the Gulf of Tonkin 30 years ago. We \ndid not stop 30 or 40 million little North Vietnamese coming down the \nHo Chi Minh trail. I do not know how, with a couple of these boats in \nthe Straits of Taiwan, that we are going to stop 1.2 billion\n\n[[Page S8013]]\n\nChinese. So we better sober up in this land, emphasize our technology, \nget it developed. That is the thrust of the Advanced Technology \nProgram.\n  So we had all the tests. Like I had commented, I had personally taken \nit on over on the House side. We had a distinguished colleague over on \nthe House side that every time we got to the State, Justice conference, \nhe wanted to write up one of these particular programs for himself. I \nsaid, ``This is not corporate welfare. This is not pork. We're going to \nstand by.'' We held this bill up in conference for weeks on this one \nparticular point, that it was not corporate welfare, it was not pork. \nIt was a studied program to commercialize, develop, and commercialize \nthe technology that we could get financed. It is a solid program with \nstrong bipartisan support.\n  Mr. President, I remember when we had the particular--if you can \nremember. I can hardly remember when the Republicans were in a \nminority, but there was a day. It was just about 4 years ago. They had \na Republican task force in the U.S. Senate at that time chaired by the \ndistinguished majority leader, Senator Dole. They had over a dozen \nSenators endorse this program as it is, which includes, of course, our \ndistinguished majority leader, Senator Lott; the former Secretary of \nthe Navy, Senator Warner; the chairman now of our Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Ted Stevens; the chairman of our Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Hatch--you can go right on down the list--the \nchairman of our Budget Committee, Senator Domenici; and others.\n  I just want the distinguished colleague and friend that I have here \nfrom Kansas to understand coming over from the House side with that \nWalker disease--we had a fellow over there named Bob Walker from \nPennsylvania who just took on a personal kind of vendetta against doing \nanything about commercialization or development of technology or \nresearch except in his district. He held up the authorization for this \nparticular measure for several years. Now it has been passed over on \nthe House side. I thank the distinguished Republican leadership for \npassing that authorization bill and do not want to stultify it now by \nresolving it into big-little, 2\\1/2\\ billion or whatever it is.\n  I can tell you here how they move on these large entities here. They \nmove on and do not put the money to it. They sell it. I can give you \nexample after example where I have worked with them in this particular \nfield, and they come by the office and say, ``I am headed to so and so \njust for a joint venture. I will just take it to Japan and get a 49-51 \ndeal. At least I can get my money back out to do some more research.'' \nBut this has been draining, veritably, the security--not just the \ntechnology, but the security--of the United States of America.\n  It is a well-conceived program, well-administered, just updated by \nour distinguished Secretary of Commerce. He has come along. I do not \nhave the exact breakdown. I wish I had the Fortune 500 approach. We \nknow about half of it goes to small companies. I have no objection to \nit going to small companies. I just have a distaste and would have to \nvote against that kind of division because if this kind of thing sells, \nthen we are going to begin the big-little and it is really going to \nmiss out on some very, very valued technological programs.\n\n  I have example after example that we could get in. I see other \nSenators wanting to speak. But the point here is, big, little, small, \nor otherwise, you have to first put up some money, at least half of it. \nYou have to have it reviewed nationally. Some of the smaller companies, \nthey are engaged in research, but they are not engaged in basic \nresearch. The smaller companies, by their very nature, only have the \nmoneys for their particular endeavor, their particular profits. \nTherefore, they do not come. We tried to get the small companies going \nbecause that is where jobs are created, trying to get small business. \nWe have a specific program for that. We have in here the Small Business \nAdministration program in Senator Gregg's bill right here and now. So \nwe take care of that when it comes to small business.\n  I know the administration, under Secretary Daley and his particular \nstudy here that we could put in the Record, says let us give even again \nmore emphasis to it and require more than the 50 percent from the \nlarger corporations. That particular guideline would be good. I would \nhave hoped that the gentleman would have come with a sense of the \nSenate to confirm that guideline. But to actually put in law this \ninitiative begins to develop in the minds of everyone that this is a \nwelfare program and what we are trying to do is finance research.\n  We are not trying to finance research at all. We are trying to \nfinance the development and commercialization of already established \nresearch. That really comes for the more affluent larger corporations. \nThey come in with the great innovations because they have basic \nresearch. The small company--incidentally, I do not know that I have \nany--of course, down in my home State it is not welfare. I do know \nthis.\n  In the debate, it ought to be understood that I had my textile folks \ncome to me and they said that they had a technology program and they \nknew that I had been the father of the Advanced Technology Program, the \nATP, and the manufacturing extension centers. So they said, ``We need \nyour help over at Commerce to get this particular''--it had a \ncomputerization of the supplies coming in and going out so they would \nnot end up with a warehouse full of bluejeans that they could not sell, \nwhatever it was. Mind you me, I said, No. 1, ``I'll not call over \nthere.'' I never have called over there to talk to a Secretary about \nit. ``This is not pork. It's not corporate welfare.'' I told that to my \nown textile leaders.\n  Mr. President, you know what they did? They went out to Livermore \nLabs, through the Energy Department, and got started a $350 million \nprogram in textile research. You see, with the closedown, fall of the \nwall and the closedown of some of the defense research and what have \nyou, to keep Energy's budget livable and alive, they said, ``Sooey, \npig. You all come. We've got money. Anybody that can do it, we are \nready to go.''\n  That is what happened. They did not qualify at the National Academy \nof Engineering for this computerization. It was an advancement. It \nwould have helped out my home industry and that kind of thing, but it \nhad nothing to do with the overall commercialization of a national kind \nof research unique to the security of the United States itself. So it \nwas turned down.\n  So we ought to be looking now and do not start this particular kind \nof initiative for defense, because we have the large companies here \nthat do all--we put this under research in the Defense Department. \nUnited Technologies, Lockheed Martin, Texas Instruments, IBM, MIT, \nHughes Aircraft, Carnegie Mellon, Northrop Grumman, Loral, Honeywell, \nGE. I can go down the list of millions and millions and millions. If \nthis particular applied, I can tell you you would not get any defense \nresearch, you would not be getting the F-22, the advanced plane, and \nothers of that kind that have come on now to maintain the national \ndefense of the United States.\n  So I hope that colleagues will understand the genesis of ATP, the \npractical reality of financing and developing and commercializing the \nresearch. The large corporations who developed the unique research in \nthis land of ours can make more money elsewhere, and they have been \ndoing it like gangbusters by exporting it right and left everywhere, \nand we have been losing out. And we are wondering why we still have a \ndeficit in the balance of trade.\n  We have gone and manufactured the actual production and \ncommercialization. We have gone from 26 percent of our work force, 10 \nyears ago, and manufactured down to 13 percent. Oh, yes, we are getting \nthe software, we are getting the wonderful jobs at McDonald's and the \nother hamburger places and the laundries. But the actual production and \nhigh-paying jobs are going elsewhere. We are exporting them as fast as \nwe can. We ought not to toy around with the solid nature of the \nAdvanced Technology Program. It is not pork. It is not corporate \nwelfare. The distinguished Senator has come up with an arithmetic \nformula, and if we begin to apply that to research in America, we are \ngone goslings.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Tom Wood, a \nfellow for Senator Frist's office be\n\n[[Page S8014]]\n\ngiven access to the floor during the debate of the Commerce, Justice, \nand State appropriations bill, and the same applies to Floyd DesChamps, \na detailee from the Department of Energy with the Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment of the \nSenator from Kansas. The ATP issue has been one of the more contentious \nissues that we have dealt with within our committee. Last year, it was \nmore contentious than this year because of an agreement reached between \nthe White House and the leadership of the Senate and House. The House \nand Senate and the White House agreed that this program would be \nfunded. I suspect that they agreed it would be funded because of the \nstrength of the arguments made by the Senator from South Carolina, but \nI think most people appreciate the fact that I have, since my tenure on \nthis committee, opposed funding for this program. It was over my strong \nobjection that this decision was made. But it was made and I have \nagreed to live by the budget agreement and, therefore, the money for \nATP is in there.\n  But if you acknowledge ATP even as a program that should proceed \nforward because of whatever arguments we are inclined to accept, it is \nvery hard to understand how we can justify using a program, the purpose \nof which is to encourage the development of technologies which might \nnot otherwise evolve. That is the key here--they might not otherwise \nevolve. It is very hard to justify such a program being used to fund \nFortune 500 companies' research initiatives. The fact is that Fortune \n500 companies, companies with over $2.5 billion in sales, have the \ncapacity to pursue any technology they wish to pursue if they determine \nthat it has some value, if it has some economic value and if it is \ngoing to produce some sort of worth to them. And it's very illogical to \npresume that those companies would not pursue those technologies if \nthey felt there is a value and they have the wherewithal to do it. You \nhave essentially created a piggy bank into which these companies can \nstep or put their hands into if they desire to pursue a technology, \nwhich they probably would have pursued anyway if they had the financial \nwherewithal to do it. But in this instance, there are Federal dollars \navailable, so they say let's use the Federal dollars instead.\n  I think it is much more logical to focus this fund on those \nentrepreneurs and entities which do not have that sort of flexibility, \ndo not have in-house the capital wherewithal to fund whatever research \nthey desire. That is why I believe we should limit access to these \ndollars to the smaller companies. And smaller is a relative term here. \nWe are talking about companies up to $2.5 billion of gross sales. That \nis a pretty big entity. I suspect there are a lot of major companies \nthat fall into that category. In fact, within the State of New \nHampshire, I am not sure how many companies would have more than 2.5 \nbillion dollars' worth of gross sales; it would not be many. We are \nretaining the availability of this program to the vast majority of \ncorporate America and to all of the entrepreneurial world.\n\n  It is not as if we were handicapping for purposes of this exercise. \nIn fact, there isn't enough money to go around as far as applications \nare concerned. There are a lot of applications that are not approved. \nIn fact, the Senator from South Carolina cited one in his own State. It \njust seems much more logical to me that we take this money and, rather \nthan giving it to folks who have the capacity to pursue this research \nindependently and on their own and are simply using the Federal dollars \nto replace dollars that they would spend anyway, that we give it to \ncompanies--or make this money available to entities that do not have \nthe financial wherewithal to pursue these programs; or if they do have \nit, they would be under more stress than a company that has 2.5 billion \ndollars' worth of income.\n  So the amendment of the Senator from Kansas makes an immense amount \nof sense. It is not a dagger in the heart of this program. In fact, I \nthink it is a strengthening amendment for this program. It will \nsignificantly improve the nature of this program. And, really, I am a \nlittle bit surprised at the intensity of opposition to it because it \nappears to be an effort to logically and fairly approach this program, \nrather than just eliminate it, which would be something that many of us \nwould support also.\n  So I think the Senator from Kansas has brought forward an excellent \namendment. I hope that we can pass it. I will certainly support it.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I want to rise in response to some of \nthe statements made by the Senator from South Carolina. I deeply \nappreciate his heart, of where it is about what we need to do to make \nAmerica a stronger economy, to keep jobs, growth, high technology, and \njobs growing and prospering in the United States. I think his heart is \nclearly in the right place and he wants to do the right thing.\n  I just think in a nation this big, with an economy this size, with \nthe dynamism that we have in this country, you can't control it out of \nWashington. That is why the President pronounced, over a year ago, that \nthe era of big Government is over. It seems to me that was an admission \nthat things have changed to the point that you just can't direct all \nthings, and all wisdom doesn't come out of Washington.\n  This program is one of those that we are talking about in that \nparticular area. You are basically talking about a program here where \nyou are going to pick winners and losers out of Washington. We have an \napplication process that takes place here. You apply for this and give \nus your good idea, and we in Washington are going to think about it and \nsee if we think you deserve to get this money or not. If your \ntechnology is one we are interested in and if we think this technology \nis good for our future, then we will decide to give it to you. We will \ndecide those sort of issues from Washington.\n  I am not even talking about the overall program here. As I mentioned, \nand as Senator Gregg has mentioned as well, this is actually a \nstrengthening amendment. We are just saying, if you are a Fortune 500 \ncompany and have revenues of over $2.5 billion a year, we are not going \nto make this program available to you. You are going to have to be, at \nleast, a startup company, because the larger companies do have \nlobbyists here in Washington, as the Senator from South Carolina knows. \nThey are always coming around looking for things for their companies, \nas they should be. Many of their companies take it because their \ncompetitor takes this. Let's remove that as an opportunity and remove \nthis area of corporate welfare, which truly is corporate welfare.\n\n  Now I would like to clear up a couple of other points on this, if we \ncould. One is that I am afraid, too, that some of these programs \nqualify in the area--we put out a big press release saying this program \nis going to solve all the problems of technology drifting abroad, and \nwe are going to solve all of the problems of not having good, high-\nwage, high-skill jobs in the United States because we have the Advanced \nTechnology Program. This will solve all of those problems. This will do \nit. I think we suffer here from a concept of having a big press release \nand a very small program to answer that.\n  Listen once again to the figures. We are talking about a program of \n$200 million. That is a large sum of money, but if you look at what \nventure capital put into new startups last year alone, which was $10 \nbillion, this is 2 percent of what was put into this from just venture \ncapital. And I add initial public offerings on to that, where people go \nto the marketplace to raise capital for a good idea, and that was $50 \nbillion. We are talking about less than 2 percent in this particular \nprogram.\n  If we really want to help business in America--which I think the \nSenator from South Carolina clearly wants to do; he wants business to \nstay here in America, to grow in America, and he wants business to \nprosper--well, then let's do some things that would actually help \nbusiness: cut taxation, regulation and litigation and manipulation out \nof Washington. Let's cut capital gains tax rates.\n  I was just in the Silicon Valley, one of the key areas in this \ncountry where startup companies are flourishing with new ideas and \nproducts that are going\n\n[[Page S8015]]\n\nglobal rapidly. I was there and talking about the Advanced Technology \nProgram. I have a letter, as I mentioned, signed by over 100 CEO's of \nstartup companies saying, ``Do away with this corporate welfare.'' That \nis what they called it. These are the people who, arguably, this \nprogram started for. They said:\n\n       We don't want you directing it because you move too slow; \n     Washington moves too slow in trying to figure out what is \n     taking place in the global marketplace. It can't react fast \n     enough; it can't figure these out. You are going back and \n     basically taking taxpayer dollars from the startup companies \n     to fund more stodgy, slower moving items, many of which end \n     up going to the private market. If you want to help us, cut \n     the capital gains rates; do something about the litigation; \n     as we try to raise capital in this marketplace, do something \n     about the regulatory regime where we have 50 different \n     entities regulating us. Much of that is needed, but can you \n     make it more simplified? What about all the manipulation \n     where you are trying to direct, by the Tax Code, everything \n     we do every day.\n\n  Then they gave a great example which I thought was wonderful. There \nis a little startup company in the Silicon Valley that raised over $300 \nmillion in capital. That is more than the Advanced Technology Program. \nWe are talking about $200 million in this program. They raised that \nmuch. I was speaking to a group of people about 5 miles away from this \nstartup company that raised $300 million. I was talking to a crowd of \nabout 100 people there. I asked them, ``Have any of you heard of this \ncompany?'' I gave the name of the company. This was a group of 100 \npeople, 5 miles a way. This company has actually raised more money than \nis in the ATP Program. One person there out of the 100 had heard of it. \nThat is a substantial amount of money, but it is not large compared to \nthe amount of capital being raised and is needed.\n  If we really want to do something, let's help the overall atmosphere \nand not try to direct it. As I want to point out yet again, look at \nwhat we are talking about with this amendment. We are saying that if \nyou are a Fortune 500 company, if you have over $2.5 billion in \nrevenues, we think you can find enough capital on your own to fund \nideas you think are good. Let's target it for the startup companies. \nThat is what we are supposed to be after with this. These large \ncompanies, when they have an idea they want to pursue, have the ability \nto be able to pursue it. That is how you deal with this issue. If we \nwant to really help corporate America, we have a great chance coming up \nto cut capital gains and deal with litigation reform, and we can \nactually do something real.\n  So those are my responses. I know the Senator from South Carolina has \nhis heart in the right place and his concepts are clear in his mind. If \nwe really want to help them--and I have been there and talked with \nthem--target this and cut it away from the Fortune 500 companies.\n  Mr. President, I do ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment, and \nI believe there is some discussion about holding this vote until 2:45.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  It appears there is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2 p.m. the \nSenate proceed to a vote on or in relation to the Brownback amendment \nNo. 980, with no amendments in order to the Brownback amendment prior \nto the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, once again, we tried to go to the \nfundamental that a $2.5 billion company does not have the ability to \ndevelop it or to pursue it or to commercialize it.\n  Now, why doesn't it have that ability? I emphasize, of course, the \nway the market and the financing of projects works. You have to have a \nquick turnaround. A lot of good, fundamental research technology is not \ndeveloped and not commercialized in the United States for the simple \nreason that the market financing infrastructure does not allow it.\n  If you were chairman of the board, then we would see how long you \nlast unless you turn around and get your stock up. And that is the name \nof the game in America. And they all have to play it. When they get a \nchoice of anything beyond 2 or 3 years, then obviously the board \nmembers, everybody wants to look like good guys and making money and \neverything else for the stockholders. The pressure is there to go ahead \nand export it, get an arrangement, a split arrangement with any of the \nother countries that would want to try to develop it. That is our \nglobal competition.\n  Specifically, right here, in Business Week:\n\n       To stay in the game, Singapore is stepping up its \n     industrial subsidies.\n\n  In September, the Government announced it will pump $2.85 billion \nover the next 5 years into science and technology development including \nresearch and development grants for multinationals.\n  No small business. I am trying to get my friend from Kansas to \nunderstand we have got the Small Business Administration. We take care \nof small business. We favor small business. But what we are looking at, \nto keep the eye on the target, is the development and commercialization \nof technology. And small business, if they went with good research that \ncould really be proven to the SBA, they would get total financing right \nnow. They would get it underwritten under the SBA technology grants. We \nworked that program far more than the little $200 million in this \nparticular endeavor. They have over $800 million in grant authorization \nfor small business.\n  Please, my gracious, let us go with it. Global competition is such \nthat the smallest of the small competitor, Singapore, recently helped \nfund a $51 million research development facility for whom? For Sony, a \n$2.5 billion corporation:\n\n       Last month Lucent Technologies received a grant for a new \n     communications research and development endeavor.\n\n  I could go on down reading these articles. I wish everybody in the \nNational Government would be given a book by Eamonn Fingleton entitled \n``Blind Side.'' We have all been running around and talking about the \nbank problems in Japan and, oh, Japan has all kinds of problems, and \nthey really have their back up against the wall; they are not any \ncompetition any longer.\n  The fact is, Mr. President, last year while we had a 2.5 percent \ngrowth with the market booming. A rebirth in America, we have the \nstrongest economy, Greenspan says he's never seen such a thing, 2.5-\npercent growth, Japan had 3.6 percent growth.\n  The name of the game is market share, market share. They are copying \nit off right and left. And at this moment, this very moment, for \nexample, the great big automaker, United States of America, exports \nless cars than Mexico. Mark it down. You are down there in that area, \nMr. President. Mexico exports more automobiles than the United States \nof America.\n\n  I just helped break ground for Honda in Timmonsville, SC. Who exports \nmore cars than any other entity in America? Honda; the Japanese. Not \nGeneral Motors, not Ford, not Chrysler. Honda.\n  When are we going to wake up to what's going on? Market share. If you \nread Fingleton's book, you go to the Ministry of Finance. Don't worry \nabout MITI, go to the Ministry of Finance and you get your financing, \nyour large corporations.\n  Now, please, my gracious, I am for the little man. I am a Democrat. \nHeavens above. We know the large corporate welfare crowd. But we have \nbeen for the little man against hunger. I just voted to take $5 million \noff administration in the Department of Agricultural budget to get more \nlunchroom programs. So don't talk about corporate welfare and try to \nidentify. We are talking about global competition, which, frankly, the \nWhite House doesn't even understand.\n  You know why I say that. We had a course on Tuesday on NAFTA, North \nAmerican Free-Trade Agreement, where we brought in Mexico in 1994, and \nwe were going to have a sort of update on how it was doing, whether it \nwas a success or not. They wouldn't even send an administration witness \nto the senatorial committee, and that's why they called off the \nparticular hearing. They are embarrassed that they said we would create \n200,000 jobs. We have lost 300,000. I will show you the Department of \nLabor statistics. We have lost in textiles and apparel 231,000 alone. \nSo instead of increasing it in one direction, we have decreased it in \nthe\n\n[[Page S8016]]\n\nother direction; we have been exporting fine, good-paying jobs in the \nparticular industry that predominates my own State. They said, well, we \nare going to increase trade. We had a plus balance of trade of $5 \nbillion and we have gone to a $16 billion minus balance.\n  And they say exports, exports. Well, exports are up. We are sending \nparts down there to be assembled into automobiles and the good \nautomobile manufacturer is moving to Mexico. You would, too. I do not \nblame them. I blame us, you and me. This is the policy. In \nmanufacturing, a third of your operating costs goes into labor, to \npayroll, and you can save as much as 20 percent by moving to an \noffshore, or down in Mexico, low wages and little or no worker or \nenvironmental protections.\n  When I say no particular protections, colleagues are running around \non this Senate floor saying you have to have a minimum wage, you have \nto have clean air and clean water and plant closing and parental leave, \nSocial Security, Medicare, occupational safety from hazard, and up and \ndown the list. Whoopee, yea, we are great. And then we put in a policy \nthat says you don't have to do any of that. You can go offshore for 58 \ncents an hour. Did you see the program on Mexico just last night on \npublic television?\n  Come on. We are losing the jobs right and left. We are losing our \ntechnology right and left. Eamonn Fingleton in his book--and I called \nhim just the other day because he has updated it now with a paperback--\nprojected by 2000 we would be blind-sided. Today, Japan, a country as \nbig as the State of California, manufactures more than the great United \nStates of America. It has a greater manufacturing output. And otherwise \nby the year 2000 it will have a greater gross domestic product, a \nlarger economy, and I will bet you on it. And I want them to come here \nand take the bets because I believe he is right. You can just see how \nthe market share goes. You see how the GDP goes and everything else of \nthat kind.\n  We are going out of business the way of Great Britain. They told the \nBrits at the end of World War II, the empire was breaking up, they said \ndon't worry about it. Instead of a nation of brawn, we will be a nation \nof brains; instead of producing products, provide services, a service \neconomy. Instead of creating wealth with manufacturing we are going to \nbecome a financial center.\n  And England today, Mr. President--I have the distinguished \nPresident's attention--England, the United Kingdom has less of an \neconomy than little irrelevant Ireland. Mark it down. Read \nthe Economist just a month ago. Yes, Ireland, now bigger, economically \nthan the United Kingdom. All they have is a debating society. London is \na downtown amusement park.\n\n  Come on. Are we going to head that way as we go out of business, \ncontinue to appropriate again more and more moneys and finance our \ncampaigns with these false promises of ``I am going to cut taxes.'' Oh, \nthe Post is running around: ``Are you for cutting taxes? Yes, I'm for \ncutting taxes.'' You cannot cut your and my taxes today without \nincreasing our children's taxes tomorrow. We have deficit financing.\n  We will get into that debate again when they bring the reconciliation \nbill over. It is not the Chinese trying to get into our elections. If \nthey want to get into our elections, do as the Japanese do. Pat Choate \nwrote the book, ``The Agents of Influence,'' 7 years ago. One hundred \nJapanese law firms, consultants here in Washington paid over $113 \nmillion. Add up the pay of the Senators and Congressmen, the 535 \nMembers of Congress, and boy, oh, boy, you get, about $71.3 million. \nThe Japanese in Washington by way of pay are better represented than \nthe people of America.\n  When are we going to wake up? Tell the Chinese, ``For Heaven's sake, \nto do the same thing as the Japanese. Give it to a lawyer. Tell them to \ncome around and find some lawyers.\n  But, no, we want to turn this into corporate welfare, show that we \nfought against corporate welfare. Absolute folly. There is no corporate \nwelfare at all in this. It is, by gosh, trying to commercialize \ntechnology and we will not face up to the reality. We are going out of \nbusiness and now we want to say to those who do the general research, \nthe unique research, that there is no reason to try and get into \nanything marginal that is going to take over 3 years to develop. Sell \nit, move on to the next thing. Let us continue the outflow of business, \nthe outflow of jobs, the outflow of technology, and the outflow of our \nsecurity. And everybody comes around and says that's a good idea.\n  I think, to the President's credit, it ought to be emphasized that he \nput this program down as a quid pro quo in the leadership agreement. \nNow, the agreement has been on both sides of the aisle, the Democratic \nand Republican agreement, the White House and the congressional \nagreement that the Advanced Technology Program would be funded at this \nparticular level and in the manner in which it is currently funded. \nWhat we are being asked for in this particular amendment is to violate \nthat agreement. We are running right into a veto situation on a small \nmatter while trying to make it appear as corporate welfare. The \nopponents of this program don't tell you about the National Academy of \nEngineering. You show me another grant program that has to be reviewed \nthat way.\n  I wish we still had Senator Danforth here because he and I worked on \nthis thing over the years to develop the bill's credibility, but now we \nare going to start tearing down its credibility, by changing it into a \nsmall business program for those small companies that can't afford to \nreally commercialize their technology. They can't afford to engage in \ngeneral research, or in unique research to begin with, on account of \nits small nature. They just don't have the labs and facilities that the \nlarge companies do. But we want to act as political animals up here, \npollster politicians and so we are for tax cuts, when we go up and \ncontinue to increase the debt.\n  We have been reducing the deficit each year for 5 years. Now we are \ngoing to use the public till to run around and say we are going to cut \nrevenues while we increase, and we are going to have to go out and \nborrow the money to do it, because we are in the red. We are not in the \nblack. So we will take that multitrillion-dollar debt and interest \ncosts of $1 billion a day and increase that for nothing.\n\n  In the last 16 years we have increased the debt from less than $1 \ntrillion to $5.4 trillion without the cost of a single war. Mr. \nPresident, in 200 years of history with the cost of all the wars we \nhave not even reached a trillion. Now we jump to $5.4 trillion and \ninstead of $75 billion--$74.8 billion, to be exact, we are going to up \nto $365 billion, $1 billion a day. That extra $285 billion, we are \nspending it for nothing. And there are all these fellows talking about \npork and welfare and getting rid of the waste, and using that rhetoric \nfor their reelection next year.\n  ``I am against taxes, I am against the Government, get rid of the \nGovernment.'' That's the big hoopla they have going on, on the other \nside of the Hill. They are now tasking the leadership of the contract \nto get rid of the Department of Commerce, to get rid of the Advanced \nTechnology Program, to get rid of all the Government that pays for \nitself and keeps us secure and keeps us superior as a nation. So now \nthey are going against jobs, against the security of the land, and for \ncorporate welfare, based on this amendment. They say, just on account \nof the $2.5 billion measure, that ``the corporation has the ability to \npursue it,'' their exact words. Yet, everyone knows that the CEO's do \nnot have the ability if they are going to be a good corporate head. \nThey are going to put their moneys elsewhere because where the \nturnaround is, there also is the competition, and they also know that \nthe other governments are financing not only the research but \ndevelopment and taking over the market share.\n  We are going to holler, ``let market forces, let market forces''--\nwell, let's look at the market that we developed here in the National \nGovernment, through measures such as minimum wage, plant closings, \nclean air, clean water--which we all vote for, Republican and Democrat. \nBut the companies say, ``You don't have any of that in global \ncompetition.'' In addition, they are financing it like we finance \nresearch for the aircraft industry.\n  They have learned from the United States. We finance Boeing, we are \nproud of them. They produce and ship planes globally. Thank God we \nstill have one industry. Now, however, we\n\n[[Page S8017]]\n\nhave shipped the technology on the FSX to Japan, and Boeing has had to \nmove the parts manufacturing into the People's Republic of China. We \nare beginning to lose that segment of manufacturing. We are losing the \nautomobile industry. Now we are going to lose the aerospace industry.\n  They told me years ago, ``Hollings, what's the matter with you? Let \nthe developing nations, the Third World, make the textiles and the \nshoes and we will make the airplanes and the computers.'' Now our \ncompetition in the global competition is making the airplanes and the \ncomputers and the textiles and the shoes and we are running around here \njabbering about, ``free trade, free trade, free trade, let market \nforces, let market forces, let market forces,'' and don't have any \nrealization of the actual market forces that we, as politicians, \ncreated.\n  I hope this amendment will be defeated in consonance with the overall \nagreement of the leadership in the Congress and the White House on the \none hand--and defeated based on common sense and competition on the \nother hand.\n  I know my distinguished colleague on the other side of the aisle, the \ndistinguished Senator from Tennessee, Senator Frist, has been leading \nnow, in our committee. He has been holding hearings, and has been \nproviding leadership on addressing the issues relating to the Advanced \nTechnology Program. I know the others that are interested in this \nprogram, including those that I have listed--trying to emphasize, by \nthe way, that this effort is bipartisan. Senator Danforth and I worked \nthis out 10 years ago, and the program is working. It is working well. \nWe need more money. Thousands and thousands of qualified grants still \ndon't receive funding.\n\n  I asked, I say, does the Senator from Kansas have the documentation \nwhere small business really applied but the big companies got the \naward? If that occurred we would have it here. He said these little \nbusinesses are being denied. I know the Commerce Department, Secretary \nDaley. I know the administration of this particular program and they \nlook for the small business in order to sustain the credibility and \nsupport of the program because since its beginnings, critics have been \nwatching the Advanced Technology Program closely for the simple reason \nthey don't understand. They think, ``Well, get rid of the Government. \nFind out where the pork is. Find out where the welfare is. Characterize \nit as welfare. Say you have these big Fortune 500 companies, they have \n$2.5 billion so they can do it.'' And they don't understand what they \nare talking about.\n  It is a sad day when we even propose an amendment of this kind, \nbecause it shows that we really don't understand competition, although \nwe keep running around like parrots, ``Competition, competition, \ncompetition.'' We are the ones with these kind of amendments that \ndestroy competition.\n  We are against welfare but we are the ones with these kind of \namendments that create welfare.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we are awaiting other Members bringing \namendments to the floor. I appreciate the enthusiasm and energy of the \nSenator from South Carolina in his spirited defense of the ATP program, \nwhich he, as he has mentioned and which will be generally \nacknowledged--he is the father of.\n  I would say we are going to have a vote on that at 2 o'clock, and at \nthat time I hope Members would support the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Kansas because I believe it makes sense and it is a strengthening \namendment to the ATP program.\n  So, at this time I make a point of order a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to speak very briefly in \nopposition to the amendment offered by the Senator from Kansas, Senator \nBrownback, as I understand it.\n  That amendment, if it were adopted, would essentially prohibit the \nAdvanced Technology Program, which is administered through the \nDepartment of Commerce, from allowing participation of large companies.\n  Let me give you my own understanding of how the Advanced Technology \nProgram works. I think it has been an extremely useful program. It has \nhelped to keep the United States at the forefront of technology \ndevelopment and high-technology industry development in the world, and, \nto a significant degree, our leadership in that arena, in that area of \nhigh technology, is the reason why we enjoy the strong economy we enjoy \ntoday.\n  So I believe the Advanced Technology Program is useful. It has been a \ngreat help to many companies. It has been a great help in helping us, \nas a country, create jobs in the industries of the future.\n  In order for that program to succeed, though, we need to be sure that \ntaxpayer funds are provided, and they are only a very small portion of \nthe total funds that go into these technology development activities, \nbut they are a catalyst. They bring together companies. They bring \ntogether research institutions to do this important work. Those funds \nalso provide a bridge between the Government-funded research and the \nprivate-sector research, so that we have national laboratories, such as \nthe two in my State, Los Alamos and Sandia, and we have many large and \nsmall companies working together to make breakthroughs in technology.\n  It is essential, if this program is going to succeed, that we allow \nthe Advanced Technology Program to put the funds where the most good \ncan be done and we not begin to structure this program as though it was \nsome kind of a jobs program or as though it is a doling out of funds to \ndifferent corporate interests. It is not that. It is an effort by the \nFederal Government to stimulate cooperative research in areas that show \ngreat promise.\n  Sometimes the people doing that work are in large companies. \nSometimes there are a few individuals in a large company who are doing \nvery important work and can benefit from collaborating with researchers \nin small companies or researchers in national laboratories or \nresearchers in universities around this country.\n  I think it would be a great mistake for us to begin to limit the \ncompanies that can participate in the Advanced Technology Program. To \ndo so would begin to move us down the road toward mediocrity in the \ntechnologies that are developed through use of these public funds, and \nI believe that is a very major mistake.\n  I know that there have been criticisms over the past that any time \nthe Federal Government invests dollars in research and development \nactivities that private sector companies are engaged in, that somehow \nor another that is corporate welfare. I strongly disagree with that \npoint of view. I think the taxpayers are well served if we can invest \nin developing technologies that will create jobs, will produce revenue, \nwill produce additional tax revenue in the future and will keep our \neconomy the strongest in the world.\n  I very much hope that the Senate will reject the Brownback amendment \nwhen it is finally voted on, and I hope we will allow this Advanced \nTechnology Program to continue to be the great engine of innovation and \ntechnology development that it has been in recent years.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise to urge the Senate to reject \nthe amendment offered by Senator Brownback that is designed to weaken a \nprogram absolutely critical to the country's technological strength. I \nthought that the fact that this bill contains the $200 million in funds \nneeded for the Advanced Technology Program was a sign that we could \nfinally get past a debate that is nothing but a distraction and a \ndanger to our own economy.\n  I stand here today just as I did last year and the year before to \ndefend this program--this investment in America's economic \ncompetitiveness. As I, along with many others in this Chamber, have \nstated before, this program supports American industry's own efforts to \ndevelop new cutting edge, next-generation technologies--technologies \nthat will create the new industries and jobs of the 21st century.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that ATP does not, and I repeat, does not\n\n[[Page S8018]]\n\nfund the development of commercial products. Instead, this program \nprovides matching funds to both individual companies and joint ventures \nfor pre-product research on high risk, potentially high payoff \ntechnologies.\n  The Senate should give credit to Secretary of Commerce Daley, and let \nus work with him through the authorization process to improve the \nprogram. Secretary Daley just met his pledge to conduct a 60-day review \nof the program to assess the ATP's performance and the criticisms that \nhave been levied against it.\n  Sure enough, his review took into account comments provided by both \ncritics and supporters of ATP. The Department of Commerce notified more \nthan 3,500 interested parties, soliciting comments about ATP. In fact, \nSenators Lieberman, Domenici, Frist, and I joined together and provided \n1 of the 80-plus comments the Department received.\n  I commend Secretary Daley for the job he did in undertaking this \nreview. As we all know, there is not a department or program that can't \nbe improved. And as a long time and avid supporter of ATP, I believe \nthat after 6 years of operation, experience shows us some areas that \nindeed can be improved. This review has done just that. I agree with \nhis suggestion to place more emphasis on joint-ventures and consortia \nand more emphasis on small and medium-size single applicants. I also \nsupport his proposal to shift the cost-share ratio for large single \napplicants to 60 percent, and I will further review his suggestions to \nencourage state participation.\n\n  As ranking Democrat on the Science and Technology Subcommittee, which \nhas oversight of the ATP, I look forward to working with my colleague \nSenator Frist to review this report and to make any necessary \nlegislative changes during consideration of legislation to reauthorize \nthe Technology Administration.\n  Secretary Daley's review could not have been done at a better time. \nAs I stated, this program has been in existence for 6 years, and this \nreview was conducted on those 6 years of experience. The proposals set \nforth in this review strengthen a very strong program that is one of \nthe cornerstones to the Nation's long-term economic prosperity.\n  Some of us in the Senate, Senator Hollings, Senator Burns, Senator \nLieberman, and myself, to name just a few, have been fighting every \nyear for the past 4 years to keep the ATP alive. We welcomed the \nSecretary's review because we knew that it would validate the arguments \nwe've been making for the past 4 years. A new element also is emerging \nin this debate that is validating what we have been saying. That new \nelement is the success stories that are finally emerging. The mere \nideas receiving grant money 4, 5, and 6 years ago are now technologies \nentering the market place and enhancing our economy and our livelihood.\n  Let me close with some success stories that are starting to emerge.\n  In Michigan for example, there are already two success stories, the \nfirst relating to the auto industry and the second relating to bone \nmarrow transplants.\n  In September 1995, an ATP-funded project, the ``2 millimeter (2mm) \nprogram,'' was completed. As a result of this grant, new manufacturing \ntechnologies and practices that substantially improve the fit of auto \nbody parts during automated assembly of metal parts was developed. This \ntechnology has substantially improved the fit of auto body parts during \nassembly, resulting in dimensional variation at or below the world \nbenchmark of 2 millimeters, the thickness of a nickel. What does this \nmean for this Nation's economy? It means that U.S. auto manufacturers \ncan make cars and trucks with less wind noise, tighter fitting doors \nand windshields, fewer rattles, and higher customer satisfaction. In \naddition, there is a cost savings between $10 and $25 per car to the \nconsumer, and maintenance cost savings is estimated between $50 and \n$100 per car. In addition, this improved quality is estimated to give \nthe U.S. auto manufacturers a 1- to 2-percent gain in market share. \nEqually important is that this newly developed technology is applicable \nin the sheet metal industry, and industries as diverse as aircraft, \nmetal furniture fabrication, and appliance manufacturing. Quality \nimprovement from this technology could result in an increase in total \nU.S. economic output of more than $3 billion annually.\n\n  In 1992, Aastrom Biosciences, a 15-person firm in Ann Arbor, MI, \nproposed a bioreactor that would take bone marrow cells from a patient \nand within 12 days produce several billion stem, white, and other blood \ncells--cells that can be injected into the patient to rapidly boost the \nbody's disease-fighting ability. The technology looked promising but \nwas too risky and long-term at that point to obtain significant private \nfunding.\n  The national benefit of this program was that it provided a reliable \ndevice that would allow blood cells from a patient to be grown in large \nquantities would reduce health care costs, require fewer blood \ntransfusions, and greatly improve the treatment of patients with \ncancer, AIDS, and genetic blood diseases. Aastrom submitted a proposal \nidentifying the economic opportunity and technical promise, and in 1992 \nthe ATP co-funded a research project that developed a new prototype \nbioreactor. Today, after completing the ATP project and proving the \ntechnology, the company has over 60 employees, and another 30 providing \ncontract services, a practical prototype, and over $36 million in \nprivate investment to develop their new blood cell bioreactor into a \ncommercial product.\n  In North Carolina, Cree Research of Durham, won an ATP award in April \n1992 to develop improved processing for growing large silicon-carbide \ncrystals--a semiconductor material used for specialized electronic and \noptoelectronic devices such as the highly desired blue light-emitting \ndiodes [LED's]. In 1992, this market was limited because of \ndifficulties in growing large, high-quality single crystals. With ATP \nsupport, Cree Research was able to double the wafer size, with \nsignificant improvements in the quality of the larger wafers. Since \n1992, LED sales are up by over 850 percent as a result of the ATP-\nfunded technology.\n  In Texas, a company has developed a cost-effective, microchip-based \nDNA diagnostic testing platform which contains both a family of \ndiagnostic instruments and disposables. This successful prototype has \ndemonstrated single molecule detection at a tenfold throughput \nadvantage over conventional technologies. Numerous patented products \nwill result from this technology in a market--molecular tools for \ndiagnostics--which is expected to reach $2 billion by the year 2004.\n  ATP funded projects from 5 and 6 years ago are becoming success \nstories all across the Nation.\n  Mr. President, ATP is working, and the U.S. economy is benefitting; \n288 awards have been given thus far, including 104 joint ventures, and \n184 single applicants. Small businesses account for 106 awards and are \nthe lead in 28 of the joint ventures. For the $989 million in ATP \nfunding committed by the Federal Government, industry has committed \n$1.03 billion in cost sharing. The success stories, however, show us \nMr. President, that the Federal funding and the cost sharing is just \nthe seed money for enormous contributions to our national economy and \nour global competitiveness. Necessary seed money that bridges the \ninnovation gap in this country between basic research and emerging \ntechnologies. I encourage my colleagues to continue their support of \nthis worthy and successful program, and to reject this amendment that \nwill take us backwards and help our foreign competitors while weakening \nour own economy.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today in support of \nSenator Brownback's amendment to the Commerce, Justice, and State \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 1998. This amendment prohibits the \nawarding of grants from the Advanced Technology Program [ATP] within \nthe Department of Commerce to corporations with sales greater than $2.5 \nbillion.\n  This amendment offered by the Senator from Kansas is a good amendment \nthat should enjoy bipartisan support. After all, I hear my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle talking year after campaign year about \neliminating corporate welfare. Therefore, I assume a vote to limit \ngrants to the wealthiest corporations in the Nation should be an easy \none. Let's be clear about what\n\n[[Page S8019]]\n\nfirms we are talking about. The companies that have been awarded the \nlargest grant amounts are IBM, General Motors, General Electric, Ford, \nand Sun Microsystems, among others. Do these sound like corporations in \nneed of one, two or three million dollar grants? To me, these \nprofitable firms sound like companies that could certainly find private \nsector funding. And this belief is not without basis. In fact, the \nGeneral Accounting Office [GAO] surveyed 89 grant recipients and 34 \nnear-winners that applied for ATP funding between 1990 and 1993. Of the \nnear-winners, half continued their research and development projects \ndespite a lack of ATP funding. Among those who received grants, 42 \npercent said they would have continued their R without the ATP money.\n  The Federal Government should not be in the business of providing \ncorporate subsidies. However, we should fund basic science projects \nthat do not have short-term profit-making potential, and would \notherwise not be funded by the private sector. The Senator's amendment \nis a step toward reversing this trend toward funding applied research \nthat ultimately produces handsome profits for these companies. Under \nhis reasonable proposal, the most profitable firms, companies that \nrealize more than $2.5 billion in sales, would not be eligible for ATP \nsubsidies. While I would prefer to see these corporate subsidies \neliminated from our budget, I would be pleased to know that Federal \nfunding is not going to enormously profitable corporations.\n  Defenders of the ATP corporate welfare program argue that these \ngrants allow research that otherwise would not go forward. How do we \nknow, when many of the grant recipients did not even seek private \nsector money before coming to the Federal Government? In fact, GAO \nfound that 63 percent of the ATP applicants surveyed had not sought \nprivate sector funding before applying for a grant. Other opponents of \nthis amendment are the same Senators who oppose the efforts of the \nRepublicans to ease the tax burden on Americans. At the same time these \nMembers deny taxpayers the chance to keep some of their own money, they \nturn around and give the hard-earned tax dollar to billion dollar \ncorporations.\n  However, after hearing so many Senators speak out against corporate \nwelfare, I am confident that this amendment will be approved by a wide \nmargin. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Department of \nCommerce's Advanced Technology Program or ATP. This is an important \nprogram and I have long appreciated Senator Hollings' work in founding \nand continuing it. The amendment offered by Senator Brownback would \nprohibit ATP awards to companies with revenues that exceed $2.5 \nbillion. I oppose Senator Brownback's amendment and would like to thank \nSenator Frist for his floor statement explaining why he too has voted \nagainst the amendment. Like Senator Frist, I think there are several \nsolid reasons as to why Senator Brownback's amendment should be \nopposed.\n  My first concern is process--this is an attempt to legislate a very \ncomplex issue now being considered by the authorizing committee, on an \nappropriations bill. The Senate Commerce Committee, Science and \nTechnology Subcommittee under Senator Frist, the Subcommittee Chair, \nand Senator Rockefeller, ranking Democrat, are planning legislation on \nATP, including a careful look at this issue, later this session. I \nbelieve in this case that the Senate should vote to wait and see what \naction the authorizing committee takes.\n  I would also highlight recent changes to the ATP proposed by Commerce \nSecretary William Daley that may assist in resolving this debate. The \nSecretary's action plan for changes is very responsive to \nrecommendations I and other Members of Congress made. Specifically the \nevaluation criteria will be changed to put more emphasis on joint \nventures or consortia. This will help ensure that the program funds \nonly pre-competitive research and development; for if competitors in \nthe development phase cooperate in research and development, they are \nvery unlikely to allow access to each other's product development \nefforts.\n  Secretary Daley has mandated that the cost-share ratio for large \ncompanies, applying as single applicants, will be increased to a \nminimum of 60 percent. Proposals will also be reviewed by venture \ncapital experts to ensure that private sector financing would not be \navailable and a government role is needed. When combined with changes \nin the evaluation criteria favoring small and medium sized businesses, \nthese changes will result in virtually all ATP grants being awarded to \neither consortium or small and medium sized company single applicants.\n  Finally, modifications to the ATP's rules and procedures would help \nfacilitate cooperative ventures between industry and universities and \nnational laboratories. To date, university and Federal laboratory \nparticipation has been hindered over concerns regarding intellectual \nproperty and project management.\n  After studying the Secretary's report, I believe that the ATP will \nemerge both as a more effective program and one with a significantly \nreduced political profile. Its new structure appears to have answered \ncriticisms raised and is consistent with the bipartisan ideas endorsed \nby the Senate Science and Technology Caucus of which I am a member.\n  I believe that the changes introduced by Secretary Daley, now under \nreview by the Commerce Committee, are a better way to ensure the \ncontinued effectiveness of the Advanced Technology Program than the \npending amendment which would completely ban large companies from all \nparticipation in the ATP. Large companies play a key role in the \ninnovation process through their organizational ability, resources and \nmarket experience. To entirely preclude their participation in the ATP \nwould be a mistake. I will vote to oppose this amendment and look \nforward to Senator Frist's subcommittee review.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to speak on this bill.\n  I thank Senator Gregg, our subcommittee chairman, and Senator \nHollings, our ranking member, for help, for cooperation and commitment \nto the most important issue facing my State, and that is bolstering the \nfront line of our Nation's defense in the war on drugs.\n  The U.S. Border Patrol has been funded in this bill. It has been \nfunded to the extent that we will be able to add 1,000 new Border \nPatrol agents during fiscal year 1998. This bill provides adequate \nfunding for their training and supervision. Moreover, it reflects the \nongoing commitment of Congress to put 5,000 new Border Patrol agents on \nthe line and to regain control of our borders by the year 2002.\n  Mr. President, I have to tell you that this was a hard-fought effort. \nThe Immigration Reform Act passed last year directed the administration \nto submit a budget request to Congress which included funding for 1,000 \nnew agents. Regrettably, they only requested funding for 500. I and \nSenator Gramm have had many discussions with the Attorney General and \nthe INS Commissioner. I am convinced of their commitment to secure our \nborders. I think they really are sincere. But now they must back that \nup with the requested resources in future years.\n  Over the past several months, I have felt and expressed a sense of \nhopelessness in our Nation's war on drugs. I feel this hopelessness \nbecause no matter where I travel in Texas, I meet people who have lost \nloved ones to drug violence. I know ranchers and farmers along our \nborder who have been intimidated by drug smugglers. They have had their \nhomes shot at in broad daylight. I know of Customs agents of Mexican-\nAmerican heritage who have been told by drug smugglers to look the \nother way as cocaine, heroin, marijuana, and methamphetamines are \nsmuggled across the border because their families back in Mexico will \nbe harmed if they do not.\n  Just this morning, a friend of mine called me to tell me about his \nfriend\n\n[[Page S8020]]\n\nwho lives in Carrizo Springs. He described gangs of drug thugs and \nillegal immigrants who are terrorizing residents of this small Texas \ncommunity. They are scared and they feel helpless. These Texans have \nthe misfortune to live along the front lines of a business that \nprovides $10 billion to the Mexican economy each year--the drug market.\n  The Office of National Drug Control Policy reports that approximately \n12,800,000 Americans use illegal drugs. Illegal drug use occurs among \nmembers of every ethnic and socioeconomic group in the United States. \nAnd 10.9 percent of all children between 12 and 17 use illegal drugs \nand 1 child in 4 claims to have been offered illegal drugs in the last \nyear.\n  Drug-related illness, death and crime cost the United States \napproximately $67 billion each year, including costs for lost \nproductivity, premature death, and incarceration.\n  I strongly believe and share the view that effective treatment and \nprevention is needed to break the cycle that links illegal drugs to \nviolent crime. It is the only way to protect our children and save \ntheir future.\n  Mr. President, our southern neighbor, Mexico, is the source of \nbetween 20 and 30 percent of the heroin, 70 percent of the marijuana, \nand 50 to 70 percent of the cocaine shipped into the United States. If \nthe flow of drugs is going to stop, the front line of that war will be \nalong our Nation's border with Mexico. The United States-Mexico border \nis 2,000 miles long, and Texas has 1,200 miles of that border.\n  You can see how that border goes. You can see that, of the 2,000, \n1,200 miles is along Texas. Texas has been and will continue to be the \nkey battleground in this war.\n  I am pleased that we have been able to work with the Border Patrol \nand the committee to correct disparities in placing Border Patrol along \nthe border. As you can see from this chart, Texas has 1.7 agents for \nevery 1 of our 1,254 miles--1.7 for this 1,254-mile border. New Mexico \nand Arizona do not fare much better. California has 16.3 agents for \nevery one mile of the border. I cannot go home and tell my constituents \nthat we are doing all we can in the war on drugs if Congress and the \nadministration fail to provide the funding for more Border Patrol \nagents.\n  Two of Mexico's largest drug cartels, the Juarez cartel and the \nMatamoros cartel operate from El Paso here and Brownsville, \nrespectively. You can see from this chart that from the Matamoros \ncartel, the gulf cartel, the drugs go in and over to the eastern \nseaboard. From the Juarez cartel, it goes into Colorado and Chicago, \nthe Midwest. From the Tijuana cartel, it goes into California, goes to \nthe Pacific Northwest. So you can see what is happening to our country \nand what not closing the border can do to the amount of illegal drugs \nthat are coming into our country.\n\n  As we work on this funding for fiscal year 1998, I will be asking \nmany questions about deployment of resources from the DEA and from the \nBorder Patrol because we must put the resources where the threat lies. \nTwo-thirds of the illegal immigration and the illegal drugs flowing \nthrough Mexico and into our country go through Texas, through McAllen, \nthrough Eagle Pass, and through the Del Rio Border Patrol sectors. Two-\nthirds of the illegal immigration and the illegal drugs go through \nthese corridors. Yet as we have said, there are only 1.7 agents per \nmile in Texas, and we must do something about that, and that is what \nthis bill is going to address today.\n  The bill that we pass will fully fund 1,000 new Border Patrol agents. \nWe need this help. It is the highest priority I have. As long as drugs \nare coming through Mexico into the United States through this border, \nit should be the highest priority for everyone.\n  That is why I cannot say enough times how pleased I am that the \nchairman of the subcommittee, Senator Gregg; Senator Hollings, the \nranking member of the subcommittee; as well as our chairman, Senator \nStevens, all agreed that this was a crisis that affects all of us. It \nis not just the border States; it is all of the States that these drugs \nfunnel into. Nothing is a greater priority than stopping the flow of \nillegal drugs into our country. When 1 child in every 4 has been \noffered illegal drugs, we cannot look them in the eye and say we are \nprotecting their future if we do not stop those illegal drugs.\n  So I want to work with the Attorney General and the Commissioner of \nINS and General McCaffrey, who is our drug czar, who is trying to \ngrapple with this issue. I want to say to them, no resource is going to \nbe withheld if it will stop the illegal drugs and the illegal \nimmigration into our country that has criminalized our borders.\n  This bill addresses that today, and I will ask the Attorney General \nand the Commissioner of INS to help us by deploying the full 1,000 and \nmaking sure that we stop the centers where these people are coming \nthrough Texas. If we can stop it right now, then our children will have \na better future.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. Once again I thank the subcommittee \nchairman. I think, if we can work together on a bipartisan basis, we \ncan make a difference for the future of our country. And this is a \nmajor first step.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in my judgment, there is an urgent need \nthat independent counsel be appointed to investigate and prosecute \ncampaign finance violations arising out of the 1996 Federal elections. \nThe efforts to persuade Attorney General Reno to make that application \nfor independent counsel have thus far failed. It is my view that it is \nimportant to consider alternatives in order to have independent counsel \nappointed.\n  In my judgment, there are two possible alternatives available. One \nwould be a lawsuit to ask the United States Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia, the appropriate panel on independent counsel, to \nappoint independent counsel, notwithstanding the refusal of the \nAttorney General to make that application.\n  The general rule of law is that a public official may not be \ncompelled to perform a discretionary function, an area of law which I \nhad some experience with as district attorney of Philadelphia. However, \nthere is a narrow ambit, even when considering a discretionary rule, \nwhere there may be an application for relief if there is an abuse of \ndiscretion by the public official. It is my legal judgment that there \nhas been such an abuse of discretion by the Attorney General in this \nsituation.\n\n  Another alternative would be to legislate in the field, to make it \nabundantly plain that independent counsel should be appointed here, and \nthat the circuit court would have the authority to do so. In my \nopinion, there is a realistic likelihood of success on litigation at \nthe present time.\n  Although the independent counsel statute poses certain problems which \nmake it to some extent uncertain, I believe there is a legal basis for \nproceeding to have the court appoint independent counsel without any \nmodification of pending law. There is the alternative of legislating on \nthis bill which is before the Senate, to make certain modifications of \nthe independent counsel law, which would remove any conceivable doubt \nabout the authority of the circuit court to appoint independent \ncounsel.\n  Mr. President, on the issue of the exhausting of remedies on \nrequesting that independent counsel be appointed by Attorney General \nReno, the record is replete with a whole series of requests having been \nmade by individual Members of Congress and then by the Judiciary \nCommittee of the U.S. Senate. The issue was focused on very sharply \nwith Attorney General Reno in oversight hearings which we had several \nmonths ago. I had an opportunity to question the Attorney General on \nthis subject and pointed to two specific instances which, in my \njudgment, cried out for the appointment of independent counsel.\n  President Clinton has publicly complained about having been denied \nnational security information which he thought he should have and has \ncomplained that such information was denied to him by the FBI and the \nDepartment of Justice. In questioning Attorney General Reno on this \nsubject in the Judiciary oversight hearing, she defended that denial of \ninformation on the ground that there was a pending criminal \ninvestigation and that as a matter of balance, it was her judgment as \nAttorney General that the information should not be turned over to the \nPresident.\n  On the record in that Judiciary Committee oversight hearing, I \ndisagreed\n\n[[Page S8021]]\n\nwith her conclusion on the ground that the Attorney General did not \nhave the authority to decide what the President should or should not \nsee on national security matters; the President as Commander in Chief \nand Chief Executive Officer of the United States has an absolute right \nto that information. If there were to be a denial to the President, it \nwas not the function of the Attorney General or the FBI to deny that \ninformation. However, if the Attorney General felt that a denial of \ninformation was warranted under the circumstances, that was a very \npowerful showing that independent counsel ought to be appointed. If the \nPresident of the United States is in any way suspected, that provides a \nvery strong basis that his appointed Attorney General ought not be \nconducting that investigation. It ought to be handled by independent \ncounsel.\n  It was pointed out to Attorney General Reno in the course of that \noversight hearing that this followed directly her testimony on \nconfirmation where she strongly endorsed the concept of independent \ncounsel both as a matter of avoiding conflict of interest and, as \nAttorney General Reno said at that time, avoiding the appearance of \nconflict of interest. Notwithstanding that, she has refused to make an \napplication for the appointment of independent counsel.\n\n  A second line of questioning which I pursued with the Attorney \nGeneral involved the issue of violations of the campaign finance laws. \nOn that subject, there has been substantial information in the public \ndomain about the President's personal activities in preparing \ntelevision commercials for the 1996 campaign. There is no doubt--and \nthe Attorney General conceded this--there would be a violation of the \nFederal election law if, when the President prepared campaign \ncommercials, they were advocacy commercials, contrasted with what is \nknown as issue commercials. The activity of the President in \nundertaking that activity has been documented in a book by Dick Morris \nand also in public statements by his chief of staff, Leon Panetta.\n  The Attorney General, during the course of the hearing, disputed my \ncontention that the commercials were, in fact, advocacy commercials. I \nthen wrote to the Attorney General the next day, on May 1, and set \nforth a series of commercials which President Clinton had edited, or \nprepared, and asked her if those were, in fact, advocacy commercials. \nIn the letter, I cited the Federal Election Commission definition of \nexpress advocacy, which is as follows:\n\n       Communications using phrases such as ``vote for \n     President,'' or ``reelect your Congressman,'' ``Smith for \n     Congress,'' or language which, when taken as a whole and with \n     limited reference to external events, can have no other \n     reasonable meaning than to urge the election or defeat of a \n     clearly identifiable Federal candidate.\n\n  Mr. President, it is my submission that reasonable people cannot \ndiffer on the conclusion that the commercials that President Clinton \nprepared were express advocacy commercials. This is an illustration of \na commercial:\n\n       Protecting families. For millions of working families, \n     President Clinton cut taxes. The Dole-Gingrich budget tried \n     to raise taxes on 8 million. The Dole-Gingrich budget would \n     have slashed Medicare $270 billion and cut college \n     scholarships. The President defended our values, protected \n     Medicare, and now a tax cut of almost $1,500 a year for the \n     first two years of college. Most community college is free. \n     Help adults go back to school. The President's plan protects \n     our values.\n\n  It is hard to see how anyone could contend that that is not an \nexpress advocacy commercial. It certainly fits within the definition of \nthe Federal Election Commission, which is that the language taken as a \nwhole can have no other reasonable meaning than to urge the election \nand defeat of a clearly identified Federal candidate. That commercial \nrefers to two Federal candidates, and one is President Clinton. It \nextols his virtues, obviously speaking in favor of the President. That \ncommercial refers to another candidate, former Senator Dole, arguing \nabout his failings.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my \nremarks, my letter dated May 1, 1997, be printed in the Congressional \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, can I ask the Senator from Pennsylvania \nwhat his intentions may be with respect to the floor, timewise?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I expect to speak at some length, Senator Kerry, and to \nintroduce an amendment to the present bill. There is a vote scheduled \nfor 2 o'clock, and I will have a considerable amount to say, which will \nnot all be said by the time the vote comes up.\n  Mr. KERRY. Well, Mr. President, if I could inquire again of the \nSenator--and I appreciate his indulgence here. I did want to speak with \nrespect to the amendment that is pending for the vote at 2 o'clock. It \nis my understanding that the amendment being submitted by the Senator \nwill not be voted on at 2. So I ask the distinguished Senator if he \nmight be willing to agree to permit some period of time--and I don't \nneed a lot-- before 2 o'clock so that I might speak on the pending \namendment.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. May I inquire of the Senator from Massachusetts, how \nmuch time he would like to have?\n  Mr. KERRY. I would be pleased to have 6 or 7 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my \npresentation be interrupted for 7 minutes so that Senator Kerry may \nspeak and that I be entitled to regain the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to speak with respect to the \namendment that seeks to make it more difficult for large companies to \nbe able to participate in the Advanced Technology Program. As a matter \nof background, Mr. President, for years in this country, we had a \nstructure where we had the Bell Laboratories, or IBM, and other very \nlarge entities who were engaged in major research and technology. And \nfor years, this country's economy benefited enormously because of the \nremarkable amount of private sector and public sector research. The \ndefense industry and other industries had an enormous amount of \nspinoff. If you look at something like the experience of Route 128 in \nMassachusetts, or the Silicon Valley, everybody understands that some \nof the great technology jobs of the present time come from the 1960's \nand 1970's spinoffs through that investment.\n  The fact is that our economic structure has changed very \nsignificantly in the 1990's. We no longer have that kind of broad-based \ntechnology research fueled by the Federal Government. We have a much \nmore specific and targeted kind of research that takes place. And as a \nresult of that, both the Federal Government and the private sector have \nnarrowed the kind of basic science and research that we do, which often \nresults in those spinoffs, which has provided the remarkable foundation \nof the economic growth we are experiencing now in our Nation.\n  It is also ironic that, at the very time that we are doing that, \nJapan and other countries are increasing their technology investment. I \nbelieve, last year, Japan committed to a 50-percent increase in their \nnational commitment to science and basic technology research.\n  So the truth is that, a number of years ago, the Commerce Committee, \nwith the leadership of Senator Hollings, Senator Rockefeller, myself \nand others, created what is known as the Advanced Technology Program, \nwhich is a way to joint venture in the United States between our \nuniversities and our laboratories and various entities in the private \nsector, in order to maximize what was a diminishing ability to move \nscience from the laboratory to the shelf, to the marketplace. It would \nbe most regrettable to turn around now and reduce the capacity of a \nlarge company to be able to be part of a consortium, to be able to \njoint venture with smaller companies in an effort to fill that vacuum \nand make up for that scientific research.\n  In point of fact, Mr. President, let me just share a couple of \nsuccess stories from the Advanced Technology Program from 16 different \nStates in our country. The Advanced Technology Program put together a \ndevice that would allow blood cells from a patient to be grown in large \nquantities, consequently reducing health care costs, requiring fewer \nblood transfusions and improving treatment possibilities for patients \nwith cancer, AIDS, and genetic blood diseases. It developed \nmanufacturing technologies and practices\n\n[[Page S8022]]\n\nthat substantially improved the fit of auto body parts during automated \nassembly of metal parts, which resulted in United States auto \nmanufacturers making cars and trucks with less wind noise, tighter \nfitting doors and windshields, fewer rattles, and higher customer \nsatisfaction, and potentially increasing United States auto \nmanufacturers' gain in the world market. Another example of success was \na development of a new way to solder electronic circuit boards that \nuses less solder, and is more precise, more efficient, and \nenvironmentally benign than current technologies. In addition, there \nwas a development of a process to develop ultrafine ceramic powders \nthat can be heat pressed into parts such as piston heads and turbine \nblades, and those significantly impact parts manufacturing.\n\n  Somebody might sit there and say, well, OK, Senator, these things are \nall well and good, why didn't these companies just go do it on their \nown? Why should the Federal Government be involved in supporting that? \nThe answer to that is the reason that we ought to keep this program \ngoing: The reality is that the way money functions in the marketplace, \nit seems it's the best return on investment, fastest or safest, but it \ndoesn't often commit to take some of the higher risks, particularly \ngiven the change within the marketplace today. It is a known fact--you \ncan talk to any venture capitalist, and talk to anybody out there \nseeking the capital--that it is only because of programs like the \nAdvanced Technology Program, where the Government is willing to share \nnot only in the risk, but in the burden of trying to find the processes \nand the technologies, that we can advance in helping to bring together \nthe special combinations, where we have been able to make things happen \nthat simply would not happen otherwise.\n  We have created jobs, we have advanced ourselves in the world \nmarketplace. We have maintained our competitive edge as a consequence \nof this commitment. And to create this arbitrary, sort of means-tested, \nvery precise process of eliminating a whole group of companies that \nhave great technology, but may not be willing to share it with smaller \ncompanies absent this joint risk, would be an enormous loss to the \nAmerican competitive edge. That is the reason that it is so important \nfor the United States to continue this effort. It is also a fact that \nwhile large firms are able to pay for their own research and \ndevelopment, they are not always going to pay for the longer term, \nhigher risk, broader applied technology principles that other nations \nor other companies might benefit from without paying for it.\n  So, Mr. President, I strongly urge colleagues not to respond to the \nsort of simple view of this adopting a notion that a large company is \nautomatically able to take care of itself and eliminate this program. \nWe need large companies in combination with small, we need large \ncompanies lending expertise to our universities, we need large \ncompanies to be part of this combination. Without this combination, \nthose companies, Mr. President, will not make this commitment and \nAmerica will lose in the marketplace. I urge my colleagues to reject \nthe Brownback amendment. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania again \nfor his courtesy.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I was in the process of my contention \nthat the commercials prepared and/or edited by President Clinton \nconstituted express advocacy, and I asked that my letter of May 1, \n1997, to Attorney General Reno be printed in the Record.\n  I now ask that the reply from Attorney General Reno, dated June 19, \n1997, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                               Office of the Attorney General,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 19, 1997.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: I have received your letter of May 1, \n     1997, asking that I offer you my legal opinion as to whether \n     the text of certain television commercials constitutes \n     ``express advocacy'' within the meaning of regulations of the \n     Federal Election Commission (``FEC''). For the reasons set \n     forth below, I have referred your request to the FEC for its \n     consideration and response.\n       Under the Federal Election Campaign Act, the FEC has \n     statutory authority to ``administer, seek to obtain \n     compliance with, and formulate policy with respect to'' FECA, \n     and exclusive jurisdiction with respect to civil enforcement \n     of FECA. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 437c(b)(1); see 2 U.S.C. Sec. 437d(e) \n     (FEC civil action is ``exclusive civil remedy'' for enforcing \n     FECA). The FEC has the power to issue rules and advisory \n     opinions interpreting the provisions of FECA. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 437f, 438. The FEC may penalize violations of FECA \n     administratively or through bringing civil actions. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 437g. In short, ``Congress has vested the Commission \n     with `primary and substantial responsibility for \n     administering and enforcing the Act.' '' FEC v. Democratic \n     Senatorial Campaign Comm., 454 U.S. 27, 37 (1981), quoting \n     Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 109 (1976).\n       The legal opinion that you seek is one that is particularly \n     within the competence of the FEC, and not one which has \n     historically been made by the Department of Justice. \n     Determining whether these advertisements constitute ``express \n     advocacy'' under the FEC's rules will require consideration \n     not only of their content but also of the timing and \n     circumstances under which they were distributed. The FEC has \n     considerably more experience than the Department in making \n     such evaluations. Moreover, your request involves \n     interpretation of a rule promulgated by the FEC itself. \n     Indeed, it is the standard practice of the Department to \n     defer to the FEC in interpreting its regulations.\n       There is particular reason to defer to the expertise of the \n     FEC in this matter, because the issue is not as clear-cut as \n     you suggest. In FEC v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign \n     Comm., 839 F. Supp. 1448 (D. Colo. 1993), rev'd on other \n     grounds, 59 F.3d 1015 (10th Cir. 1995), vacated, 116 S.Ct. \n     2309 (1996), the United States District Court held that the \n     following advertisement, run in Colorado by the state \n     Republican Federal Campaign Committee, did not constitute \n     ``express advocacy'':\n       ``Here in Colorado we're used to politicians who let you \n     know where they stand, and I thought we could count on Tim \n     Wirth to do the same. But the last few weeks have been a real \n     eye-opener. I just saw some ads where Tim Wirth said he's for \n     a strong defense and a balanced budget. But according to his \n     record, Tim Wirth voted against every new weapon system in \n     the last five years. And he voted against the balanced budget \n     amendment.\n       ``Tim Wirth has a right to run for the Senate, but he \n     doesn't have a right to change the facts.''\n       839 F. Supp. at 1451, 1455-56. The court held that the \n     ``express advocacy'' test requires that an advertisement ``in \n     express terms advocate the election or defeat of a \n     candidate.'' Id. at 1456. The Court of Appeals reversed the \n     District Court on other grounds, holding that ``express \n     advocacy'' was not the appropriate test, and the Supreme \n     Court did not reach the issue.\n       Furthermore, a pending matter before the Supreme Court may \n     assist in the legal resolution of some of these issues; the \n     Solicitor General has recently filed a petition for \n     certiorari on behalf of the FEC in the case of Federal \n     Election Commission v. Maine Right to Life Committee, Inc., \n     No. 96-1818, filed May 15, 1997. I have enclosed a copy of \n     the petition for your information. It discusses at some \n     length the current state of the law with respect to the \n     definition and application of the ``express advocacy'' \n     standard in the course of petitioning the Court to review the \n     restrictive definition of the standard adopted by the lower \n     courts in that case.\n       It appears, therefore, that the proper legal status of \n     these advertisements under the regulations issued by the FEC \n     is a question that is most appropriate for initial review by \n     the FEC. Accordingly, I have referred your letter to the FEC \n     for its consideration. Thank you for your inquiry on this \n     important matter, and do not hesitate to contract me if I can \n     be of any further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Janet Reno.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Further, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the \nFederal Election Commission, dated June 26, 1997, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                  Federal Election Commission,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 26, 1997.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: Your letter of May 1, 1997 to \n     Attorney General Reno has been referred by the Department of \n     Justice to the Federal Election Commission. Your letter asks \n     for a legal opinion on whether the text of certain \n     advertisements constitutes ``issue advocacy'' or ``express \n     advocacy.''\n       As the Attorney General's June 19, 1997 letter to you \n     correctly notes, the Federal Election Commission has \n     statutory authority to ``administer, seek to obtain \n     compliance with, and formulate policy with respect to'' the \n     Federal Election Campaign Act (``FECA''). 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 437c(b)(1). The Commission's policymaking authority \n     includes the power to issue rules and advisory opinions \n     interpreting the FECA and Commission regulations. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 437f and 438.\n       Your May 1 letter notes that the Commission has promulgated \n     a regulatory definition of ``express advocacy'' at 11 CFR \n     100.22. While the Commission may issue advisory opinions \n     interpreting the application of that provision, the FECA \n     places certain limitations on the scope of the Commission's \n     advisory opinion authority. Specifically, the FEC\n\n[[Page S8023]]\n\n     may render an opinion only with respect to a specific \n     transaction or activity which the requesting person plans to \n     undertake in the future. See 2 U.S.C. 437f(a) and 11 CFR \n     112.1(b). Thus, the opinion which you seek regarding the text \n     of certain advertisements does not qualify for advisory \n     opinion treatment, since the ads appear to be ones previously \n     aired and do not appear to be communications that you intend \n     to air in the future. Moreover, ``[n]o opinion of an advisory \n     nature may be issued by the Commission or any of its \n     employees except in accordance with the provisions of \n     [section 437f].'' 2 U.S.C. Sec. 437f(b).\n       While the FECA's confidentiality provision precludes the \n     Commission from making public any information relating to a \n     pending enforcement matter, I note that past activity such as \n     the advertisements you describe may be the subject of \n     compliance action. If you believe that the advertisements in \n     question involve a violation of the FECA, you may file a \n     complaint with the Commission pursuant to 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 437g(a) noting who paid for the ads and any additional \n     information in your possession that would assist the \n     Commission's inquiry. The requirements for filing a complaint \n     are more fully described in the enclosed brochure.\n       I hope that this information proves helpful to your \n     inquiry. Please feel free to contact my office (219-4104) or \n     the Office of General Counsel (219-3690) if you need further \n     assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              John Warren McGarry,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the essence of the Attorney General's \nresponse to me was that she would not respond on the legal issue, \nnotwithstanding she is the Nation's chief law enforcement officer. She \npassed the buck over to the Federal Election Commission. The Federal \nElection Commission passed the buck back, saying that these were \nmatters that had already occurred, so they didn't come within advisory \nopinions. One way or another, Mr. President, we will have a \ndetermination as to what is involved there. The alternative of \nproceeding in court is one which we are currently examining, and as I \nhave noted, there is an issue as to whether that can be done on the \nexisting statute.\n  I do believe there is a legal basis for so proceeding, but on a novel \nbit of litigation of this sort, no lawyer can be absolutely certain as \nto what the result would be. But in the context of what we have on the \nrecord with the Attorney General's refusal to appoint independent \ncounsel, in a context where she is denying the President of the United \nStates national security information, and her refusal to proceed to \nappoint independent counsel where the Attorney General concedes that \nthere has been a coordinated effort by the President so that the only \nremaining issue is whether there is an advocacy commercial, which on \ntheir face, I submit, these commercials are. The problems have been \ncompounded with the conduct of the Attorney General and the Justice \nDepartment in the course of the last several days where they have \nopposed applications for immunity requested for consideration by the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee.\n  The Governmental Affairs Committee, as is well known, is currently \ninvestigating illegal or improper activities in the 1996 Federal \nelections. A modus operandi has been worked out there which would allow \nthe Attorney General to come in and give the committee the Attorney \nGeneral's opinion as to whether immunity should be withheld or granted.\n  The law is plain that the committee has the jurisdiction to make that \ndetermination, where the statute gives the Attorney General a period of \ntime to object and additional time for the purpose of putting the \nDepartment of Justice's case together. Due to the problems created by \nthe decisions involving Admiral Poindexter and Colonel North go to a \npoint where limited immunity is granted, the prosecutor must prove the \ncase from independent sources and the prosecutor can put a case \ntogether, can, so to speak, bundle the case before immunity is granted.\n  So when the request was made for applications for immunity for five \nindividuals, the Attorney General responded, the Department of Justice \nresponded that they objected to the grant of immunity. That was, so to \nspeak, the straw which broke the camel's back and the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Thompson, made a very forceful public statement on \nTuesday saying that he had lost confidence in the Department of Justice \nto conduct an impartial and appropriate investigation, and that the \nrefusal to agree to those grants of immunity was just beyond the pale, \na conclusion with which I agree.\n  On the basis of the equities here, I believe a very, very strong case \ncan be made out to have the Court, in its supervisory authority, \nappoint independent counsel notwithstanding the absence of an \napplication by the Attorney General. However, in consultation with my \ncolleagues, I have decided to introduce an amendment to the pending \nbill which would make certain modifications in the independent counsel \nstatute. These modifications would create new authority for the \nCongress to seek judicial appointment of an independent counsel where \nthere is a determination that the Attorney General's failure to do so \nis an abuse of discretion. This authority would reside in the Judiciary \nCommittee, where the full committee or a majority of the majority party \nmembers or a majority of the nonmajority party members could petition \nthe Court to appoint an independent counsel where the full committee or \na majority of either party's committee members determines that the \nAttorney General's failure to appoint an independent counsel is an \nabuse of discretion. This carefully crafts a procedure so that there is \na limit of standing as to who may come in and ask for the appointment \nof independent counsel.\n  The amendment, which I propose to introduce, would further provide \nfor a judicial determination on independent counsel with a \nspecification that upon receipt of a congressional application, the \nCourt shall appoint independent counsel where the Court has determined \nthat the Attorney General's failure to appoint an independent counsel \nis an abuse of discretion.\n  There are considerations on constitutional issues here, but I believe \nthat other relevant issues must also be considered. Regarding the \ncontext of the current factual situation and carefully limiting the \npetitioning authority to the Congress, and in the context where the \nAttorney General herself has emphasized the importance of the \nindependent counsel provision, including the avoidance of appearance of \nimpropriety, it is my judgment that this law would pass constitutional \nmuster and would provide an important addition in the interest of \njustice to solve the problem which we now confront, where the \noverwhelming weight of evidence--and I don't use that term lightly. It \nis evidence. It has evidentiary value--calls for the appointment of \nindependent counsel.\n\n  There is pending at the present time an amendment so I cannot \nintroduce my amendment now. A subsequent amendment is pending. But it \nis my intention, as I say, Mr. President, to introduce this amendment. \nThere have been some preliminary indications that the introduction of \nthis amendment might tie up the bill, and I do not intend to tie up the \nbill. If that is the consequence of the introduction of an amendment, \nif a filibuster were to follow, I would not persist and subject this \nappropriations bill to a filibuster. I firmly believe that it is in the \npublic interest in a very serious way to have independent counsel \nappointed, and it is obvious that all the entreaties to the Attorney \nGeneral have thus far been unsuccessful and litigation is an option \nwhich may be pursued. However, this statutory change would make it \ncertain that the Court would have the authority and that the \npetitioning parties would have appropriate standing to have independent \ncounsel appointed.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 1, 1997.\n     Hon.

And I, too, am very optimistic and feel very confident that \nthis can be done, yet I want to rise and speak against the amendment \nand stress that the approach is different than what I would like to \ntake and therefore explain it.\n  I am chairman of the Commerce Science, Technology and Space \nSubcommittee, the committee through which the reauthorization and the \nauthorization for this ATP takes place. That subcommittee right now is \nlooking at all of the information in a very systematic way to see how \nwe best can evolve that program to provide absolutely the best return \non our Nation's investment.\n  I feel strongly that the proper place to effect such changes should \nbe in a more comprehensive approach rather than a shotgun approach, and \nthat is through the committee structure, through the committee that is \ncharged with the reauthorization of NIST's ATP, and that is what we are \ndoing.\n  Just last week an excellent report was released by the Commerce \nDepartment. It is a 60-day report. It put forth recommendations, four \nreform efforts in place, suggestions, recommendations--conducted by the \nCommerce Department. And I dare say I bet there has not been a Senator \nin the room who has read through that report released just last week.\n  I think the report is a good first step. We need to go much further \nthan that, but I would rather do that on an authorizing bill rather \nthan having it tagged on an appropriations bill in more of a shotgun \nfashion.\n  Our subcommittee is right now working on a reauthorization bill that \naddresses the longstanding concerns which people have with the Advanced \nTechnology Program so that it can be become a really more effective \nvehicle for stimulating innovation in this country, and that is what we \nwant to do, stimulate innovation.\n  I welcome the input to our subcommittee of all interested parties, \nincluding my colleagues from the Commerce Committee and the Senator \nfrom Kansas, who is also on the Commerce Committee, in order to craft \nthis more comprehensive legislation. Therefore, I rise to express my \nopposition to this particular amendment offered by the Senator from \nKansas and hope that we will begin the opportunity through the \nappropriate authorizing subcommittee to effect real change, more \ncomprehensive change where we can consider all of the available data in \norder to accomplish the necessary change in the NIST's Advanced \nTechnology Program through this reauthorization process. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in opposition to this amendment, recognizing \nthat we will be addressing all of these issues through the appropriate \nreauthorizing committee, that of science, technology and space.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I make a point of order that a quorum is \nnot present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Under the previous order, the question now occurs on amendment No. \n980, offered by the Senator from Kansas [Mr. Brownback].\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar], for himself, Mr. \n     McConnell, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Graham, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Roth, \n     Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Mack proposes an amendment numbered 981.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 113, line 7, after the word ``expended.'' insert \n     the following new heading and section:\n\n\n                    national endowment for democracy\n\n       For grants made by the United States Information Agency to \n     the National Endowment for Democracy as authorized by the \n     National Endowment Democracy Act, $30,000,000 to remain \n     available until expended.\n       On page 100, line 24 strike ``$105,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$75,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR.

Mr. President, I object to the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LUGAR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana has the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, point of personal privilege, I would simply \nlike to indulge the attention of the Chair. I do this in the most \ngentle, appropriate way as possible.\n  I have the utmost respect for the Senator from Indiana. The rules of \nthe Senate are, Senators are recognized as a right of first voice heard \nby the Chair. Three voices were raised on this side of the aisle. And \nwhile I have enormous respect and affection for the Senator from \nIndiana, I do not think his voice had even been expressed, but he was \nrecognized.\n  I think the Chair should proceed, if I may say, by the rules of the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. His voice was expressed. I happened to be \nlooking in his direction and recognized him.\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the amendment that I introduce comes to the \nfloor because no funding for the National Endowment for Democracy is in \nthis bill. It has been zeroed out. The bill as written proposes to \neliminate the National Endowment for Democracy, a program that has been \nenthusiastically supported by every administration, Republican and \nDemocratic, since President Ronald Reagan's first term, and by every \nCongress, Republican and Democratic, since 1983, when it was first \nlaunched.\n  The amendment we are proposing would continue funding for the \nNational Endowment for Democracy at this year's level, namely $30 \nmillion. It does not seek an increase in funding. But it proposes that \nthe funding continue.\n  The amendment would shift $30 million from the State Department \nCapital Investment Fund in the bill to the National Endowment for \nDemocracy.\n  I point out, Mr. President, that even with the $30 million shifted \nfrom the State Department Capital Investment Fund, that fund will still \nexceed by $11 million the administration's request.\n  The capital investment fund is an important initiative. Many of us \nhave written to Secretary Albright and the President about the \nimportance of strengthening the State Department's technological and \ncommunications capability. They are significant and important \ndeficiencies in the State Department. And this bill will go a long way \nto correct them.\n  But, Mr. President, the administration requested a total of $64 \nmillion for these purposes. The bill before us includes a funding level \nof $105 million, some $41 million over the President's request. \nTherefore, Mr. President, I am pleased to announce the administration \nfavors our amendment, it favors support of the amendment because it \nprovides for the National Endowment for Democracy and all that had been \nrequested, and more, for the Capital Investment Fund of the State \nDepartment.\n  Let me point out, Mr. President, an important editorial that appeared \nin the Wall Street Journal this morning that very succinctly sums up \nthe case that we make.\n  The Wall Street Journal editorial states--and I quote:\n\n       A United States Senate accustomed to forking up \n     multibillions will debate the government's equivalent of the \n     widow's mite today, a $30 million appropriation to fund the \n     National Endowment for Democracy. An appropriations \n     subcommittee chaired by New Hampshire Republican Judd Gregg \n     decided not long ago in a fit of austerity to defund the NED, \n     on grounds that it was a relic of the Cold War. The same \n     subcommittee awarded the State Department $100 million, $40 \n     million more than it requested, just to buy computers.\n       We don't think for minute that a title with the word \n     ``democracy'' in it imparts virtue to a federal enterprise in \n     and of itself, and we confess to having had some skepticism \n     of our own about the NED some years after it was founded in \n     1984. But a closer look at what the NED has been up to \n     produces some surprises.\n       Its rather unusual design seems to have encouraged \n     considerably more initiative in its mission of spreading \n     democracy around the world than would be expected of the \n     usual federal agency. Maybe that's because it is not a \n     federal agency, but a free standing foundation with its own \n     board of directors supported by both federal and private \n     money. It channels its grants through four institutes, two of \n     which are operated by the two major U.S. political parties.\n       One achievement of this Ronald Reagan brainchild was to \n     help Poland's Solidarity break the grip of the Soviet Union \n     in the Cold War days. But it is doing some rewarding work \n     today as well.\n       Its Republican branch, the International Republican \n     Institute, help set up free elections in Mongolia last year, \n     turning that once-Communist country into a democratic, free \n     market paragon. IRI also is helping villages in China learn \n     how to conduct free and fair elections of local governing \n     committees something they are entitled to do under Chinese \n     law. The Democrats, through their National Democratic \n     Institute for International Affairs, are doing similar work. \n     American politicians are helping teach practical politics at \n     the very foundations of democracy, and doing it on a \n     shoestring.\n       Is this of value to the U.S.? You only have to ask yourself \n     whether the world is safer with a democratic or an \n     authoritarian China to answer that question. The fact that \n     private corporations are willing to fund special NED projects \n     in non-sensitive situations offers evidence that enlightened \n     businesses value the stability that democracy and a rule of \n     law bring to the countries where they seek to operate. \n     Bulgaria is one such place where new democrats are being \n     offered such aid.\n       Since news of the defunding became known, the NED has had \n     an outpouring of support from people around the world who \n     have direct knowledge of its contributions.\n       Hong Kong democratic leader Martin Lee, who faces tough \n     battles ahead in coping with Hong Kong's new Beijing \n     landlords, penned a letter to Senator Connie Mack begging him \n     to help save the NED, Senator Bob Graham has heard from \n     Sergio Aguayo of the Civic Alliance, which has had a strong \n     hand in promoting the multiparty democracy now taking root in \n     Mexico. Jack Kemp, Jeane Kirkpatrick and William Bennett, \n     along with such varied Senate personalities as Richard Lugar, \n     Chris Dodd, John Kyl and Ted Kennedy have weighed in one \n     behalf of NED.\n       The NED recently sent out an invitation to kindred groups \n     in Germany, Britain, Canada, Sweden and the Netherlands to a \n     meeting in Taiwan in October it will co-sponsor with Taiwan's \n     Institute for National Policy Research. The purpose of this \n     gathering in one of the world's newest democracies is to \n     foster NED-type groups in still more countries. What a shame \n     it would if the U.S. Senate collapsed with an attack of \n     parochialism on the eve of such a bold endeavor.\n\n  That is the end of the Wall Street Journal editorial.\n  Mr. President, I simply make the point that the NED is not a cold war \nrelic. The President of the United States, currently, President Bill \nClinton, just as Ronald Reagan at the inception of this, sees the value \nof this type of activity.\n  President Clinton has said if we are going to make a difference in \nChinese democracy, the National Endowment for Democracy and its \nInternational\n\n[[Page S8026]]\n\nRepublican Institute is on the spur of what needs to happen by \npromoting the organization of elections in local villages. And this we \nare doing. These things do not happen by chance.\n  The President has commended the idea that the National Endowment for \nDemocracy has been involved in Mongolia, has commended the work that is \noccurring in situations where not only free and fair elections have \noccurred, but in its unique way the National Endowment for Democracy, \nby placing labor leaders in nations that have gained democracy, helps \nbuild labor unions.\n  The Chamber of Commerce, by placing businesspeople under the National \nEndowment for Democracy's auspices, helps market economics get started. \nAre these important to the United States? You bet they are.\n  The fact is, a free and fair election can occur, and the cold war may \nbe over, but our Nation needs to relate to other nations that have \nongoing sensitivity toward labor-management relationships, market \neconomics, price finding in the markets, freedom of speech, and \npolitical dialog that our political parties have fostered.\n  The suggestion, Mr. President, is this could be done by private \nenterprise all by itself. But that would have no particular legitimacy. \nThe backing by the Congress, by the administration, by every living \nSecretary of State, every living National Security Adviser, every \nliving President, of this idea ought to at least weigh in with this \nbody.\n  There may be Members second-guessing all of these people and saying \nthey are simply out of it. But I would advise Members, they are very \nmuch with it. They understand the dynamics of what has to happen in the \nworld and why it is important for these four groups in the National \nEndowment for Democracy to band together throughout several \nadministrations and with a continuity of effort to make a substantial \ndifference in the world.\n  Mr. President, I cited a few moments ago letters that have been \nwritten. I want to mention specifically one from the Laogai Research \nFoundation, and a name that all will recognize in this body, Harry Wu, \nits executive director. He simply says:\n\n       Tomorrow (Thursday), in a letter he wrote to me yesterday, \n     in a vote on the Senate floor, you will be presented with a \n     choice to either support the N.E.D. or [to] kill it. I \n     understand that particular . . . programs may, from time to \n     time, draw the ire of lawmakers. [But] may we suggest that \n     when this is the case, leaders such as yourself [must] \n     suggest . . . what internal changes need to be made.\n       In other words, don't throw out the baby with the \n     bathwater.\n       If the United States intends to maintain its leading role \n     in world affairs, continued Congressional support of the \n     National Endowment for Democracy is imperative.\n\n  I have cited a letter that was written by Jeane Kirkpatrick, Jack \nKemp, William Bennett, Lamar Alexander, Steve Forbes, Vin Weber, a \nwhole galaxy of people involved in Empower America. They are important \nvoices, living, active voices, not relics of the cold war. They \nunderstand the dynamics of what we ought to be doing in American \npolitics.\n  They are joined, as I have suggested earlier, by Sandy Berger, \ncurrently the National Security Adviser, and by all the National \nSecurity Advisers since the NED was created.\n  Mr. President, I want to cite specifically a letter from Martin Lee, \nchairman of the Democratic Party in Hong Kong. Not long ago, many in \nthis Senate honored Martin Lee. Prior to the turnover in Hong Kong, \nmost of us were worried about Martin Lee and democracy.\n  I simply cite Martin's letter in which he says:\n\n       My main purpose in writing now is to express my concern \n     about proposals I understand are before the Senate to \n     consider eliminating funding for the National Endowment for \n     Democracy. I know you have always been a strong supporter of \n     NED and the important work it does around the world, but I \n     wanted to write to express my conviction the National \n     Endowment for Democracy is indeed indispensable in a world \n     where democracy and freedom are not entrenched and where--to \n     cite the example of Hong Kong--all democratic institutions \n     can be wiped out by fiat.\n       In Hong Kong and elsewhere in Asia--\n\n  Martin Lee says\n\n     and around the world, the struggle to preserve democracy, \n     political freedom and the rule of law is far from being won.\n\n  Let me just simply say, Mr. President, this is serious business. What \nis being proposed here in our amendment is that $30 million for \ncomputers and technological equipment the State Department did not seek \nbe restored to the National Endowment for Democracy that they did ask \nfor. The request of the President is for this money, leaving fully all \nof the requests that the administration made for the equipment.\n  Mr. President, what we have before us we need to see very clearly. \nThere are Members of the body who simply want to kill the National \nEndowment for Democracy. Now, I resist that idea, and for good reason. \nThe experience of most of us in this Chamber, I hope, would be to say \nthat we have to be active on the front lines, and we have to be active \nas Republicans, Democrats, labor union members, and business people in \nour own expertise and synergy and continuity; we have to be active not \nsimply in setting up those activities our diplomacy can do--free and \nfair elections--but the centers of support of commerce, of labor, of \nfreedom of speech and press and contract law and the details that, \nalone, make continuity possible and second and third elections in \ncountries transitioning to democracy possible. Mr. President, I do hope \nthat Members will support this amendment. I think it is very important \nfor the foreign policy and security of this country. I thank the Chair.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 982 to Amendment No. 981\n\n (Purpose: To make appropriations for grants to the National Endowment \n                             for Democracy)\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell], for himself, Mr. \n     Lugar, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Graham, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Roth, Mr. \n     Dodd, and Mr. Mack, proposes an amendment numbered 982 to \n     amendment No. 981.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 113, line 7, after the word ``expended.'' insert \n     the following new heading and section:\n\n\n                    national endowment for democracy\n\n       For grants made by the United States Information Agency to \n     the National Endowment for Democracy as authorized by the \n     National Endowment Democracy Act, $30,000,000 to remain \n     available until expended. This shall become effective one day \n     after enactment of this Act.\n       On page 100, line 24 strike ``$105,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$75,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nsecond-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, independence is the first step toward \ndemocracy--hardly the last. As our own nation's history records, 87 \nyears after our revolution, President Lincoln stood at Gettysburg to \nremind a deeply wounded nation----\n\n       It is for us, the living to be dedicated . . . to the \n     unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so \n     nobly advanced . . . the great task remaining before us--that \n     this nation, under God shall have a new birth both of \n     freedom--and that government of the people, by the people and \n     for the people shall not perish from the earth.\n\n  We all, at one point or another in our school careers, memorized that \nfamous address. Eighty seven years after our Nation's birth--when we \nhad a strong, well established representative government--Lincoln spoke \nof our unfinished work--because we saw our democracy, our Government \nand Nation divided and devastated by civil war--a war which serves as a \ncaution that even healthy, strong democracies suffer attack and \nsetbacks.\n  One hundred years after President Lincoln reminded us of our \nunfinished work, President Reagan stood before the British Parliament \nin 1982 and predicted the certain end of communism.\n  But, in forecasting communism's imminent demise, President Reagan \ncalled upon his country, our allies and our American political parties \nto ``contribute as a nation to the global campaign for democracy \ngathering force.''\n  This remarkable speech set in motion the people and events which \nestablished the National Endowment for Democracy.\n\n[[Page S8027]]\n\n  President Reagan's message was as simple and pure as it was powerful \nand enduring--the mission he defined was to create a world illuminated \nby individual liberty, representative government and the rule of law \nunder God.\n  Eighty-seven years after our revolution, we needed to recommit \nourselves to that purpose at Gettysburg. President Reagan renewed the \ncall and, now, we must rededicate and redouble our efforts to secure \ndemocracy around the globe.\n  With the end of the cold war, this mission and our responsibilities \nhave only just begun. It is not ending, it is the beginning.\n  The National Endowment for Democracy--and especially its four core \ninstitutes--offer the best, most effective, and strongest tools we have \navailable to consolidate the gains we have made in dismantling the \nstructure of Communist and totalitarian governments.\n  We need to remember that tearing down the weak practices and \ngovernment architecture of communism is not the same thing as creating \nor sustaining strong, viable democratic principles, laws and \ninstitutions.\n  Communism has indeed been cast on the ash heap of history. The \nquestion remains what will take its place.\n  Virtually every nation which suffered behind the Iron Curtain has \nenjoyed some form of free and fair elections--but the first election is \nnot as important as the second then third when there is a real test of \ndemocratic principle and practice--when those who have enjoyed elected \noffice must relinquish power if the principle of self determination is \nto survive. In other words, only after an orderly transition of power \nfrom election to election occurs can democracy truly take root.\n  The key to self-determination--the core of democracy--is the active \nengagement of citizens in their government. NED and its institutes, in \nturn are the key to building and encouraging this deep, informed \ninvolvement.\n  These organizations carry out this important work in a number of \nways.\n  In Burma, NED funding is keeping the faint but fervent hopes for \nfreedom and democracy alive. Let me explain why their work is so vital.\n  Burma and North Korea have a lot in common with the Stalinist era in \nthe Soviet Union. A ruthless 400,000 man military force, led by the \nState Law and Order Restoration Council--SLORC--have systematically \ndestroyed the education system and detained, tortured, and executed \nanyone opposing their brutal rule.\n  NED is a lifeline for the courageous opponents who resist SLORC \ninside Burma and the large, exiled community who struggle every day to \nrestore the results of the 1990 elections and their leader Aung San Suu \nKyi to office.\n  With less than $200,000 NED has kept alive the only uncensored, \nindependent newspaper circulated inside Burma. The New Era, a monthly \nnewspaper, is vital to the effort to raise awareness of SLORC's \nviolations of human rights and civil liberties, to assure independent \nreporting of events and to provide counterbalance to SLORC's daily \ncampaign to smear and slander Aung San Suu Kyi.\n  Let me point out that it's a crime in Burma to have a copy of this \nnewspaper, yet in spite of threats of imprisonment and death, an \nextraordinary network of students and citizens take this risk to assure \nmonthly delivery and circulation of the New Era.\n  The NED also supports the Democratic Voice of Burma which produces \nand transmits a daily morning and evening broadcast of news, features \nand ethnic language programming as well as broadcasting recordings of \nAung San Suu Kyi's speeches, the texts of U.N. decisions and other \ninformation of intense interest to Burma's citizens.\n  Beyond sustaining the independent media, NED supports efforts to \nstrengthen cooperation among the more than 15 ethnic groups which work \nin peaceful opposition to the military junta. This support has enabled \nthe National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma under the \ndirection of elected Prime Minister Dr. Sein Win to continue to \nrepresent to the outside world the views and aspirations of the \nlegitimately elected parliamentarians of Burma.\n  Although they are victims of one of the world's most repressive \nregimes, Dr. Sein Win works with his colleagues inside and outside \nBurma, calling for peaceful dialog to restore democracy to his \nbeleaguered nation.\n  Burma is just one example of the Endowment's exceptional service to \nthe cause of democracy.\n  I have also observed the crucial role they have played in the New \nIndependent States of the former Soviet Union.\n  Each of these countries illustrate my earlier point that while \ntrappings of communism have been dismantled, it is far too early to \njudge the transition to democracy a complete success.\n  Communities across the region desperately need precisely the kind of \ntraining and support available through NED. One of the most compelling \nreasons why NED is so vital is illustrated by the work done through \ntheir core grantee in Russia.\n  Although we are all concerned about the reactionary elements which \ncontinue to dominate the Russian Parliament, there is some reason to be \nhopeful. During the last election, in every community and town where \nthe International Republican Institute ran training programs and \nsupported efforts to strengthen local political parties, reformers were \nelected to office--reformers who shared our interests in free market \neconomies and individual liberties.\n  Obviously, reformers do not control a majority yet, but IRI's \nimpressive record suggests we should be substantially expanding our \nsupport for endowment activities to secure the kinds of governments and \nsocieties which share our interests.\n  The cold war may be over, but repression and authoritarian impulses \nare alive and well.\n  NED nourishes the ambitions of all those who want to participate and \nshape their own great experiment in democracy--Muslim women in the \nMiddle East, journalists under fire in Cambodia, trade unions in \nBelarus, political scientists in Azerbaijan, legal defense funds in \nLatin America--all benefit from NED's small grants--all contribute to \nbuilding the foundation which sustains a healthy democracy.\n  The National Endowment for Democracy and its core grantees work \ncitizen by citizen and community by community to transform individual \naspirations of self-determination into the governing nations which \nRonald Reagan defined so well--nations which preserve and protect \nindividual liberty, representative government and the rule of law under \nGod.\n  NED deserves our support. It does a good job and it does it in \nservice to our national interests. Each democracy which grows is one \nmore trading partner, one less crisis which may require our political \nor military intervention.\n  We abandon this extraordinary campaign for democracy gathering force \nat our own peril.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to strongly support and \ncosponsor the McConnell amendment to restore modest funding for the \nNational Endowment for Democracy. I commend the distinguished chairman \nof the Foreign Operations Subcommittee for his continued leadership on \nthis important matter.\n  The National Endowment for Democracy is a proven, cost-effective \ninvestment in democracy. It represents our national interests and our \nvalues.\n  As a member of the Commerce, State, Justice Subcommittee, I am \ndisappointed that no funds were provided for a program that so \neffectively strengthens democracy around the world. Today we seek to \nrestore funding to continue this important tool of American foreign \npolicy.\n  The cold war may be over--but dictatorships and military juntas still \nexist. Democracy is still fragile in too many countries. Rigged \nelections still occur, and freedom of speech is not a universal right. \nThe National Endowment for Democracy provides the tools of democracy. \nIt encourages a free press, unions, and multiparty elections. It \nsupports women's participation in the electoral process. It assists \ngrassroots organizations that support democracy and human rights.\n  The National Endowment for Democracy has a remarkable track record. \nIt was one of the early supporters of the Solidarity movement in \nPoland. It helped to draft South Africa's constitution.\n  But NED does not rest on it laurels. Today, in Albania, Burma, and \nCuba--NED is supporting democracy. It provides assistance to the only \nindependent newspaper in Bosnia. It is helping\n\n[[Page S8028]]\n\nto empower women in Turkey. It is helping Asian organizations to fight \nagainst the use of child labor.\n  Mr. President, the cold war is over--but American leadership is still \nimportant. We are still the strongest voice for democracy. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me is supporting the National Endowment for \nDemocracy--one of our most important tools in supporting democracy \naround the world.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \npending amendment, which will restore $30 million of funding for the \nNational Endowment for Democracy.\n  Mr. President, unless we reverse the decision that has been made by \nthe Appropriations Committee, the Senate will be on record as \neliminating this unique, flexible, low-cost, public-private \npartnership, an important foreign policy instrument, an instrument that \nhas proven important today in furthering U.S. interests, as important \ntoday as it was in 1983 when established with the active support and \nleadership of President Ronald Reagan.\n  Mr. President, the Senate has debated the future of the National \nEndowment for Democracy virtually every year in recent years. Every \nyear, proponents of continuing the Endowment have prevailed, but the \nfight has taken a toll. NED's budget has been whittled down by almost \n15 percent over the last 3 years, and its authorization is now flat for \nthe next 2 years. Any further cuts will severely hamper NED's ability \nto carry out its important programs. That is why so many of us are here \ntoday concerned that its current budget be sustained at the requested \nlevel of $30 million.\n  Mr. President, although we once again are debating NED's future, this \nrecurring debate has been, and continues to be, more about our future \nand our view of the world than it does this one Federal initiative for \ndemocracy. It is also about how the American people view America's role \nin the world. In examining that world view, several fundamental \nquestions must be answered.\n  First and foremost is the question of whether it is in the interest \nof the United States of America to remain actively engaged in world \naffairs.\n  Second, is it in our interest to creatively promote peaceful \ndemocratic change? To put it another way, is it in our interest to stay \none step ahead of tomorrow's costly conflicts by promoting peaceful \ndemocratic change today?\n  Finally, does the National Endowment for Democracy make a positive \ncontribution to advancing these interests?\n  Mr. President, I submit that the answer to each of these questions is \nyes. I would briefly wish to cite two examples.\n  First, in our own hemisphere, the United States has had a long and, I \nsuggest, painful and destructive history of being involved in our \nhemisphere only when we faced an immediate security, political, or \neconomic crisis. Once the crisis passed, our interests waned and then \nevaporated.\n  Mr. President, in large part because of some of the things that the \nUnited States led in the last 50 years, we now have a period of \ndemocratic government within our hemisphere that we have never known \nsince Christopher Columbus discovered the new world. Those democracies, \nfrom Guatemala to Argentina, are new. They are enthusiastic. But they \nlack the kinds of deep roots that will assure their longevity. It is \nexactly nations such as that and building those roots that will sustain \ndemocracy that the National Endowment for Democracy has exhibited, and \nit is in exactly those circumstances within Latin America and the \nCaribbean that the endowment has played such an important role, and I \nsubmit will play an even more important role in the future.\n  Another prime example is China. Those who understand and care about \nthe need for long-term democratic change in China strongly support the \nNational Endowment for Democracy. That is because the National \nEndowment for Democracy is working with human rights activists to bring \nto life abuses by the current regime. The endowment is also creatively \nexploring openings at the local level to help officials establish \nindependent elections.\n  NED is on the ground working in China every day in ways that very \ndirectly further United States national interests. No other agency of \nthis Government is equipped to carry out the kind of innovative \ngrassroots work as is the National Endowment for Democracy.\n  If we are to successfully engage China over the long term, if we are \npositively to influence United States-China relations, if we are to \nreverse our past history and demonstrate a sustained commitment to \ndemocratic institutions within our nearest neighbors in the Western \nHemisphere, the National Endowment for Democracy must necessarily be an \nessential ingredient in that United States policy.\n  Indeed, the long-term impact we are confident NED to have in China is \non display today in Mexico, where the Endowment's support of the Civic \nAlliance, a coalition of non-governmental organizations in that \ncountry, paved the way for electoral reform that resulted in the freest \nelections in Mexico's history. The result has been a deepening of \ndemocracy, and a sense among the Mexican people that casting ballots \ncan produce positive change in their lives. The result is a government \nwhich is far more stable and responsive to the people's needs. The \nMexican people benefit, and so do we.\n  Mr. President, China and Mexico are only two examples of NED's work. \nIndeed, the Endowment is helping dissidents in over 90 countries, \nincluding dissidents who are fighting for democratic change in Cuba, \nBurma, Nigeria, Belarus, Serbia, and Sudan. NED is working to \nstrengthen democratic institutions in Russia, Ukraine, and South \nAfrica. This is vitally important work. And there are many informed \nobservers who see it the same way.\n  Former Secretaries of State Baker, Eagleburger, Haig, Kissinger, \nShultz, and Vance are on record in support of NED. According to them:\n\n       During this period of international change and uncertainty, \n     the work of the NED continues to be an important bipartisan \n     but non-government contributor to democratic reform and \n     freedom. We consider the non-governmental character of the \n     NED even more relevant today than it was at NED's founding * \n     * *\n\n  Former National Security Advisors Allen, Carlucci, Brzezinski, and \nScowcroft also are on record in support. They have stated that:\n\n       The endowment, a small bipartisan institution with its \n     roots in America's's private sector, operates in situations \n     where direct government involvement is not appropriate.\n       It is an exceptionally effective instrument in today's \n     climate for reaching dedicated groups seeking to counter \n     extreme nationalist and autocratic forces that are \n     responsible for so much conflict and instability.\n       Eliminating this program would be particularly unsettling \n     to our friends around the world, and could be interpreted as \n     sign of America's disengagement from the vital policy of \n     supporting democracy. The endowment remains a critical and \n     cost-effective investment in a more secure America.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous to have printed in the Record an \nexchange of correspondence I recently had with National Security \nAdvisor Sandy Berger. He responded in a July 21 letter reaffirming \nstrong administration support the NED and ``our opposition to any \neffort reduce or eliminate NED funding.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                        Washington, July 21, 1997.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Bob: Thank you for your letter of July 16 regarding \n     funding for the National Endowment for Democracy (NED).\n       I welcome the opportunity to reaffirm strong Administration \n     support for the NED and our opposition to any effort to \n     reduce or eliminate NED funding. As you correctly note, the \n     President is a dedicated supporter of the NED, as it has been \n     in the forefront of U.S. efforts to promote democracy, civil \n     society and the rule of law around the world. Moreover, it \n     has done so at very little cost to the American public, \n     leveraging modest resources with great effectiveness.\n       I should also note that the NED, established by President \n     Reagan and strongly supported by each of his successors, has \n     served as a model for democracy-promotion efforts by our \n     democratic friends and allies.\n       For all of these reasons, we enthusiastically endorse your \n     efforts to restore funding for the NED, and we are prepared \n     to work closely with you to ensure that objective.\n       Best regards.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Samuel R. Berger,\n\n         Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs.\n\n[[Page S8029]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 16, 1997.\n     Hon. Samuel R. Berger,\n     Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, The \n         White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Sandy: The Commerce-Justice-State Appropriation will \n     soon be debated on the Senate floor. As you may know, the \n     Appropriations Committee is recommending that all funding for \n     the National Endowment for Democracy be eliminated.\n       NED's numerous Senate supporters, including myself, regard \n     this as a serious mistake, since it would cripple the ability \n     of our country to assist the various democratic networks \n     abroad whose continued sustenance is so critical to our \n     national security.\n       The President has been a dedicated supporter of the \n     Endowment in the past. It would be helpful if he would commit \n     the Administration to reaffirming that support by backing the \n     efforts of the Endowment's friends in the Senate to restore \n     its funding.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Bob Graham,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like now to take this opportunity \nto clarify some misconceptions that have arisen regarding NED and its \nwork over the years. Two of those misconceptions are contained in the \nreport accompanying the bill we are now debating.\n  The report states that, because NED was created to support democratic \nmovements behind the Iron Curtain, it is no longer needed. Nothing \ncould be further from the truth. Indeed, NED was never intended to be a \ncold war institution.\n  In Ronald Reagan's speech that helped launch the Endowment, he \noffered the following vision of NED:\n\n       . . . To foster the infrastructure of democracy--the system \n     of a free press, unions, political parties, universities--\n     which allows a people to choose their own way, to develop \n     their own culture, to reconcile their own differences through \n     peaceful means.\n\n  He referred to the work of Western European parties assisting \ncounterpart institutions and of the foundation looking into ``how the \nUnited States can best contribute as a nation to the global campaign \nfor democracy now gathering force.''\n  It is true that the Endowment supported Solidarity and other \ndissidents behind the Iron Curtain.\n  But that represented a small percentage of its funding. In fact, in \nthe early years of the Endowment, approximately half of its funds went \nto support the growing democratic movements in Latin America.\n  This had nothing to do with the cold war and everything to do with \nthe reason NED was created and the reason it exists today--because \nAmerica believes that the spread of democracy is good for the people of \nthese countries, and ultimately, for the people of the United States as \nwell.\n  NED's work in the Middle East, in East Asia, in Central Asia, in \nAfrica, in Bosnia, in Mexico, demonstrates that in the post-cold-war \nworld, efforts to foster civil society are even more relevant today \nthan they were when the Endowment was created.\n  The report accompanying this bill goes on to state that NED was never \nintended to be a ``private-public partnership.'' According to the \nCongressional Research Service, which carefully researched NED's \nlegislative history, ``While NED was originally established as a \nprivate entity, private funding was not required. Neither the \ncongressional debate in 1983, nor the National Endowment for Democracy \nAct--the law establishing NED--indicates private source funding would \nbe required.''\n  It is true that NED does raise some funds in the private sector, \nprimarily to support its International Forum for Democratic Studies, \nwhich is a research center and clearinghouse for worldwide information \nabout democracy. In addition, NED has calculated that its funding \nleverages over 70 cents for every program dollar it grants.\n  The essential point, however, is that the founders of NED never \nimagined that this would be a privately funded effort. To the contrary, \nbecause NED serves the national interest, it is an entirely worthwhile \nexpenditure of the Federal Government.\n  Several other misperceptions have dominated this debate in the past. \nLet me address them as well.\n  Opponents have suggested that the Endowment duplicates those of the \nAgency for International Development. AID Administrator Brian Atwood \nreported to the House Committee on International Relations in March \n1996, following an extensive review of hundreds of programs funded by \nhis agency and those of the Endowment. His report stated:\n\n       We found that USAID and NED do not duplicate, but rather \n     complement each other's efforts.\n\n  In the same report, Atwood outlined a series of steps that AID and \nNED have taken together to make sure that this lack of duplication \ncontinues.\n  NED and its supporters also have been accused of keeping a GAO report \ncalling for a reassessment of NED's funding from being issued. This is \na nonissue originally raised in print by a long time NED opponent. The \nfacts are quite simple:\n  The General Accounting Office, after an exhaustive study of U.S. \nGovernment programs to promote democracy, concluded that there was no \nsignificant overlap between those funded by NED and official agencies.\n  Referring to the stops that have been taken between AID and NED to \nmake sure the lack of duplication between their programs continues, a \nGAO official wrote to House International Relations Chairman Gilman and \nRanking Member Hamilton that the Agency's concerns about potential \noverlap had been allayed.\n  Another charge frequently made against NED is its funding is used \ndisproportionately for travel. Some of the over 300 programs that are \nfunded annually by the Endowment involve the use of experts from the \nUnited States and abroad who travel pro bono basis to share their \nknowledge and experiences with grassroots Democrats.\n  Many of these trips are under adverse circumstances to places that \ncan hardly be regarded as vacation spots and the trips are not only \nworking trips but frequently quite rigorous for participants. The \namount of free time that is donated by these experts is rather \nsignificant in dollar terms.\n  Opponents also charge NED with funding meaningless conferences. NED \nfunds in fact are used to assist organizations working inside \ncountries. Occasionally NED funds gatherings of democrats in exile who \ncannot operate in their home countries. Countries such as China and \nCuba fall in this category.\n  An example of a conference pointed to as insignificant by some NED \ncritics is a meeting held in 1995 in Zagreb, Croatia. In fact this \nparticular conference brought together activists from all the countries \nof the former Yugoslavia at the height of the war to exchange \ninformation.\n  The meeting succeeded in matching funders and civic groups in the \nregion in desperate need of help. Apart from bringing together \ndemocrats in a war situation the meeting has led to a number of \nworthwhile projects in a region that desperately needs to build up its \ncivil society.\n  Mr. President, NED deserves our support. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport a restoration of this funding.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support for the \npending amendment. I have long been a supporter of the National \nEndowment for Democracy because I believe that it serves to promote \nU.S. interests by fostering democracy throughout the world.\n  NED was established by Congress in 1983 as a nonprofit, bipartisan \norganization designed to promote democratic values by encouraging the \ndevelopment of democracy in a manner consistent with U.S. interests, \nassisting pro-democracy groups abroad, and strengthening electoral \nprocesses and democratic institutions. NED accomplishes these goals by \nproviding funding to a wide variety of grantees that operate programs \nin more than 90 countries throughout the world.\n  Mr. President, many of my colleagues may be aware of the work that \nNED-funded grantees have done in Eastern Europe and the countries of \nthe former Soviet Union. These Newly Independent States have benefited \nimmensely from programs designed to help develop the rule of law, \ngrassroots campaigns, party organization, and private sector \nenterprise. And while the development of truly democratic institutions \nis a slow process, I believe that over the long run it remains in the \ninterest of the United States to continue our commitment to those who \nare struggling to build stable, democratic governments.\n  While NED's work in the newly independent states is commendable, of\n\n[[Page S8030]]\n\nequal importance--and often with less publicity--NED grantees are also \nhard at work in countries like Nigeria, Burma, Cuba, and Mongolia where \npro-democracy forces are most in need of assistance, and where the \nability of the United States to make a positive impact is at its \ngreatest.\n  Mr. President, even though in the past decade the world has witnessed \na remarkable transformation, and the forces of democracy are on an \nupswing throughout the world, it remains a fact that approximately two-\nfifths of the world's population continues to live under authoritarian \nrule. There clearly remains a need for continued vigilance and support \nof those groups still striving to achieve democratic reforms. While \nCongress may have created the National Endowment for Democracy during \nthe cold war, I firmly believe that fostering democracy remains as \nimportant today as it was 14 years ago.\n  Because of the continued need for U.S. assistance to pro-democracy \nforces, I was disappointed that the Senate subcommittee did not fund \nthe President's request of $30 million for NED. It is for this reason \nthat I fully support the amendment before the Senate that will fund the \nNational Endowment for Democracy for fiscal year 1998.\n  Mr. President, there is a reason that four former National Security \nAdvisers to the President have said that the elimination of NED funding \nwould signal America's disengagement from the vital policy of \nsupporting democracy. There is a reason that seven former Secretaries \nof State from both Republican and Democratic administrations have \nvoiced their belief that NED funding is as vital today as when the \nprogram was created. And finally, there is a reason that brave, pro-\ndemocracy activists like Harry Wu and Vaclav Havel tell us that NED \nfunding is essential to advancing the cause of democracy. Mr. \nPresident, the reason is that they, like many of my colleagues here \ntoday, realize that America must maintain its commitment to the ideals \nand principles of democracy.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to support the restoration of funding \nfor the National Endowment for Democracy in the Justice, State, \nCommerce appropriations bill. The amount is very modest--$30 million--\nand the same level of funding as the NED currently receives for this \nfiscal year.\n  What is the NED? It is a grant-making organization that is governed \nby an independent, nonpartisan board of directors. NED monies are \nutilized to fund the activities of the four independent institutes--the \nNational Democratic Institute, the International Republican Institute, \nthe Free Trade Union Institute, and Center for International Private \nEnterprise.\n  In addition to funding the programs of these institutes, NED also \nprovides grants directly to support democratic activist groups \nthroughout the world. This includes grass roots organizations in \nNigeria and Zaire, women's groups in moderate Islamic countries, civic \ngroups who worked to make the recently held Mexican elections open and \ntransparent, pro-democracy groups in Cuba, China and Burma. These are \njust a small handful of the activities funded by NED.\n  The endowment also sponsors the Journal of Democracy, a well known \nand highly regarded scholarly publication on global democracy issues. \nThe journal is part of the work of the International Forum for \nDemocratic Studies--NED's research center. In addition to the \npublication of the journal, the Forum holds important conferences on \nissues of particular relevance to democratic societies, such as civil-\nmilitary relations, economic reform, and the role of political parties.\n  In other words, NED has become an important focal point for \ndemocracy-promotion activities around the globe.\n  For those who say they don't know what NED or the grantee agencies \nhave been doing with the funds they receive, I would urge them to take \na long look at the annual report which NED issues every year. I have \nwith me the latest report for 1996--that report goes into great detail \nwhere the monies are being spent. It is my view that if my colleagues \nwould take a look at this publication they would be impressed with the \nextensive activities being undertaken with relatively small amounts of \nmoney.\n  Mr. President, I strongly agree with President Clinton's assessment \nof the NED. Earlier this year he said of the NED, ``through its \neveryday efforts, the Endowment provides renewed evidence of the \nuniversality of the democratic ideal and of the benefits to our Nation \nof our continued international engagement.''\n  I urge my colleagues to support the restoration of funding for the \nEndowment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment to \nrestore funding for the National Endowment for Democracy [NED].\n  Last month the Senate expressed its overwhelming support for the NED \nwhen it passed the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of \n1997--90 to 5. That legislation provided $30 million, full funding, for \nthe NED.\n  Even more recently we voted unanimously to congratulate Mexico on its \nelections. The NED provided critical support to the Civic Alliance in \nMexico, a nonprofit election monitoring and civic education group that \nplayed a key role in that success story.\n  When the Reagan administration proposed the NED, I thought it was a \nbad idea and voted against it. After seeing all of the good work they \nhave done and are doing, I have been converted to a supporter.\n  The NED continues to play a critical role in promoting democracy and \ndemocratic values, and is vital to U.S. national interests.\n  Mr. President, let me make this clear--NED is not a foreign aid \nprogram. This is because it builds self-sufficiency by working with \nindigenous groups that demonstrate a real commitment to democratic \nprinciples.\n  NED only receives $30 million, but is very cost-effective. It makes \nhundreds of grants annually in over 90 countries for civic education, \nmedia, human rights, and other organizations dedicated to supporting \nthose who desire democracy.\n  NED funds support political party training and the establishment of \nopposition newspapers, helping to promote an independent press. For \nexample, NED has done important work in China through its support of \nChinese human rights activists.\n  Another well-known example is Burma, where the NED has strongly \nsupported Aung San Suu Kyi and the pro-democracy movement there.\n  Still another important aspect of the NED is that it is rooted in the \nU.S. private sector, and operates in situations where direct government \ninvolvement is not appropriate.\n  It is particularly effective in reaching those groups seeking to \ncounter nationalist and autocratic forces that are responsible for so \nmuch conflict and instability.\n  The NED provides a successful and cost-effective mechanism for \nspreading our democratic values and enhancing American security.\n  This point was made today in a Wall Street Journal editorial that \nhighlights and praises the NED's effective and innovative approach to \ndemocracy promotion.\n  Elimination of this program could be interpreted as a sign of \nAmerica's disengagement from the vital policy of supporting democracy \naround the globe.\n  I urge my colleagues to continue to support this critical democracy-\nbuilding organization.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, once more we are engaging in the \nincreasingly repetitive argument over whether the U.S. Senate should \nsupport one of our country's most valuable tools of foreign policy--the \nNational Endowment for Democracy. The Senate subcommittee zeroed out \nthe administration request for $30 million for the Endowment, although \nthe House of Representatives granted it full funding. Today, Senators \nLugar and others are offering an amendment that will restore the \nSenate's support for full funding for the National Endowment for \nDemocracy (NED), and I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I've been in this body for the entire history of the \nNational Endowment for Democracy, and I make no reservations about my \nwholehearted support for this organization. My colleagues know I was an \noriginal supporter of the NED, and I am a stronger supporter today than \nI was then.\n  President Reagan clearly summarized the NED's mission when he stated \nat its inception:\n\n\n[[Page S8031]]\n\n\n       The objective I propose is quite simple to state: to foster \n     the infrastructure of democracy--the system of a free press, \n     unions, political parties, universities--which allows a \n     people to choose their own way, to develop their own culture, \n     to reconcile their own differences through peaceful means.\n\n  I believe that mission statement is as relevant to our goals today as \nit was in 1982, when the National Endowment for Democracy was founded. \nAnd I find it illogical and disingenuous that some argue that the \nEndowment is a cold war institution which, because we have won the cold \nwar, is no longer relevant. Many appear to agree with me. In a \nSeptember 1995 letter to our congressional leadership, seven former \nSecretaries of State said:\n\n       During this period of international change and uncertainty, \n     the work of the NED continues to be an important bipartisan \n     but non-governmental contributor to democratic reform and \n     freedom.\n\n  It appears that a few still believe, illogically, that because the \nNED was engaged in fighting for democracy during the cold war, it is no \nlonger relevant. This reasoning is unsound, based on facts of the past, \nand realities of the present.\n  First, the past. The NED did have some high-profile involvement \nwith organizations such as Solidarity, which were critical in loosening \nMoscow's grip on its captive nations. I applaud the NED for that, as I \napplaud the many other organizations, such as the International Labor \nOffice and other great anti-communists such as Irving Brown, who worked \nwith us to undermine Soviet totalitarian control. But anyone who \nbelieves that the cold war was the central or only focus of the NED may \nnot have all the facts.\n\n  It is a fact, for example, that during the early days of the National \nEndowment for Democracy, approximately half of NED's funds were \ndirected toward Latin America. The 1980's, you will recall, Mr. \nPresident, was the decade when democracy swept across the Latin \nAmerican continent. The people of Latin America, and their brave \ndemocratic leaders, deserve the credit for this. But it was the wisdom \nof U.S. foreign policy--and the participation from the NED--that \nprovided important diplomatic and practical support.\n  Second, the present. The obvious fact is, Mr. President, that support \nfor democracy remains a necessary goal of U.S. foreign policy. Students \nof history know that democracies are less likely to try to settle their \ninternal and external conflicts with a resort to violence. Observers of \ncurrent affairs recognize that, while democracy continues to spread, \nmany parts of the world are in desperate need for further democratic \ndevelopment. It is no coincidence indeed that many of these areas are \nareas where U.S. foreign policy goals are and will be challenged.\n  To believe that supporting democracy was a need solely of the cold \nwar is a notion that ignores the basic reality that the world remains \nfull of nations where democracy needs support. And where democracy \nadvances, the risk of conflict that could require a U.S. response \ndeclines.\n  That is why a number of my friends--Jack Kemp, Steve Forbes, Bill \nBennett, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Vin Weber, and Lamar Alexander--have \ncirculated a letter from their organization, Empower America, which I \nwould like to quote:\n\n       NED helps brave people around the world who are engaged in \n     difficult struggles for freedom. These are America's natural \n     friends. Resisting the enemies of freedom, they need our \n     continual solidarity.\n       A case in point is China, where the Endowment supports \n     various pro-democracy networks as well as the democracy \n     movements in Tibet and Hong Kong . . .\n       China is but one example of how NED, which works in over 90 \n     countries, is as relevant to the post-Cold War world as it \n     was in the struggle against Soviet totalitarianism. Examples \n     could be cited from other difficult situations, from Burma to \n     Cuba, from the Balkans to the Middle East. The kind of \n     political assistance NED provides is not foreign aid. NED is \n     more than a program; it is an instrument for transmitting in \n     a peaceful way American democratic values to a world that \n     looks to us to maintain our leadership role.\n       NED works to expand human freedom and helps people help \n     themselves. It promotes American values and interests. It is \n     realistic and idealistic at the same time. It \n     internationalist in the best sense of that term. It is truly \n     our kind of program.\n\n  Mr. President, among my friends at Empower America, you will not find \none person who believes the United States should be the world's \npoliceman. Most of these individuals are very skeptical--like me--about \nsome of this country's recent unilateral as well as multilateral \ndeployments.\n  But none of these individuals believes that the $30 million spent on \nthe National Endowment for Democracy is anything but a completely \nworthwhile expenditure that supports our national interests by \nsupporting the spread of democracy around the world.\n  The cold war is over, Mr. President, and we won it. We won it with a \nstrong defense posture, with a policy of engagement in Latin America, \nAfghanistan, and central Europe. And we won it by standing with \ndemocrats around the world. Despite the end of the cold war, there are \nmany democratic movements that need our support. As the Empower America \nletter said: ``. . . the brave people around the world who are engaged \nin difficult struggles for freedom . . . these are America's natural \nfriends.''\n  I wish that we could do more for these friends of America, Mr. \nPresident. But the reality of foreign affairs has always been limited \nby the need to prioritize limited resources. In my view, an expenditure \nof $30 million to support the many activities of the NED throughout the \nworld may be one of the most cost-effective investments we make in the \nsupport of American's interests overseas.\n  The critics of the NED should review the Endowment's materials. For \nexample, this body has spent a large amount of time debating how we \nshould relate to the rising power of authoritarian China. While we \ndebate the value of sanctions or engagement, who in this body suggests \nthat the support for local elections in China that is conducted by NED \nwith the International Republican Institute is anything but an \nenormously positive development? Who suggests that NED-supported \nChinese activists who monitor and report on the repression of \ndissidents must not be continued--so that lawmakers around the world \ncan know the truth when we debate complicated issues of engaging China? \nWho believes that Harry Wu's research foundation--dedicated to \nmonitoring the abhorrent use of prison labor--should not be supported, \nso that we know how China abuses our trade relations?\n  Who believes, Mr. President, that the many programs promoting open \npress, reasoned democratic debate and the rule of law that NED supports \nthroughout the Arab world are not supporting America's goals in that \nregion? Can anyone who is aware of America's uncertain relations with \nthe Islamic world declare that it is not in our interest to promote \ndemocratic values there?\n\n  Mr. President, I've cited a few examples and endorsements from \nprominent U.S. foreign policymakers--Republican and Democrat--but I'd \nlike to close my remarks by quoting Martin Lee, who my colleagues \nsurely recognize as Hong Kong's voice of democracy. As we know, the \nreversion to the People's Republic of China opens a new--and \nuncertain--page in the recent history of democracy in Hong Kong.\n  Martin Lee recently wrote a letter to my colleague, Senator Mack. \nMembers of this body know that Senator Mack has devoted a large amount \nof his time to the difficult process of Hong Kong's reversion, and he \nis one of the leaders who will increase his attentions to the former \nBritish colony now that July 1 has past. Martin Lee wrote:\n\n       In Hong Kong and elsewhere in Asia and around the world, \n     the struggle to preserve democracy, political freedom and the \n     rule of law is far from being won. But by supporting key \n     human rights organizations which work for development of \n     democracy and the preservation of the rule of law and human \n     rights in Hong Kong, the Endowment's work in Hong Kong has \n     had profound effect at a critical time. During what I realize \n     is a time of shrinking budgets, I cannot think of better \n     value for money than the National Endowment for Democracy.\n\n  Mr. President, Martin Lee is correct: ``The struggle to preserve \ndemocracy, political freedom and the rule of law is far from being \nwon.'' What a sorry signal the United States would be giving democrats \nstruggling around the world if we ended our support for the National \nEndowment for Democracy. What a shortsighted notion it would be to save \n$30 million by abandoning our support for an organization that promotes \nour political values around the world.\n  I urge my colleagues to support full funding for the National \nEndowment for Democracy.\n\n[[Page S8032]]\n\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask that the pending amendment be \nset aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield the floor, Mr. President, to the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator can't yield the floor. But I will \nrecognize the Senator from Maryland.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in strong support for the \namendment now pending. The National Endowment for Democracy has done \nsome extremely effective work around the world in strengthening and \nassisting in the development of democratic institutions and protecting \nindividual rights and freedoms. Endowment programs have assisted \ngrassroots organizations and individuals in more than 90 countries \nacross the globe.\n  A great number of distinguished individuals have walked through the \nHalls of the Capitol over the years whom we have recognized as fighters \nfor human rights, freedom, and democracy. They are leaders from abroad \nwho have come to visit the U.S. Congress as a sign of their respect for \nAmerican democracy. They have led the way toward democracy and human \nrights, and freedom in their own countries. In expressing their support \nfor the National Endowment for Democracy, they have underscored the \ncritical assistance that they have received from it, which made it \npossible for them to pursue democratic efforts in their own countries.\n  The National Endowment for Democracy has enjoyed broad bipartisan \nsupport since it was established in 1983 under the Presidency of Ronald \nReagan. Seven former Secretaries of State--James Baker, Lawrence \nEagleburger, Alexander Haig, Henry Kissinger, Edmund Muskie, George \nShultz, and Cyrus Vance--wrote to the leadership of the Congress in \n1995 to express their support for continuing funding of the National \nEndowment for Democracy. Their letter and stated, and I quote:\n\n       During this period of international change and uncertainty, \n     the work of the NED continues to be an important bipartisan \n     but nongovernmental contributor to democratic reform and \n     freedom. We consider the nongovernmental character of the NED \n     even more relevant today than it was at NED's founding 12 \n     years ago.\n\n  The NED serves an important role because of the fact that it can \noperate as a nongovernmental entity. It can support nongovernmental \norganizations which, in turn, provide opportunities that would not \notherwise be available if these activities were undertaken by a \ngovernment or governmental agency. This is an extremely important \ndimension to the work of the National Endowment for Democracy.\n  Former national security advisers of previous administrations and the \nPresident's current Adviser for National Security Affairs, Sandy \nBerger, have expressed their strong support for the NED. Mr. Berger \nnoted in his letter to Members of Congress this week:\n\n       I welcome the opportunity to reaffirm strong administration \n     support for the NED and our opposition to any effort to \n     reduce or eliminate NED funding . . . The President is a \n     dedicated supporter of the NED, as it has been in the \n     forefront of U.S. efforts to promote democracy, civil society \n     and the rule of law around the world. Moreover, it has done \n     so at very little cost to the American public, leveraging \n     modest resources with great effectiveness.\n\n  The sweeping and profound changes resulting from the end of the cold \nwar provide ample reason for why we continue to need institutions like \nthe NED, which can operate in a cost-effective manner and at the same \ntime promote our interests and values. Many of the new democracies that \nhave emerged from the implosion of the Soviet Union and the collapse of \nthe Iron Curtain have benefited from the assistance NED and its \ngrantees have provided. Those who paved the way for freedom and \ndemocracy in their own countries have consistently testified as to the \nimportance of NED support to the success of their efforts.\n  In fact, President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic stated that \n``the National Democratic Institute was one of the first supporting \nactors in the democratic revolution in our country.''\n  And others have made similar statements with respect to the \nactivities of the two party organizations, the business groups, and the \nlabor groups that are the core grantees of NED.\n  This is a program that is working. It is producing significant \nresults around the world.\n  I strongly support this amendment, and urge my colleagues to adopt \nit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, first of all, I would like to say to my \nvery dear friend, Senator Feinstein from California, who is anxiously \nawaiting the floor so she can get into the ninth circuit debate, that I \nam going to object to moving to that amendment until this amendment is \ndisposed of.\n  Let me also say that I am prepared to enter into a time agreement, \nbut not yet.\n  Let me start off by saying that Rasputin was a piker compared to the \nNational Endowment for Democracy. It took him a long time to die, and \nit has just taken forever for this boondoggle to die.\n  I have heard so may people in this body lament the size of \nGovernment, the waste of Government, the terribleness of Government, \nand here is $30 million of wasteful Government spending. There was \nactually an effort to get NED's appropriation up to $50 million 3 years \nago.\n  I can tell you that, in this Senator's opinion, the National \nEndowment for Democracy is without question the biggest waste of money \nI can think of next to the space station. That is saying something.\n  It is a cold war relic. Everybody in this body knows that the \nNational Endowment for Democracy was started in 1983 as an answer to \ncommunism in the world. We were not only spending $250 to $300 billion \na year on defense at that point--that was not enough to contain \ncommunism around the world--we decided to add $18 million to bring \ndemocracy to the world. We started this program with $18 million in \n1983, and a year after that, it soared up to about $23 million; the \nyear after that, $27 million, then $35 million. Then, finally, I was \nable to get it back to $30 million 2 years ago. And this year, in this \nbill, thanks to the very good judgment of our chairman of this \nsubcommittee, Senator Gregg of New Hampshire, it was sacked as it \nrichly deserved.\n  Mr. President, we have been holding hearings in the Governmental \nAffairs Committee. And the headlines in the paper since January have \nbeen in anticipation of those hearings about foreign influence in \nAmerican elections. I want to say that if China had had any judgment at \nall they would have consulted with the NED before they started trying \nto influence American elections.\n  The National Endowment for Democracy has as good a record of meddling \nin foreign elections as any organization the Earth has ever known. They \ntried to clean it up a little bit. They used to be very overt, and made \nno bones about who they were giving money to. But they are still giving \nout money to influence foreign elections.\n  One of the things that is the most intriguing of all is: Who do they \ngive this $30 million to?\n  At the expense of sounding terribly arrogant, I would just like to \nsay that on the debate on the space station which occurred day before \nyesterday, I daresay if that debate were held on national television \nbefore an American audience of every voter in America, the space \nstation would be dead, dead, dead, at this moment, by an overwhelming \nvote. But, unhappily, all the people who might be watching that \ntelecast wouldn't be interested in those few jobs that NASA has put in \ntheir State.\n  But now when it comes to boondoggles and giving away money, I invite \nmy colleagues' attention to this:\n\n[[Page S8033]]\n\n What happens to this $30 million? It took me 2 or 3 years for the \nrealization really to soak in that this actually is the case.\n  Out of the $30 million, first of all, 15 percent of it, 15 percent of \nit, or $4.5 million, goes for NED Administration. And if you look at \nthe way the money is spent, you will find a lot of it going for first \nclass airfare to transport people all over the world, people who every \nyear will write letters to the people who are engaged in this debate. \nThey will write letters about what a wonderful program NED is.\n  You think of it. If a food stamp program had a 15 percent \nadministrative cost, we would kill it dead. We would not tolerate that \nfor a moment. But we are willing to put aside $4.5 million, 15 percent \nof this $30 million, and allow NED to use that for administrative \nexpense.\n  But that is not the worst of it. We give the money out as follows. \nListen to this, colleagues. CIPE--that's a nice acronym, isn't it. CIPE \ngets 13.75 percent of the money--$4.125 million. Who is CIPE? I bet you \nnever heard of them. CIPE stands for Center for International Private \nEnterprise, but they are really the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. This is a \nlittle offspring of the chamber of commerce, CIPE. We give them a neat \n$4,125,000 out of this $30 million.\n  Let me ask you this: how much of that do you think they spend on \nadministration? Bear in mind, 15 percent comes off the top for NED \nadministration. Then you give the chamber of commerce $4.125 million, \nand what do you think their administrative expense is?\n  Then to even things up, we give an organization called FTUI, to make \nthings even we give them 13.75 percent, also $4,125,000, the same \namount we give the chamber of commerce. Who is FTUI? The Free Trade \nUnion Institute. Why, that's the AFL-CIO. You cannot give money to the \nchamber of commerce unless you are willing to balance it out and give \nthe AFL-CIO another $4,125,000. And what do you think their \nadministrative expense is? Lord only knows. I cannot find out.\n  So you have the administrative expense of the chamber; you have the \nadministrative expense of the AFL-CIO; you have the 15 percent for NED \nright off the top.\n  We are not finished. Now we go to the IRI. Whoever heard of the IRI? \nNow, this is going to be hard for you to believe. I will tell you who \nthe IRI is. That is the International Republican Institute--the \nRepublican Party. Can you believe this, another 13.75 percent, \n$4,125,000. We have to be evenhanded. We have to give the chamber \n$4.125 million, have to give the AFL-CIO $4.125 million, have to give \nthe Republican Party $4.125 million.\n  And then we get down to the fourth organization, NDI. Who do you \nthink NDI is? Why, you guessed it. It is the National Democratic \nInstitute--the Democratic Party. And we are going to give them 13.75 \npercent. They get $4,125,000. I will say one thing. What do you think \nthe administrative expense is for all those four organizations on top \nof the 15 percent administrative expense of NED? Who knows? The \nNational Endowment for Democracy is an egalitarian group; they treat \neverybody the same. But some are more equal than others.\n  Here is the portion for everybody else. After you get through giving \nit out most of the money to all these groups who we know will send \nmembers to the Senate every year to tell us how wonderful NED is so we \nwill give them another $30 million the next year after they \nevenhandedly give everybody $4.125 million in exchange for writing \nSenators here saying how wonderful it is, they have $9 million left. \nThat's what everybody else gets.\n  Do you know what that amounts to? It comes to an average of $41,096 \nfor all the grantees who are not part of the chamber of commerce, the \nAFL-CIO, the Democratic Party or the Republican Party. Everybody else, \nthe other grantees--there are 218 of them for 1996, 218 grants made \nwith the remaining $9 million, gets an average of $41,096. Now, ain't \nthat something--218 grants. When you get past the big boys, the \nRepublicans, Democrats, labor and the chamber, you have 218 grants, \n$41,096 each. What are they going to do with that? That will not even \nbuy enough first class air tickets to get to the election in Cambodia \nor wherever. And what is the administrative expense for those 218 \ngrantees? You talk about money well spent and saving the world through \ndemocracy.\n\n  Mr. President, we spend on the Agency for International Development \nabout $4 billion a year. And did you know that I am a great champion of \nthat program? And do you know what that is for? That is to help \ncountries help themselves. That is to help them generate electricity so \nthey can develop. That is to teach them how to plant crops so they can \nfeed themselves. And it is also designed to make those people feel \nkindly toward the greatest democracy of all, the United States of \nAmerica. And about $450 million of AID's budget is for democracy-\nbuilding projects.\n  And then there is Public Law 480, popularly known as Food for Peace--\nover $1 billion a year. Do you know who favors that? The Senator from \nArkansas. We help feed people who cannot feed themselves. Mr. \nPresident, Public Law 480 has been around as long or longer than any \nMember of the Senate, with a couple of exceptions, and it is designed \nto help people keep from starving.\n  Do you know what else it is designed to do? It is designed to help \nthem feel kindly toward the United States, that great citadel of \ndemocracy.\n  Then, Mr. President, there is that $13 to $14 billion a year we spend \non that terrible thing that the American people have such \nmisconceptions about called foreign aid. And you know something else? I \nvote for that. I vote for foreign aid. Never made any bones about it. \nNo. 1, it helps farmers because that money also buys food. It helps \nindustry because people buy American products with the aid we give \nthem. It is money well spent.\n  Do you know what else we expect to get out of it? We expect people to \nwant to be like us. We expect them to want to be democratic. We expect \nthem to want to be free and enjoy the same kinds of freedoms we enjoy \nhere in the United States.\n  I have just finished listing for you all those billions of dollars we \nspend for what? To try to build democracy around the world. What good \ndo you think this $30 million will do in changing China from a \nCommunist nation to a free democracy? None. It is utter waste, $30 \npaltry million dollars that ought to be saved. It is nothing.\n  You have the Voice of America. You have these radio programs to \ninfluence the rest of the world about the joys of democracy and how \ngreat the United States is. And $450 million for the Agency for \nInternational Development is for democracy building. This is nothing in \nthe world, but in 1983, when Ronald Reagan was President and everybody \nthought the Communists were going to come up the Potomac River and get \nus any minute, we thought, well, we will just dump a little more money \ninto this democracy-building business.\n  You know something else. It was never intended--I want everybody to \nunderstand this. It was never intended that the National Endowment for \nDemocracy would be a federally funded agency. We started it off with \n$18 million with the clear understanding that within a short period of \ntime they were going to have to stand on their own feet with private \ncontributions. We never intended for that to be another perpetual \nGovernment program. And so last year, 1996, do you know what their \nreport shows? Out of $30 million, they collected from the private \nsector $541,000. And if I am not mistaken that is their high watermark.\n  It is just like so many other Federal programs. It is a program that \nbecomes self-perpetuating because a lot of people find it to their \nadvantage. It is difficult when you think about how I was trying to \nsave $100 billion, 2 days ago, on the space station. Here I find myself \njust as exercised, just as exercised about $30 million because it \ndoesn't really matter. It is money that ought not to be spent. The \ntaxpayers have a right to expect more of us. Can you imagine, Mr. \nPresident, can you imagine members of the AFL-CIO and the Chamber of \nCommerce sitting around the table with some people from a foreign \ncountry and trying to explain the joys of democracy, the Chamber member \nrepresenting what democracy means to him, the head of the labor union \ntelling what democracy means to him.\n\n[[Page S8034]]\n\n  Why, if those people on the other side were not confused beforehand--\n--\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. GREGG. I was wondering if the Senator would be willing to enter \ninto a time agreement so that we could move on with the bill. The \nSenator mentioned that after he had spoken for a while he might be \nwilling to consider that. He has spoken now for approximately 40 \nminutes and the other side has taken approximately the same amount of \ntime.\n  I was wondering if we could enter an agreement which would limit \ndebate to an additional hour with the time equally divided between the \nproponents and the opponents and have a vote here at 4:30.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me say to my distinguished chairman, \nof course, I sit on this subcommittee and he is doing an excellent job. \nOne of the greatest day's work he ever did in his life was when he \ntorpedoed NED in the bill. But let me say, to accommodate the chairman, \nI will be delighted to agree to 1 hour equally divided, 30 minutes on a \nside, with a vote to occur at 4:30.\n  Mr. GREGG. If there is no objection from the other side, I would ask \nunanimous consent that the vote on the pending amendment be at 4:30, \nwith the hour equally divided.\n  I would ask, additionally, after the vote on the second-degree \namendment offered by Senator McConnell, if the next matter before the \nbody could be the matter of the ninth circuit and the amendment of the \nSenator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would ask in that unanimous-consent agreement I be \nallowed 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. If I may ask----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. There is objection--reserving the right to object, is \nthe request of the Senator from New Hampshire on the McConnell \namendment or on the Lugar amendment?\n  Mr. GREGG. I believe the pending amendment is the second-degree. \nWhatever amendment is presently pending would be the intention of the \nSenator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The current amendment which is pending is \nAmendment 982 offered by the Senator from Kentucky, [Mr. McConnell].\n  Mr. GREGG. And the yeas and nays have been asked on that, is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. And the Senator from Arizona is asking for 10 minutes. I \nwould suggest that neither myself nor the Senator from South Carolina, \nboth of whom are involved in this issue, have had an opportunity to \nspeak. So we may have to add a little bit more time. Why don't we add \nan additional--have the vote be at quarter of 5, add an additional 15 \nminutes with the time, an hour and 15 minutes equally divided, and 10 \nminutes to the Senator from Arizona. Is that acceptable?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have been on the floor for the \nsubstantial period of this debate. It is my intention to speak on this \nas well. I have no objection to a time agreement provided there is \nsufficient time.\n  Mr. GREGG. How much time would the Senator need?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, 10 or 15 minutes. I guess I would like 15 \nminutes. I may not use all of it, but I have waited for some while, and \nI intend to speak in support of it.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from North Dakota would like 15 minutes, the \nSenator from Arizona--does the Senator rise in support or opposition to \nthe amendment?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I rise in support of the Lugar amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, I represent we will get the Senator his time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, it would be my intention at the \nconclusion of that time to move to table the Lugar amendment. Of \ncourse, if that would prevail, it would take the McConnell amendment \nwith it. When we talk about voting at 4:30, I want to reserve the right \nto make that motion to table at the expiration of that period of time. \nSo the unanimous-consent agreement does not necessarily pertain to the \nMcConnell amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, or I will ask \nunanimous consent as a part of my assent to the idea before us, that I \nhave the right to withdraw my amendment, and I would say, for clarity \nof all sides, my intent would be to send an amendment to the desk \npromptly thereafter. I simply want to make certain that all sides know \nthis, so there is not any misunderstanding. But I reserve the right to \nobject until I am certain I could withdraw my amendment and send an \namendment to the desk.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I withdraw my request, and we will just \nproceed here and see what happens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas retains the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment that \nis pending and in support of the underlying bill, obviously. I think \nthe Senator from Arkansas had certainly outlined rather effectively the \nproblems with NED, the expense of this program, and the fact that the \nprogram, for all intents and purposes, involves a passing of Federal \ntax dollars, hard-earned tax dollars, on to a number of groups for the \npurposes of exercises which are of questionable value in the post-cold-\nwar period: the Democratic National Committee, Republican National \nCommittee, the AFL-CIO, and the Chamber of Commerce being the primary \nbeneficiaries of this fund.\n  I call this the club fund. You know, here in Washington there are a \nlot of folks who are sort of part of a club. The city has a bit of a \nclubby atmosphere. It is a you-scratch-my-back-and-I-scratch-your-back \nclub. This is sort of one of the funding mechanisms for the club. I am \nnot too surprised that some community of the press supports the \nexercise because the club, regrettably, involves some of the press, \ntoo. But, as a practical matter, there is very little substance done \nhere.\n  Let's take China, for example. I suppose if there is an example of a \nnation where we have concerns about democracy and its impact on our \nfuture as a country, China is probably it. How valuable is NED in \nrelationship to China? Well, last year NED sent a lot of people over \nthere. A lot of people took airline flights over there. There were a \nlot of good trips, I am sure, to China. China is a nice place to visit. \nI am absolutely sure of that. A lot of people had an opportunity to go \nthere, people who were members of the Republican National Committee, \nDemocratic National Committee, AFL-CIO activists, Chamber of Commerce \nactivists, people who are friends--a lot of people who were friends of \nmembers of these different organizations went on trips. All of them \nwent to China for a variety of meetings, and NED committed $2 million \nfor various programs. They had about, I think, about 20 or 30 different \nmeetings in China to tell China how to become a democracy; $20 million \nfor 1 billion people. That works out to about 2 cents a person. I think \nthey must have distributed toothpicks that said ``vote'' on them for 2 \ncents a person.\n\n  The fact is, it had absolutely no impact. All it did was represent a \nnice trip for a bunch of folks from the United States who probably \nlooked forward to going to China and meeting some folks in China.\n  The inverse, of course, is that when China tried to influence our \nelections, I\n\n[[Page S8035]]\n\nthink we generated a fair amount of outrage here in the United States \nabout that. We are still looking for Charlie Trie. Maybe he is working \nfor NED in China now. The fact is, the influence of elections in the \nUnited States by a foreign country tends to really antagonize a few \npeople--as it should, in the post-cold-war period. And vice versa. You \nknow? Vice versa.\n  So what's the purpose of NED? The purpose of NED is to, for the most \npart, be a nice gathering of folks who find it is a very effective way \nto fund various trips, various get-togethers around the globe. What \ndoes this amendment suggest we do to pay for these trips, to pay for \nthis club activity? What is the suggestion of the way they are going to \nfund this? They are going to take the money out of the State Department \ncapital account.\n  Yes, the White House did not ask for as much money in the capital \naccount as we put into it, because the White House wanted to spend the \nmoney on the United Nations and on international operations, \ninternational organizations. So they raided that fund for that account. \nThat is a little more legitimate than NED but not a whole lot more \nlegitimate than NED when you are talking about the capital account of \nthe State Department.\n  I submit to the people who are supporting this amendment that maybe \nthey should read a few of the reports from the State Department about \nthe present status of the State Department's capital situation. Maybe \nthe people who offered this amendment would like to call up the United \nStates on a dial telephone from Lagos. Maybe the people who offered \nthis amendment would like to be working on a Wang computer that cannot \ncommunicate with any other computer in the United States. That is what \nwe subject our people to at the State Department.\n  The present infrastructure of the State Department is a disaster. \nThey can't call home. And the practical effect of this amendment is \nthat a lot of them aren't going to be able to call home. Or maybe when \nyou have a constituent who has a family member who has run into a \nserious problem in one of these Third World nations and you are out \ntrying to help your constituent out, you are going to be really upset \nthat the State Department can't communicate with its people in the \nfield effectively because 82 percent of the State Department radio \nequipment, 55 percent of their computer equipment, and 40 percent of \ntheir telephone equipment is totally obsolete.\n  So what does this amendment suggest? It suggests we keep it obsolete \nso we can fund a bunch of folks at the Republican National Committee, \nDemocratic National Committee, the AFL-CIO, and the Chamber of \nCommerce--who happen to have the best computer equipment in the world, \nthe best communication equipment in the world--so we can fund them for \ntheir trips. What an absolute outrage.\n  I cannot believe that we would consider doing this to the people who \nwork at the State Department. It is an absolute affront. This is \nimportant. Yes, somebody said, this is serious business. You are darned \nright this is serious business. This is very serious business. You go \nout to these embassies in some of these Third World countries and you \nsee what we subject our people to, and it is not right. They take their \nfamilies along with them. They take their families along with them, and \nthey get into some of these countries where Americans aren't all that \npopular, and their families are driving to work some morning, or \ndriving to school, and their lives are threatened and they have no \nsecure vehicles to travel in because we can't fund it--because we can't \nfund it. But we can fund a first-class airline ticket to China for \nsomebody here in the United States to go to a meeting to talk about \nstuff and come back and have a good time on the trip. But we can't fund \nthe protection of an American family serving overseas. It's really \nincredible.\n\n  I heard somebody on this floor citing an editorial from the Wall \nStreet Journal, or some commentary in the Wall Street Journal. You tell \nme the last time a reporter at the Wall Street Journal used a Wang \ncomputer to file their story. You tell me when that happened. Wang was \na great company. It started right down the road from where I live. We \nwere very sad to see it go by the way. The fact is that it did. Yet we \nstill ask our people in the field to use Wang computers.\n  This amendment takes from the capacity of the guys and women who are \nin the field doing the job of presenting American policy, it takes out \nof their hands the capacity to do their job and gives it to a bunch of \nfolks who may be well intentioned but who do not accomplish a whole \nlot.\n  I just find it unbelievable that the account into which you would dip \nto pay for the NED is the account which is absolutely critical to \nupgrading the State Department and giving our people in the field an \nadequate opportunity to represent us. But that is the amendment, and I \nlook forward to this vote with some enthusiasm because this is going to \nbe a real test of who really cares about the future of our State \nDepartment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, you know now why, in my opening \nstatement on this particular measure, I said I was so enthused about \nworking with the distinguished chairman, the Senator from New \nHampshire--he laid it on the line. Last December we had a NATO \nconference in Paris whereby we elected the distinguished Senator from \nDelaware the president of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \nCouncil. Senator Roth is now the president.\n  Pamela Harriman, the distinguished Ambassador, was there, and she \nknew that I was ranking member and had been the chairman. The word had \ngotten around of our attempt to try to bring the State Department from \nthe Third World into the first world. I am aghast here that those who \nchaired foreign relations would put in such an amendment, to tell you \nthe truth. I feel just as strongly as the Senator from New Hampshire. \nBecause Pamela Harriman came to me and said, ``Can I meet you in the \nmorning?'' Then we met for the entire morning. We spent the morning \ntogether.\n  Exactly what the Senator from New Hampshire said was pointed out. \nAlthough the Embassy in Paris was nice, their equipment was outdated. \nTheir computers were totally obsolete. They couldn't even get \nreplacement parts for it. Their communications had broken down. They \nhad a premier facility, an embassy, with hundreds of Americans coming \nin daily--I don't know how you handle a post of that size--but I \nwouldn't even volunteer for it. It wouldn't be an honor; it would \nreally be a drag, because trying to keep up with national policy while \ndealing with the visiting firemen and repairmen and all the other \nproblems, the problems that ensue in a wonderful city like Paris. It is \nreally hard work--she was doing an outstanding job. I said to her--the \nAssistant Secretary, Dick Moose, who used to head up our Foreign \nRelations Committee, and I have been trying to increase funding for the \ncapital account to modernize telecommunications, to modernize \ncomputerization and other equipment in hopes of doing all the good \nthings that the distinguished Senator from Kentucky says that NED does.\n  Let's assume it is true, and I can tell you, I opposed this in the \nvery beginning and then finally said, ``I'm wasting my breath.'' The \none time I actually supported it was when the current Secretary of \nState, the distinguished Secretary Albright, came to me and said,\n\n       We've got an election in Budapest, Hungary, and we can buy \n     some old printing presses out in Indiana and print up voting \n     bills to be handed out and ballots to help conduct an \n     election.\n\n  Now everyone is bothered about foreign governments trying to \ninfluence our elections? Heavens above, the other day we had, I think, \n99 votes commending Mexico on its elections because it was the first \ntime the United States stayed out.\n  We have been funding activities through Wall Street or otherwise down \nthere with the PRI. That is a big financial fix. Paying off the Mexican \ndebt was just a refinancing. Nothing went to the Mexican people. It all \nwent back up to the banks on Wall Street. It is time we sober up and \nunderstand. My colleagues should get the American Chamber of Commerce \nreport in Mexico City 60 days ago and see what it says: Unemployment is \ndown, the economy is down and the forecast is no recovery for several \nyears to come. NAFTA\n\n[[Page S8036]]\n\nhasn't worked. It has worked for the financial crowd, and it has worked \nfor those who want to export the industrial backbone of America.\n  I reviewed, as a member of the Hoover Commission in the fifties, the \nCentral Intelligence Agency. That was our primary function. I can see \nSonny Purfoy in the Guatemala election. I can see him in the Greek \nelection. His job was to run elections the world around.\n  So the Chinese learned to do a little bit of that, and now we are \ngoing to have a big Federal program and spend millions of dollars, all \nto get on national TV to express our horror and surprise. Mature \nindividuals ought to quit acting like children, and let's move on and \nlet's get the work of the Government done. Now that is what I want to \nspeak about, the work of the Government, namely the State Department.\n  Assume everything said by the distinguished Senator from Indiana, \neverything said by the distinguished Senator from Kentucky is \nabsolutely true and ought to be done without apology by the Department \nof State. What is wrong with that? What is wrong is under communism, we \nsaid, ``Well, we couldn't do that.'' We always apologized because of \nour democracy and our freedom and our individual rights.\n  The Department of State ought to be around as the foremost lead \norganization, not the Department of Defense, now with the fall of the \nwall. We ought to be selling democracy. To Secretary Christopher's \ncredit, he finally got them doing business.\n  I started back 37 years ago as Governor of South Carolina. I went \ndown in Rio de Janeiro and, like the distinguished Senator from North \nCarolina, Chairman Helms, I thought of them in that same vein. Why? \nBecause the United States Ambassador, standing up with the Governor of \nGuana Bera, in the Embassy in Rio in Brazil, reached over into my glass \nand pulled the ice out of it and threw it on the floor and said, \n``Don't drink that, Governor, the ice is dirty in this country.'' How \ndo you think I felt? I said, ``That fellow doesn't have any manners.'' \nBut a lot has happened in 37 years.\n  Our Department of State has outstanding personnel the world around, \nand they are trying to work in the business field to help spread \ncapitalism. In my opinion that is what really prevailed with the fall \nof the wall. It wasn't the CIA or anything else. It was capitalism. I \nserved on the Intelligence Committee, and they never briefed us that \nthe wall was about to fall.\n  So be that as it may, let's bring our Department of State in and put \nin a billion more. They gave a billion more in foreign aid and less to \nthe Department of State. The distinguished chairman, the Senator from \nNew Hampshire, comes around and finds some money here, and we put it in \nthe infrastructure to try to build up the Department of State. We come \naround and we have a crowd that says, ``No, the Republican Party, the \nDemocratic Party, the AFL-CIO, the chamber of commerce''--now, by gosh, \nthey have their minions all over this Capital City, and so they can fix \nthe vote and tell what wonderful work it does. Well, if it is wonderful \nwork, let's let the Department of State, without embarrassment or \napology, perform it.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have on previous occasions come to the \nfloor of the Senate to support amendments offered by the Senator from \nArkansas to strike the funding for the National Endowment for \nDemocracy. I must say that I was surprised and very pleased by the \nactions taken by the Senator from New Hampshire and the Senator from \nSouth Carolina and the subcommittee to strike the funding in the \nsubcommittee and recommend to the full Senate there be no funding for \nthe National Endowment for Democracy.\n  The chairman and the ranking member say it very simply. They simply \ncut the $30 million out. In their report, they tell us that:\n\n       The National Endowment for Democracy was originally \n     established in 1984 during the days of the cold war as a \n     public-private partnership to promote democratic movements \n     behind the Iron Curtain. Limited U.S. Government funds were \n     viewed as a way to help leverage private contributions and \n     were never envisioned as the sole or major source of \n     continuing funds for the National Endowment for Democracy.\n\n  I might say parenthetically, it wasn't really a private-public \npartnership, it was public funding. There was never very much private \nmoney available. But the subcommittee says:\n\n       Since the cold war is over, the committee believes the time \n     has come to eliminate Federal funding for this program.\n\n  Once again, I am pleased by this recommendation. I think it is the \nright recommendation.\n  We have a weed in North Dakota out in ranching and farming country \ncalled the leafy spurge. The leafy spurge is kind of an ugly weed. It \ngrows anywhere, without moisture. You just can't get rid of it. You can \ncut it, you can spray it, you can mutilate it, you can dig it up, and \nyou come back and it is still growing. We have some things in the \nFederal budget that remind me a little bit of leafy spurge. It doesn't \nmatter what you do, you just can't kill it.\n  The chairman and the ranking member bring a proposal to this floor \nfrom the committee that says this program is a program that is done, it \nought not be funded. I think the Senator from Arkansas, the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, the Senator from South Carolina, and others, have \nsaid it well. Most taxpayers, I think, would be surprised to discover \nthat we were spending nearly $30 million and we were dividing it up and \nsaying to groups, ``Take this and go around the world and promote \ndemocracy.'' We would give a pretty big chunk to the National \nDemocratic Party. Then we would give an equivalent chunk to the \nRepublican Party, because you can't give to one without the other. Then \nwe would give a big chunk of money to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and \nthen give an equivalent amount of money to the AFL-CIO, and we would \nsay, ``With this, promote democracy, promote free enterprise, promote \nunionism.''\n  It is 1997. The cold war is over. The Soviet Union doesn't exist. \nThere is no Berlin Wall. There is no Warsaw Pact. Democracy has marched \nacross the continents on this Earth, and yet, today, we face an \namendment that says, ``Let us decide to continue to spend $30 million a \nyear for the National Endowment for Democracy.''\n  I must tell you that I sort of view these things also in the context \nof what else is necessary to be done. The Senator from New Hampshire \ntalked about trying to make a telephone call from a U.S. embassy on \nforeign soil to the United States or to use a computer in an American \nembassy abroad to try and connect to the United States. He talked about \nthe Department's equipment needs, and I understand that. I think most \nof us have seen that first hand. He is talking about the needs of the \nState Department.\n  Those needs are great, and yet the funding to meet those needs is cut \nunder this amendment, in order to pay for this $30 million for the \nNational Endowment for Democracy.\n  There are other needs that frustrate me from time to time, sufficient \nso that I sit and grit my teeth and wonder why, why can't you get \nsomething so small done that would help people who are so important? \nBut you just can't. And yet $30 million is available for a National \nEndowment for Democracy.\n  I think for 4 or 5 years, I have come to this floor to try to get, \nfirst, $1 million, then $2 million, to deal with the issue of child \nabuse on Indian reservations. I have been unsuccessful all these years \nto get that money.\n  I held a hearing one day, and at the hearing, we heard the story of \nTamara DeMaris, a young Indian girl 3 years old who was put in a foster \nhome, and they didn't have enough time to check out the foster home. So \nthis 3-year-old girl was in this foster home, and a drunken party \nensued. The 3-year-old girl was beaten severely, her hair was torn out \nat the roots, her arm was broken and her nose was broken. Why? Because \nshe was put in a foster home and no one checked to see that the foster \nhome was safe. Why? Because one person had 150 cases of children who \nneeded help and didn't have time to check the foster home.\n  At a hearing on this issue of child abuse, I had a young woman sit at \nthe table and begin to weep. She was in charge of child welfare. She \nsaid, ``I have stacks of folders on the floor alleging physical abuse \nand sexual abuse that haven't even been investigated because I don't \nhave the money.'' She\n\n[[Page S8037]]\n\nbegan to weep. She said, ``I don't even have the ability to transport \nkids to a doctor.''\n  I tried for 4 or 5 years to get money to start a pilot project to \ndeal with those child abuse issues. The money is not available. But $30 \nmillion for the National Endowment for Democracy? A big chunk to the \nAFL-CIO, to the chamber of commerce, to each political party, and then \nsend some contracts around the world, fly around the world to meetings \nin the biggest cities in the world and talk about democracy?\n  We are going to come to a portion of appropriations, as the Senator \nfrom Arkansas said, where we will spend $4 billion for something called \nthe Agency for International Development. That is a program that \npromotes democracy abroad. That is a program that helps people around \nthe rest of the world. Four billion dollars, I am told. The U.S. \nInformation Agency is a program that helps people around the world; \nFood for Peace; the contribution we make to NATO.\n  I was asking somebody today, if we contributed the same amount of our \nnational income as all of our NATO partners do to the defense of \nEurope, what would it mean to us? I discovered something interesting: \n$100 billion a year of savings. If we were contributing the same \naverage amount for defense as all of our allies are contributing, $100 \nbillion a year. Think of that.\n  So we spend $100 billion extra a year to promote democracy, to help \nour allies, to help defend the free world, and then we spend money in \nAID, we spend money in USIA, we spend money in Food for Peace in a \ndozen other ways, and then we want to duplicate it in a minuscule \nprogram that doesn't have a reason for being, except that we fund it \nand it sets up a very well-connected board. The Senator from New \nHampshire said, I guess he called it the club, I think that was the \nreference.\n  I don't know much about this club. The names I see are some of the \nmost distinguished Americans, no question about that, people for whom I \nhave great respect. I would expect every single one of them associated \nwith this organization would support the organization. I understand \nthat.\n  The point is, we spend billions and billions of dollars supporting \ndemocracy abroad through this Government's programs--the foreign aid \nprogram, the Food for Peace Program, USIA, AID, and dozens of others--\nand there is not a need when the cold war is over, when there is no \nSoviet Union, when times have changed, to resurrect a $30 million \nprogram that this subcommittee decided it wanted to kill.\n  It is unusual to see a bill come to the floor of the Senate with a \nrecommendation that says, you know, this program has outlived its \nusefulness. This program is no longer needed. This money ought to be \nsaved. It is very unusual to see that happen here in Congress. But it \nhappened today when Senator Gregg and Senator Hollings brought a \nrecommendation to the floor saying this organization that produces \nthese slick annual reports is no longer necessary.\n  That conclusion is contested by some who say, yes, it is. We want $30 \nmillion more added to the bill to support the continued existence of \nthis organization, the National Endowment for Democracy.\n  We live in the greatest democracy on the face of this Earth. Half of \nthe people in the last election said they did not want to go vote. If \nwe want to endow a democracy, let us invest this $30 million here, let \nus continue an investment in this democracy.\n  You know, I know some people look at, I suppose, some of the things I \ntalk about on trade and other things I talk about and say, ``Well, it's \nsome of the same old story, kind of isolationist, and don't understand \nthings, can't see over the horizon. You just don't have the vision, the \nbreadth of understanding that it takes to know why this is necessary.''\n  I think I do understand this.\n  I am not a foreign policy expert by any means, nor am I an \nisolationist, nor do I believe the world is growing larger--it is \ngrowing smaller--nor do I believe that we do not have to be involved in \nwhat is happening in the rest of the world. But this country can no \nlonger afford to spend money it does not have on things it does not \nneed. And it does not need the National Endowment for Democracy, an \norganization with a fancy title, that gives its money to the AFL-CIO, \nthe chamber of commerce, the two national political parties, and then \ngoes without much strain to promote democracy abroad.\n  There is plenty of democracy to promote here at home, plenty of \nreasons to decide either to save this money or to invest it here in \nthings we need to do in this country and use the promotion of democracy \nas it is effectively done in AID, in USIA, and Food For Peace, and so \nmany other organizations, yes, including, as Senator Bumpers said, the \nforeign aid bill. That is where we promote the principles of democracy \nabroad. It is where it should be promoted.\n  Finally, let me just say this. This organization was created on a \nrecommendation offered in 1983, created in 1984 in the middle of the \ncold war, I assume for good purposes at that time, for people who felt \nit was a necessary organization. It is now no longer necessary.\n  The subcommittee is dead right. This is a colossal waste of the \ntaxpayers' money. If we cannot kill this organization, and end this \nfunding, then in my judgment we have a very difficult time taking a \nlook at other areas of questionable funding and making the right \nchoice.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. LUGAR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. LUGAR.

NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR DEMOCRACY.\n\n       For grants made by the United States Information Agency to \n     the National Endowment for Democracy as authorized by the \n     National Endowment for Democracy Act, $30,000,000, to remain \n     available until expended.

Mr. President, let me just say very briefly--we are \nanxious to hear from Senator McCain, and move on to a vote--the capital \ninvestment account referred to by the distinguished chairman of the \nsubcommittee and the ranking member will still be $105 million after \nthe Lugar amendment is approved. That would exceed the President's \nrequest by $10 million and exceed the 1997 level of last year's bill by \n$80 million.\n  The distinguished chairman of the subcommittee certainly raises a \nvalid point with regard to the infrastructure at the State Department. \nBut it will be substantially increased for all the purposes he alluded \nto even after the amendment restoring the National Endowment for \nDemocracy is hopefully approved.\n  Just one other point, Mr. President. I just want to mention a letter \nthat was sent to the chairman and the ranking member in support of the \nNational Endowment funding at $30 million signed by, in addition to \nSenator Lugar and myself, Senator Graham, Senator Mikulski, Senator \nLautenberg, Senator Mack, Senator Sarbanes, Senator Cochran, Senator \nLieberman, Senator Hatch, Senator Bob Kerrey, Senator Inhofe, Senator \nDodd, Senator Abraham, Senator Kennedy, Senator Murkowski, Senators \nLeahy, Roth, Kerry of Massachusetts, Robb, Levin, Breaux, Kyl, DeWine, \nCoverdell, Jeffords, Moynihan, Reed, Hagel, Torricelli, Thomas, Reid, \nRockefeller, Frist, and of course the distinguished Senator from \nArizona, who is about to speak who has been an enthusiastic supporter \nof this program over the years.\n  The NED, many of us feel, has done wonderful work, has broad \nbipartisan support across both party and ideological lines.\n  Mr. President, we hope the amendment offered by the distinguished \nSenator from Indiana will be approved.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator \nfrom Indiana have made I think a strong and compelling case for this \namendment. I am grateful for what they have said and their active \ninvolvement in the pursuit of democracy throughout the world.\n  The Senator from Kentucky just recently completed action on an \nappropriations bill here that I think embodies frankly what the \nNational Endowment for Democracy is all about. And of course the \nSenator from Indiana, Senator Lugar, is acknowledged throughout the \nworld, not only in this body, but throughout the world as one of the \nforemost experts on national security issues and foreign affairs.\n  Mr. President, I do not want to repeat a lot of the things that have \nalready been said about this issue, except to try to define really what \nthis debate is all about.\n  The Senator from North Dakota just talked about the fact that there \nwas no use for this kind of activity by our Government. I understand \nthat. I less understand the Senator from New Hampshire who I have \nalways known to be a person who supported efforts for freedom and \ndemocracy throughout the world.\n  We have people, Mr. President, like Martin Lee, who everyone \nrecognizes as the voice of human rights and freedom in Hong Kong. He \nsays:\n\n       In Hong Kong and elsewhere in Asia and around the world, \n     the struggle to preserve democracy, political freedom and the \n     rule of law is far from being won [is far from being won]. \n     But by supporting key human rights organizations which work \n     for the development of democracy and the preservation of the \n     rule of law and human rights in Hong Kong, the Endowment's \n     work in Hong Kong has had a profound effect at a critical \n     time.\n\n  I do not know if the Senator from Arkansas, who I have debated this \nissue for several years with, takes the time or the effort or the \ntrouble to hear from people like Martin Lee and Harry Wu, and people \nwho have suffered--who have suffered--on behalf of fighting for human \nrights and freedom in their countries.\n  I wish the Senator from Arkansas would take some time and listen to \nthese individuals, not me, not the Senator from Kentucky, not the \nSenator from Indiana, but why don't you, I would ask the Senator from \nArkansas, listen to people like Martin Lee and Harry Wu, the Dali Lama, \nthe Prime Minister of the National Coalition Government of Burma, the \nformer chief of staff of the President of Chile, the President of \nLithuania, the list goes on and on, names that are not known to some in \nAmerica but are known throughout the world in their struggle for \nfreedom in virtually every part of the world. That is why I am a bit \npuzzled and confused by the length of this debate and, frankly, the \nemotion associated with it.\n  As has already been noted by the Senator from Indiana and the Senator \nfrom Kentucky, there is an editorial in the Wall Street Journal this \nmorning. I quote:\n\n       Hong Kong democratic leader Martin Lee, who faces tough \n     battles ahead in coping with Hong Kong's new Beijing \n     landlords, penned a letter to Senator Connie Mack begging \n     him--begging him--to help save the NED. Senator Bob Graham \n     has heard from Sergio Aguayo of the Civic Alliance, which \n     has a strong hand in promoting the multiparty democracy \n     now taking root in Mexico.\n\n  The list goes on and on.\n\n       One achievement of this Ronald Reagan brainchild was to \n     help Poland's Solidarity break the grip of the Soviet Union \n     in the Cold War days.\n\n  It goes on and on.\n  Mr. President, as I said, I am not going to take a lot of time. I \njust want to say as strongly as I can, in the end I think it is fair to \nsay that the opponents of the National Endowment for Democracy are \nthose who define this country only by what we are against and not by \nwhat we are for. It is enough for them that the United States opposed \ncommunism, and once the threat communism posed to our own security was \ndefeated, they viewed America's role as the champion of liberal \ndemocracy to have become an expensive vanity which deserved to \ndisappear with the Berlin wall.\n  But such a cramped view of American purpose ignores the service and \nsacrifice of hundreds of thousands of Americans who were ordered into \ninnumerable battles, not just in defense of American security, but of \nAmerican values.\n  It ignores the aspirations of our Founding Fathers who conceived of \nthis Nation as an inspiration for and friend to all peoples who sought \ntheir natural right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n  It ignores the wisdom of Abraham Lincoln who knew that the outcome of \nour Civil War would affect the world as profoundly as it affected our \nown society. And it ignores the generous spirit of Ronald Reagan who \nbelieved that supporting the forces of democracy overseas was our \nabiding moral obligation, just as it was a practical necessity during \nthe cold war.\n  I am proud of America's long and successful opposition to communism, \nbut being an anticommunist is not enough. It was never an end in \nitself. We are all small ``d'' democrats in our efforts to help secure \nthe blessings of liberty of what truly distinguishes American history \nfrom all other nations on Earth. It was necessary to defeat communism \nto protect the well-being of Americans, but it was also necessary to \ndefeat communism because it threatened America's best sense of itself \nand our sublime legacy to the world.\n  Mr. President, $30 million is a small investment in preserving that \nlegacy. And I ask all my colleagues to keep faith with the many revered \nAmericans who paid a much higher price than that to keep America a \nbeacon light of liberty.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am delighted I was here to hear the Senator from \nArizona comment on the program. I will call attention to the fact that \nthe bill in the other body has the same amount of money that is in the \namendment as proposed here. This matter will be at conference. And it \nwill be a long and sustained conference whether this amendment is \nadopted or not.\n  I believe that we should keep on course. I am not an opponent of this \nmatter. As a matter of fact, I have always voted for it. But I do not \nthink it gains anything to have a prolonged discussion here at this \ntime. I will assure Senators who support it, we will do everything in \nour power to assure the conference of their objectives at conference. \nBut I move to table this\n\n[[Page S8039]]\n\namendment, and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n               Vote on Motion to Table Amendment No. 984\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table the amendment. The yeas and nays are ordered. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. \nKennedy] is necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] would vote ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, there is overwhelming opposition. But I \ndo want to tell the Senate that we are spending time on an amendment \nthat deals with a subject the House has always insisted on in \nconference. I don't know why we spend time debating here on the floor \nwhether or not we are going to give this subject approval by the \nSenate, because it is one item that the House will not let us come out \nof conference on unless we approve it. So we have taken time to get \nnegotiating room with the House, and the Senate won't let us have it. I \nam sorry to say that I think the Senate just made a mistake.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 985\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the pending \nbusiness before the body is the second-degree amendment by the Senator \nfrom Kentucky.\n  Is there further debate? If not, the question is on agreeing to the \namendment of the Senator from Kentucky.\n  The amendment (No. 985) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 984, As Amended\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is now on the first-degree \namendment, as amended. Is there any further debate? If not, the \nquestion is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 984), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be laid aside for up to 3 minutes; and I further ask \nunanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of H.R. 1585, which was just received from the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, as long \nas the Chair will recognize the Senator from California following the \nhandling of this measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's request is so modified.\n  Is there an objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1585) to allow postal patrons to contribute to \n     funding for breast cancer research through the voluntary \n     purchase of certain specially issued United States postage \n     stamps, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am proud to support the breast \ncancer research stamp bill, H.R. 1585, sponsored by Congresswoman Susan \nMolinari and approved in the House of Representatives yesterday on a \nvote of 422 to 3.\n  I, along with Senators D'Amato, Faircloth, and the original 51 \ncosponsors of my bill, the breast cancer research stamp Act (S. 726), \nhave worked very hard to give life to this innovative breast cancer \nresearch stamp idea, which originated with a physician--Dr. Bodai from \nmy State, and I am happy to see it become a reality today.\n  At a time when the National Cancer Institute can only fund 26 percent \nof applications, a drop from 60 percent in the 1970's, this legislation \ncreates an innovative way for citizens to contribute to breast cancer \nresearch.\n  Under this bill:\n\n  Postal Service would establish a special rate of postage for first-\nclass mail, not to exceed 25 percent of the first-class rate, as an \nalternative to the regular first-class postage. The additional sum \nwould be contributed to breast cancer research.\n  The rate would be determined in part, by the Postal Service to cover \nadministrative costs and the remainder by the Governors of the Postal \nService.\n  Seventy percent of the funds raised would fund breast cancer research \nat NIH and 30 percent of the funds raised would go to breast cancer \nresearch at DOD.\n  The Postal Service would provide the stamp within a year from the \ndate of enactment.\n  Within 3 months prior to the stamp's 2-year anniversary, the bill \nrequires the Comptroller General to evaluate the effectiveness and the \nappropriateness of this method of fund raising and report its findings \nto Congress.\n\n\n                         The breast cancer Toll\n\n  There are 1.8 million women in America today with breast cancer. \nAnother 1 million women do not know they have it; 180,200 new invasive \ncases will be diagnosed this year.\n  Breast cancer kills 46,000 women a year. It is the leading cause of \ndeath for women ages 35 to 52 and the second leading cause of cancer \ndeath in all women, claiming a woman's life every 12 minutes in this \ncountry.\n  For California, 20,230 women were diagnosed with breast cancer and \n5,000 women will die from the disease. (Source: American Cancer \nSociety--cancer facts and figures 1996.)\n  The San Francisco Bay area has one of the highest rates of breast \ncancer incidence and mortality in the world. According to the Northern \nCalifornia Cancer Center, bay area white women have the highest \nreported breast cancer rate in the world, 104 per 100,000 population. \nBay area African-American women have the fourth highest reported rate \nin the world at 82 per 100,000.\n  In addition to the cost of women's lives, the annual cost of \ntreatment of breast cancer in the United States is approximately $10 \nbillion.\n  The incidence of breast cancer is increasing. In the 1950's, 1 in 20 \nwomen developed breast cancer. Today, it is one in eight and growing.\n  While we know there is a genetic link to some breast cancers, we do \nnot understand the fundamental cause. In hearings I held as cochair of \nthe Senate Cancer Coalition, we learned that environmental factors may \nlead to as much as 90 percent of breast cancer. We know that breast \ncancer rates vary between countries and when people migrate, they tend \nto acquire cancer rates closer to those of newly adopted countries \nwithin a generation.\n  Over the last 25 years, the National Institutes of Health has spent \nover $31.5 billion on cancer research--$2 billion of that on breast \ncancer. In the last 6 years alone, appropriations for breast cancer \nresearch have risen from $90 million in 1990 to $600 million today.\n  And the United States is privileged to have some of the most talented \nscientists and many of the leading cancer research centers in the world \nsuch as UCLA, UC San Francisco, Memorial Sloan-Kettering, the Dana \nFarber Institute, and M.D. Anderson. But researchers need funding. \nScience needs nourishment. Without it, promising avenues of scientific \ndiscovery go unexplored. Questions go unanswered. Cures go \nundiscovered.\n\n\n                         Citizen Contributions\n\n  The breast cancer research stamp bill allows anyone who chooses to, \nto conveniently contribute to Federal research and to finding a cure \nfor the breast cancer epidemic. It is an innovative idea originating \nwith an American citizen and I am very grateful for the support of the \nHouse yesterday.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, as chairman of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, which has oversight responsibility for the U.S. Postal \nService, I want to comment on H.R. 1585. This measure directs the \nPostal Service to issue a semipostal stamp, at a price of up to 8 \nadditional cents per first-class stamp, to raise funds for breast \ncancer research. Clearly this measure has the votes to pass; a similar \nmeasure passed the Senate last week by a vote of 83 to 17. But I want \nthe record to reflect my strong disagreement with it. I think it is a \nbad idea for several reasons. It will create a precedent for \ncongressional authorization for the issuance of many other fundraising \npostal stamps for many other worthy causes. As all Members are aware, \nthe Postal Service has plenty of challenges on which it should \nconcentrate. Not all costs of undertaking this new program are \nquantifiable, and we will be distracting the Postal Service from its \nresponsibility of providing the best delivery service at the lowest \nprice. Note that it is likely that we will soon see an increase in the \ncost of mailing a first-class letter. If Congress believes additional \nfunds should be spent for this or another purposes, Congress should \nappropriate the funds directly. That is our responsibility.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I want to convey my strong support for \nthe Stamp Out Breast Cancer Act, H.R. 1585. I may have created \nconfusion on this point by voting last week against an amendment \noffered by my friend Senator Feinstein of California when\n\n[[Page S8041]]\n\nthe Senate was considering the Treasury-Postal Service-general \nGovernment appropriations bill. I was concerned about initial reports \nthat the Postal Service would have technical problems raising the \nprojected funds. However, passage of today's legislation both solves \nthose problems and properly authorizes the program. As a supporter of \nthe war on cancer 26 years ago and the author of the pilot program \nwhich grew into the Centers for Disease Control's breast and cervical \ncancer screening program, I am very pleased to see this legislation \nenacted. The bottom line is that we need public awareness and research \nfunds, and this legislation provides both. Again, I commend my friend \nSenator Feinstein for her energetic efforts on this front and am \npleased to support this bill.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the bill be \nconsidered read a third time, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be placed \nin the Record at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 1585) was passed.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from \nCalifornia for yielding. I think it is just gratitude at this time \nbecause there is no one who has worked harder than Senator Feinstein in \nterms of the attempts to bring forward this passage.\n  This will permit the Postal Service to go forward with a program that \nwill pay for it itself and dedicate 70 percent of the net proceeds to \ncancer research at NIH and give the other 30 percent to the Department \nof Defense.\n  We worked together on this with the House, and I think it is a great \ntestimony to the dedication of bringing people together for a sole \npurpose.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I also want to thank the Senator from \nNew York for his help on this matter.\n  We have had a true bipartisan effort with Ms. Molinari and Mr. Fazio \nin the House and Senators D'Amato, Faircloth and Feinstein in the \nSenate. This bill passed the House on suspension. I believe it is an \nexcellent bill. I think it will get the job done in a way in which we \ncan all be proud.\n  The bill is slightly different than the bill that we introduced as an \namendment on the fiscal year 1998 Treasury-Postal appropriations bill \nlast week. This bill provides for up to 25 percent of the cost of a \nfirst-class stamp to be attached, the extra amount added to be used for \nbreast cancer research. Of the amount of funds raised, 75 percent would \ngo to the NIH, and the remainder to DOD.\n  It is something that is widely supported by virtually every medical \nand cancer association in the United States.\n  Let me say one thing. Breast cancer is the No. 1 killer for women \nbetween the ages of 35 and 52 in this Nation today. It used to be 1 out \nof 20 women. Today it is one out of every eight women in the United \nStates will come down with breast cancer. It is extraordinarily \nserious. This is a unique public/private partnership, the first time it \nhas been tried, a pilot, if you will. I know it has been hotlined. I am \ngrateful for the results. I thank the Senator from New York so very \nmuch for his work and support and the pink ribbon he is wearing on his \nlapel, and I believe the women of America, all of us, also thank every \nMember of this body.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill has been passed.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I certainly will.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. We debated this in the Appropriations Committee, as we \nknow, for a short time. We voted on it the other day--a different \nproposition. I am not clear on the difference between the amendment the \nSenator is offering now and the one that was overwhelmingly passed in \nthe Senate the other day. That was carried--a 1-cent increase in the \n32-cent stamp, with the extra penny going to breast cancer research. \nThis one, as I understand it--does this amendment take part of the 32 \ncents or does it also carry an increase in the 32 cents?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The amendment we are to be on is a Commerce, State, \nJustice amendment that I have sent to the desk involving the ninth \ncircuit split. But before we start that, it is my understanding the \nbill has passed on the breast cancer stamp, and I would be very happy \nto discuss it.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I did not realize the parliamentary situation. Could the \nSenator just take a minute to explain?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will be very happy to.\n  One of the problems with the 1-cent stamp is the uncertainty of the \npost office that the administrative costs will be fully covered by the \nadditional 1 cent. The legislation which passed the House, authored by \nSusan Molinari and Dick Fazio, on suspension, essentially provides that \nit can be up to 25 percent --that would be about 8 cents, determined by \nthe Board of Governors--so that the full cost of administering it is \ncovered. The Board of Governors within a short period of time will set \nthe actual amount, whether it is 1 cent, 2 cents, 3 cents or 4 cents, \nand I actually feel is a much better way of doing it. I think it will \nend up producing more money. I think it will give the post office fewer \nulcers. I think it will be carried out forthwith. This has passed the \nHouse, and with the passage here today we can get the show underway.\n  The Board of Governors must, within 1 year of the enactment of the \nbill, issue the stamp.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The Senator mentioned 25 percent. Is that 25 percent of \n32 cents or is that 25 percent of something else?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. It is 25 percent of a first-class stamp which right \nnow is 32 cents.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. So 25 percent of that goes to the Postal Service to \nadminister this program?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. No. No. It allows an optional first-class stamp, up \nto 25 percent of the cost of a first-class stamp. In other words, it \ncould add 8 cents onto it, on an optional basis. There would still be a \n32-cent stamp. Then there would be this breast cancer stamp. All right. \nThe Board of Governors in their deliberation would make a decision of \nadministrative cost and then out of the 8 cents or 4 cents or 6 cents \nor 2 cents, whatever they decide, those administrative costs would come \nout of that additional amount.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I follow you. And the rest of it then would go to the \nDepartment of Defense and the National Institutes of Health?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would be happy to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator for her leadership on the breast \ncancer stamp. I was proud to be one of the cosponsors of the stamp. I \nknow how hard she worked. I know it took many, many hours of work. I \nwas sitting in the Appropriations Committee when the committee chose to \nawait action on the floor. I know that a couple of the senior members \nof the committee were not that enthusiastic. But I do feel that what \nthe Senator says is right. This bill, this freestanding bill that we \nhave now passed, takes the best of both worlds. I am very excited about \nit. I congratulate my friend. I can't wait to go to the post office and \nbuy that stamp. If all the American people just think about buying a \nfew of those stamps during the year, we will be able to put so much \nmore into research. It is just a great concept. I thank my colleague \nfor her leadership.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from California for her comments. \nI thank the Senator for her help, and I think all of us can be very \nproud if we just await Presidential signature. It is a fine thing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/24/senate-section/article/S8040-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8041-S8087]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDEPARTMENTS OF COMMERCE, JUSTICE, AND STATE, THE JUDICIARY, AND RELATED \n                   AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1998\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 986\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will now proceed to consider the \namendment of the Senator from California, which is to be considered \nunder a pending time agreement.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Now, if we may turn to something which is of very deep concern. The\n\n[[Page S8042]]\n\namendment that I have sent to the desk is on behalf of the ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy; the Senator from \nWashington, Mrs. Murray; my colleague from California, Senator Boxer; \nand the two Senators from Nevada, Senators Reid and Bryan. The \namendment is an amendment to strike and substitute language. The \nsection we would strike from the bill is section 305, which splits the \nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals on an appropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, this legislation which I am presenting serves as a \nsubstitute to a nongermane provision of the fiscal year 1998 \nappropriations bill for Commerce, State, Justice.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator from California yield for a question?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am sorry to break in. I was wondering if the Senator \nwould agree to reducing the time of this amendment down to 3 hours \nequally divided?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that, under the prior order on \nthis amendment, the time be reduced to 3 hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this bill, with no hearing, no due \ndiligence, no consultation with the ninth circuit--any of its judges, \nattorneys, bar associations within the circuit--splits the circuit, and \nI would like to show you how it splits the circuit. It creates a \ntwelfth circuit which would comprise Washington, Arizona, Alaska, \nOregon, Hawaii, Idaho, and Montana. If you look at the map--separate \nand distinct, alone--separated from the rest, would be the State of \nArizona. The proposal would leave in the ninth circuit only two \nStates--the States of California and Nevada--along with the territories \nof Guam and the Marianas.\n  Now, what is wrong with that? First of all, the way in which it is \ndone, which I will address in detail. But second, it creates two \nunequal circuits. The ninth circuit and Nevada would have close to 35 \nmillion people and the twelfth circuit would have 16 million people. \nBut look at the proposed distribution of the judges. It would \ndistribute 15 judges to the ninth circuit and 13 judges to the \nremainder--an unequal, unfair distribution of judges.\n  Here is what the effect would be. In the ninth circuit, you would \nhave 363 cases per judge. In the new twelfth circuit, each judge would \nhave just 239 cases. So the judges of the ninth circuit would \nimmediately have caseloads 52 percent higher than the judges of the \ntwelfth circuit.\n  Mr. President, the real point is that there is already a resolution \nto this issue. It was passed by the Senate last session, and it has \nalready passed the House. The resolution is legislation that calls for \na study of all of the circuits, with special emphasis on the ninth \ncircuit.\n  The substitute amendment that I am offering today to form a study \ncommission passed the House of Representatives unanimously in June. \nThis bill is identical to the House-passed bill. The study commission \nrepresents, I believe, the only principled approach to dealing with an \nissue as important and far-reaching as the structure of the U.S. courts \nof appeals.\n  If I may, Mr. President, there has never been a division of a circuit \ncourt without careful study and without the support of the judges and \nthe lawyers within the circuit who represent the public they serve. \nThere has never been a division of any circuit in this manner--\narbitrary, political, and gerrymandered. As a member of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, I am deeply concerned that the legislation to \nsplit the ninth circuit has been included in this appropriations bill \nwith no hearing, no study, no due diligence as to its impact. Section \n305 of the bill contains language for this split. It is a misuse, in my \nview, of the appropriations process.\n  Yesterday, Representative Henry Hyde, the chairman of the House \nJudiciary Committee, wrote a strongly worded letter, which was \ncirculated broadly. I would like to quote from it.\n\n       I understand that this week the Senate is expected to \n     consider S. 1022, the Commerce-Justice-State-Judiciary \n     appropriations bill. Included in the bill is a major piece of \n     substantive legislation, the ``Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals \n     Reorganization Act of 1997.'' This provision of the bill \n     (section 305) would amend Title 28 of the United States Code \n     by dividing the existing Ninth Circuit into two circuits. As \n     you well know, altering the structure of the federal judicial \n     system is a serious matter. It is something that Congress \n     does rarely, and only after careful consideration.\n       It is anticipated that an amendment will be offered to \n     replace the circuit division rider with legislation to create \n     a commission--\n\n  That is what I am trying to do at this time--\n\n     to study the courts of appeals and report recommendations on \n     possible change. This legislation, H.R. 908, has already \n     passed the House unanimously on a voice vote on June 3, 1997. \n     A similar bill, S. 956, was passed unanimously by the Senate \n     in the 104th Congress. This is a far superior way of dealing \n     with the problems of caseload growth in the Ninth Circuit and \n     other courts of appeals. I urge your support for the \n     amendment.\n       Sincerely, Henry Hyde, Chairman.\n\n  So the House is on record supporting a study. The chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee of the House writes this letter, and yet this split \nis in the bill. The administration has issued a strong statement to the \nSenate Appropriations Committee indicating its support for a study \ncommission and its opposition to the inclusion of such far-reaching \nlegislation in an appropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, I hope the President will veto this bill if it should \ncontain an arbitrary split of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals--a \nsplit done politically, as a form of gerrymandering.\n  In a letter dated July 11, Gov. Pete Wilson reiterated his support \nfor the commission study and stated that the present effort to split \nthe circuit involves judicial gerrymandering, apparently designed, and \nI quote, ``to cordon off some judges in one circuit while keeping \nothers in another because of concerns, whether perceived or real, over \nparticular judges' perspectives or judicial philosophy.''\n  Less than 2 weeks ago, when Governor Wilson wrote this letter, there \nwas a proposal that would have divided the ninth circuit into three \ncircuits and split California in half. Then there was another proposal \nthat would have left California and Hawaii in a two-State circuit, the \nfirst time in history that a Federal judicial circuit would have \nconsisted of fewer than three States.\n  In a matter of hours, an amendment was made to the bill, and we have \nthe latest proposal which keeps California whole, teams it with Nevada, \nisolating a geographical neighbor, Arizona, and placing Arizona with \nOregon, Washington, Hawaii, Idaho, Alaska, and Montana. Mr. President, \nI respectfully submit this is not the way to do the people's legal \nbusiness. This is not the way to restructure the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  Let me offer some history. I authored the first proposal to create a \ncommission on structural alternatives for the Federal courts of appeal \nin the 104th Congress during a markup session in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee on December 8, 1985. If that had been passed, the job would \nhave been done by now. The Senate ultimately passed legislation to \ncreate a study commission during that Congress on March 20.\n  As noted above, in the present Congress, a commission bill identical \nto the one I am offering today unanimously passed the House. So both \nHouses of Congress have spoken on this issue and both Houses of \nCongress have said if the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals should be \nsplit, no due diligence, consult the judges, consult the attorneys who \npractice before it, look at the precedents, see that there is study, \nthought and consideration to what would be the best split. None of this \nhas been done. In a matter of a week, four separate proposals have been \nput forward and changed with no opportunity for anyone who practices \nlaw in the ninth circuit, the huge ninth circuit, to indicate what the \nimpact of those proposals might be.\n  The House-passed bill was modeled on a proposal I introduced with \nSenator Reid on January 30, 1997. The House Judiciary Subcommittee \nChairman Coble and Chairman Hyde moved the bill with the support and \ncosponsorship of Representative Berman. The current H.R. 908 represents \na compromise that was worked out in the House and endorsed by every \nHouse Republican and Democrat.\n\n[[Page S8043]]\n\n  I should note that the House-passed bill is very similar to a \ncompromise on a study commission that Senator Burns and I reached \ntogether just a few months ago. This all began with Senator Burns. I \nunderstand his concerns. He has legitimate interests, legitimate \nthoughts, and I appreciate them. The last I had heard was Senator Burns \nsigned off on the study commission. So you can imagine the surprise \nwhen I heard. My goodness, this is on an appropriations bill. And \nMembers of this body have taken it on themselves to arbitrarily just \ndecide, willy-nilly, how the ninth circuit should be split.\n  The House-passed commission study is fully bipartisan, a 10-member \ncommission. The commission would operate for 18 months, at which time \nit would make recommendations to Congress for any changes in circuit \nstructure or alignment.\n  I don't think we should subject something as important as the \nstructure of our courts to political gamesmanship, and that is just \nwhat this is. The study called for in H.R. 908 is a responsible method \nof evaluating the current situation and making recommendations that can \nprovide a sound foundation for Congressional action in the future.\n  A study is needed to determine whether this or any proposed circuit \ndivision would be likely to improve the administration of justice in \nthe region. That is the fundamental question: Would a split improve the \nadministration of justice, and, if so, what should that split be? Even \namong those who believe that some kind of split should occur, there is \nno consensus as to where any circuit boundary lines might be redrawn.\n  During the 105th Congress, proponents of a circuit split put forward \nthese four proposals. One would have split the north from the \nsouthernmost States of the circuit. The second would have chopped the \nexisting circuit into three separate circuits and split California in \nhalf. The third would have created a narrow stringbean circuit. That \nwas the same proposal that failed to pass the Senate during the 104th \nCongress.\n\n  The current proposal, which represents at least the fourth proposal \nin the 105th Congress, is a modification of the stringbean circuit. \nAgain, no due diligence, no hearings, no study, no testimony--nothing.\n  As I noted before, the proposal isolates Arizona. It combines Nevada. \nIt separates coastal States that have common maritime law. And that is \nwhy I say it is gerrymandering. I say if it looks like a gerrymander, \ntalks like a gerrymander, it probably is a gerrymander.\n  Let's talk about the costs inherent in what is happening here today. \nIf this bill passes and should go into law, splitting the circuit will \nrequire duplicative offices of clerk of the court, circuit executive, \nstaff attorneys, settlement attorneys and library as well as \ncourtrooms, mail and computer facilities. According to the ninth \ncircuit executive office, neither Phoenix nor Seattle currently have \nfacilities capable of housing a court of appeals headquarters \noperation.\n  As part of the review of last year's similar proposal to split the \ncircuit, the GSA estimated that it would cost a minimum of $23 million \nto construct new facilities for a headquarters in Phoenix, and I would \nbe very surprised if it was as little as $23 million. Based on GSA \ncosts, the ninth circuit executive has estimated that building and \nrenovation costs for creating or upgrading new headquarters in Seattle \nand Phoenix would amount to at least $56 million. Additional combined \noutlay of another $6 million in startup costs would be needed to outfit \nboth Phoenix and Seattle.\n  The CBO last year estimated the cost of duplicative staff positions \nat $1 million annually. The new proposal calls for two coequal clerks \nof the court in the twelfth circuit. Assuming each clerk would have the \ncustomary deputy clerk and staff attorney, an additional $300,000 in \nsalaries would be added to the total. So the new twelfth circuit would \ncost an additional $1.3 million annually for duplicate salaries, and \nminimum of $25 million in Phoenix and an additional amount for Seattle. \nIt is estimated the cost would run in the neighborhood of $60 million.\n  This wouldn't be so bad if there just hadn't been approved and spent \n$140 million to rehabilitate and seismically equip the Ninth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals in the city of San Francisco and Pasadena--$140 \nmillion has just been spent. I just visited the San Francisco ninth \ncircuit. It compares with the U.S. Capitol. There is a brand-new \nlibrary already built in, magnificent chambers, one library that is \nsolid redwood, marble that is incredible, lighting fixtures that go \nback well over 100 years. It is an amazing and beautiful building.\n  Under the configuration of States proposed for the new twelfth \ncircuit, the circuit executive estimates that upward of 50 percent of \nthe space recently renovated in San Francisco and Pasadena at a cost of \n$140 million would no longer be needed. The space was specifically \ndesigned to meet the business needs of the court of appeals. The \nexecutive office estimates, ``It would cost many tens of millions of \ndollars to modify the space to make it usable by tenants other than the \ncourt of appeals.''\n  Let me talk for a minute about the real risk of an impetuous \npolitical and gerrymandered split of the ninth circuit.\n  Forum shopping: Organizations and entities whose activities cut \nacross State lines, and those who sue them, would be able to forum shop \nto take advantage of favorable precedents or to avoid those that are \nunfavorable. And I suspect, frankly speaking, that this is just what is \nbehind this split. Thus, an additional burden would be placed on the \nU.S. Supreme Court to resolve conflicts that are now handled internally \nwithin the circuit.\n  Here are some examples provided by the ninth circuit of how dividing \nit could invite forum shopping: water disputes concerning the Colorado \nRiver, which affect California, Nevada, and Arizona; commercial \ndisputes between large contractors like Boeing and McDonald--perhaps \nthat is resolved now--or Microsoft and Intel; different legal \nprecedents affecting the shipping industry along the coastline of the \ncontinental United States and Hawaii.\n\n  Think of the complications created if different commercial and \nmaritime rules governed the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Tacoma \nand Hawaii. The ninth circuit includes a vast expanse of coastal area, \nall subject to the same Federal law on cargo loading, on seaman's \nwages, on personal injury, and maritime employment. Vessels plying the \ncoast stop frequently at ports in California, Washington, Alaska, \nHawaii and the Pacific territories. If the circuit were to be divided, \nseamen would have an incentive to forum shop among port districts in \norder to predetermine the most sympathetic court of appeals to hear the \ncase.\n  In the commercial law area, all of the States in the circuit have \nconsiderable economic relations with California because of its large \nand diverse population. In a recent case, Vizcaino v. Microsoft, the \nninth circuit decided to hear a case en banc concerning whether \nMicrosoft contractors were entitled to the same ERISA benefits and \nstock options as were regular employees. Microsoft is a large \ncorporation with primary offices in Washington but significant business \noperations in California. If the ninth circuit were split, Microsoft or \nits employees might choose to bring a lawsuit in either the ninth or \ntwelfth circuit, in hopes of finding a more sympathetic court.\n  The judges and lawyers of the ninth circuit overwhelmingly oppose \nwhat is happening in this bill. Let me repeat that. The lawyers and \njudges in all of the ninth circuit States overwhelmingly oppose what is \nhappening in this State, Justice, Commerce appropriations bill.\n  On four occasions, the Federal judges in the ninth circuit and the \npracticing lawyers in the ninth circuit judicial conference have voted \ntheir opposition to splitting the circuit. The official bar \norganizations of Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana and \nNevada, and the National Federal Bar Association, all have taken \npositions against circuit division. No State bar organization in the \ncircuit has taken a position in favor of circuit division or what is \nhappening in this bill.\n  Candidly speaking, this is a political decision of Senators of the \nAppropriations Committee to affect the legal business of 50 million \npeople in the United States with an arbitrary split, gerrymandered, of \nthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Candidly speaking,\n\n[[Page S8044]]\n\nalso, the ninth circuit is large. California alone is predicted to be \n50 million people by the year 2025.\n  Whether the circuit should be split or not, I can't say. I strongly \nbelieve it is a decision that should not be made, however, either \npolitically or in a cavalier fashion. The decision should not be made \nwithout study, without hearing, without comment from those lawyers and \njudges whose clients are affected by it.\n  If--and I say if--the circuit is eventually split, it should be the \nproduct of diligence, of study, of hearing, of commentary. It should be \npart of an analysis of how the circuit courts are functioning in the \nUnited States. There may well be a better split involving other States. \nI don't know, and I would hazard a guess that no one in this Chamber \nknows that either.\n  But this does mean a careful study of population should be \nundertaken. It means an even distribution of caseload by judge, not a \nrammed-through circuit split that has a 52 percent higher caseload for \njudges in this new ninth circuit than in the twelfth circuit. On its \nface, it is patently unfair. Anybody who looks at any split that says \nyou split it so that one set of judges has double the number of cases \nthan the other--that doesn't meet a simple test of fairness.\n  There should be a careful study of precedents, of commercial law, of \nmaritime law, of the other aspects of precedents. California now has \nthe largest consumer market in the United States in Los Angeles; the \nthird largest in the San Francisco Bay area. It is a huge consumer \nmarket, and it is going to be bigger with all kinds of \nintercommunication among these States.\n  There should be a study of costs. I pointed out the duplication of \nstaff, I pointed out the need for two new courthouses when two already \nhave been refurbished at a cost of $140 million for the taxpayers. All \nof this is being done without any study, any hearing, any commentary. \nIt is not something of which this great body can be proud.\n  I notice that the distinguished Senator from Nevada is here, and if I \nmight ask him, I believe he would like 10 minutes? I will be happy to \nyield to him.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, if the Senator from California wouldn't \nmind, I would like to go from side to side.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will be happy to do that.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield to the Senator from Washington 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, there can be no serious argument posed to \nMembers in body that it is not appropriate, maybe beyond appropriate, \nfor all practical purposes necessary, for the proper administration of \njustice that the U.S. Court of Appeals--almost twice as large as the \nnext largest court of appeals and almost three times as large in \npopulation and in caseload as the average circuit--should not be \ndivided.\n  Twenty-three years ago, a commission, the Hruska Commission, said the \nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals was too large and should be divided; \nthat no circuit court of appeals should have more than 15 judges. The \nreasons, of course, is collegiality, the prompt and effective \nadministration of justice. Any other argument is simply a matter of \ndelay, simply a matter of a maintenance of the status quo.\n  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals should be divided. There have been \nbills on this subject and hearings on this subject in most of the \nCongresses from 1975, 22 years ago, to date. The very proposal that is \nbefore us right now, with minor changes, was recommended by the \nJudiciary Committee in the last Congress and did not come to a vote \nbecause it was clear that it would be filibustered as an independent \nvote. That is at least one of the reasons that when he comes to the \nfloor, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee will recommend the \nrejection of this amendment and supports the division that is included \nin this bill.\n  But, Mr. President, before I get back to the merits of the proposal, \nI want to express my deep concern over some portions of the opposition \nthat come to this bill from California and perhaps elsewhere. One of \nthe reasons that the Senator from California can describe this bill as \na gerrymander, one of the reasons that she can call for delay is \nbecause the proponents of the division have acceded to the requests of \nthe Senators from the various States that are affected by this \ndivision.\n\n  Should we have another study commission? That study commission, if it \nis remotely objective, will recommend the division of the ninth circuit \nnot into two, but into three new circuits, a proposition that this \nSenator feels to be highly appropriate. The only way to create three \nnew circuits out of the present ninth circuit is to divide the State of \nCalifornia and to place it into two circuits: one centered in San \nFrancisco, the other centered in Los Angeles.\n  That recommendation has been with us for many years. That \nrecommendation was incorporated into the first version of this bill. \nThe two Senators from California are vehemently opposed to that \nrecommendation, and I strongly suspect that if we go 2 years and have \nanother study commission and it comes up with dividing California, they \nwill find a reason to object to it again and to filibuster the \nproposal.\n  So what did the sponsors of the division do? The sponsors of the \ndivision said, ``Fine, we will accede to the wishes of the Senators \nfrom California. We will make this a two-new-circuit bill.'' California \nwill be left united.\n  The Senators from Nevada, with some real justice with respect to the \nbill reported by the Judiciary Committee 2 years ago, stated that they \ndidn't like the division; that Nevada felt more drawn to California \nthan it did to the Pacific Northwest and Arizona. And so in this bill, \nwe have acceded to the wishes of the Senators from Nevada and have left \nthat State in the ninth circuit with the State of California.\n  That is the reason that the circuit, as it appears in the bill, is \nnot contiguous. But in the days of the Internet, of e-mail, of faxes, \nof air transportation, there is nothing but history to require that \ncircuits be made up of contiguous States. And, of course, Alaska and \nHawaii have never been contiguous to the States in the ninth circuit. \nNor has Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to the circuits to which \nthey are attached.\n  Finally, the State of Hawaii, through its Senators, when it was \ndetermined there was to be a bill, elected, to my delight, Mr. \nPresident, that it would rather be in the smaller, the more intimate, \nthe more collegial circuit, the new twelfth, and that appears in the \nbill. Then when we asked the representatives of Guam and the trust \nterritories of the Pacific, they said, while they really don't want to \nchange that, of course, they prefer to stay with Hawaii.\n  If the great majority of the Senators from the Northwest and from \nArizona wish a new circuit that is so logical, and if they have \ndeferred to the wishes of the Senators from Colorado and Nevada as to \ntheir desires, why should we say no on the floor of the Senate to those \nwho wish the division? What business is it of the Governor of \nCalifornia to tell us how the ninth circuit should be constituted? I am \ndeeply troubled that Senators whose own wishes, reflecting what they \nthink is best for their States, have been respected, refuse so \narbitrarily as they and their predecessors have for more than two \ndecades to accede to ours.\n  Mr. President, there are 28 positions authorized for the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals. There are 10 more requested by those judges \nand approved by the Judicial Council. That is a collegial circuit? At \nthe number 28, three-judge panels that are chosen by lot have 3,276 \npossible combinations of those three judges. You, Mr. President, one of \nthe youngest of our Members, could be appointed to the ninth circuit, \ncould serve on it for 30 years, and the chances are you would never \nserve on the same panel of three twice in that entire period of time. \nThat is collegiality?\n  The ninth circuit is slow from the time appeals are filed until they \nare decided. It is notoriously reversed more frequently than in the \ncase of any other circuit. When I was attorney general of the State of \nWashington, we figured that if we could get the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States to take certiorari from the ninth circuit, we had at \nleast a 75-percent chance of winning in the U.S. Supreme Court, of \ncausing it to repeal the circuit.\n  At one level, that is not a totally relevant argument, because the \ntwo new\n\n[[Page S8045]]\n\ncircuits would start with exactly the same judges they have now, and I \ncan't note any difference in philosophy from those who come from the \nStates in the old ninth circuit under this proposal and the new twelfth \ncircuit, and, of course, they are nominated by the same Presidents and \nconfirmed by the same Members of the U.S. Senate. But I suspect that if \nthe judges who work together knew one another a little bit better than \nthey do now, there would at least be a marginal improvement in the \nnumber of times during which they are reversed.\n  Mr. President, there is simply no justification whatsoever for the \nmaintenance of this huge and unwieldy circuit. The Senator from \nCalifornia said in 20 years, California itself will have 50 million \npeople. We have a wonderful First Circuit Court of Appeals, much \nsmaller than the twelfth we propose in this legislation. New York and \nPennsylvania, that don't have the population of California combined, \nhave always been in separate circuits, and they are both on the \nAtlantic Ocean, and they both have to deal with the same kind of \nadmiralty law.\n  No, Mr. President. The time has come. There have been hearings \ngalore. Those hearings have occupied a quarter of a century. There have \nbeen bills reported. Another study, another delay, only to be followed \nby another attempt to delay after that when a three-circuit division is \nproposed.\n  No, Mr. President. The time is now. The division is appropriate. It \nwill not be the last in the history of the U.S. courts. But it seems to \nme we should go ahead. From a personal point of view, I am somewhat \nunhappy that while we have done all we can to accommodate California, \nCalifornia refuses to accommodate us.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. How much time is remaining on our side, Mr. \nPresident?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifty-eight minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes of the time to the ranking member \nof the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have been on the Appropriations Committee \nfor 20-some odd years, on the Judiciary Committee about the same amount \nof time, and I understand that periodically, out of necessity, we have \nsome items of legislation on the appropriations. But this is about as \namazing a step as we could take to determine the fate of the ninth \ncircuit on an appropriations bill.\n  It is not the way to do it. We say we are going to split the Nation's \nlargest court of appeals on this appropriations bill. We have had no \nhearings, no testimony, no public deliberations on the proposed split \nbefore us.\n  Well, the 45 million people that live in these nine Western States \ndeserve a more considered approach. What we ought to do is have the \nSenate Judiciary Committee hold hearings, conduct an independent study \nto determine whether this or any other proposed circuit division is \nnecessary, find out what is the best way to do it, and not just do it \nbasically based on one vote with very little debate in a committee, \nthen on the floor in an appropriations bill.\n  Last year, the Senate unanimously passed a bill to create a \nbipartisan commission to study if and how the ninth circuit should be \nrestructured. And that is what the House has done this year. The \namendment of the distinguished Senator from California [Mrs. \nFeinstein], is the same language as H.R. 908, the House-passed bill.\n  What the Senator from California has done is a principled approach. \nIt is also the approach supported by the majority of the judges and \nlawyers in the areas served.\n  Are there problems in the ninth circuit? Of course there are. Let me \npoint out to you, it is a problem not caused by the circuit, but by the \nU.S. Senate; 9 of the 28 judgeships in the ninth circuit are vacant. \nThere are nominees up here before the Senate.\n  As a result, the national average is 315 days to get a decision, but \nfor the ninth circuit, it is 429 days. We have people in the ninth \ncircuit who pay taxes like everybody else but who have to wait an extra \n114 days. In fact, the ninth circuit canceled 600 hearings this year \nbecause we cannot get judges confirmed to sit there.\n  And what does that mean? It means that a multimillion-dollar \nsettlement of a nationwide consumer class action against a maker of \nalleged defective minivans is not heard; a $71.7 million antitrust case \ninvolving the monopolizing of photocopy markets is not there; an \narsenic and lead poisoning class action case with a $68 million \nsettlement agreement is not being heard.\n  What is happening, Mr. President, is that we go on and try to do \nlittle quick fixes because somebody wants to at the moment on an \nappropriations bill.\n  What we ought to do, if we want to really do something to help \njustice in this country, is for the leadership of the Senate, that is, \nthose who schedule debate, in this case, the majority leader, to take \nsome of these judges and allow us to confirm them.\n  The distinguished senior Senator from Utah, the chairman of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, is on the floor. He has been working hard \nto get judges heard. But no matter how many we hear in the Judiciary \nCommittee, unless they are confirmed on the floor of the Senate, it \ndoes not do any good.\n  At this point, incidentally, we have confirmed--and we are down to \nthe seventh month of this session--we have confirmed six judges. We are \nabout to take another vacation. No more judges will be confirmed. That \nis less than one a month.\n  There are over 100 vacancies. We have about 40 or so nominees up here \nwaiting to be confirmed. We cannot even get them confirmed. Here is \none, William Fletcher, nominated in 1995; still waiting. Richard Paez, \nthe first month of 1996; still waiting. Margaret McKeown, March 1996; \nstill waiting. This goes on and on and on.\n  Here is what we have in vacancies--102 vacancies. This Senate has \nconfirmed six.\n  We all give speeches of needing judicial reform and needing law and \norder. You have a whole lot of courts where, because the U.S. Senate, \nbecause the leadership of the U.S. Senate will not let us confirm \njudges, we have courts where prosecutors have to kick cases out, that \nthey have to plea bargain and everything else because there are not \nenough judges to hear them.\n  Now, when you have proponents of the split of the ninth circuit say \nit is because justice is being denied, the reason justice is being \ndenied is not geography; the real reason justice is being denied is \nbecause judges are being delayed.\n  These are four well-qualified in the ninth circuit, four well-\nqualified people. In fact, they have the highest ratings there are. One \nnominee has actually been favorably reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee, but no--no--action here.\n  What is happening, Mr. President, is not something that is going to \nget fixed by the Judiciary Committee, but is going to get fixed if the \nU.S. Senate does the duty it is supposed to. If we have judges here \npeople do not like, vote them down. We held up the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral of the United States, Eric Holder, week after week. ``Oh, we've \ngot Senators, we cannot tell you their names, of course, but we have \nSenators who have real problems, real problems with this man. We can't \nbring him to a vote. We've got real problems.''\n  We brought it to a vote. I asked for a rollcall vote. I thought, \nwell, at least let all those Senators, unnamed Senators, who had an \nexcuse for holding the No. 2 law enforcement officer of this country--I \nsaid, now we will know who they are, because, obviously, they have \nproblems that they would hold up this man all these months, so they \nwill vote against him. And the clerk called the roll.\n  And do you know what it was? You know how many voted against him? You \nsay, maybe 30? Probably 20, 10, I ask my good friend, the ranking \nmember? You know how many it was?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. How many?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Zero. I cannot quite say it--I cannot quite say it like my \ngood friend from South Carolina. He is the only person I know who can \nget five syllables in the word ``zero,'' but zero. It was 100 to \nnothing; 100 to nothing.\n  But what we have is, while the Judicial Conference, Chief Justice \nRehnquist was asking for more justices, we have 27 vacancies in the \ncourt of appeals. We have all kinds of problems. And the ninth circuit \nis not\n\n[[Page S8046]]\n\ngoing to be helped by politicizing it on an appropriations bill.\n  The ninth circuit can at least be helped by doing what the Senator \nfrom California said, have a nonpartisan professional panel look, make \na recommendation, go to the Senate Judiciary Committee, vote it up or \ndown, which is exactly what we should be doing on these judges. If we \ndo not want them, vote them down.\n  But what we have is always some mysterious person who has a problem. \nBut when we have to vote in the light of day, there is no mysterious \nperson at all because they vote for them. So, Mr. President, I know \nthere are others who wish to speak.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter be printed in \nthe Record addressed to Majority Leader Lott from all the leaders of \nseven national legal groups, asking him to finally move these judges \nthat are being held hostage.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                     American Bar Association,\n\n                                                    July 14, 1997.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     The President, The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     The Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President and Mr. Majority Leader: Among the \n     constitutional responsibilities entrusted to the President \n     and the Senate, none is more essential to the foundation upon \n     which our democracy rests than the appointment of justices \n     and judges to serve at all levels of the federal bench. \n     Notwithstanding the intensely political nature of the \n     process, historically this critical duty has been carried out \n     with bipartisan cooperation to ensure a highly qualified and \n     effective federal judiciary.\n       There is a looming crisis in the Nation brought on by the \n     extraordinary number of vacant federal judicial positions and \n     the resulting problems that are associated with delayed \n     judicial appointments. There are 102 pending judicial \n     vacancies, or 11% of the number of authorized judicial \n     positions. A record 24 of these Article III positions have \n     been vacant for more than 18 months. Those courts hardest hit \n     are among the nation's busiest; for example, the Ninth \n     Circuit Court of Appeals has 9 of its 28 positions vacant. At \n     the district court level, six states have unusually high \n     vacancy rates: 10 in California, 8 in Pennsylvania, 6 in New \n     York, 5 in Illinois, and 4 each in Texas and Louisiana.\n       The injustice of this situation for all of society cannot \n     be overstated. Dangerously crowded dockets, suspended civil \n     case dockets, burgeoning criminal caseloads, overburdened \n     judges, and chronically undermanned courts undermine our \n     democracy and respect for the supremacy of law.\n       We, the undersigned representatives of national legal \n     organizations, call upon the President and the Senate to \n     devote the time and resources necessary to expedite the \n     selection and confirmation process for federal judicial \n     nominees. We respectfully urge all participants in the \n     process to move quickly to resolve the issues that have \n     resulted in these numerous and longstanding vacancies in \n     order to preserve the integrity of our justice system.\n\n         N. Lee Cooper, President, American Bar Association; U. \n           Lawrence Boze, President, National Bar Association; \n           Hugo Chavaino, President, Hispanic National Bar \n           Association; Paul Chan, President, National Asian \n           Pacific American Bar Association; Howard Twiggs, \n           President, Association of Trial Lawyers of America; \n           Sally Lee Foley, President, National Association of \n           Women Lawyers; Juliet Gee, President, National \n           Conference of Women's Bar Association.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, let us also not add to the partisanship we \nhave had with stopping judges from being confirmed by now showing even \nmore of a capricious nature on the part of the U.S. Senate by splitting \nthe ninth circuit with no hearings, no debate, no thoughtful \nconsideration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I just mention briefly there have been \nconsiderable hearings on this issue, testimony before our committee on \nthis issue, and the matter has been around and been discussed at length \nin a variety of forums.\n  Mr. President, how much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seventy-seven minutes and eighteen seconds.\n  Mr. GREGG. And the Senator from California has?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-nine minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. We have 77 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield, in sequence, 5 minutes to the Senator from Utah \nand 20 minutes to the Senator from Montana, if that is acceptable.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nappropriations provision effecting a split of the Ninth U.S. Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, and to respectively oppose the amendment offered by \nmy colleague from California. Splitting the ninth circuit is \nappropriate at this time for three principal reasons: First, its size. \nThe ninth circuit is the largest of the 13 federal circuits. Indeed, \nthe ninth circuit is larger than the 1st, 2d, 3d, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th \nand 11th circuits combined. The population of the States comprising the \nninth circuit is 49,358,941, almost one-fifth of the Nation's \npopulation. The size of the circuit also has an effect on the caseloads \nof the judges of the circuit. The ninth circuit's caseload in recent \nyears has been in excess of 7,000 cases a year, far and away more than \nin any other circuit.\n  The second reason to support this proposal is a function of the \nfirst. The ninth circuit's size also negatively impacts the internal \nconsistency of law within the circuit. There are currently 28 seats on \nthe ninth circuit, and many who are claiming that Congress should \nsignificantly add to that number at least 10 more seats--so, 38 seats. \nA circuit comprised of so many judges is entirely unmanageable and \nundermines important considerations of judicial economy, efficiency and \ncollegiality. Because the circuit is so large its judges cannot sit \ntogether to hear cases en banc as do other circuits, and accordingly \nthe court has lost the necessary sense of judicial collegiality, and \ncoherence of its circuit-wide case law. I would venture that there are \nas many contradictory rules of law within the ninth circuit as there \nare within all the other circuits combined. This has, I believe, \ncontributed to a trend by which some ninth circuit judges feel totally \nfree to disregard precedent, be it circuit precedent or even the \nSupreme Court's rulings. Just this past term, the ninth circuit had an \nastounding reversal rate of 95 percent before the Supreme Court. \nTwenty-eight of 29 cases were reversed. And the usual rate is no less \nthan 75 percent of their cases are reversed. One ninth circuit judge \nhas expressed chagrin at this regrettable situation, explaining that \n``the circuit is too large and has too many cases--making it impossible \nto keep abreast of ninth circuit decisions.''\n  The third cost of having such a large circuit is the resulting delay \nin having cases decided. The ninth circuit is, in fact, one of the \nslowest in turning around case decisions from the time of filing. And, \nbecause of its size, some cases, especially high-profile ones, appear \nto be subject to manipulation.\n  These important considerations have persuaded me that the ninth \ncircuit should be split. And, I am happy to report that I believe some \nof my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, from States within the \nninth circuit, will vote against the present amendment, and support the \nsplit provided for in the present bill.\n  And finally, I would like to say a word about the way in which this \nproposed split has come to the floor. Some argue that a significant \ndevelopment like splitting a judicial circuit should not arise in the \ncontext of an appropriations bill--that the committee of jurisdiction, \nin this case the Judiciary Committee, should have the opportunity to \nreview and comment about this proposal. I could not agree more with the \nproposition that this is a serious matter, deserving serious \nconsideration. I point out, however, that the Judiciary Committee has \nindeed examined the advisability of splitting the ninth circuit. In \njust the last Congress, the Judiciary Committee held hearings on the \nsubject, hearing from judges of the circuit and others knowledgeable \nabout the implications of a split. After that hearing, the committee \nreported out a bill that, in many regards, is similar to the one before \nthe Senate today.\n  Accordingly, I am confident that the Senate has before it today a \nwell-considered and desperately needed proposal to divide the ninth \ncircuit. This is a proposal that serves the interests of judicial \nefficiency, stable case law,\n\n[[Page S8047]]\n\nand equal justice for Americans within the ninth circuit.\n  With all due respect, therefore, I must take exception to the \nproposed commission my colleague from California is now offering by way \nof an amendment. I think the time for a split of the ninth circuit is \nnow. I believe we have studied the matter thoroughly, and that there is \nno need for further hearings or a commission.\n  Frankly, I would expect that, were we in fact to proceed with another \ncommission, it would simply make a recommendation similar to the Hruska \nreport of nearly 25 years ago--namely, to divide the State of \nCalifornia. I don't have any doubt in my mind that that is what a \nfuture commission will decide, because if you want to get population \nequality, you are going to have to divide California. This does not do \nthat, in deference to the Governor of California and, I might add, the \ntwo Senators from California, and to the various Congresspeople from \nCalifornia. And I might add, should this amendment succeed--the \namendment of the distinguished Senator from California--and a \ncommission be created that ultimately recommends splitting California, \nI may well be compelled, as will others in this body, to support that \nsplit and finally put this matter to rest. So this is dangerous stuff \nto be playing around with because I believe that there will be a split \nof California if you go the commission route.\n  Now, while I recognize that many are greatly concerned about the \nprospect of dividing the State of California, I have to tell everybody \ntoday that this is pretty certain to result if this amendment is \nenacted.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment offered by my \ncolleague from California. I believe, in the best interests of all \nconcerned, this is an adequate and reasonable response. And, frankly, \nwe have given States within the total area to be divided their right to \nchoose which circuit they will belong to. I think that is an \nappropriate, reasonable, decent way to proceed. Otherwise, we are just \ndelaying this another 2, 3 years, and we will come up with another \nsplit of California, which will be vigorously fought against by Members \nof the California delegation in both the House and Senate, and we will \nwind up right back where we are, or California will be split. If it is \nsplit, I think it would be to the disadvantage of California, as I view \nit.\n  I hope our colleagues will vote down this amendment, as well-\nintentioned as it is, and will vote for this split, because it would be \na split that would, I think, bring about collegiality, and it will \nbring about a better functioning two circuits, and it will give the \nStates who want the split a chance to have their own circuit, where \nthey can work together in the best interests of their States.\n  If California continues to be the most reversible set of judges in \nthe Nation, then they will have to live with that. Then everybody will \nknow exactly who are the people that are doing this, who are the \njudicial activists, the ones undermining the judicial system, and are \nreally causing California the pain, struggles, and difficulties that \ncome from an out-of-control, judicially activist Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I do not see the Senator from Nevada \nat the moment. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 48 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Washington \n[Mrs. Murray].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray] is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Feinstein \namendment. We simply should not--must not--divide the Ninth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals on an appropriations bill. It is an irresponsible way \nto proceed with such a fundamentally important question about how we \nbest administer justice in the West.\n  I want to remind my colleagues that this body, the Senate, in the \n104th Congress twice approved a study commission bill. In June, the \nHouse of Representatives sent us a bill, H.R. 908, establishing a \nsimilar commission. That bill is waiting at the desk for our action. \nHouse Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde has voiced his dismay at this end \nrun around his authorizing committee. Tuesday he wrote to Chairman \nHatch, saying: ``As you well know, altering the structure of the \nFederal judicial system is a serious matter. It is something that \nCongress does rarely, and only after careful consideration.''\n  Mr. President, I am not necessarily opposed to a split of the ninth \ncircuit, but I am adamantly opposed to an appropriation's rider \nmandating such a gerrymandered split. As Chairman Hyde suggested, we \nneed judicial experts thoroughly analyzing the courts and advising us \non what makes sense from a national perspective.\n  With so many of those who work directly in the ninth circuit opposed \nto this split, it seems clear we need guidance before we act. The White \nHouse opposes this split, the majority of judges on the ninth circuit \noppose this split, and the majority of bar associations of the affected \nStates oppose this split. Simply put, this is not the right way to \nproceed.\n  We need answers to some important questions first. How much will this \ncost? Should we create a virtual one-state court? Should Arizona become \na part of the tenth circuit? Where should we place a new circuit's \ncourthouse? How many judges should serve in each circuit and from which \nStates should they come? Should we break the ninth circuit into three \ncircuits? How will our Pacific maritime law be affected? Before I \nparticipate in breaking up an institution that is more than 100 years \nold, I want those--and many more questions--answered.\n  Mr. President, I also have another concern. I find it interesting \nthat supporters of this rider so often refer to the pace at which the \nninth circuit does its business. Yet, these same Senators have done \nlittle or nothing to fill the many vacancies plaguing the ninth \ncircuit. An outstanding member of the Washington State legal community, \nMargaret McKeown, has been languishing for nearly 2 years in this body. \nShe has yet to receive a hearing. This is unconscionable and this has \nreal impact on the administration of justice. To make the ninth \ncircuit--or any circuit--work, we must have judges. Let's get the \nconfirmation process moving, and that will stop the glacial pace that \npeople are concerned about.\n  Finally, I want to remind my colleagues that we have passed almost \nevery fiscal year 1998 appropriations bill without contentious riders. \nWe should have learned from the disaster relief bill what can happen \nwhen these riders dominate the process. I believe we should maintain \nthe bipartisan approach we've used so far and avoid letting this \nimportant bill get bogged down with riders.\n  Let's do our appropriations job right and let's do the very serious \njob of reconfiguring the judiciary right. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Feinstein amendment establishing a commission to guide the \nCongress on how best to resolve any real or perceived difficulties in \nthe administration of justice in the ninth circuit.\n  I yield my time back to the Senator from California.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment that would \nstrike the provision from the Commerce, State, Justice appropriations \nbill to divide the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. We have heard so \nmuch said today about how the bar associations oppose it, the judges \noppose it, and nobody has said anything about the people. Are they \nsecondary in our justice system? We are supposed to be serving the \npeople, and I think the bar associations do, too. I happen to believe \nthat they believe very strongly in the kind of service that they \ndeliver to their clientele. But we haven't heard that today.\n  If there were a judicial equivalent of baseball's famous ``Mendoza \nline,'' marking the mediocre batting average of .200 below which \nplayers dread dropping, then the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals \nwould be laboring in the farm leagues.\n  In terms of the rate at which its decisions are reversed by the U.S. \nSupreme Court, the ninth circuit's record for failure is practically \nunblemished. In recent years, on average, more than 80 percent of \nrulings by the ninth have\n\n[[Page S8048]]\n\nbeen overturned. This past term, the Supreme Court reviewed 29 cases \nfrom the ninth circuit--it reversed, in part or in whole, an \nastonishing 28 of them.\n  The ninth circuit in 1996-97 alone was reversed, often 9 to 0, on \ndecisions asserting the right to die, requiring sheriffs to conduct \nfederally required but unfunded background checks on people who buy \nguns, and denying the right of groups who were economically harmed by \nthe Endangered Species Act to sue even though the law gives legal \nstanding to any person.\n  While the high court undoubtedly chooses many cases with the express \nintent of reversing them, the ninth circuit this past year has wrecked \nthe curve. For instance, the eighth circuit, which had the second-most \ncases reviewed, had a reversal-and-affirmance record of only 4 to 4.\n  But ``this isn't baseball,'' says Judge Stephen S. Trott of Boise, \nID, according to a recent Los Angeles Times article.\n  Agreed. The jurisprudence of our Federal appellate court system is \nfar more serious than a game. In my view, the fact that the ninth \ncircuit is undeniably out of step with the rest of the Nation is \nperhaps the least of the multitude of reasons to consider splitting \nthis giant court.\n\n  First, the ninth circuit outstrips the other circuits in all measures \nof size, both physically and legally. The ninth circuit encompasses a \nland mass the size of Western Europe. Its nine States and two \nterritories--Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, \nNevada, Oregon, Washington, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands--\nstretch from the Arctic Circle south to the United States-Mexico border \nand west across the international dateline. It has a population of \nnearly 50 million people, about 1 in 5 Americans, and is expected to \ngrow by 43 percent over just the next 13 years.\n  Second, the ninth's caseload is the largest. More than 8,500 appeals \nwere filed last year, and that number is expected to jump by nearly 700 \npercent in the next 25 years, making the ninth less than a model of \nfair and speedy justice. In fact, of the 11 regional circuits and the \nDistrict of Columbia circuit, it ranks next-to-worst in the duration of \npending appeals--an average of 429 days, usually more for criminal \ncases, compared to the national average of 315 days.\n  These delays are costly. Appeals take time and money, and they're \nputting the squeeze on my State. Litigants and attorneys who must make \nfrequent and expensive trips to San Francisco are pleading for reform.\n  Third, the problems of geography and population are two factors that \ncontribute to judicial inconsistency on the ninth. Because the 28 \njudgeships of the ninth--nearly twice the maximum number recommended by \nthe U.S. Judicial Conference--are scattered so far and wide, the court \nhas experimented with limited en banc proceedings in which a panel of \n11 judges decides the most important cases. By relaying on this \napproach, conflicting court decisions are common. The right hand \ndoesn't know what the left hand is doing. As a result, decisions by the \nninth are often narrow and set few precedents for use by judges in \nother cases.\n  In fact, several of the Supreme Court Justices criticized the Ninth \nCircuit's en banc decision in Washington versus Glucksberg that the due \nprocess clause of the 14th amendment guarantees critically ill \nindividuals a limited right to assisted suicide. Even some liberal \nmembers of the Court, such as Justice Ginsburg, expressed concern that \nthe Ninth Circuit opinion seemed to give Federal courts a ``dangerous \npower.''\n  Size was a factor leading a congressional commission in 1973 to urge \nsplitting the fifth and ninth circuits. Congress chose to split the \nfifth, while the ninth has become bogged down in political squabbles \nand has had to make due with its enormous size.\n  One cannot make the argument this has not been heard, or that it has \nnot been studied when in actuality it has.\n  Some press accounts have portrayed the debate as a clash of party \nideologies, of conservatives who favor the split versus liberals who do \nnot. But such a view is short-sighted. These press accounts overlook \nthe bipartisan support behind dividing the ninth. For many of us, it is \njust as simple as wanting a court that is closer in every sense to the \npeople it serves.\n  Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy has publicly noted the merit of \ndivision. The U.S. Department of Justice has recently said ``the sheer \nsize of the Ninth Circuit, even without its attendant management \ndifficulties, argues for its division.'' Montana Governor Marc Racicot, \na former State attorney general, favors the idea. And I would now like \nto submit a letter from Governor Racicot supporting this split.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                           Office of the Governor,\n\n\n                                             State of Montana,\n\n                                        Helena, MT, July 22, 1997.\n     Senator Conrad Burns,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington DC.\n       Dear Senator Burns: I would like to submit this letter in \n     support of an amendment to the appropriations bill for the \n     Departments of Commerce, Justice and State, the Judiciary, \n     and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     1998. The amendment would divide the Ninth Circuit Court of \n     Appeals and create a Twelfth Circuit Court of Appeals made up \n     of the states of Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, \n     Oregon, and Washington. As you know, I have been supportive \n     of this effort for a long time and I continue to support the \n     proposal for the reasons stated below.\n       The Ninth Circuit, of which Montana is currently a part, is \n     simply too large to effectively respond to the needs of those \n     it serves. That Court has 28 judges making decisions for 9 \n     states and 2 territories, with a population of between 40 and \n     50 million people in an area that encompasses about fourteen \n     million square miles. The next largest circuit has a \n     population of under 30 million. California cases alone \n     represent over half of the Ninth Circuit's caseload and the \n     number of judges exceeds by twelve the next largest appellate \n     court, the Fifth Circuit, and is sixteen more than the \n     average appellate bench. I cannot imagine anyone making a \n     compelling argument that a judicial unit of government this \n     size can be administratively efficient.\n       As you know, our system of jurisprudence relies upon the \n     principle of ``stare decisis'' or precedent. With a circuit \n     and court so large, most cases must be heard by smaller \n     panels of judges, with increased reliance upon staff and \n     summary procedures. With 28 judges, there are over 3,276 \n     combinations of panels that may decide cases that involve \n     similar issues. This leads to conflicting and unpublished \n     opinions, reduced communications among judges and little \n     consistency in the court's determinations. The lack of \n     consistency in a court's decisions, in turn, makes our system \n     of justice unpredictable and unreliable. As a result, the \n     body of established precedent in the circuit can be rendered \n     meaningless. There is, in essence, a diminution of precedent, \n     which undermines the stability and predictability of the law, \n     and actually leads to increased litigation.\n       I have questioned whether the operational costs of such a \n     large system are comparatively higher. Travel expenses and \n     efficiency of judges and staff should be examined to \n     determine if significant efficiencies could be produced in a \n     smaller circuit. It is not true that a new circuit would \n     result in attorneys traveling to the same cities for argument \n     as before. Montana attorneys often are ordered to San \n     Francisco for argument.\n       The size of the Ninth Circuit also seems to bear upon the \n     length of time it takes to make decisions. The median time to \n     dispose of a case--from the time of filing a notice of appeal \n     to the final decision on the merits--is 14.6 months. \n     Arguments will be made that much of this time is consumed by \n     counsel rather than the Court; however, I can recall as \n     Montana's Attorney General waiting a long time for the Court \n     to decide cases for which the record had been submitted \n     months or years before.\n       Habeas corpus matters have taken up to 14 years in one \n     Montana case. It appears that the legitimate interest of the \n     public in reaching final resolution in these cases is not \n     given equal and appropriate consideration when balancing the \n     rights of petitioners. The resulting delays invite the kinds \n     of ``recreational'' use of the court system by inmates that \n     we have seen in recent years.\n       Opponents of splitting the Ninth Circuit argue that the \n     larger the circuit the more consistency in federal law and \n     mention that judges and attorneys have testified to a sense \n     of community which they enjoy with the existing appellate \n     courts. As I noted in the beginning of my letter, the size of \n     the Ninth Circuit bench has led to decision-making by panel, \n     the differing combinations of which leads inescapably to a \n     lack of consistency in precedential authority. And to argue \n     that judges and attorneys are comfortable with the status quo \n     is a position that, with all due respect, I would imagine \n     falls deaf on the ears of those who have been awaiting a \n     decision from the Court for many months or years.\n       I do not take the position that Montanans can only find \n     justice before a bench made up of Montana judges or judges \n     from neighboring states. And I am not moved to my position by \n     the political arguments of interest groups whose position on \n     S. 956 is based upon\n\n[[Page S8049]]\n\n     whether they wish their particular body of substantive law to \n     change or remain the same. However, I do not believe that the \n     original intent of the appellate court system, which was to \n     establish circuits which reflected a regional identity by \n     designating a manageable set of contiguous states that shared \n     a common background, is consistent with a circuit that serves \n     twenty million more people than most of the other circuits \n     and covers fourteen million square miles.\n       Suggestions to divide the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals \n     have apparently been proposed since before World War II. The \n     Hruska Commission (Commission on Revision of the Federal \n     Court Appellate System) in 1973 recommended dividing the \n     Fifth and the Ninth Circuits (the Fifth was subsequently \n     divided, but not the Ninth). Opponents of dividing circuits \n     recommend a variety of alternatives: consolidation of all \n     circuits into one large national court, dividing California \n     into two different circuits, and finally the familiar \n     solution of studying the problem further. I hope Congress \n     does not delay further correcting a situation that penalizes \n     those states in the Ninth Circuit for the incredible \n     population growth that has occurred in California and is \n     occurring in Nevada.\n       I strongly support the proposed amendment, because I think \n     it will solve some of the problems mentioned above and end \n     many of the frustrations we feel with the Ninth Circuit Court \n     of Appeals. If I can be of further assistance in your effort \n     to pass this proposal, please let me know.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Marc Racicot,\n                                                         Governor.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I would like to read one part of the \nGovernor's letter. He states ``the Ninth Circuit is simply too large to \neffectively respond to the needs of those it serves.'' State \nlegislatures of the Northwest consistently and overwhelmingly call on \nCongress to split the ninth circuit.\n  On the other hand, the bill is opposed by judges and lawyers in the \nninth circuit who would lose control over their fiefdoms. It is also \nopposed by special-interest groups that apparently care little about \nthe troubles that are caused by the ninth circuit.\n  Mr. President, as you may know, since I came to the Senate in 1989, I \nhave sponsored numerous bills and amendments that would achieve a split \nof the ninth circuit and I commend the Commerce, State Justice, \nSubcommittee on their willingness to again take up the fight in the \n105th Congress. It's an old axiom that justice delayed is justice \ndenied. For too long the people of the ninth circuit have been caught \nin the cogs of the wheels of justice. I want to put a stop to this \ninequity by dividing this court before its growth overwhelms us all.\n  Mr. President, in looking at what has been said by some, that it has \nnot been heard, that it has not been studied, let's just take a look \nand see what has been done since.\n  In 1974, the Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings on S. 729 to \nrealign the fifth and ninth. It was reported out of committee. Nothing \nhappened.\n  On March 7, 1984, the Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts held hearings \non S. 1156, the Ninth Court of Appeals Reorganization Act of 1983. No \naction was taken.\n  On March 6, 1990, the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts and \nAdministrative Practices held hearings on S. 948, the Ninth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals Reorganization Act of 1989. And there was no action \ntaken.\n  In 1990, the Intellectual Property and Administration of Justice \nCommittee held hearings on H.R. 4900, the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals Reorganization Act of 1990. Still no action was taken.\n  H.R. 3654 died in committee without hearings.\n  In 1995, the full Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings on S. 956, \nthe Court of Appeals Reorganization Act of 1995. An amended version \npassed the Senate by voice vote, but it died in the House Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  So it is not that this has not been looked at and studied. It has \nalways gotten bogged down.\n  Basically that is what we are talking about here. We continue to talk \nabout the bar association doesn't want it, the judges of the ninth \ndon't want it. When do we start listening to the people who have to use \nit?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER [Mr. Bennett]. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes of my time to the \ndistinguished Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if a litigant in the ninth circuit, which \ncovers the areas that have already been spoken of, has a case heard \nbefore a Federal district judge or a bankruptcy court and they are \ndispleased with how the case turns out, they have a right to appeal \nthat case. Under the framework of the courts that we have now in this \ncountry, that is appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San \nFrancisco.\n  That is what we are talking about here today--what happens when a \ncase is appealed from a lower Federal court to the ninth circuit, which \nis an intermediary step before it goes to the U.S. Supreme Court. That \nis what we are talking about. It is extremely important if you are \ninvolved in the judicial process. There isn't a court that is more \nimportant than a circuit court, a Federal circuit court of appeals.\n  We are very fortunate in the ninth circuit to have the chief judge of \nthe ninth circuit, not only one of the distinguished jurists of this \ncountry but also a graduate of Stanford Law School with a great \nacademic record, but, most important for this Senator, is a Nevadan, \nborn in Nevada, went to school in Nevada until he got into law school. \nWe didn't have a law school.\n  I have spent a lot of time with Judge Hug learning about the ninth \ncircuit. I would ask the Members of this body to reflect upon what the \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee said. The ninth circuit is \ndoing an excellent job. They are reducing caseload. In fact, even with \nnine vacancies, which the distinguished ranking member, the senior \nSenator from Vermont, established, the ninth circuit caseload is \ndecreasing--not increasing, decreasing. They have increased their \ntermination of cases by almost 1,000 from March 1996 to March 1997. \nThey are doing a good job even though they are handicapped because the \nSenate won't confirm the vacancies that they now have.\n  I, first of all, want to thank the distinguished Senator on the \nsubcommittee, Senator Gregg, for taking into account my concerns about \nthe split. I very much want this study to go forward, the amendment \nthat is now before this body. But if it doesn't go forward, it is \nimportant that the State of Nevada recognize people--recognize, as the \nchairman of the subcommittee recognized, that the State of Nevada is \nnow the most urban State in America. Ninety percent of the people live \nin the metropolitan areas of Reno and Las Vegas. We have tremendously \ndifficult judicial problems. Frankly, the way the State has changed \npopulationwise is we have a great deal in common with the more \npopulated areas of America.\n  We feel that it would be unfair to have the split any other way than \nit now is. There may be other and better ways to split this court. That \nis why this study is so important. That is why the U.S. Senate last \nyear passed a study saying let's take a look at all the circuit courts \nbefore a decision is made as to how you are going to split the ninth \ncircuit. We all have a feeling that the ninth circuit is large. It is \nlarger than most all of the other circuits. But the fact of the matter \nis, how can we determine how it should be split under the terms that it \nis now being done; that is, before the Appropriations Committee? It is \nbeing done for reasons that are not legal in nature. They are political \nin nature.\n\n  Judge Hug said, ``By adding a circuit-split provision as a rider to \nan appropriations bill, it would completely bypass the Judiciary \nCommittee and would seek to impose a new judicial structure on nine \nWestern States and the Pacific territories without appropriate \nhearings, public comment, or independent research subsequent of such \naction.''\n  Let's, in effect, have the experts take a look at what we should do. \nThe House passed a compromise very comparable to what we did last year. \nThe House passed a bill that says let's have the Chief Justice, the \nPresident of the United States, and the minority and majority leaders \nof the House and Senate pick people to serve on this 10-member \ncommission and to report back to us in 18 months as to what should be \ndone.\n  I think it would even be better, while all of this is going on, to \nfill the nine vacancies in the ninth circuit. People\n\n[[Page S8050]]\n\nare really concerned about the administration of justice. Let's have \nthe majority move those people through this body as quickly as \npossible.\n  The fifth circuit, the most recently split circuit, has only 1,000 \nfewer cases than the ninth circuit, and the eleventh circuit, the other \nhalf of the most recently split circuit, is the slowest circuit for \nfiling the disposition. It is not the ninth circuit, even though we are \nhamstrung and are short a significant number of judges. If you look at \nthe eleventh circuit, which has 1,000 fewer cases than the ninth \ncircuit, it takes them longer to dispose of a case than the ninth \ncircuit.\n  So the ninth circuit should be commended for the good work they are \ndoing with the limited resources they have.\n  Mr. President, there are some who say, ``Well, it is important that \nwe do this because California takes up so much of the ninth circuit.''\n  Another misstatement of fact: California doesn't do as much work in \nthe ninth circuit as, for example, the second circuit. The second \ncircuit, New York, has 86 percent of the filings; the ninth circuit, \nonly has 55 percent. The fifth circuit takes up 72 percent of the \nfilings; and the eleventh circuit, Florida, takes up 55 percent of the \ncases.\n  So, Mr. President, California is not the glutton that people have \nalleged it to be. They don't take up as many of the case filings as \nother circuits.\n  I would compare the qualifications of the ninth circuit judges--those \nappointed by Republican Presidents and those appointed by Democratic \nPresidents--with any other circuit. From the finest law schools in \nAmerica are the judges who serve on the ninth circuit. Five of the \nsenior judges in the ninth circuit were appointed by Republican \nPresidents; four by Democratic Presidents.\n  There has been a lot of talk in this body about the Hruska \nCommission. The Hruska Commission said, in 1974, you should split the \ncircuits. But let's listen to what the experts said about that. I have \na letter here dated July 17, 1997, from Arthur Helman, Professor of Law \nat the University of Pittsburgh. I will read parts of this letter. This \nis written to the president of the California State Bar Association.\n\n       Again, as the Deputy Executive Director of the Hruska \n     Commission, and as a scholar who has studied the ninth \n     circuit extensively during the intervening period, I am in as \n     good a position as anyone to shed light on this matter. My \n     conclusion is unequivocal. Such speculation is baseless.\n\n  Mr. President, this isn't some lawyer from California or some \nprofessor from California or anyone in the ninth circuit. This is the \nprofessor in the School of Law at the University of Pittsburgh.\n\n       My conclusion is unequivocal. Such speculation is baseless. \n     The circumstances that led to the Hruska Commission are no \n     longer present, and there is absolutely no reason to think \n     that a new commission would endorse such a proposal. Let me \n     be more specific. The Hruska Commission recommendation was \n     driven primarily by a single factor. The commission believes \n     that ``no circuit should be created which would immediately \n     require more than nine active judges.'' That was a realistic \n     possibility 25 years ago. Today it is not. In fact, of \n     existing circuits, all but one have more than nine active \n     judges. With the nine-judge circuit a relic of the past, a \n     new commission would have no reason to recommend a division \n     of California. A second consideration is also relevant. The \n     Hruska Commission held hearings in the ninth circuit, and, \n     although there was no consensus, several prominent California \n     judges expressed support for the idea of dividing California \n     between Federal judicial circuits.\n       I know that sounds implausible, but that only underscores \n     how much things have changed since the Hruska Commission \n     carried out its work 25 years ago. Plainly, no such support \n     would be forthcoming today without a record such as the one \n     of the Hruska Commission and with overwhelming opposition \n     from the California bar, no commission would recommend a \n     division of California. For all these reasons the speculation \n     you referred to is totally without foundation. Whatever \n     recommendations the new commission might make, I am confident \n     that dividing California into circuits will not be among \n     them.\n\n  Mr. President, in short, we should do the right thing. The right \nthing calls for having experts report back to us in a reasonable period \nof time. If they want to do it in a year, even though it would put a \ntremendous amount of work on them, I would accept that so that next \nyear at this time we could take appropriate action. But to go forward \nthe way we have done in the Appropriations Committee is bad. It is bad \nlegislation and makes this body look bad, and it is bad legislation \nbecause it makes our judicial system look real bad. It has never ever \nhappened before that we have divided a circuit court the way we are \nabout to do it now. The lives of people depend on what we do today. \nCases that are appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court come from these \ncircuits. I suggest we follow the recommendation of the amendment that \nis now before this body.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for yielding in \nopposition to the Feinstein amendment and hope that the Senate would \nconcur with the findings of the committee. Commerce, State, Justice \nappropriations has dealt in what I believe is an appropriate way with \nthe issue of the ninth circuit court. There should be no surprises. \nThis is simply not a new issue. I have always felt, and I think many \nconcur, that if you want to not resolve an issue, you create a \ncommission and study something once again, and we know that this has \nbeen studied and recommendations have been made.\n  In 1973, the Hruska Commission suggested that the ninth and the fifth \ncircuits be split, and the fifth circuit was split, the ninth was not. \nThere was simply too much political controversy around it. My guess is \ntoday it is a lot more about politics than it is about justice, justice \nto the citizens of our country who deserve a timely process in the \ncourts, and certainly with the ninth circuit court being as large as it \nis, as other Senators have spoken to this afternoon, justice \nappropriately and timely rendered is the question.\n  It has been mentioned--I believe the Senator from Montana mentioned \nthat the ninth circuit averages 429 days and that the medium national \ntime average is 315 days. When you are in the midst of a lawsuit, do \nyou set it aside? Do you quit spending money? Do you stop the retainer \nof the attorneys representing you? I doubt it. And that clock ticks on \nand the money accumulates, and the cost is high and justice goes \nunrendered.\n  Then the question in this very extended court is to whether the \njustice is appropriate. The Senator from Utah referenced the number of \ntimes the Supreme Court this year has overruled the ninth circuit. \nThose are all part of the issues that brought the citizens of Idaho to \nme and to my colleague, Senator Kempthorne, to suggest that it was time \nwe dealt with this issue, that it had been since 1973 that the issue \nwas found to be one of division, one of the appropriate allocation of \nStates, money, and judges, and that simply has not occurred.\n  I hope that we would deal with this.\n  The bill before us today would put California, Nevada, Guam, and the \nNorthern Marianas in the ninth circuit. It would also create a new \ntwelfth circuit including Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Hawaii, Oregon, and \nWashington. I am currently a cosponsor of Senator Murkoswki's bill, S. \n431, which splits the ninth circuit a little differently. However, I \nfind the division in the Gregg-Stevens amendment to be very well though \nout and fair. I think either split of the ninth circuit would work much \nbetter than the current organization of the ninth circuit.\n  The subject of dividing the ninth circuit split has been discussed \nnow for many years. In fact, as long as 1973, the Hruska Commission \nsuggested the ninth and fifth circuits should be split. Although the \nfifth circuit was divided, the ninth was not. Ever since then, the \ndebate about splitting the ninth circuit has roared on.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, I am perplexed why there is any question \nabout this proposal. The ninth circuit is by the largest circuit in the \nUnited States. It currently employs 28 judges--11 more than any other \ncircuit. The U.S. Judicial Conference has called any circuit with more \nthan 15 judges unworkable. I guess that means, in the opinion of the \nJudicial Conference, we have an unworkable situation.\n  The ninth circuit currently serves 45 million people. This is 60 \npercent more than the next largest district. The Census Bureau has \nestimated that by 2010, the population in the ninth circuit will top 63 \nmillion people, an increase of 40\n\n[[Page S8051]]\n\npercent. The situation has worsened since the Hruska Commission \nsuggested a split of the ninth circuit--a trend certain to continue \nwith further delay.\n  Over the years of debate on this issue, there has been much \ndiscussion of inconsistency and unmanageable caseloads. I would like to \nchange the focus of the argument for just a moment and instead look at \nthe impact on the people of the ninth circuit, which includes the \npeople of Idaho. The size of the ninth circuit also has quite an effect \non these individuals.\n  The ninth circuit averages 429 days from filing to concluding an \nappeal. This is much longer than the national median time of 315 days. \nThis affects the individuals who resort to the judicial system to \nresolve a dispute in their lives. It's been said that people in this \ncountry want and expect swift, efficient justice and I think they \ndeserve it.\n  It is not fair for the people in the ninth circuit to be subjected to \nthis inefficiency. People want their disputes to be solved quickly so \nthey can go on with their lives. A lawsuit has the ability to consume \neverything else in one's life. In the ninth circuit, it consumes their \nlives for a longer period of time. Also, during this extended process, \nthese individuals are forced to continue paying legal fees. Mr. \nPresident, I ask you if 100 extra days in litigation sounds like swift \njustice.\n  The huge backlog that develops can lead to different sorts of \nproblems in the Northwest. The economic stability of the Northwest is \nthreatened when suits involving, for example, the timber industry are \nforced into the backlog of inefficiency.\n  It is unquestioned that the ninth circuit covers a huge area. \nHowever, when that is combined with the 7,000 new filings the circuit \nhad last year, it becomes almost impossible to keep abreast of legal \ndevelopments in the circuit. The result is everchanging judicial \npatterns that inevitably make conflicting rulings. This leads to \njudicial inconsistency, which is not good for the system, or the people \nwho seek relief through the system. This might help to explain the fact \nthat the ninth circuit has an 82 percent rate of reversal by the \nSupreme Court of the United States. Mr. President, I ask you if this \nsounds like efficient justice.\n  Opponents of this legislation argue that the extreme size and \npopulation of the ninth circuit is not enough of a reason to support a \nsplit. However, that was the exact reason for the split of the former \neighth circuit, which created the tenth circuit. It was also the exact \nreason for dividing the fifth circuit and creating the eleventh \ncircuit. In fact, as I said before, when the fifth circuit was split, \nit was suggested that the ninth circuit be split as well.\n  Opponents also argue for the need of a new commission to determine \nthe need for a split of the ninth circuit. Twenty-five years ago the \nsuggestion of just such a commission was to split the ninth circuit. It \nhas grown since then, and is continuing to grow. The proposed split has \nbeen discussed for many years now, including Senate Judiciary hearings. \nThere is more than enough data currently in the record to make an \ninformed decision, and that decision should be to split the ninth \ncircuit.\n  Mr. President, this situation has been a long time in coming. It is \nnow time for us to act. The split of the fifth circuit worked 25 years \nago, so there is no reason we should not expect similar success with \nthe ninth circuit. It is time that we recognize the competing interests \nof the differing regions in the ninth circuit and split them up. I ask \nthat my colleagues support the split of the ninth circuit in the \ninterest of returning swift, efficient justice to the people of the \nninth circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I stand in favor \nof the pending Feinstein amendment calling for a study to decide \nwhether the people would be better served by splitting the ninth \ncircuit and, if so, how to split the ninth circuit.\n  Mr. President, I am very fortunate at this time to be sitting on the \nAppropriations Committee, and I knew when I took a seat on that \ncommittee it was very powerful. Mr. President, I know you sit on that \ncommittee as well, and we are proud to be there. But, in my opinion, I \nnever believed the Appropriations Committee would take it upon itself \nto determine how to split the ninth circuit. It seems to me if we are \ngoing to undertake this, it ought to be a study. The study ought to go \nto the Judiciary Committee, of which my distinguished colleague, \nSenator Feinstein, is a member. That is the proper way to serve the \npeople we represent.\n  Congress has redrawn circuit boundaries only twice since creating the \nmodern appellate system in 1891. So only twice has Congress stepped in. \nCongress has never divided a circuit without the support of the circuit \njudges and the organized bar. The judges and lawyers of the ninth \ncircuit overwhelmingly oppose the split without first studying it. The \nFederal Bar Association and the bar associations of California, \nArizona, Nevada, Montana, Idaho, and Hawaii have all passed resolutions \nexpressing their opposition to splitting the circuit. The Ninth Circuit \nJudicial Council, the governing body for all the courts in the ninth \ncircuit, is unanimous in their opposition to splitting the circuit.\n  The last time splitting up the ninth circuit was studied was during \nthe Hruska Commission in 1973, and the principal authors of that \nreport, Judge Charles Wiggins of Nevada and former Deputy Executive \nDirector of the Hruska Commission, Professor Arthur Hellman, agree that \nits recommendation to split the ninth circuit is outdated and they \noppose a split without first conducting a study. And that, of course, \nis what the pending amendment is about, to have a study first.\n  Now, we hear many comments in this Chamber, and I heard them in \ncommittee, about the delay at the ninth circuit. Any delay in total \ncase processing time is clearly due to unfilled vacancies. I have heard \nthis over and over. There are 28 judicial seats on the ninth circuit. \nOf these 28, there are only 19 active judges. So clearly we have not \ndone our job here, and it seems to me justice delayed is justice \ndenied, and we better get busy.\n  We have some excellent nominees pending before the Senate and before \nthe Committee on the Judiciary. And I tell you, I have been quite \nfrustrated that we cannot seem to get these nominations up before the \nbody but yet we can seem to bring a split of the ninth circuit with all \nits ramifications here in lickety-split time without much study. I find \nit very, very ironic when we have the most qualified candidates who \nhave been selected by Republicans and Democrats alike sitting and \nwaiting here in excess of a year and a half, 2 years.\n  We hear about the high reversal rate at the ninth circuit, and \nclearly there is a high reversal, if you look at it this way --28 of 29 \ncases. However, the Supreme Court elects to hear only a tiny fraction \nof the more than 4,000 final dispositions issued annually by the \ncircuit. So thousands of cases stand and then 28 of 29 that they chose \nto hear they reversed.\n  But, Mr. President, it is interesting. Four other circuits have \nhigher reversal rates than the ninth circuit. The first, second, \nseventh, and D.C. circuits are all reversed 100 percent of the time.\n  We also hear that California judicial philosophy dominates the ninth \ncircuit. Ten of the circuits' nineteen active judges actually sit \noutside California: Arizona, Nevada, and Idaho each have two judges; \nMontana, Washington, Oregon, and Alaska each have one. And the circuit \njudges are evenly split between Republicans and Democrats. Of the \ncourt's 19 active judges, Mr. President, 10 were nominated by \nRepublican Presidents and 9 by Democratic Presidents. So many of the \narguments that we hear today seem to me to be rather specious.\n  Then we hear the argument that this is very cost efficient, but no \none talks about costs of the splitting up of the ninth circuit, and \nthose would be substantial. Creation of a new twelfth circuit would \nrequire duplicate offices of clerk of court, circuit executive, staff \nattorneys, settlement attorneys, libraries, courtrooms, and mail and \ncomputer facilities, at an annual cost of $1.3 million.\n\n[[Page S8052]]\n\n  Now, it may be that this money would be well spent. I certainly am \nvery, very open to splitting this court. That is not a problem for me. \nThe problem for me is how we go about it. Before we invest this money \nevery year plus the $3 million startup costs, and an additional $2 \nmillion for leasing space, it seems to me we ought to have a study.\n  So I strongly support the Feinstein amendment. I am proud to be a \ncosponsor of it. I hope that wisdom will prevail.\n  I thank the Chair for its patience. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nOregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I have a prepared statement, but \nI am going to divert from it and frankly just speak from my heart, from \nmy experience. My experience is not long in this Chamber. But my \nexperience among the people of Oregon is very recent. And my experience \nthere with people causes me to rise in opposition to the amendment of \nthe Senator from California. I am reluctant to do that for a personal \nreason. I am one of Senator Feinstein's great admirers. She may not \nknow that, but I think she is a terrific human being. But I have an \nobligation to speak as best I can for the people who elected me.\n  I believe this may be an imperfect process. Maybe it should not be a \nrider to a bill. But I am very aware that for 25 years this issue has \nbeen debated in this Chamber, and we have had study after study after \nstudy, and what we are beginning to develop is a feeling among the \nelectorate that when going for justice in the ninth circuit, that \njustice will be denied. So I think there is a lot of frustration on the \npart of many of us here that we have to do whatever we can and stop \nstudying and stop delaying and start doing. So I feel very strongly \nabout this.\n  I have heard many arguments today that have merit on a procedural \nbasis. Yes, maybe many of the legal profession oppose this. But many \npeople support this.\n  We have heard charges of gerrymandering. I have a map of the United \nStates and the circuit courts of this country. They are saying we are \ngerrymandering on the west coast of the United States, but I notice \nthat nearly every State on the east coast of the United States is in a \ndifferent circuit. There are five circuits that cover the Eastern \nUnited States, and those circuits have the lowest reversal rates, taken \ntogether, of any region in the country. I think we need to change it.\n  So I rise to support what Senator Gregg is doing. I thank him for \nthat. I thank him for his leadership. He doesn't have a dog in the \nfight of the ninth circuit, but a lot of us do. So I thank him for \nthat.\n  I join my colleagues in opposition to this amendment to strike the \nprovision in this bill to divide the Ninth Circuit of the U.S. Court of \nAppeals. This may not be the most perfect solution to a difficult \nproblem, but I believe that it provides a platform from which to \nrelieve the caseload and reversal rate of the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. Serving more than 45 million people and spanning 1.4 million \nsquare miles, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals handles more than \n8,500 filings a year--with a reversal rate of 96 percent. By the year \n2010, the ninth circuit population will increase in size by 43 percent.\n  While my colleague from California may argue that this is an issue \nfor further study, I would like to remind my colleagues that the Senate \nhas studied this issue for almost a quarter century and has reported \nlegislation to split the ninth circuit on three separate occasions. \nClearly, the time has come to act.\n  I want to conclude by reading the comments of some judges who support \nwhat is happening here, because some have been read to the reverse.\n  Mr. President, we are not simply legislating without just cause. The \njudges that serve in the ninth circuit have given us cause to act \nwithout further delay. Judge Diarmuid O'Scannlain from my state of \nOregon has stated:\n\n       We (the ninth circuit) cannot grow without limit. As the \n     number of opinions increases, we judges risk losing the \n     ability to know what our circuit's law is. In short, bigger \n     is not necessarily better. The ninth circuit will ultimately \n     need to be split.\n\n  I replaced a great senator, Senator Mark O. Hatfield who served in \nthis Chamber for 30 years. He said:\n\n       The ninth circuit's size has created serious problems: too \n     many judges spending more time and money traveling than \n     hearing cases, a growing backlog of cases which threaten to \n     bury each judge, a dangerous inability to keep up with \n     current case law, a breakdown in judicial collegiality and, \n     most importantly, a failure to provide uniformity, stability \n     and predictability in the development of federal law \n     throughout the Western region. It is increasingly clear that \n     these problems cannot be solved by the reforms already \n     implemented by the Court. These arguments adequately state \n     the case for the division of the circuit. We delay at our \n     peril.\n\n  Mr. President, justice delayed is justice denied. I ask my colleagues \nto join me in opposing this amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, how much time is left on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire controls 46 \nminutes. The Senator from California controls 27 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Does the Senator from California mind if we take another \nspeaker?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Not at all.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield to the Senator from Idaho for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, may I commend the Senator from New \nHampshire for his efforts on this issue. I applaud him on that. It is \nlong overdue. Therefore, I must rise in opposition to the Senator from \nCalifornia, for whom I have the utmost respect. She and I happen to \nhave served as mayors in this country at the same time. I prefer it \nwhen we are on the same side of an issue. I look forward to that day \nagain.\n  The time to alleviate the problems being faced by the ninth circuit \nhas long been passed. It is time for us to deal with this. The proposal \nto realign the ninth circuit was first considered by the Senate nearly \n25 years ago. For 25 years we have known that we should be at this \npoint, that we should have made the decision long ago. Yet, the option \npresented by this amendment would only serve to further delay this long \noverdue realignment. And further delay serves only to deny access to \njustice to the people who fall under the jurisdiction of the ninth \ncircuit.\n  The immense size of the ninth circuit is one of the problems. The \nnext closest circuit in size is the sixth. The sixth circuit has a \npopulation of just under 30 million people. The ninth circuit has \nnearly 50 million people--70 percent more people than does the sixth. \nAnd the problem will only get worse because, over the next 12 years, \nthe States which make up the current ninth circuit are expected to grow \nby 43 percent.\n  So here we have a problem that is 25 years in the making and getting \nworse, and now we can see the projections that it is just simply going \nto be driven to the point that access to justice is absolutely \nimpossible. As a result of the tremendous caseloads, adjudication by \nthe ninth circuit is unnecessarily and unfortunately slow. Recent \nfigures indicate the time to complete an appeal in the ninth circuit is \n40 percent longer than the national median.\n  The people of the ninth circuit are simply not served by the unneeded \ndelay experienced within the circuit. The question before us, \ntherefore, is not a question of politics. It is a question of fairness. \nThe judges in the ninth circuit simply cannot keep up with the number \nof cases which are being decided. It is nearly impossible logistically \nfor judges within the circuit to know the law as it is being decided \nwithin the circuit, and therefore you see inconsistencies, you see \nproblems with not staying up with decisions that have been made \nelsewhere within the jurisdiction, and therefore we see the cases being \noverturned.\n  So, should the people of the ninth circuit have to continue to face \nthe unnecessary delays and judicial uncertainty which is becoming \ncommonplace within the circuit? Should the judges of the ninth circuit \ncontinue to be burdened with a system which prevents the kind of \ncollegiality which is necessary for effective decisionmaking? Any \nobjective analysis of these questions reveals that the answer must be \nno. And, if the answer is no, then we must act now to split the ninth \ncircuit\n\n[[Page S8053]]\n\nand provide the people within this jurisdiction the access to justice \nwhich all Americans expect and are entitled to. Speaking for the people \nI represent, I say that it is fundamentally unfair to deny the people \nof Idaho justice. Yet, the amendment of the Senator from California \nwould continue the kind of injustice that was exposed nearly a quarter \nof a century ago.\n  In reviewing a proposal of this magnitude, I believe it is important \nto speak with those who are most familiar with the situation. With this \nin mind, I asked Idaho's attorney general, Al Lance, to share his views \nwith me. I believe his words are worth repeating at this time. He said:\n\n       My concerns regarding the ninth circuit include its \n     unwieldy size, inconsistency in decisions issued by its \n     various panels, excessive delay in the issuance of those \n     decisions, as well as the circuit's very high reversal rate \n     when its decisions are reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court. \n     Furthermore, it is my firm belief that in view of the \n     unwieldy nature of the circuit as it is presently configured, \n     that the true significance of regional and local issues is \n     neither fully appreciated by the court nor reflected in the \n     court's decisions. Establishing a new Twelfth Circuit Court \n     of Appeals will resolve these concerns and, at the same time, \n     reduce the average case processing time by over 400 days to a \n     time period consistent with most other circuits.\n\n  In closing, I would like to quote another friend of mine who is the \nGovernor of the State of Idaho, Phil Batt. With regard to the ninth \ncircuit, he stated:\n       The court has been overloaded for a long time, and it is in \n     the interest of everyone, especially justice, to split it.\n\n  That is what this debate is truly about: justice. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote for justice and to vote against the amendment which \nis before us. Americans are entitled to justice and they are entitled \nto access to the justice system, and it is being denied currently in \nthe ninth circuit. The remedy, as proposed by the Senator from New \nHampshire, is before us. It is a quarter of a century overdue. It is \ntime for us to take the right action and provide that access to justice \nfor all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Nevada, [Mr. Bryan].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the senior Senator from California.\n  Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment offered by the senior \nSenator from California. In my view, and I speak as one who has \nappeared before the ninth circuit as an attorney, the provision \nincluded in this appropriation bill to divide the ninth circuit and \ncreate a new 12th circuit is inappropriate, ill-conceived and ill-\nadvised. I must express my dismay that my colleagues on the \nAppropriations Committee have seen fit to usurp the jurisdiction of the \nJudiciary Committee on this matter. If there was ever an issue that \ndeserved to be considered in a thoughtful and careful manner by the \nJudiciary Committee, it is the issue of reforming our Federal court \nsystem.\n  The Commerce, Justice, State appropriation bill is clearly not an \nappropriate venue to debate an issue of this magnitude, one that will \nhave far-reaching policy implications, not only for those of us in the \nWest but for the entire Nation.\n  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Reorganization Act of 1997 would \nreformulate the ninth circuit to include California, Nevada and the \nPacific territories, and create a new twelfth circuit consisting of \nAlaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington.\n  In the 104th Congress, the distinguished senior Senator from \nWashington introduced legislation that would have placed California, \nNevada, Arizona, Hawaii and the Pacific territories in the ninth \ncircuit. That legislation was later modified by the Judiciary Committee \nto establish a new ninth circuit consisting of California, Hawaii and \nthe Pacific territories, and I have been further advised that at one \ntime a proposal was floating around that would divide northern and \nsouthern California into separate circuits.\n  I mention these various iterations of dividing the ninth circuit to \nmake the point that there is a variety of views as to how best to \naddress the ninth circuit and whether or not it should be divided, and, \nif so, how it should be divided. But in my view, it is clear the \nproposal to divide the ninth circuit is more reflective of an act of \npolitical expediency than the prudential concerns related to the \nadministration of justice. The sponsors of this provision claim that \nthe ninth circuit is unable to effectively manage its caseload because \nit has grown too big and that the solution to this perceived problem is \nto divide the circuit. But this, I fear, is only a smokescreen, for the \nreal reason splitting the ninth circuit being proposed at this time is \nsimply that many do not like the decisions rendered by the circuit.\n  While they will not admit that one purpose of dividing the ninth \ncircuit is to change the substantive outcomes of decisions, the \nsponsors have made clear their displeasure with many decisions issued \nby the court, particularly in the area of natural resource protection. \nSurely not all of the decisions in the ninth circuit, or for that \nmatter any circuit, come down the way that all of us would like. I, \nmyself, have cosponsored legislation that would reverse the effect of \nsome of the ninth circuit decisions. But I do not believe that \ndifferences over the decisions rendered by the ninth circuit are an \nadequate basis to split the circuit.\n  What kind of precedent would the Congress then be setting? Would a \ncircuit court of appeals face possible reconfiguration whenever \nCongress does not like the decisions being rendered? Does this Congress \nreally want to support what is essentially judicial gerrymandering? I \nhope not. The ninth circuit serves nine Western States and has been one \ncircuit for more than 100 years. Whenever the issue of splitting the \ncircuit is put to a vote of the judges and lawyers in the circuit, the \nvote has been overwhelmingly to retain the circuit as it is currently \nconstituted.\n  Who better than those judges who comprise the circuit and those \nlawyers who represent litigants before the ninth circuit to determine \nwhether or not the ninth circuit is working effectively or not?\n  It has been my experience that neither judges nor lawyers have been \nshy about stating an opinion when they think something needs to be \nchanged.\n  The last study of the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals was by the \n1973 Hruska Commission. A fellow Nevadan, the Honorable Charles \nWiggins, a ninth circuit court judge, served as a member of that \ncommission. Parenthetically, Judge Wiggins first served as a Republican \nMember of the House before serving on the ninth circuit. In a letter to \nCalifornia's senior Senator, he stated:\n\n       My understanding of the role of the circuit courts in our \n     system of Federal justice has changed over the years from \n     that which I held when the Hruska Commission issued its final \n     report in 1973. At that time, I endorsed the recommendations \n     of the Commission calling for a division of the fifth and \n     ninth circuits. I have grown wiser in the succeeding 22 \n     years.\n\n  We should heed Judge Wiggins' experience--act wisely and not \nprecipitously in dividing this circuit.\n  The last time a circuit court of appeals split was in 1980 when the \nfifth circuit was divided and the eleventh created. It should be noted \nthat the judges of the fifth circuit unanimously requested the split, a \nsituation we clearly do not have with the ninth circuit.\n  In a recent letter, Judge Wiggins wrote me:\n\n       Circuit division is not the answer. It has not proved \n     effective in reducing delays. The former fifth circuit ranked \n     sixth in case processing times just prior to its division \n     into the fifth and eleventh circuits. Since the division, the \n     new fifth circuit is still ranked fifth or seventh, while the \n     new eleventh circuit now ranks 12th, the slowest of all \n     circuits. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals judges are the \n     fastest in the Nation in disposing of cases once the panel \n     has received the case.\n\n  So the ninth circuit would appear to take the appropriate \nadministrative steps to manage its caseloads through innovative ways \nthat other circuits use as models.\n  The ninth circuit disposes of cases in 1.9 months from oral argument \nto rendering a decision. That is less than the national average by 2 \nweeks. This currently makes the ninth circuit the second most efficient \ncircuit in the country.\n  So it is obvious the circuit has recognized caseload management is an \narea\n\n[[Page S8054]]\n\nthat needs improving and is successfully addressing it.\n  I find it particularly ironic that in this political environment in \nwhich budget decisions are hotly debated and new expenditures are \nclosely watched that a new circuit would be proposed, because it is \nestimated that a courthouse alone would cost some $60 million and there \nwould be additional costs that would be involved in the transition \nperiod. So, therefore, we would face the continuing cost of operating \nan additional circuit court when, at this point, no determination has \nbeen made in a fair and objective way that dividing the circuit is \nnecessary.\n  In my view, the ninth circuit has worked well for the nine Western \nStates it serves and will continue to do so into the future. For those \nwho believe the ninth circuit must be split, I urge the support of the \nFeinstein amendment to establish a commission to review the structure \nand the alignment of the Federal courts of appeals. This is a \nthoughtful and prudent way to address this issue.\n\n  When the information necessary to determine whether any circuits need \ntheir geographical jurisdiction changed is available, we can then \ndebate this issue more intelligently, having been thoroughly informed \nas to the facts. But let us not split the ninth circuit at this time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Alaska 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment offered by my good \nfriend, the Senator from California, the amendment which would strike \nthe provisions of the bill to divide the ninth circuit into two \nseparate circuits of more manageable size and certainly more manageable \nresponsibility.\n  The division of the ninth circuit is warranted for three very \nimportant reasons: its size and population; its caseload; and its \nastounding reversal rate by the U.S. Supreme Court. Who holds the ninth \ncircuit court accountable? It is the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Let's talk about size and population. I have a chart here which shows \nthe magnitude of the area covered by the ninth circuit. The ninth \ncircuit is, by far, the largest of the 13 judicial circuits, \nencompassing nine States and stretching from the Arctic Circle in my \nState to the border of Mexico and across the international date line. \nThat is how big it is.\n  We are not against California or Nevada. What we want is a \nrecognition of timely judicial action.\n  Population: The second chart I have shows the number of people served \nby the ninth circuit. Over 49 million people are served by the ninth \ncircuit, almost 60 percent more than are served by the next largest \ncircuit. By the year 2010, not very far away, the Census Bureau \nestimates that the ninth circuit's population will be more than 63 \nmillion, a 43-percent increase in just 13 years. Talk about not doing \nanything rash. This population is increasing out of control. We better \nstart doing something now.\n  On the issue of accountability, Mr. President, and that is most \nimportant, the only factor more disturbing than the geographic \nmagnitude of the circuit is the magnitude of its ever-expanding docket. \nThe ninth circuit has more cases than any other circuit. Last year \nalone, the ninth circuit had an astounding 8,502 new filings. It is \nbecause of its caseload that the entire appellate process in the ninth \ncircuit is the second slowest in the Nation. How do they explain that? \nAs a former chief judge, Judge Wallace of the ninth circuit, stated:\n\n       It takes about 4 months longer to complete an appeal in our \n     court as compared to the national median time.\n\n  Former Chief Justice Warren E. Burger put it more succinctly when he \ncalled the ninth circuit an ``unmanageable administrative \nmonstrosity.''\n  Let's look at this reversal rate which I want to talk to you about, \nbecause there is the issue of accountability. Our responsibility of \njudicial oversight demands action now. Unfortunately, this massive size \noften results in the decrease in the ability of the judges to keep \nabreast of legal developments within this jurisdiction. The large \nnumber of judges scattered over a large area inevitably results in \ndifficulty in reaching consistent circuit decisions. This judicial \ninconsistency has led to continual increases in the reversal rate of \nthe ninth circuit decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  During the last Supreme Court session, the Court reversed 19 of the \n20 cases that it heard from the ninth circuit. That is an astounding 95 \npercent reversal rate. How do they explain that? They don't. It is \nembarrassing, I would think, for the judges. The Supreme Court holds \nthe circuit accountable to the tune of a 95 percent reversal rate. It's \nabout accountability, Mr. President.\n\n  Here is the relative ninth circuit reversal rate: 95 percent in 1996; \n83 percent in 1995; 82 percent in 1994; 73 percent in 1993; 63 percent \nin 1992.\n  Why does this reversal rate continue to increase? Because the circuit \nis simply too big. Intracircuit conflicts are the result. Ninth circuit \nJudge Diramuid O'Scannlain, a sitting judge on the ninth circuit, \ndescribed the problem as follows:\n\n       An appellate court must function as a unified body, and it \n     must speak with a unified voice. It must maintain and shape a \n     coherent body of law. A circuit judge must feel as though he \n     or she speaks for the whole court and not merely an \n     individual. As more and more judges are added, it becomes \n     harder for the court to remain accountable to lawyers, other \n     judges, and the public at large.\n\n  Listen to that, ``the public at large.''\n\n       As the number of opinions increase, we judges risk losing \n     the ability to keep track of precedents and the ability to \n     know what our circuit's law is. In short, bigger is not \n     better.\n\n  Another sitting judge on the ninth circuit, Judge Andrew Kleinfeld, \nagrees:\n\n       With so many judges on the ninth circuit and so many cases, \n     there is no way a judge can read all the other judges' \n     opinions. . . It's an impossibility.\n\n  Now there you have it, Mr. President. Two statements from two sitting \njudges about what the problem is.\n  Some today argue that the Senate is acting in haste. This is entirely \nuntrue. The concept of dividing the ninth circuit is not new. Numerous \nproposals to divide the ninth circuit were debated in Congress since \nbefore World War II. More recent congressional history includes:\n  A 1973 congressional commission to study realignment with the circuit \ncourt, chaired by Senator Hruska, which strongly called for division of \nthe ninth circuit.\n  Congressional hearings have been held in 1974, 1975, 1983, 1989, 1990 \nand 1995.\n  A split of the ninth circuit has been reported from a Senate \ncommittee on three occasions, Mr. President.\n  How long do we have to wait? Dividing the ninth has been studied, \ndebated and analyzed to death. It is time for action.\n  I have one final chart. This is a statement from retired U.S. Supreme \nCourt Justice Warren Burger:\n\n       I strongly believe that the ninth circuit is far too \n     cumbersome and it should be divided.\n\n  U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy who reviews, if you \nwill, the appeals, has this opinion:\n\n       I have increasing doubts and increasing reservations about \n     the wisdom of retaining the ninth in its historic size, and \n     with its historic jurisdiction.\n\n  Honorable Diarmuid O'Scannlain, ninth circuit:\n\n       We (the ninth circuit) cannot grow without limit. . . As \n     the number of opinions increases, we judges risk losing the \n     ability to know what our circuit's law is. . .\n\n  Judge Kleinfeld currently sitting on the court:\n\n       The ninth circuit is too large and has too many cases--\n     making it impossible to keep abreast of ninth circuit \n     decisions.\n\n  Our own former Member, a Senator from Alabama, former Alabama Supreme \nCourt Chief Justice Howell Heflin, who we have the greatest respect \nfor:\n\n       Congress recognized that a point is reached where the \n     addition of judges decreases the effectiveness of the court, \n     complicates the administration of uniform law, and \n     potentially diminishes the quality of justice within a \n     circuit.\n\n  That is our own former Senator.\n  Finally, recently retired Senator Mark Hatfield:\n\n       The increased likelihood of intracircuit conflicts is an \n     important justification for splitting the court.\n\n[[Page S8055]]\n\n  There you have some of the most respected people we know relative to \nthis subject. The Commerce, State, Justice bill splits the circuit in a \nrational way. The States of California and Nevada, due to their large \npopulation, particularly of California, and the rapid population growth \nof Nevada, will comprise the new ninth circuit. The balance of the \nStates of the circuit will form the new twelfth circuit. The 49 million \nresidents of the ninth circuit are the persons who suffer. Many wait \nyears before cases are heard and decided, prompting many to forgo the \nentire appellate process.\n  In brief, the ninth circuit has become a circuit where justice is not \nswift and justice is not always served. We have known of the problem of \nthe ninth circuit for a long time. It is time to solve the problem. It \nis time for action now, and it is time for timely justice.\n  I urge my colleagues to reflect on this reality and the \nresponsibility that this Senate has to address it. Let's not forget \nthat reversal rate relative to the chart on my right. I am going to \nleave that up as I yield the remainder of my time, because this is the \nreal story, Mr. President. Here is the accountability of the court, the \nSupreme Court of the United States, and the number of cases that they \nhave reversed. It is absolutely embarrassing and, as a consequence, \naction should be taken by this body now.\n  This is nothing against my good friends from California or the State \nof California. This just happens to be the reality of the court that we \nare forced to operate under. To suggest that somehow we don't like the \ndecisions is absolutely silly and unrealistic. These decisions are made \non legal merits, as they should be. They have nothing to do relative to \nthe location of the court. This court is simply overworked and is \nunresponsive to the public, as indicated by the Supreme Court's \nreversal rate.\n  Mr. President, I thank the floor manager. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, in the bill before us, we have in there \nsomething called the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Reorganization Act \nof 1997. It is hidden in the back of the bill within the general \nprovisions, but boy, does it have great import. This language asks us \nto split the ninth circuit court into two circuits--the ninth circuit \nwould include California, Guam, Nevada, and the Northern Mariana \nIslands while the twelfth circuit would include Alaska, Arizona, \nHawaii, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington. Needless to say, I am \ncertain my friends from these States will have something to say about \nthis matter.\n  While there will be Senators here to talk about the pros and cons of \nsplitting this ninth circuit court, I would like to say to my \ncolleagues that this is neither the time nor place to be talking about \nthis issue at all. As far as I can tell, this is a matter that belongs \nin the most able hands of our Judiciary Committee. This is not a money \nmatter. This is true and true new authorization language that has no \nplace being on our appropriations bill.\n  In our full committee mark of the bill, Senators Reid and Boxer asked \nthe committee to create a commission to study the state of all the \ncircuits and make recommendations according to the big picture. The \nrationale behind this is to let the experts who know and understand our \ncircuit courts tell us what they think before we do anything drastic. \nExpanding Federal caseloads is a nationwide problem requiring a \nnationwide solution. We can't sit here on our appropriations bill and \npretend to be experts as to what's best for the ninth circuit or all \nthe circuit courts, especially without ever having any hearings on the \ntopic, and especially not knowing how much our decision will cost us. \nBelieve me, splitting the ninth circuit court will without a doubt \nincur upon us additional costs that we haven't even begun to predict.\n  So I urge my chairman and my colleagues to listen when I say that \nthis issue must go. We need to give this to the Judiciary Committee \nwhere I have confidence they will make an informed and thorough \ndecision in a field that is theirs and theirs alone.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, can the Chair advise us of the present time \nstatus?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire controls 30 \nminutes; the Senator from California controls 19 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest to the Senator from California, \nif it is agreeable, that we move to the Senator from Arizona for 5 \nminutes while we work on a possible unanimous consent agreement for a \nvote.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is acceptable.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding. This \nproposal to divide the ninth circuit is especially important to my \nState.\n  Mr. GREGG. May I ask the Senator from Arizona to suspend for a second \nwhile I propound a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. KYL. Sure.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote occur \non or in relation to the pending Feinstein amendment at 7:45 p.m. this \nevening; and further, that the time between now and then be equally \ndivided in the usual form, and that there be no amendments in the \nsecond degree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  As I said, this provision in the bill to divide the ninth circuit is \nvery important to the State of Arizona because Arizona is the second \nlargest State in the existing ninth circuit, both in terms of \npopulation and caseload. It, California, and Nevada are all three very \nfast growing. And there is no question that the caseload will continue \nto grow at least in proportion to the population.\n  Phoenix, AZ, is now the sixth largest city in the country. Arizona \nis, I believe, the fastest growing State in the country. So not only do \nwe have a situation in which we are growing very rapidly, along with \nNevada and California, but the proposed amendment would result in a \ndivision of the circuit which would affect my own State of Arizona. So \nI speak to that issue.\n  Now, it is not my suggestion, Mr. President, that the circuit be \ndivided. There is a division of opinion in Arizona on that that \nsuggests that the bench and bar are split. I do not think there is a \nclear consensus in my State as to whether the circuit should be \ndivided, but I think there is a pretty clear recognition that it will \nbe. It will happen sooner or later. It is inevitable, as several of my \ncolleagues have already pointed out here. There is no question, because \nof its size and other factors, the circuit is going to be divided one \nway or another.\n  The question is how will it be divided? On that question I think we \nhave to look at this question of size, population, growth, caseload \ngrowth, and so on. Because if, for example, you divided the circuit the \nway it calls for in the bill, the caseload division would be as \nfollows: The circuit comprised of California and Nevada would have 63 \npercent of the cases, and the remainder of the circuit would have 37 \npercent of the cases. That is about a 2-to-1 division, showing just how \nbig California is. Probably in terms of caseload, the sounder way to do \nit would be just to have California. It would still be about 60-40 in \nfavor of California versus all of the rest of the States in the \ncircuit.\n  But I gather that the proponents of this have decided to accommodate \nStates who have expressed a willingness, through their Senators, to be \nadded to California or to remain with California, and that Nevada has \ndone that, as a result of which, to accommodate Nevada, it has been put \nwith California.\n  Now, if Arizona were to be added to that circuit, as some people \nsuggest--again, there is division of view on this--the caseload would \nbe 73 percent for the Arizona, Nevada, California circuit; 27 percent \nfor the rest of the circuit. Obviously, that is not a good division for \nthe circuits. So I have had to consider it from both a perspective of \nmy State and what makes sense how to approach this issue. It clearly \ndoes not make sense, from a caseload division, to divide the circuit in \na way that would add the three fastest growing States--Arizona, Nevada \nand California--together. I think it is bad enough to add Nevada and \nCalifornia together, though I do not deny that Nevada has a right to be \nwith California if they desire. But it will soon be unbalanced and soon \nbe the largest circuit in the country.\n\n[[Page S8056]]\n\n  Mr. President, in the end, I conclude I will not oppose this \nproposal. I would like to add two comments to those that have been made \nby my colleagues. First, there has been a suggestion that this circuit \nwould be gerrymandered. I do want to suggest that that is not true. It \nis not true politically. The division of Democrat and Republican \nnominees would be exactly the same with the new division as it would be \nunder the existing circuit. So I do not think that anybody believes \nthis is about gerrymandering in a political sense. The percentage of \nDemocrats and Republicans would be the same. Moreover, it is not a \ngeographical gerrymandering. It simply takes two of the States of the \ncircuit and leaves the remaining circuit as it is.\n  Again, I would prefer that Nevada remain with the rest of the circuit \nto have a more evenly balanced caseload. Nevada wants to go with \nCalifornia--fine. That creates the anomaly that Arizona is divided from \nthe rest of the circuit. But in the day of air travel, I do not think \nthat is a particularly difficult problem for us, particularly since the \ncommittee has seen fit to designate both Seattle and Phoenix \nadministrative sites of the circuit. So you have both a northern and \nsouthern administrative site. I know in the existing ninth circuit, \ncases are argued in Phoenix, Seattle, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and \nso on. Because of its size, you have to accommodate the travel needs of \nthe parties, the litigants. So there is an accommodation to that. And \nit would exist in this new circuit as well.\n\n  But at least the people in the new circuit would not have to travel \nto California. So it seems to me that, on balance, maybe the best of a \ndifficult situation has been made. I should say, the best has been made \nof a difficult situation. That is how to make a division that results \nin a fairly even distribution of cases, No. 1, and that does not divide \nthe State of California, which I objected to along with Senator \nFeinstein. So in the end, Mr. President, conceding that division is \nultimately going to occur, it seems to me that this is a division that \nmakes sense. Therefore I will not oppose it.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I think the distinguished Senator from Arizona knows \nI greatly respect him, from working together on other issues. I think \nwe work very well together.\n  I want to directly address something that he has said about the \nfairness of this split, particularly with respect to the size. I say to \nhim, that isn't the issue. The issue is how the judges are split. I say \nto the Senator, this legislation splits the judges. The way in which it \nsplits the judges is 15 judges for the ninth circuit, and 13 judges for \nthe newly formed twelfth circuit. Now, the caseload means that the \nninth circuit court judges have a 50 percent greater caseload per judge \nthan do the twelfth circuit court judges.\n  The Senator and I discussed these kinds of issues a year or so ago. I \nhope you will recall when we were discussing this in the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  There is a letter dated July 18 of this year to Senator Reid from \nChief Judge Procter Hug. What Judge Hug points out is:\n\n       Under the bill, the Ninth Circuit is to have 15 judges and \n     the Twelfth Circuit is to have 13 judges. The Ninth Circuit \n     would have a 50% greater caseload per judge than the Twelfth.\n\n  He goes on and shows the total for California, Nevada, Guam, Northern \nMarianas, with a total caseload of 5,448.\n\n       With 15 judges, the caseload per judge--363 cases, then the \n     caseload for Alaska, 204; Arizona, 891; Hawaii, 204; Idaho, \n     141; Montana, 175; Oregon, 626; Washington, 871, with a total \n     of 3,112.\n       With 13 judges, the caseload per judge--239 cases. That is \n     one of my big objections. One thing I would just bet my life \n     on is, as a product of a study, there will be a fairer \n     distribution of judges.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If it is on your time, I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. KYL. That would be up to Senator Gregg. I am going to agree with \nyou, so perhaps----\n  Mr. GREGG. I have no problem with that. This colloquy can be on our \ntime.\n  Mr. KYL. I want to say, we discussed the allocation of judges before. \nThe Senator is exactly correct. I totally agree with you there should \nbe a fair allocation, meaning that it should be in rough proportion to \nthe caseload, and the projected caseload, not just the existing \ncaseload. Therefore, if that means that there should be a different \ndivision of the judges vis-a-vis the States in the new circuit, I would \nnot only have no objection to that, but I would join the Senator from \nCalifornia in assuring that that is the case.\n  This was not my proposal, as the Senator from California knows. But I \nwould suspect that the proponents of this amendment would be very happy \nto ensure that that distribution of judges is made a part of the \nlegislation. At least, I would work with the Senator from California to \nassure that that would be the case.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I very much appreciate that, and I take you at your \nword. However, what this legislation does will be the law if it is \naccepted by the House.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Could I ask my friend from California a question?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Of course.\n  Mr. GREGG. At this time I would have to reclaim my time because we do \nhave some additional speakers. So any additional colloquy should come \noff the time of the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I may just make my quick statement here.\n  On four occasions, the Federal judges of the ninth circuit and the \npracticing lawyers of the Ninth Circuit Judicial Conference have voted \nin opposition to splitting the circuits. The official bar organization \nof Arizona--as recently as July 14, a few days ago--and the bars of \nCalifornia, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, and Nevada, and the National \nFederal Bar Association, all have taken positions against the circuit \ndivision. No State bar organization to this day has taken a position in \nfavor of circuit division, let alone this division.\n  Now, let me try to begin to summarize here.\n  I believe strongly--and I think the other side knows I do not throw \nthese comments around loosely--that this is really being done for the \nwrong reasons and in the wrong way. I think some people did not like \nsome of the decisions, specifically in mining and grazing. For some it \nis being done because they think they will get more judges for their \nState. I have had Senators tell me that directly. For some, a new \ncourthouse is attractive.\n  The point is, the House of Representatives has passed the very bill, \nthe amendment of which I am carrying here in the Senate. This proposal, \nnotwithstanding anything anyone has said, as a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee for the last 4\\1/2\\ years --there has never, Mr. President, \nin the time you've been there, there has never been a hearing on this \nsplit. There has never been a discussion of the ramifications of this \nsplit on legal precedent or forum shopping. There has never been input \nfrom the judicial council, from the judges, from the bar associations \non this split. That is fact, Mr. President. That is fact.\n  Yet, an appropriations committee has stolen the jurisdiction of the \nJudiciary Committee and moved ahead and proposed a split a few weeks \nago--2 days later they had a split which split California in half--the \nnext day that was gone and there was the split we are faced with today. \nThat is why I say it is a gerrymander.\n  If this were a map before a court on an electoral district with \nArizona floating out here alone, they would say, aha, it is a \ngerrymander. Yet it can be done by a committee that does not even have \nauthorizing oversight jurisdiction, and, bingo, it is before the full \nbody. I really have a problem with that. I do not think that is right.\n  I happen to agree with my chairman, California is going to have 50 \nmillion people by the year 2025. We should take a look at whether or \nnot the interests of justice would be carried out by splitting the \nlargest circuit in the Union. I do not have a problem with that.\n  What I do have a problem with is worrying, aha, is this being done \nbecause Montana does not like a mining decision? Is it being done \nbecause Washington does not like a timber decision? Is it being done \nbecause someone else doesn't like another decision? Is it being done \nbecause a state wants an additional judge?\n  I mean, this is a very real and pertinent consideration because never \nbefore in the history of the Union has a\n\n[[Page S8057]]\n\ncircuit been split in this manner. So it is indeed very, very \nimportant.\n  No consideration of costs. I pointed out the Pasadena and San \nFrancisco courthouses; $140 million has just been spent on them. My \ngoodness, I can see the spot done now on television. ``They spend all \nthis money.'' I believe there is no way you can build new courthouses, \nand staff them with duplicate positions, and not have it cost at least \n$100 million in 1997 dollars. And do you know what? This goes into \nplace, Mr. President, in October of this year.\n  This is almost the end of July, and then there's August, September, \nand October 1 this goes into effect. No hearing; no study; no talk; no \nwhat do you think, bar of Arizona; what do you think, bar of Nevada; \nwhat do you think, bar of Alaska; or what do you think, bar of Idaho? \nIt doesn't meet the smell test. That is the problem for me.\n  Now, let me talk----\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I may finish my thought, the point has been made--\nand the distinguished Senator from Alaska made this point very well--\nthat 28 out of 29 cases of this session were reversed by the United \nStates Supreme Court. Bingo, it is a terrible circuit. Well, let me say \nthat that is only 28 cases out of over 4,480 cases. It is the largest \ncircuit. That is a very small percentage of the cases it successfully \nadjudicated.\n  Let me just go back to Judge Hug's letter because I believe there is \nsomething important here. The caseload per judge in the ninth circuit \nwould be 124 cases per judge higher than the twelfth circuit, or 52 \npercent greater, as I have said, than the twelfth.\n  Then he raises this:\n\n       The provision in the bill for coequal clerks in the twelfth \n     Circuit is completely unworkable. How can it be efficiently \n     administered in this way? Is the administration of the \n     circuit to be done in two separate, coequal headquarters? \n     Where would the circuit executive be located?\n\n  These are all questions that need to be answered. This thing would go \ninto effect on October 1. No question is answered.\n  Then Judge Hug says in his letter:\n\n       Consider the travel time and expense of the judges. \n     Presumably, the judges from Alaska and Montana will need to \n     travel half of the time to Phoenix, and the Arizona judges \n     will need to travel half the time to Seattle. Presently, the \n     circuit headquarters in San Francisco is equal distance, and \n     the air routes convenient. This would not be the case in the \n     new twelfth circuit. I don't know whether that's good or bad. \n     My point is that it ought to be looked at. If we had been \n     able to move ahead, and the House and the Senate agreed on \n     the study, it would have been done by now. The study would \n     have been done by now. It is a year and a half ago. It would \n     have been done by now. Instead, we are faced with another \n     arbitrary proposal for a split. We are rushing it through. It \n     is an arbitrary split. No one has looked at costs, or at fair \n     distribution of judges; no one has heard from a judge or from \n     a bar association on this split; and no members of any of the \n     bars of any of the States have indicated their support for \n     this--none, zero, zilch, none. October 1, it goes into play. \n     It does not make sense.\n\n  How much time do I have remaining, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield the floor and reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Will the Senator from California yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask for 1 minute.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Alaska a minute.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I believe the Senator from California indicated, Mr. \nPresident, that new California judges would have a 50 percent increase \nin caseload, and the Senator from California indicated that would not \nbe enough judges. I wonder if she meant to say that, in the new ninth \ncircuit, there would be 63 percent new cases and 53 percent judges, and \nin the twelfth circuit, there would be 37 percent new cases and 42 \npercent judges, which are the figures that we have from the committee, \nwhich hardly reflect a 50 percent increase in the caseload.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would be happy to respond. I am \nreading from a letter dated July 18, signed by Procter Hug, Chief \nJudge, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. What he points out \nis--he is using what I believe is current caseload. I would be happy to \nshare this with the Senator. I read this accurately:\n\n       The total caseload filings in California, Nevada, Guam and \n     the Northern Marianas would be 5,448. The filings in Alaska, \n     Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington would \n     be 3,012.\n\n  The point is, with 13 judges, the twelfth circuit would have 239 \ncases per judge. The ninth circuit would have 363 cases per judge. That \nis an unfair allocation of cases per judge.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I will not further comment, other than to point out \nthat I don't think it is a fair statement to suggest that California \njudges would have a 50 percent increase in caseload, because that is \nnot reflected.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The Senator misunderstood me. If I might respectfully \nget this straight----\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I have no further questions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I will reclaim a moment of my time to \nsay this. Let me quote the chief judge:\n\n       The ninth circuit would have a 50 percent greater caseload \n     per judge than the twelfth circuit.\n\n  That letter is here. Anyone can see it.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GREGG. Could the Chair advise us of the time status?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 14 minutes \nand 48 seconds.\n  Mr. GREGG. And the Senator from California?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. She has 9 minutes 2 seconds.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield to the Senator from Alaska, the chairman of the \ncommittee, 9 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I shall not use that much time. I do \nappreciate the courtesy of the manager of the bill.\n  Mr. President, we have studied this matter to death. The issue, in \n1973, was recommended by Senator Hruska and the Hruska Commission was \ncreated. It recommended then, in 1973, that the ninth circuit court be \nsplit. Every Congress we hear the same thing from the large delegation \nin the House and the two Senators in the Senate from California: we \nneed more study. I think that is what we are hearing again now--have \nanother study.\n  It has only been 24 years now that we have been studying since the \nfirst commission reported. But, of course, we do need the advice of \nanother commission.\n  Mr. President, I am a California lawyer. I was raised in California, \nand I am pleased to have that background. But I tell you, in all \nsincerity, I cannot believe that we can continue this situation. This \nchart--I am not sure it can be seen, Mr. President. This chart shows \nthe population and caseload of the circuits. Clearly, the population is \nalmost 50 million people in the ninth circuit, and it requires some \nchange when, clearly, the average of all of the others is somewhere \naround 20 million people.\n  I want to address the concern spoken to, I think, by my good friend \nfrom Hawaii, Senator Inouye. It has been 13 years now since a Hawaii \nresident was appointed to the ninth circuit. Fourteen judges have been \nseated on the circuit since that time, but Hawaii was never recognized. \nSenator Inouye has included an amendment in this provision that \nguarantees that at least one judge will be appointed to the circuit \ncourt of appeals from the new circuit, when it is created, from each \nState. Now, I think the Senate should listen to that kind of \nfrustration and should listen to the frustration of those who see how \nlong it takes for a case to be decided by the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  Mr. President, I said the other day that the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals judges come to our State. They come during the summer, and they \nhave a delightful time visiting our State. In the wintertime, all our \npeople fly south and some of our lawyers like that. But the litigants \ndon't like it because the average time that an appeal is pending before \nthe ninth circuit is so long, it puts a great burden upon our States, \nthe smaller States in this circuit.\n  Now, in 1995, the Senate Judiciary Committee report showed that New \nYork accounted for approximately 87 percent of the second circuit \ndocket; Texas cases were approximately 70 percent of the fifth circuit \ndocket. We have considered splitting the ninth circuit before several \ntimes since I have been in the Senate. Mr. President, the overload of \nthe ninth circuit is now such a serious problem, and it is only going \nto get worse if we continue to\n\n[[Page S8058]]\n\ntalk about another commission to discuss whether this split should take \nplace.\n  The appellate process, for almost one-fifth of the citizens of the \nUnited States, will continue to be inadequate. I believe we are doing \nCalifornia a favor by splitting this court. They are the only State \nthat has one circuit all to itself, all to itself--well, Nevada could \nmake the decision to join if they wish. But the establishment of \ntribunals is a responsibility of the Congress, not of a commission. It \nis one of our most important responsibilities under the Constitution. I \nbelieve the Senate will shirk its responsibility if we do not act to \ncorrect this problem of the ninth circuit, and I urge the Senate to do \nwhat this amendment would do: create a new twelfth circuit and allocate \nto it the States that are suffering greatly by the current crowded \nsituation and long delays in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  I thank the Chair and yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, does the Senator from California have any \nadditional speakers?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would like to know how much time I have remaining, \nif I might.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GREGG. Does the Senator plan to close? We have one additional \nspeaker. I will have that speaker go if the Senator is planning to \nclose as the final speaker.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will speak after the Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield the balance of our time to the Senator from \nWashington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Senator from California makes a \nserious argument: we should not split the circuits because we will \nwaste the $140 million investment in a courthouse in San Francisco, \nexcept that we can split the circuits if this so-called study \ncommission says we should do so, and she would then have no objection.\n  Well, either the courthouse is an important consideration, or it is \nnot an important consideration. Obviously, Mr. President, it is not an \nimportant consideration. I presume--I hope--that the Senator from \nCalifornia is not arguing that, even if there is a split, all of the \nstaff and all of the people who are now in that courthouse in San \nFrancisco would still be there and everything has to be added onto \nthat. That is often a way in which the Federal bureaucracy operates. \nBut there is no reason in the world for us to allow it to operate in \nthat fashion under this set of circumstances.\n  This can be done efficiently and effectively. But that is the \nfundamental argument against this amendment and in favor of the bill as \nit stands. The ranking minority member of the Judiciary Committee said \nthat this is the wrong way to act. The Senator from California says \nthis is the wrong way to act because it is on an appropriations bill.\n  Yet, 2 years ago when a bill practically identical to this was \nreported by the Judiciary Committee, after full hearings and a full \ndebate, they objected to it even being debated on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate. Now for the first time we have an opportunity to do so.\n  This Senator has favored this flip since the early 1980's. And this \nis the first time we have ever been able so much as to debate it on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate.\n  The arguments against the proposal for split are essentially \nprocedural. ``Oh, no, we have not had enough hearings. We have not \ntalked about it for a long enough time. There have not been enough \nstudy commissions.''\n  There have been hearings for decades. There has been a debate for \ndecades. It simply cannot be argued in any kind of rationale manner \nthat a circuit with this number of States, with 14 million square miles \nof land and water, with almost 50 million people growing more rapidly \nthan any other part of the country, with 28 authorized judges at the \npresent time, 10 more requested on top of that, can be a collegial \nbody, a court that can understand the cases that come in front of it, a \ncourt in which the members can even learn the names of the other \nmembers of the court.\n  Of course a division is appropriate, and the division that is being \ndiscussed here today is the division, if there is to be one, that the \nSenators in opposition asked for.\n  We are criticized because the bill changed in form as it got in front \nof us. Well, California is not divided because the Senators from \nCalifornia ask that it not be divided. And we went along.\n  Nevada remains a part of the ninth circuit because the Senators from \nNevada asked that that be the case as against the bill that was \nreported 2 years ago.\n  Hawaii and the trust territories are with the new twelfth circuit \nbecause, assuming a division, that is where they wanted to be.\n  Yes, there have been changes, but they have been changes requested by \nthe very Senators who are here on the floor arguing against the result \nof their requests. Justice in these circuit courts will be done better \nin circuits that are roughly similar to the other circuits--all of the \nother circuits in the United States. Each of these circuits will still \nhave more square miles than any other, except for, I believe it is the \ntenth in the Mountain States, and more when you include Alaska. The \nninth circuit will still be the largest of any and all of them.\n  I don't believe this is going to be the last such division. But it is \na division whose time came almost a quarter of a century ago. And that \nhas been resisted by lawyers and judges who are comfortable with the \npresent situation, with the wonderful travel opportunities they have, \nand rank that convenience ahead of the convenience of individuals \nseeking justice before those courts who can be served far better, far \ncloser to home, with far more understanding, if this division becomes \nlaw, than if we simply say, ``Oh, let's wait. Let's have another study. \nAnd let's let that study come up with the same results we did before. \nAnd then we will have another excuse to oppose the division.''\n  That is what we got when we heard, on the one hand, ``Fine, let's \nhave the study, and we will agree with it. But, no, we can't divide the \ncircuit because we have a brandnew $140 million courthouse in San \nFrancisco.''\n  No, Mr. President, it is time for the Senate of the United States to \ndeal with this question as a matter of substance today. It is time to \ndo justice. It is time to reject this amendment and pass this bill.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I believe I have 9 minutes remaining \non my time. I would like to yield 7 of them to the distinguished \nSenator from Delaware, the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, this is not the right way to do this. Let me repeat \nthat again. This is not the right way to do this. If the circuit were \nto be split, we should do it in a way we have done it in the past.\n  When some of my colleagues who have argued for the split in the past \nhave come before the committee, they have said some of the following \nthings. The argument is, ``Well, the reason we want a split is we don't \nwant to have the court, basically a California-dominated court, making \njudgments for the folks in my State. We are different.''\n  And I point out to my colleagues who say that, you know, it is a \nfunny thing about the circuit courts. Our Founding Fathers set the \ncircuit courts up for a basic fundamental reason. They didn't want 50 \ndifferent interpretations of the Federal Constitution. It is kind of \nstrange. The whole purpose of the circuit court of appeals was to make \nsure there was a uniform view as to how to read the Constitution--not a \nMontana reading, not a Washington State reading, not a Nevada reading, \nnot a Hawaii reading, and not an Alaska reading. Geography is relevant \nonly in terms of convenience--not ideology.\n  This is all about ideology at its core. That is what this is about. \nThat is what the attempt to split it is about.\n  There is no data to sustain that this should be done. Let the \nJudicial Conference make a judgment, make a recommendation to us. Let \nthem decide as they have in the past.\n\n[[Page S8059]]\n\n  I say to my friends from the South, before I got here, we split up \nwhat used to be a giant circuit from Texas to Florida. The Senator's \nhome State was part of the Presiding Officer's home State, was part of \nthis giant district of the circuit court, and it got split. We did it \nthe right way. We got the facts. We heard from the Judicial Conference. \nWe listened to the court.\n  This is about politics. It is no way to deal with the court. It isn't \nhow to do this.\n  Let's look at what we have. We don't have any data on the operation \nof the circuit as it is presently configured. So, therefore, it seems \nto me, we should at least give some weight to those folks who are on \nthe court, and those folks who are litigants argue before the court--\nthe bar of those States.\n  With that in mind, let me point out that the Ninth Circuit Judicial \nCouncil, the governing body of all the courts in the ninth circuit, is \nunanimously opposed to this--Republican appointees to that court, \nDemocratic appointees to that court, liberal appointees, conservative \nappointees, pointed-head appointees, flat-headed appointees. They are \nall opposed.\n  Let's look at the next thing that makes sense to look at--those who \nlitigate before the court.\n  The California bar is opposed to this. The Arizona bar is opposed to \nthis. The Hawaii State Bar Association is opposed to this. Big Sky \nCountry Bar from Montana is opposed to this. The State of Nevada's bar \nis opposed to this, and the State of Idaho.\n  Mr. President, I would also point out that splitting the circuit, as \nproposed, will not guarantee that certain regional interests will be \nbetter represented. Keep in mind that is what this is really about--\nregional interests.\n  That is the part that bothers me about how we are going about this.\n  Look, I am from the third circuit way back East--Pennsylvania, \nDelaware. So I am not telling anybody in the other part of the country \nwhat their business is. But it offends me that we have argued at \nleast--I have not been here for the debate--in the committee based upon \nregional bias. There is not a Western Federal Constitution. There is \nnot an Eastern Federal Constitution. There is not a Southern Federal \nConstitution. There is one Constitution--one.\n  Another problem with this legislation that the court will face is the \ncosts incurred. Dividing this circuit requires trading \nan infrastructure to support the new twelfth circuit. The Ninth Circuit \nExecutive Office estimates that the initial startup cost for the \nestablishment of the new twelfth circuit would amount to tens of \nmillions of dollars. Operating costs of maintaining two circuits have \nbeen estimated to be more than $5 million per year.\n\n  Look, I think the Senator from California has been eminently \nreasonable throughout this whole process. By the way, if anybody \nwonders whether this is not about regionalism, which is the worst thing \nwe could be talking about when we talk about the Federal Constitution, \nlet me remind my colleagues of a point in fact.\n  No ninth circuit judge has been appointed to the court for a long \ntime because those who, in fact, are suggesting that this should be \nsplit said, ``Unless it is split, we are not letting any judges go on \nthe court.''\n  Think of that now, Mr. President. Isn't that nice?\n  ``You won't split the court so we can have a regional division. We \nare not letting any folks get on the court. And then we are going to \ntell you that the court is overworked. Then we are going to tell you \nthe court has a backlog. Then we are going to tell you the court has a \nproblem.''\n  The reason, if it does, is because they have arbitrarily held up the \nappointments.\n  Republican judges from the circuit have come to my office--Democratic \njudges from the circuit, Reagan appointees, Bush appointees--and said, \n``Can't you do something?'' I said, ``You are talking to the wrong guy. \nYou are preaching to the choir. Go to the guys who are blocking these \njudges.''\n  So, Mr. President, you can make an argument that this court is \noverworked. You can make the argument that this distribution is but \npart of the argument. The reason is a self-fulfilling prophesy. You \ndon't put judges on the circuit. You create a problem.\n  I can see my time is up. I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  This is a bad idea. It is not the right way to go about it.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware for \nhis excellent comment. I agree with him 100 percent. This is the wrong \nway for the wrong reason. The reasons are regional. The reasons are, if \nwe do not like the decision, we don't appoint the judges.\n  One-third of the ninth circuit today is vacant. I repeat, one-third \nof the judgeships on the ninth circuit today are vacant. And I do not \nbelieve that there is a plan to appoint another judge to the ninth \ncircuit until we bow to this. What we are bowing to is something that \nhas never been heard, never been studied in the 4\\1/2\\ years that I \nhave been on the Judiciary Committee of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record a \nJuly 14, 1997 statement of the Arizona bar in opposition to this split, \na statement of the California bar in objection to this, a recent letter \nfrom the Governor of the State of California in objection to this, a \nJuly 22 letter from the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee in \nobjection to this, a letter from the chief judge of the ninth circuit \nin objection to this, and the chief judge's letter on the unfair \nallocation of judges. I also have in my files letters objecting to the \nearlier proposals to split the circuit. These include letters of \nobjection from the State Bar of Nevada, the State Bar of Montana, the \nState Bar of Hawaii, the Los Angeles County Bar, lawyers' \nrepresentatives of the ninth circuit, and the Judicial Council.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 22, 1997.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Orrin: I understand that this week the Senate is \n     expected to consider S. 1022, the Commerce-Justice-State-\n     Judiciary appropriations bill. Included in the bill is a \n     major piece of substantive legislation, the ``Ninth Circuit \n     Court of Appeals Reorganization Act of 1997.'' This provision \n     of the bill (section 305) would amend Title 28 of the United \n     States Code by dividing the existing Ninth Circuit into two \n     new circuits. As you well know, altering the structure of the \n     Federal judicial system is a serious matter. It is something \n     that Congress does rarely, and only after careful \n     consideration.\n       It is anticipated that an amendment will be offered to \n     replace the circuit division rider with legislation to create \n     a commission to study the courts of appeals and report \n     recommendations on possible change. This legislation, H.R. \n     908, has already passed the House unanimously on a voice vote \n     on June 3, 1997. A similar bill, S. 956, was passed \n     unanimously by the Senate in the 104th Congress. This is a \n     far superior way of dealing with the problems of caseload \n     growth in the Ninth Circuit and other courts of appeals. I \n     urge your support for the amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Henry J. Hyde,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                State Capitol,\n\n                                    Sacramento, CA, July 11, 1997.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Orrin: I have been closely following the renewed \n     interest in Congress over proposals to split the Ninth \n     Circuit. I understand that a new proposal, under \n     consideration by the Appropriations Committee, would split \n     the Ninth Circuit and divide California in half between the \n     resulting circuits. I am writing to register my strong \n     opposition to the passage of any such measure prior to such \n     time that an objective study is commissioned and issued \n     addressing the many, serious ramifications of such a split.\n       As you may know, I have been on record in opposition to \n     previous proposals to split the Ninth Circuit on the grounds \n     that they were a form of judicial gerrymandering which sought \n     to cordon off some judges and keep others.\n       However, the present proposal to split California between \n     two circuits would not only amount to judicial gerrymandering \n     but would invite forum shopping of the rankest kind. \n     California would face the unprecedented prospect of a \n     ``circuit split'' on a question of law within the same state, \n     which would invite lawyers to ``forum shop'' between the two \n     resulting halves of California on the basis of which law is \n     more favorable to their position. This would be particularly \n     frustrating for State government, where\n\n[[Page S8060]]\n\n     legal challenges to its actions may generally be brought in \n     any venue within the State.\n       While a split of the Ninth Circuit would generate a number \n     of inconsistent rulings along the West Coast in areas such as \n     commercial law, environmental law (including standing to \n     sue), and admiralty law, a split of California would \n     exacerbate this inconsistency by subjecting Northern \n     California's cities, like San Francisco, to different \n     controlling law than Southern California's cities, like Los \n     Angeles.\n       Nor would the spectacle of forum shopping between circuits \n     within California be alleviated by a mechanism similar to \n     that proposed in a 1993 House bill (H.R. 3654), which \n     suggested the creation of an ``Intercircuit California En \n     Banc Court.'' As proposed in that bill, the Intercircuit \n     California Court would permit en banc review by judges of \n     different circuits ``whose official duty stations are in the \n     State of California.'' Such an intercircuit en banc panel \n     would necessarily differ from the composition of the en banc \n     panels for each of the participating circuits. This, of \n     course, raises the specter of greater inconsistencies among \n     the circuits arising from overlapping en banc panels. As the \n     proposal would permit the Intercircuit Court to resolve only \n     intercircuit conflicts of federal law, conflicting \n     interpretations of California substantive law arising in \n     diversity cases would presumably remain unresolved. Of \n     course, these additional circuits would impose additional \n     burdens on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n       Admittedly, the Ninth Circuit handles more cases than any \n     other circuit. However, statistics refute any objection that \n     the Circuit is ``too big.'' The median time for it to decide \n     appeals (14.3 months as of September 30, 1995) is less than \n     that for the Eleventh Circuit (15.1 months), and only \n     slightly higher than that for the Sixth, Seventh and District \n     of Columbia Circuits.\n       The real issue underlying this debate appears to be one of \n     judicial gerrymandering, which seeks to cordon off some \n     judges in one circuit while keeping others in another because \n     of concerns, whether perceived or real, over particular \n     judges' perspectives or judicial philosophy. If this is the \n     issue, I submit that the proper means to address it is \n     through the appointment of judges who share our judicial \n     philosophy that judges should not make policy judgments, but \n     should interpret the law based on the purposes of the statute \n     as expressed in its language, and who respect the role of the \n     states in our federal system.\n       I urge you to discourage your colleagues from approving any \n     proposed split of the Ninth Circuit, and particularly one \n     that splits California, until such time as a study is issued \n     that carefully examines the implications of this significant \n     issue. I would be pleased to contribute one or more \n     representatives to assist with such a study.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Pete Wilson,\n     Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     The State Bar\n\n\n                                                of California,\n\n                                 San Francisco, CA, July 14, 1997.\n     Re State Bar of California Support for Commission to Study \n         the Federal Courts of Appeals and Opposition to Splitting \n         the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: The Board of Governors of the State \n     Bar of California strongly opposes the recent proposals to \n     split the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. We support the \n     establishment of a non-partisan commission to study the \n     structure and alignment of the federal courts of appeals. A \n     bill to establish such a commission, H.R. 908, unanimously \n     passed the House in June. It has been 24 years since the last \n     major study of the structure and alignment of the federal \n     courts of appeals was conducted. No proposal to restructure \n     the Ninth Circuit should be considered prior to the \n     completion of a thorough study.\n       Some have argued that the size of the caseload of the Ninth \n     Circuit argues for its division; however, caseload growth is \n     an issue common to courts of appeals nationwide. Splitting \n     the Ninth Circuit, ostensibly because of its caseload, before \n     considering how to respond to growing caseloads nationwide, \n     will complicate rather than advance solutions to caseload \n     growth. Furthermore, repeated division of circuits in \n     response to growth is likely to create a proliferation of \n     balkanized circuits.\n       We have heard that various proposals to split the Ninth \n     Circuit may be made in the Senate Appropriations Committee, \n     for example, to include California and Nevada in one circuit \n     and to join other states in the Continental United States in \n     another circuit, including non-contiguous Arizona; or to \n     place California in a single circuit with the island \n     territories, with all other states presently in the Ninth \n     Circuit in a separate circuit. The variety of proposals \n     indicates that there is no consensus, even among proponents, \n     as to how any split should be achieved.\n       We are strongly opposed to all of these proposals to split \n     the Ninth Circuit. They represent a form of judicial \n     gerrymandering and are not based upon any study of the Ninth \n     Circuit or of the overall needs of the federal courts of \n     appeals. They violate the established principles that federal \n     judicial circuits encompass three or more states and be \n     designed to transcend parochial interests. These proposals \n     are likely to increase the problems of the federal courts of \n     appeals and make these problems more costly and difficult to \n     fix. The multiplicity of proposals that have been made, \n     without study, simply emphasize the need for a thorough study \n     of the federal appellate courts as a whole.\n       For these reasons, we believe that any proposal to split \n     the Ninth Circuit, or to realign any other circuit, needs to \n     be informed by a non-partisan study of the structure and \n     alignment of the federal courts of appeal.\n       I have written a similar letter to Senator Boxer, who is a \n     member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Thomas G.

Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: This letter is simply to confirm that \n     the State Bar of Arizona has repeatedly opposed any division \n     of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and supports the \n     House's proposal for a study commission.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Don Bivens,\n     President-Elect.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             United States Courts,\n\n\n                                        For the Ninth Circuit,\n\n                                          Reno, NV, July 23, 1997.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: This afternoon we had a meeting of \n     the active and senior judges of the Ninth Circuit Court of \n     Appeals, for the sole purpose of discussing the current \n     efforts underway by the Senate Appropriations Committee to \n     split the Ninth Circuit. After a thorough discussion, the \n     judges voted overwhelmingly to support the creation of a \n     study commission to study the structure of the circuits.\n       Altering the structure of the federal judiciary system is \n     an extremely serious matter, something that should be done \n     rarely and only after careful, serious study and \n     consideration.\n       We strongly urge the members of the Senate to support the \n     creation of a commission to conduct a thoughtful, thorough \n     and complete study of the matter.\n       Our court asked me to convey to you our appreciation for \n     your continued leadership in this matter.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                 Procter Hug, Jr.,\n     Chief Judge.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              United States Courts\n\n\n                                        For the Ninth Circuit,\n\n                                          Reno, NV, July 18, 1997.\n     Hon. Harry M. Reid,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Harry: After reviewing this matter yet again, I have \n     some possible arguments for the floor of the Senate, giving \n     examples of why this is a hasty and ill-considered bill and \n     why a Commission should study such an important issue.\n       1. Under the bill, the Ninth Circuit is to have fifteen \n     judges and the Twelfth Circuit is to have thirteen judges. \n     The Ninth Circuit would have a 50% greater caseload per judge \n     than the Twelfth Circuit.\nStates:                                                         Filings\n    California....................................................4,840\n    Nevada..........................................................500\n    Guam.............................................................87\n    Northern Marianas................................................21\n                                                               ________\n                                                               \n      Total.......................................................5,448\n                                                               ========\n\nWith 15 judges, the caseload per judge..............................363\n                                                               ========\n\n    Alaska..........................................................204\n    Arizona.........................................................891\n    Hawaii..........................................................204\n    Idaho...........................................................141\n    Montana.........................................................175\n    Oregon..........................................................626\n    Washington......................................................871\n                                                               ________\n                                                               \n      Total.......................................................3,112\n                                                               ========\n\nWith 13 judges, the caseload per judge..............................239\n       The caseload per judge in the Ninth Circuit would be 124 \n     cases per judge higher than the Twelfth Circuit, or 52% \n     greater than the Twelfth.\n       2. The provision in the bill for co-equal clerks in the \n     Twelfth Circuit is completely unworkable. How can it be \n     efficiently administered in this way? Is the administration \n     of the circuit to be done in two separate co-equal \n     headquarters? Where would the Circuit Executive be located?\n       3. Consider the travel time and expense of the judges. \n     Presumably, the judges from Alaska and Montana will half the \n     time travel to Phoenix, and the Arizona judges will half the \n     time travel to Seattle. Presently, the circuit headquarters \n     in San Francisco is equidistant and air routes convenient. \n     This would not be the case in the new Twelfth Circuit.\n       Harry, I suggest these arguments be saved for the floor to \n     avoid changes or arguments prepared to meet them.\n           Yours Sincerely,\n                                                 Procter Hug, Jr.,\n     Chief Judge.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n                      The Judiciary: Ninth Circuit\n\n       The Administration opposes the provision in the Committee \n     bill that would reorganize\n\n[[Page S8061]]\n\n     the Ninth Circuit by splitting it into two separate circuits. \n     We understand that other substantive amendments to divide the \n     Ninth Circuit may be offered on the Senate Floor. The \n     Administration strongly objects to using the appropriations \n     process to legislate on this important matter. The division \n     of the Ninth Circuit is an important issue not just for the \n     bench and the bar of the affected region, but also for the \n     citizens of the Ninth Circuit. The Administration believes \n     that a much better approach would be passage of legislation, \n     H.R. 908--already passed by the House and currently pending \n     at the desk in the Senate--that would create a bipartisan \n     commission to study this difficult and complex question and \n     make recommendations to the Congress within a date certain. \n     This would allow for substantive resolution of the issue in a \n     deliberative manner, allowing all affected parties to voice \n     their views.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I have a couple of minutes left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Before getting to a vote on this issue, just let me make \nthis point.\n  Were this a judicial proceeding, there is something called judicial \nnotice. That is like water runs downhill and the Sun comes up in the \nEast. I think the Court would take judicial notice of the fact the \nninth circuit does not work; it is too big; it has too many people for \none circuit to manage; it has too many judges to work effectively; it \nhas too large a geographic region. This is an attempt to address that \nissue. It is a very important issue to address. It is an affordable \nissue to address. I hope my colleagues will vote down this amendment.\n  Have the yeas and nays been asked for on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. GREGG. Does the Senator from California wish to ask for the yeas \nand nays?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 45, nays 55, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 204 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--45\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--55\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n  The amendment (No. 986) was rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel).

Mr. President, is it in order to send an amendment to \nthe desk at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to laying aside amendment \n979? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 989\n\n (Purpose: To Strike the Provisions Dealing With the Withdrawal of the \n        United States From Certain International Organizations)\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Mr. Sarbanes], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 989.\n       On page 124, beginning on line 5, strike all through page \n     125, line 2.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, could we have order in the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. The Senator from \nMaryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to direct my colleagues' \nattention to section 408 of this bill, on pages 124 and 125. I am \nabsolutely stunned to find this language in this legislation, because \nit provides for our withdrawal from the United Nations.\n  What it says, if I understand it correctly, is that if the \nappropriation does not come up to the level of the U.N. assessment, \nthen the United States shall withdraw from an international \norganization, but I assume it is primarily directed at the U.N.\n  Let me just read a couple of paragraphs to my colleagues.\n\n       The United States shall withdraw from an international \n     organization under this section in accordance with the \n     procedures identified for withdrawal in the treaty, pact, \n     agreement, charter, or other instrument of that organization \n     which establishes such procedures.\n       Unless otherwise provided for in the instrument concerned, \n     a withdrawal under this section shall be completed by the end \n     of the fiscal year in which the withdrawal is required.\n\n  This is a small section located in the latter part of this \nlegislation. As you read through this bill, all of a sudden, you come \nacross the provision. If we are going to withdraw from the U.N., we \nought to have a full-scale debate. This is not a minor decision. There \nare some people in the country who would like to do that, but if we are \ngoing to undertake to do so we ought to have a full scale debate.\n  What this section says as it starts off is:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the United \n     States shall withdraw from an international organization if \n     the President determines that the amount appropriated or \n     otherwise available for a fiscal year . . . is less than the \n     actual amount of such contributions. . . .\n\n  In other words, the assessments. So, if we do not appropriate the \nfull assessment, as I understand this section, the President has to \nbegin withdrawal procedures.\n  There are many years when we have not met the assessment. In fact, we \ncontinue to run arrearages. We just passed legislation here that had \ncertain conditions for paying our U.N. dues, that withheld certain \namounts, required certifications, and so forth and so on.\n  I don't know where this provision came from but it is a backdoor way \nof compelling our withdrawal from the United Nations.\n  The amendment that was sent to the desk would strike this section \nfrom the bill. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. We should \nnot be talking about withdrawal from international organizations. We \nare the world's leading power. We essentially use these international \norganizations to serve our interests. Now we come to this section, \nwhich is sort of hidden away. The upshot of it would be to, in effect, \nlead us to begin withdrawal procedures from the United Nations.\n  I don't think we even ought to have any references to withdrawal. \nCertainly the way this provision is written, the bill is going to force \nus out of the U.N.\n  I hope the committee, upon reflection, would agree to drop the \nsection from the bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will my colleague yield for a second?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. He is just yielding to me. But I absolutely agree with \nyou. I absolutely agree with you. Let me tell you, during this last \ncold war time, I had a lot to do with the ILO when I was chairman of \nthe Labor Committee and ranking member there, and ever since, when our \ntripartite organization--Government, labor and business--saved this \ncountry and countries all around this world from the tyranny of \ntotalitarianism, right at the ILO.\n\n[[Page S8062]]\n\n  I can remember one trip I made over there because Irving Brown called \nme. He was the head of our delegation. He was the International Vice \nPresident of the AFL-CIO, and in my opinion the strongest anti-\nCommunist in the world at the time. He stopped the Communists from \ntaking over the French docks. He went into Paris before the end of the \nSecond World War--one of the most heroic figures I ever met in my life. \nAnd he led our delegation with the full support of labor, business, and \nGovernment, year after year. He died here a few years ago. I went to \nhis memorial service here.\n  But I know what the ILO has meant to this country and what it has \nmeant to free trade unionism around the world and what it has meant to \nfreedom.\n  I have to tell you, if we have this provision continue in this bill, \nsince all three of these organizations, the WHO, the ILO, and the \nagricultural organization, we are behind in payments to them, it would \nmean it would have to come down to choosing one of them that they would \ndelete. I can tell you right now, the one, probably the weakest that \nwould be deleted, would be the ILO. I have to tell you, that preserves \nfree trade unionism around the world, it protects freedom around the \nworld, and, I have to tell you, quells disruptions and problems all \nover the world. It helps us all over the world to spread democracy.\n\n  I don't want to see that happen, and I think the distinguished \nSenator from Maryland has brought up a very, very good point here. I \ncall my colleagues' attention to it. I am grateful he has yielded to me \nfor these few remarks. I hope they have been helpful to my colleagues \non both sides, but I have been there, I know how important this is. I \nbelieve this is not the thing to do, to have that particular language \nleft in there as it is. So I support my colleague from Maryland.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator from Maryland yield for a brief comment?\n  Mr. President, this is the second time we have addressed this issue \nin the last several weeks. A similar provision was in the State \nDepartment authorization bill that we dealt with. We raised the issue \nthen, and the Senator moved to strike a similar provision, a withdrawal \nprovision. It was accepted by a voice vote. This bill went on to pass \nthe Senate 90 to 5, I believe.\n  I am surprised this issue has surfaced again. Not only does section \n408 depart from the State Department authorization bill, but it is bad \npolicy; it is just simply bad policy.\n  I hope my friends, the managers of this bill, will consider the fact \nthat we have been through this once already and maybe allow us just to \nhave a voice vote and move on. We have enough to fight over in this \nbill.\n  I have much more to say on this, but, as the old joke goes, everybody \nhas already said it, so I am not going to repeat it. The Senator from \nMaryland is absolutely right; it is a repeat of what we did.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding to me, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. GREGG. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The clerk will continue \ncalling the roll.\n  The legislative clerk continued to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I seek recognition so we can announce there \nwill be no further rollcall votes tonight. There will be at least one \nvote tomorrow. And I believe that we can say there will be one vote \ntomorrow. It will be an important vote. We expect that that vote will \nbe either on the tuna-dolphin issue or, more than likely, under the \nagreement we are going to propound, it would be on the global warming \nissue.\n  So there would be a vote tomorrow. A time would have to yet be \ndetermined exactly what time that would be, but probably not before 10 \no'clock in the morning. And then we hope to work out some \nunderstandings with regard to State, Justice, Commerce. And then we \nwould probably not have final votes on that until next Tuesday, I \nbelieve it would be.\n  So that is the point I wanted to announce. There will be at least one \nvote tomorrow, and no further rollcall votes tonight. We will make an \nannouncement with regard to Monday later on, in a few minutes, or \ntomorrow, about the situation on Monday.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is the leader's intention, if there is no agreement on \ntuna-dolphin, that there will be a cloture vote tomorrow morning on \ntuna-dolphin that he had previously anticipated?\n  Mr. LOTT. Unless there is an agreement, there will be a cloture vote \non tuna-dolphin, but we are working on an agreement where it may not be \nin the morning. But we will have one in short order. We are trying to \nwork through all the different players and make sure everybody has been \nconsulted. That is why we are not asking for the UC right now.\n  I think I should go ahead and say to the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, it would be our intent, because of requests \nof a number of Senators, and because of the cooperation we have \nreceived, that we would not have any recorded votes on Monday. But we \nare trying to also clear an agreement that the Democratic leader \nindicated he would like to approve with us to take up the \nTransportation appropriations bill some time during the day on Monday, \nbut it would not lead to recorded votes. The next recorded vote would \nbe tomorrow, and then Tuesday morning and Wednesday morning under the \nagreements we are working. But we have not cleared them with everybody \nat this point.\n  With that, at this time, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kerry pertaining to the introduction of S. 1067 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside so that I can engage in a brief colloquy with \nthe chairman of the subcommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). Is there objection?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Reserving the right to object, I don't think it is \nnecessary to set the amendment aside in order to have a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. It is not necessary.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I stand corrected.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I object to the request, but it doesn't \npreclude the distinguished Senator from having her colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard. The Senator from Maine \nis recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfor such time as I may consume for a brief colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           NWS REORGANIZATION\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to engage in a colloquy with \nthe distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Gregg, \nregarding the National Weather Service's ongoing top-to-bottom review \nof its operations and structure.\n  I am taking this opportunity today to express my hope and belief that \nthis review process will conclude that the Weather Service Office in \nCaribou, ME, should be fully upgraded to a Weather Forecasting Office. \nI just want to comment very briefly, Mr. President, on a few of the \nreasons why the Caribou Weather Service Office should be upgraded.\n  In general, it is the Weather Service's policy that weather \nforecasting\n\n[[Page S8063]]\n\noffices should cover roughly 17,000 square miles. Right now, the \nWeather Forecasting Office in Gray, ME--which is more than 230 miles \nfrom Caribou--is attempting to provide services for roughly 63,000 \nsquare miles, an area more than three times larger than the norm. Given \nthe huge area involved, it is extremely difficult for the small staff \nof a Weather Service Office to provide the services necessary to ensure \npublic safety.\n  For example, the Weather Service Office currently has only one \nelectrical technician who must service equipment in Frenchville, \nCaribou, Houlton, and as far south as Millinocket, in Penobscot County. \nThis is an enormous workload for just one employee, particularly in \nlight of the possibility that repairs may be needed at the same time at \ndifferent locations far away from each other.\n  Accurate and timely weather reports are essential to Aroostook \nCounty, the largest county in Maine, for two reasons: one involving \npublic safety, the other an economic concern.\n  Mr. President, northern Maine experiences more than its fair share of \nsevere weather, including blizzards in the winter months. Many of my \ncolleagues have probably heard weather reports in which my hometown of \nCaribou has recorded the lowest temperature in the Continental United \nStates. Accurate and timely weather reports are essential for public \nsafety.\n  The second reason for upgrading the Weather Service Office centers on \nthe nature of the economy in the county. Natural resource-based \nindustries such as agriculture, logging, and tourism are the mainstay \nof the county's economy. Our potato farmers, for example, must have \nquality weather forecasts and reports in order to know best when to \nplant and harvest their crops.\n  For these public safety and economic reasons, I am convinced that \nupgrading the Weather Service Office in Caribou is a necessary action \nfor the National Weather Service to undertake, and I hope that the \nAppropriations Committee will act favorably on upcoming funding \nrequests.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor so that my distinguished New England \nneighbor and colleague, Senator Gregg, may respond to my concerns.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nMaine, Senator Collins, and the distinguished chairman of the \nsubcommittee, Senator Gregg, today to discuss an issue of utmost \nimportance to Aroostook County, the Caribou Weather Service Office.\n  The bill before us requires the National Weather Service [NWS] to \nconsult with the subcommittee before making any reprogramming requests \nin relation to the top-to-bottom review that is currently underway. As \npart of their review, NWS will consider whether the Caribou Weather \nService Office should be upgraded to a weather forecasting office.\n  Under the National Weather Service's modernization plan, a weather \nforecasting office will have Doppler radar. The Doppler radar would \ngive Caribou the ability to forecast warnings for sudden and severe \nchanging weather patterns so that the communities the weather station \nserves will be able to respond quickly. At the present time, the \nnearest Doppler radar is in Gray, ME, more than 200 miles away. This is \ntoo far away to be of immediate help to Aroostook County.\n  Aroostook County is one of the largest counties in the United \nStates--the size of Connecticut and Rhode Island combined--and its \neconomy is dominated by agriculture, trucking, and forest products \nindustries, all of which rely heavily on timely and accurate weather \ninformation. The Caribou station provides vital information on a daily \nbasis to northern Maine communities that must deal with a wide range of \nweather patterns from bitter cold and snow to severe thunderstorms and \nflooding. An upgrade from a weather service office to a weather \nforecasting office would improve the weather forecasting abilities of \nthe Caribou station, thereby improving the ability of the affected \ntowns to react to sudden and severe weather changes.\n  Once the NWS has completed its review, I look forward to working with \nChairman Gregg and the subcommittee to ensure that the recommended \nchanges are funded in an expeditious manner.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Maine raising \nthis very significant issue to the folks of Northeastern Maine. Those \nof us who have been to Caribou understand that it is the coldest place \nin America, consistently, and recognize that the issue of weather and \npredictability of weather is very important. Also, I know how important \nupgrading the Caribou Weather Service Office into a Weather Forecasting \nOffice is for the people of Aroostook County. It is a major issue, and \nI can understand how strongly my friend and colleague from Maine feels \nabout this matter.\n  The Senator from Maine, Senator Collins, has made a very persuasive \ncase for why the Weather Service Office in Caribou, ME, should be \nupgraded into a Weather Forecasting Office. We must always work to \nensure public safety, and given the enormous land area, a Weather \nForecasting Office would be a tremendous benefit for the people of \nnorthern Maine.\n  You have my assurance, Senator Collins, that when the subcommittee \nreceives the National Weather Service report and recommendations on a \nreorganization plan, the subcommittee will work closely with you \nregarding the Caribou, ME, Weather Service Office.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Senator very much for his assistance.\n  Mr. REED addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                                Slamming\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to discuss a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution which is included, I believe, in the \nmanagers' amendment, with the concurrence of the Senator from New \nHampshire and the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The thrust of my amendment is to confront an issue which is growing--\nthe issue of slamming--where individuals who have signed up for long \ndistance telephone service have their service changed illegally. This \nis a growing problem, a problem that we must confront. It is a problem \nthat--in fact, as I considered it, I also contemplated the construction \nof an amendment to this appropriations bill that would have dealt with \nthe problem by mandating better proof that a customer has actually \nchanged service, including criminal penalties for slamming, and other \ndeterrences.\n  As I spoke with my colleagues and law enforcement officials, I came \nto realize, through many different viewpoints, that an amendment at \nthis time would delay the appropriations process. So rather than \nintroducing an amendment, I have proposed a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution which, again, I believe has been accepted and will be \nmaintained within the managers' agreement.\n  Before going forward, I commend and thank the chairman, Senator \nGregg, and the ranking member, Mr. Hollings, and also Chairman McCain \nand Chairman Burns for their generous assistance in this endeavor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator will yield. \nThe Senator from Rhode Island has done a valuable service to the Senate \nin bringing this to our attention. The FCC has just promulgated a rule \nrelative to slamming just this past week. This sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution is consistent with it, in the sense that it would require \nthe mandating of the evidence itself, civil fines, and a civil right of \naction. I think it really emphasizes the concern that all of us have \nhad in the communications field of this particular malpractice. I hope \nwe can help, with this sense-of-the-Senate resolution, emphasize the \nneed to expedite the rulemaking on the part of the FCC. I thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Rhode Island and I join in his resolution.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from New Hampshire, \nwithout losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I support the efforts of the Senator from \nRhode Island to put a sense-of-the-Senate resolution in this bill \nrelative to this very important issue. His sense of the Senate tracks \nthe FEC regulation. I think it is very appropriate that he has raised \nthe visibility of this issue, and the sense of the Senate will be \nincluded in the managers' amendment.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, reclaiming my time, I thank the Senator from \nNew Hampshire for his support. I would\n\n[[Page S8064]]\n\nlike to just briefly describe the problem and also the ongoing \ndiscussion with the FCC and also here within Congress.\n  First, as both my colleagues have indicated, this is an alarming and \ngrowing problem. The Federal Communications Commission is dealing with \nthe problem now. They will shortly propose a rule that will take away \nthe financial incentive for some of these renegade companies who \nessentially illegally change service. Surprisingly, today under FCC \nrules, a renegade company can, in fact, illegally switch a customer and \nstill get the benefits of that month or of several months of charges. \nThe FCC has proposed to change this.\n  This sense-of-the-Senate resolution supports that proposed rule \nchange and the other activities the FCC is contemplating. One of the \nreasons we are here today is that, under the present rules of the FCC, \ntelephone companies must get either a verbal or written response in \nterms of a formal request to change. The problem with respect to a \nwritten consent is that, many times, they are hidden in sweepstakes \npromotions, giveaways and, in fact, the nature of the written response \nis unknown to the consumer. Once again, the FCC is proposing to change \nthis new rule. I support that change and encourage them to go forward.\n  The phone company can also rely upon the verbal assent of a consumer, \nbut there are problems with this verbal assent, also. Some of the \nproblems we have seen with telemarketers are the fact that they will \ndeceive the consumer about identity or the nature of the service, or \nthey will obtain the consent of a child, or stranger in the household, \nor disregard the consumer's decline to switch the service, or flatout \nnot even bother to get the verbal assent and claim that they do in \nretrospect. The problem with this verbal authorization is proof. Again, \nthe FCC has taken some steps in this regard. They are proposing to \neliminate what is an option today, where someone presumably could \nconsent over the phone and then receive a package later from the \ncompany requiring that consumer to send a card in to deny the service \nchange. The FCC once again is trying to eliminate that procedure, also.\n\n  These are all positive steps. I encourage, and this resolution \nencourages, the FCC to pursue those steps.\n  This is a major problem for consumers in the United States. Fifty \nmillion people each year switch their phone service. One million of \nthose switches are likely to be fraudulent. One regional carrier now \nestimates that 1 in 20 of the switches in their system are fraudulent \nswitches. This problem has tripled since 1994. It is now the FCC's No. \n1 consumer complaint. Therefore, this problem is something that we \nshould deal with, and deal with decisively.\n  In my own home State of Rhode Island, there are abundant examples of \nconsumers who have been disadvantaged by this illegal switching. \nIndeed, the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission has noted this \ncomplaint as the No. 1 complaint they receive with respect to telephone \nservices. For example, a small businessperson in Newport, RI, had his \n800 number switched, and rather than an 800 number, the only people who \ncould call the business were residents of Alaska.\n  In Smithfield, RI, a family had their phone service illegally \nswitched. They protested, but before they could rectify the problem, \ntheir phone service was terminated because they refused to pay the bill \nfor the illegal company that switched them.\n  These are problems that have to be addressed, and I hope are being \naddressed today by the FCC, and perhaps ultimately our legislation in \nthis body.\n  What I hope we could do would be to focus more resources of the FCC \non this problem. In 1996, the FCC received 16,000 complaints about \nslamming, but they only were able to successfully prosecute and induce \njudgment against 15 companies. They don't have the resources. They need \nthose resources. Indeed, I worry that law enforcement agencies around \nthe country not only lack resources but lack, ultimately, the proof \nthat a switch has been made illegally. Law enforcement officials in \ncertain States, such as Connecticut, Wisconsin, California, Texas, and \nIllinois, have been successful, but they need additional support.\n  Indeed, one of the major elements of the legislation I was \ncontemplating was the requirement not only of written proof but, also, \nin the case that an oral or verbal consent was given, some type of \nrecording of assent so that law enforcement authorities could verify \ndecisively whether or not the appropriate assent had been made. It is \nnecessary for us to balance the needs for a flexible system by which \nconsumers can make choices and change their service to one that \nprotects their right to ensure that it is their choice and not the \nresult of fraudulent or manipulative practices by unscrupulous \ncompanies. I believe we can do that.\n  I believe we have taken a step forward today with this sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution to start on that path. I look forward to offering \nindependent legislation which I think will assist the current effort of \nthe FCC to resolve this grave problem that is growing each day.\n  Once again, I thank my colleagues, Senator Gregg, Senator Hollings, \nSenator McCain, and Senator Burns, for their work and for their effort \non this. Others are interested. I know Senator Campbell and Senator \nDurbin are also interested in this problem.\n  We have an opportunity today to send a strong message to the FCC to \nmove forward and also to continue to contemplate and deliberate about \nlegislation which will assist in their efforts and end this scandalous \nproblem, the No. 1 consumer complaint today with respect to \ntelecommunications slamming.\n  I thank my colleagues. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I had a discussion with the Senator from \nNorth Dakota. I am going to be very, very brief, with his indulgence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to laying aside the pending \namendment?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we temporarily \nlay aside the amendment for the purpose of introducing my amendment, \nand the moment my introduction is completed that the pending amendment \nwill return and be the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 992\n\n   (Purpose: To provide funding for the Community Policing to Combat \n                       Domestic Violence Program)\n\n  Mr. KERRY. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), for himself, \n     Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mr. Johnson, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 992.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 29, line 18, insert ``That of the amount made \n     available for Local Law Enforcement Block Grants under this \n     heading, $47,000,000 shall be for the Community Policing to \n     Combat Domestic Violence Program established pursuant to \n     section 1701(d) of part Q of the Omnibus Crime Control and \n     Safe Streets Act of 1968: Provided further,'' after \n     ``Provided,''.\n\n                       stop domestic violence now\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this amendment continues the successful \nCOPS ``Community Policing to Combat Domestic Violence'' Program. Police \ndepartments currently use these COPS funds for domestic violence \ntraining and support. This amendment would allow local law enforcement \nagencies to renew their grant funding so they can continue to employ \ninnovative community policing strategies to combat domestic violence.\n  Mr. President, domestic violence is a very serious national problem. \nAlmost four million American women were physically abused by their \nhusbands or boyfriends in the last year alone. A woman is physically \nabused every 9 seconds in the United States. Women are victims of \ndomestic violence more often than they are victims of burglary, \nmuggings, and all other physical crimes combined. In fact, 42 percent \nof women who are murdered are killed by their intimate male partners. \nIn Massachusetts, 33 women were killed in domestic related cases in \n1995. This\n\n[[Page S8065]]\n\namendment is necessary to fight this epidemic of domestic violence.\n  Mr. President, this problem of domestic violence affects all classes \nand all races. More than one in three Americans have witnessed an \nincident of domestic violence according to a recent nationwide survey \nreleased by the Family Violence Prevention Fund. Mr. President, \nbattering accounts for one-fifth of all medical visits by women and \none-third of all emergency room visits by women in the U.S. each year. \nAs Dartmouth, MA, Police Chief Stephen Soares said recently, domestic \nviolence ``goes from the lowest economic planes to the highest in terms \nof professional persons. There isn't a line drawn in terms of \nprofession or money.''\n  Domestic violence hurts women and hurts our economy. The Bureau of \nNational Affairs estimates that domestic violence costs employers \nbetween $3 billion and $5 billion each year in lost work time and \ndecreased productivity. In a recent survey of senior business \nexecutives, 49 percent said that domestic violence has a harmful effect \non their company's productivity. Forty-seven percent said domestic \nviolence negatively affects attendance and 44 percent said domestic \nviolence increases health care costs.\n  Mr. President, domestic violence also has tragic effects on children. \nChildren who witness the violence often do poorly in school, repeat the \npattern of either victim or abuser as adults, and are more prone to \nhave a variety of emotional problems.\n  According to Linda Aguiar, the head of ``Our Sisters' Place'' in Fall \nRiver, Massachusetts, ``One child that was at the shelter, we found out \nhe had taken knives from the kitchen and hid them in the bedroom. He \ndid this because he was afraid his father would come. He thought his \nfather would come and put a ladder to the window.''\n  To attempt to deal with these problems, Congress in the 1994 Crime \nAct provided that up to 15 percent of the funding for the COPS program \ncould be made available for innovative community policing activities. A \nsmall part of that money, $47 million, was made available to police \ndepartments for domestic violence training and support. I would like to \nread excerpts from a letter I received from the Chief of Police of \nChelmsford, MA, about the COPS Domestic Violence program. He said, ``It \nhas come to my attention that the federal grant entitled `Community \nOriented Policing Services Combating Domestic Violence' '' (COPS) has \nnot been approved--As you know, domestic violence is a serious law \nenforcement and societal problem that we are just beginning to face. \nEvery year, millions of women are abused and hundreds are murdered by \nmembers of their own family. It's time that society began viewing these \natrocities as a crime. We must put forward the necessary attention and \nfunding to solve this problem. The COPS grant does exactly that. It \nprovides advocacy, training, and research toward ending this problem. \nWithout this funding victims of domestic abuse and police officers will \nhave nowhere to turn for support, education, resources and training.''\n  Mr. President, the COPS Domestic Violence Program has been a success. \nIn Massachusetts, police departments have used the money to fund many \nanti-domestic violence activities:\n  The Gardner Police Department and a local battered women's resource \ncenter were able to establish school-based support groups for children \naffected by violence in their homes. More than 250 children ages 5-10 \nhave benefited from this program.\n  In Somerville, nearly 100 city police officers and an equal number of \nrepresentatives of local non-profit service agencies received anti-\ndomestic violence training. As a result, a young woman who appeared in \nthe Emergency Room seeking assistance for domestic violence was \nreferred to a nurse supervisor who helped her get a restraining order, \nsafety planning, and other support.\n  Officers in the Domestic Violence Unit of the Fall River Police \nDepartment, in coordination with a local battered women's and \nchildren's shelter, have been able to conduct personal follow-up in \nmore than 1,100 incidents of domestic violence since September of 1996.\n  Mr. President, before these funds were available, many local law \nenforcement agencies lacked the resources to provide anti-domestic \nviolence training and support. In 1995 prior to the awarding of the \nCOPS domestic violence grant, police in Gardner, MA were called to \nintervene in a dispute involving domestic abuse. Due to the lack of \ncooperation from the victim, officers did not have sufficient evidence \nto arrest her boyfriend, but instead were only able to escort him off \nthe property. Two hours after the incident, the victim's boyfriend \nreturned to the property and set it afire, and the woman was killed by \nasphyxiation. Subsequent to this crime the suspect was arrested, \nconvicted of the crime with which he was charged and sentenced to time \nin prison. This incident demonstrated the need for a victim's advocate \nemployed by the police department who might have been able to convince \nthe woman of her need for help and then intervene on her behalf. Due to \nthe COPS Domestic Violence grants, the Gardner Police Department now \nhas the resources to more successfully combat domestic violence.\n\n  When the Department of Justice announced these Community Policing to \nCombat Domestic Violence grants on June 1, 1996, police departments \nwere promised 1 year of funding with the ability to receive two \nadditional years of funding. Unfortunately, these successful Domestic \nViolence programs will be denied the additional 2 years of funding \nbecause of a little-noticed change, included in the appropriations bill \nreport language, which no longer allows up to 15 percent of COPS funds \nto be used for innovative community policing activities such as anti-\ndomestic violence training and support for local law enforcement \nagencies.\n  Our amendment earmarks $47 million of the $503 million provided by \nthe Commerce/State/Justice Appropriation bill for the Local Law \nEnforcement Block Grant (LLEBG) to renew funding of grants made under \nthe COPS Domestic Violence Program. It is appropriate that this money \nbe earmarked for this purpose because the Local Law Enforcement Block \nGrant Program was designed to provide funds to local governments to \nfund crime reduction and public safety improvements broadly defined. \nAdditionally, the LLEBG already contains several earmarks in the C/S/J \nAppropriations bill: $2.4 million for discretionary grants for local \nlaw enforcement to form specialized cyber units to prevent child sexual \nexploitation, and $20 million for the Boys and Girls Clubs.\n  Some will argue that this appropriations bill increases funding for \nthe Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) and that therefore no additional \nfunds are needed to confront domestic violence. However, that is \nincorrect for three reasons. First, the increase in funding for the \nViolence Against Women Act is only $15 million, far less than the $47 \nmillion needed to renew the COPS Domestic Violence grants. Second, only \n25 percent of the VAWA money goes to police departments--most of the \nrest goes to prosecution and direct victims services. Third, most of \nthe VAWA money for police departments goes to buy equipment, not for \ntraining and support.\n  Mr. President, this funding is necessary to help police departments \nto deal with the epidemic of domestic violence. I would like to thank \nSenators Dodd, Lautenberg, and Johnson for joining me in proposing this \nimportant amendment and urge all my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment of my \ncolleague, the Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry]. This amendment \nwill restore the COPS antidomestic violence grants created by the \nViolence Against Women Act--a program of vital importance that funds \nlocal police and community initiatives to combat domestic violence.\n  Domestic violence is a serious scourge on our society. Once every 9 \nseconds, a woman is beaten by her husband or boyfriend, according to \nFBI crime statistics. Four women are killed each day at the hands of \ntheir domestic attackers, according to the National Clearinghouse for \nthe Defense of Battered Women. And 16 people were killed by family \nviolence in Connecticut between September 1995 and September 1996. That \nis totally unacceptable.\n  Mr. President, for quite some time I have been extremely concerned \nthat\n\n[[Page S8066]]\n\nantidomestic violence programs currently funded through domestic \nviolence COPS grants will no longer have a source of funding as the \nCOPS grants for this purpose are eliminated.\n  For too long before Congress enacted the 1994 crime law and Violence \nAgainst Women Act, domestic violence was considered a private matter--\nsomething to be dealt with inside the home, and outside of public view \nand public policy. The Violence Against Women Act represented a \nconsensus that government and our communities should work together to \nprevent and stop domestic violence, and that it should be one of our \nhighest priorities.\n  In Connecticut, many communities were able to rise to that challenge \nwhen they received anti-domestic violence grants under the COPS \nprogram. More than ten Connecticut cites and towns have used these \ngrants to establish law enforcement infrastructures to support a \ndiverse range of anti-domestic violence programs, each specifically \ntailored to the needs of that local community. I recently had the \nopportunity to visit with two police chiefs who are using anti-domestic \nviolence COPS grants to run domestic violence prevention and \nintervention programs in Bridgeport, CT, and Groton, CT. They have \ndeveloped different programs that make use of a wide range of resources \nto fight domestic violence, utilizing police officers, involving \nvictims' shelters and services, incorporating counseling for both \nvictims and batterers, and aggressively pursuing prosecution of \nbatterers.\n  Programs like these send a message from our communities to victims \nand batterers alike. These programs say that domestic violence has no \nplace in Connecticut or anywhere in our country. These programs say \nthat if you are a batterer, we will stop you, we will catch you, and we \nwill prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law. And I am told by \npolice chiefs throughout Connecticut that that is why these programs, \nand the funds that make them possible, have truly improved their \nability to combat domestic violence. Domestic violence is preventable, \nif we provide the funding for initiatives to stop it.\n  Now, however, the elimination of antidomestic violence COPS grants \nthreatens to force an untimely end to successful programs like those in \nConnecticut. Law enforcement officials would be hindered in their \neffort to prevent domestic violence and catch and punish perpetrators, \nand victims of domestic violence would continue to suffer. Let's not \nabandon police chiefs when they've just begun to win the battle against \ndomestic violence. Let's not turn our backs on the victims who need our \nhelp.\n  I wrote to the Commerce-State-Justice appropriators to ask them to \nmaintain the funding for these important programs, and I am pleased \ntoday to cosponsor the amendment that would do just that. Hundreds of \npolice chiefs and countless victims across the country are counting on \nus to do no less.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his amendment, and I join \nhim in urging my colleagues to adopt it.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for \nfinishing expeditiously and for his help on a number of issues \nthroughout the day as we try to get an agreement on how we can proceed \nfor the remainder of the day, and when we can get votes tomorrow and \nnext week.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following be the only \nremaining first-degree amendments in order to S. 1022, and they be \nsubject to relevant second-degree amendments.\n  Mr. President, I will submit the list since there are several of \nthem. But everybody has been consulted on this list. The Democratic \nleadership is aware of it as well as the Members on this side.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n            democratic amendments to commerce-state-justice\n\n       Baucus, EDA.\n       Biden, COPS.\n       Biden, trust fund.\n       Bingaman, registration of nonprofits.\n       Bumpers, OMB.\n       Byrd, anti-alcohol.\n       Conrad, relevant.\n       Daschle, law enforcement.\n       Dorgan, sense of Senate--Univ.

Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that all \namendments must be offered and debated tonight and any votes ordered \nwith respect to S. 1022 be postponed to occur beginning on 9:30 a.m. on \nTuesday, July 29, with 2 minutes for debate equally divided before each \nvote, and following the disposition of amendments, S. 1022 be advanced \nto third reading and a passage vote occur, all without further action \nor debate.\n  I have more to this request, but I want to emphasize what that means. \nWe will complete all of the amendments tonight. The votes on those \namendments and final passage will occur next Tuesday beginning the \n9:30.\n  I further ask that if the Senate has not received the House companion \nbill at the time of passage of S. 1022, the bill remain at the desk; \nand I further ask unanimous consent that when the Senate receives the \nHouse companion bill, the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration \nand all after the enacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 1022, \nas amended, be inserted, the House bill then be read a third time and \npassed and the Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference \nwith the House and that the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees \nand that S. 1022 be indefinitely postponed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, in the \ndiscussions with the chairman of the subcommittee, as I understand it, \nthe amendment that is pending at the desk will be adopted this evening.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is my understanding Mr. President.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I further ask that at 8:30 a.m. on Tuesday the Senate \nresume the State, Justice, Commerce appropriations bill and there be 30 \nminutes remaining, equally divided, for debate on each of the two \namendments to be offered by Senator Wellstone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I further ask that it be in order, if necessary, for each \nleader to offer one relevant amendment on Tuesday prior to the \nscheduled 9:30 votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. With regard to the tuna-dolphin issue, I ask unanimous \nconsent that, at 9:30 a.m. on Friday, July 25, the Senate resume the \nmotion to proceed to S. 39, the tuna-dolphin bill, and there be 30 \nminutes equally divided between Senator McCain, or his designee, and \nSenator Boxer. I further ask unanimous consent that following the use \nor yielding back of the time, the Senate proceed to the vote on the \nmotion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 39.\n\n[[Page S8067]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I further ask that if an agreement can be \nreached with respect to S. 39--and it appears there may be--it be in \norder for the majority leader to vitiate the cloture vote, the Senate \nto then immediately proceed to S. 39, that the managers' amendment be \nin order, and the amendment and bill be limited to a total of 30 \nminutes equally divided, and following the disposition of the amendment \nthe bill be advanced to third reading, and passage occur, all without \nfurther action or debate.\n  I think I should clarify this and put it in common language.\n  If an agreement is worked out, we will vitiate the cloture vote. I \nwould like to modify that agreement to say that, if an agreement is \nreached, we will vitiate; then we will take that issue up next week \nwith 30 minutes of debate and a vote next week, unless a voice vote \nwould be agreed to for tomorrow or next week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. With regard to Wednesday of next week, I ask unanimous \nconsent that at 9:30 a.m., Wednesday, July 30, the Senate proceed to \nthe consideration of Senate Resolution 98. I further ask unanimous \nconsent that there be 2 hours of debate on the resolution equally \ndivided between the chairman and the ranking member, or their \ndesignees, with the following amendments in order to this bill.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I realize it gets a little confusing on how \nwe are lining these up. But I think it is being helpful to all \nSenators. I think it is allowing us to complete the debate and get \nvotes and move important legislation forward in the best way possible.\n  So the way we are getting it racked up, so to speak, I think is good \nfor the Senate, and we are trying to do the right thing.\n  So I would like to modify that earlier request to this extent:\n  That we come in in the morning and go immediately at 9:30 to the \nglobal-warming bill. That bill is Senate Resolution 98. I ask consent \nthat there be 2 hours of debate on the resolution equally divided \nbetween the chairman and the ranking member or their designees with the \nonly amendments in order to be the following: Kerry amendment adding \nspecific negotiating positions; Senator Byrd's amendment, relevant.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of the \nabove-mentioned amendments and the expiration or yielding back of time \nfor debate, the Senate proceed to a vote on the resolution with no \nintervening action or debate, and, if the resolution is agreed to, the \npreamble then be agreed to, which means that the final vote on global \nwarming would occur around 11:30 tomorrow morning.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--I will not \nobject--I simply ask the majority leader if he would modify that \nfurther, per our agreement, that they would be first-degree amendments \nwith no second-degree amendments.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask to further modify my unanimous-consent \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Then the modification of what we had earlier agreed to is \nthat after that vote on Senate Resolution 98, we would then have the \nvote on the cloture motion on tuna-dolphin unless an agreement is \nworked out, at which point we would vitiate that cloture vote, and we \nwould get a subsequent time agreement of 30 minutes and a voice vote, \nor a recorded vote, on that issue next week.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not object--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The leader did not say exactly what time the cloture vote \nwould take place.\n  Mr. LOTT. The cloture vote would then take place, after the global \nwarming vote, I presume about 11:45, 11:50, something of that nature.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Could we say by 12 o'clock?\n  Mr. LOTT. It certainly would be by 12 o'clock.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That would be very helpful. One more point. If there \nshould be a recorded vote, which many of us do not anticipate, on the \ndolphin-tuna compromise, if there is one, could we reserve just a \ncouple of minutes on either side just to talk before that vote, on next \nweek, just 2 minutes?\n  Mr. LOTT. Before the vote next week.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Sure. I would hate to enter into a time agreement on a \nspecific time now but we would have a vote at an agreed to time and we \nwould have some time to explain it. I think it is appropriate.\n  Mr. KERRY. It is my understanding the majority leader in the prior \norder already requested 30 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. I had indicated 30 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is very acceptable. Thank you very much. And I \nwanted to thank the Senator from Arizona as well for helping resolve \nthis procedure.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the Senators for their cooperation. \nLet us keep going then. I think we are making good progress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 5 o'clock on Monday, July 28, the \nSenate proceed to the consideration of the Transportation \nappropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. For the information of all Senators, any votes ordered with \nrespect to the Transportation appropriations bill will be postponed to \noccur on Wednesday morning immediately following the global warming \nresolution vote.\n  We have changed that now. The Transportation appropriations bill \nwould occur on Wednesday morning.\n  Mr. FORD. I liked the first one better.\n  Mr. LOTT. Therefore, no votes will occur during the session on \nMonday, July 28.\n  Mr. President, I will yield the floor at this point and in a few \nminutes we will recap everything we agreed to in those unanimous-\nconsent agreements so that they will be clear and understandable. We \nwill do that before we go out tonight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 989\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, is the Sarbanes amendment now the \npending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sarbanes amendment is now the pending \nbusiness.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I ask unanimous consent that Senators Moynihan, Hatch, \nJeffords, Kerry, Biden, and Leahy be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I hope we could move to adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. I hope the Senator would ask for adoption.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The question is on the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 989) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 993\n\n    (Purpose: To make an Amendment Relating to the Health Insurance \n              Benefits of Certain Public Safety Officers)\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, at the completion of these brief remarks, \nI will send an amendment to the desk.\n  Mr. President, last year in consideration of this same appropriations \nbill, the Senate and the House adopted and the President signed into \nlaw what is known as the Alu-O'Hara bill. This is legislation which was \nthe result of a tragic circumstance in which two law enforcement \nofficers called to a hostage-taking scene were seriously\n\n[[Page S8068]]\n\nburned when the hostage taker set on fire the structure in which the \nhostages were being held. These two law enforcement officers were \nsubsequently discharged from the law enforcement agency because of \ntheir severe injuries, and in the course of their discharge they lost \ntheir insurance coverage. So now they were two heroes out of work, \nlifetime injuries and without health insurance.\n  This Alu-O'Hara bill, which we adopted last year, provided that law \nenforcement agencies would provide to any public service officer ``who \nretires or is separated from service due to an injury suffered as the \ndirect and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in line of \nduty while responding to an emergency situation or in hot pursuit with \nthe same or better level of health insurance benefits that are \notherwise paid by the entity to a public service officer at the time of \nretirement or separation.'' The enforcement for this was a reduction in \nthat local law enforcement block grant award.\n  Mr. President, as I indicate, this has been the law since last year. \nIt is currently in the House appropriations bill. Frankly, we are \nseeking an opportunity to put this into substantive law so we will not \nhave to continue to rely upon the appropriations bill as the means of \ncontinuing this important protection for law enforcement officers which \nhas strong support by all the major law enforcement agencies in \nAmerica.\n  So I send this amendment to the desk and will ask my colleagues for \nits favorable adoption when we consider these matters on Tuesday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment. The bill \nclerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 993.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in title I of the bill, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 1. Of the amounts made available under this title \n     under the heading ``OFFICE OF JUSTICE PROGRAMS'' under the \n     subheading ``state and local law enforcement assistance'', \n     not more than 90 percent of the amount otherwise to be \n     awarded to an entity under the Local Law Enforcement Block \n     Grant Program shall be made available to that entity, if it \n     is made known to the Federal official having authority to \n     obligate or expend such amounts that the entity employs a \n     public safety officer (as that term is defined in section \n     1204 of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets \n     Act of 1968) does not provide an employee who is public \n     safety officer and who retires or is separated from service \n     due to injury suffered as the direct and proximate result of \n     a personal injury sustained in the line of duty while \n     responding to an emergency situation or a hot pursuit (as \n     such terms are defined by State law) with the same or better \n     level of health insurance benefits that are otherwise paid by \n     the entity to a public safety officer at the time of \n     retirement or separation.\n\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. We have no objection to this amendment and I ask unanimous \nconsent the amendment be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 993) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have been working on a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution which I hoped to have the agreement of a number of \nMembers of the Senate who have similar interests on the issue of the \nusing universal service funds for the purpose of reaching a balanced \nbudget in the budget reconciliation conference that is now going on. I \nknow that sounds foreign as a subject to those who are not familiar \nwith it, but I want to explain it a little bit and describe why this is \nimportant.\n  I have spoken to a number of Senators in the Chamber this evening--\nSenator Stevens, the distinguished chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Rockefeller, Senator Hollings, \nSenator Daschle, Senator Snowe, and others who are concerned about \nsomething that is happening in the reconciliation conference that could \nhave a significant impact on the cost of telephone service in rural \nareas in this country in the years ahead. Here is what it is.\n  Our country has been fortunate to enjoy the benefits of a \ntelecommunications system that says it does not matter where you live. \nIf you live in an area where you have very high-cost service, there \nwill be something called a universal service fund that helps drive down \nthat high cost so that everyone in this country can afford telephone \nservice, universally affordable telephone service. That is what the \nuniversal service fund is designed to do and has been designed to do \nfor a long, long while. I come from a town of 300 people and telephone \nservice there is affordable because the universal service fund drives \ndown the rate of what would otherwise be high cost. The benefits of a \nnational system is that every telephone in the country makes every \nother telephone more valuable. A telephone in my hometown in Regent, \nND, makes Donald Trump's telephone more valuable in New York City \nbecause he can reach that telephone in Regent, ND. That is the whole \nconcept of universally affordable telephone service, and it is why we \nhave a universal service fund.\n  Now, having said that, the universal service fund was reconstructed \nsome--but not dramatically--during the Telecommunications Act passed by \nCongress a year and a half ago. We now have a balanced budget proposal \nthat is in conference between the House and the Senate and some are \nsaying in this negotiation that they want to use the revenues from the \nuniversal service fund out in the year 2002 in order to help plug a \nleak on the budget side.\n  The fact is the universal service fund was never intended to be used \nfor such a purpose. In fact, the universal service fund does not belong \nto the Government. It does not come into the Federal Treasury and is \nnot expended by the Federal Government. It, therefore, ought not be a \npart of any discussion on budget negotiations, and yet it is.\n  This week I have spoken several times to the Office of Management and \nBudget, and they have explained to me in great detail with no clarity \nat all why it is now part of this process. I have spoken to people who \nclaim to be experts on this, and none of them have the foggiest idea \nabout what the proposal actually does.\n  Now, the reason I come to the floor to speak about it is this: We are \nnearing presumably the end of a conference, and if a conference report \ncomes to the floor of the Senate using the universal service fund as \npart of a manipulated set of revenues in the year 2002, in order to \nreach some sort of budget figure, it will be an enormous disservice for \nthe universal service fund. It will deny the purpose of the fund for \nwhich we in the Commerce Committee worked so hard to preserve in the \nTelecommunications Act of 1996. This provision in the reconciliation \nbill will set a precedent that will be a terrible precedent for the \nfuture. The result will be, I guarantee, higher phone bills in rural \nareas in this country in the years ahead.\n\n  I once stopped at a hotel in Minneapolis, MN, and there was a sign at \nthe nearest parking space to the front door, and it said ``Manager's \nparking space.'' And then below it, it said, ``Don't even think about \nparking here.'' I don't expect anybody ever parked in that space \nbesides the manager. Don't even think about parking here. I hope that \nthe Senate will pass the sense-of-the-Senate resolution I have proposed \nthat says to the reconciliation conference: ``do not even think about \nthis.'' I say to the budget reconciliation conferees: ``do not try to \nbring to the floor of the Senate or the House a budget reconciliation \nconference report that manipulates and misuses the universal service \nfund.'' It is not right, it is not fair, and it will destroy the \nunderpinnings of what we have done in telecommunications policy to \nprovide affordable telephone service across this country for all \nAmericans. Yes, especially, most especially Americans who live in the \nrural areas of this country.\n  I have enormous respect for those people who put these budgets \ntogether. It is not easy. But this instance of using the universal \nservice fund as is\n\n[[Page S8069]]\n\nnow being proposed is, I am afraid, budget juggling at its worst. \nJuggling I suppose at a carnival or in the backyard is entertaining. \nJuggling in this circumstance using universal fund support to \nmanipulate the numbers in 2002 is not entertaining to me. It is \nfundamentally wrong. This money does not belong to the Federal \nGovernment. It does not come to the Federal Treasury, and it is not \nspent by the Federal Government and has no place and no business in any \nreconciliation conference report.\n  I was flabbergasted to learn that it was there and it is being \ndiscussed. I have spoken to the Director of the Office of Management \nand Budget about this several times this week, spoken to others who are \ninvolved with it. And I must tell you I think that the Congressional \nBudget Office, the Office of Management and Budget, and any member of \nthe conference that espouses this is making a terrible, terrible \nmistake. I hope that the Senate will pass the sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution I have proposed and that we can garner the support of the \nposition I now espouse to say as that parking sign, ``don't even think \nabout this.'' It is wrong, and it will disserve the interests that we \nhave fought so hard to preserve affordable telephone service all across \nthis country.\n  The Senator from South Carolina has spent a great deal of time on \nthis issue, as has the Senator from Alaska, the Senator from West \nVirginia, the Senator from Maine, and so many others. As I said, the \nwording is not yet agreed to on the sense-of-the-Senate resolution. I \nhope it will be very shortly, and when it is I hope we will pass it and \nsend a message that any conference report that comes back here ought \nnot use universal service support funds because they are not our funds \nto use.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 994\n\n (Purpose: To amend section 3006A of title 18, United States Code, to \n provide for the public disclosure of court appointed attorneys' fees \n                upon approval of such fees by the court)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have an amendment and I understand it \nis going to be accepted. I will let the managers do that in their wrap-\nup if they would like unless the Senator has indicated that it is all \nright.\n  Mr. President, I ask, has Senator Hollings cleared it?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. It has been cleared.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator very much.\n  I send an amendment to the desk, and since it is acceptable on both \nsides I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 994.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title I of the bill, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 1. PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF COURT APPOINTED ATTORNEYS' FEES.\n\n       Section 3006A(d) of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended by striking paragraph (4) and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(4) Disclosure of fees.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Subject to subparagraphs (B) through \n     (E), the amounts paid under this subsection for services in \n     any case shall be made available to the public by the court \n     upon the court's approval of the payment.\n       ``(B) Pre-trial or trial in progress.--If a trial is in \n     pre-trial status or still in progress and after considering \n     the defendant's interests as set forth in subparagraph (D), \n     the court shall--\n       ``(i) redact any detailed information on the payment \n     voucher provided by defense counsel to justify the expenses \n     to the court; and\n       ``(ii) make public only the amounts approved for payment to \n     defense counsel by dividing those amounts into the following \n     categories:\n       ``(I) Arraignment and or plea.\n       ``(II) Bail and detention hearings.\n       ``(III) Motions.\n       ``(IV) Hearings.\n       ``(V) Interviews and conferences.\n       ``(VI) Obtaining and reviewing records.\n       ``(VII) Legal research and brief writing.\n       ``(VIII) Travel time.\n       ``(IX) Investigative work.\n       ``(X) Experts.\n       ``(XI) Trial and appeals.\n       ``(XII) Other.\n       ``(C) Trial completed.--\n       ``(i) In general.--If a request for payment is not \n     submitted until after the completion of the trial and subject \n     to consideration of the defendant's interests as set forth in \n     subparagraph (D), the court shall make available to the \n     public an unredacted copy of the expense voucher.\n       ``(ii) Protection of the rights of the defendant.--If the \n     court determines that defendant's interests as set forth in \n     subparagraph (D) require a limited disclosure, the court \n     shall disclose amounts as provided in subparagraph (B).\n       ``(D) Considerations.--The interests referred to in \n     subparagraphs (B) and (C) are--\n       ``(i) to protect any person's 5th amendment right against \n     self-incrimination;\n       ``(ii) to protect the defendant's 6th amendment rights to \n     effective assistance of counsel;\n       ``(iii) the defendant's attorney-client privilege;\n       ``(iv) the work product privilege of the defendant's \n     counsel;\n       ``(v) the safety of any person; and\n       ``(vi) any other interest that justice may require.\n       ``(E) Notice.--The court shall provide reasonable notice of \n     disclosure to the counsel of the defendant prior to the \n     approval of the payments in order to allow the counsel to \n     request redaction based on the considerations set forth in \n     subparagraph (D).

Mr. President, I am not sure, if I were to ask every \nSenator to take a guess, anyone would come anywhere close to answering \nthis question correctly.\n  I ask, how many dollars do you think we spent last year paying for \ndefense lawyers for criminals in the Federal court who claim they don't \nhave enough money to defend themselves?\n  We have an obligation. The court has interpreted our Constitution to \nsay they must have counsel, so I am not here complaining. But I don't \nthink anyone--I see my friend from Iowa looking at me--would guess $308 \nmillion, and growing tremendously, taxpayers' dollars to defend \ncriminals in the Federal court system.\n  I am not asking in this amendment that we review that process, \nalthough I kind of cry out to any committee that has jurisdiction and \nask them to take a look. All I am doing in this amendment is changing \nthe law slightly with reference to letting the taxpayer know how much \nwe are paying criminal defense lawyers. All this amendment does is say \nwhen a payment is made to a criminal defense lawyer, a form has to be \nfiled that indicates that payment. There is no violation of the sixth \namendment because there are no details. We are not going to, in this \nstatement, reveal the secret strategy of the defense counsel or their \nlatest deposition theory. We are just saying, reveal the dollar amount \nso the American people know, through public sources, how much we are \npaying.\n  Frankly, if I had a little more time, I would state some of the fees \nthat we finally have ascertained, and I think many would say, ``Are you \nkidding?'' I will just give you three that we know of.\n  Mr. President, what would you say if I told you that from the \nbeginning of fiscal year 1996 through January 1997, $472,841 was paid \nto a lawyer to defend a person accused of a crime so heinous that the \nUnited States Attorney in the Northern District of New York is pursuing \nthe death penalty? Who paid for this lawyer--the American taxpayer.\n  What would you say if I told you that $470,968 was paid to a lawyer \nto defend a person accused of a crime so reprehensible that, there too, \nthe United States Attorney in the Southern District of Florida is also \npursuing the death penalty? Who paid for this lawyer--the American \ntaxpayer.\n  What would you say if I told you that during the same period, for the \nsame purpose, $443,683 was paid to another attorney to defend a person \naccused of a crime so villainous that the United States Attorney in the \nNorthern District of New York is pursuing the death penalty? Who paid \nfor this lawyer--the American taxpayer.\n  Now, Mr. President, what would you say if I told you that some of \nthese cases have been ongoing for three or more years and that total \nfees in some\n\n[[Page S8070]]\n\ninstances will be more than $1 million in an individual case? That's $1 \nmillion to pay criminal lawyers to defend people accused of the most \nvicious types of murders often which are of the greatest interest to \nthe communities in which they were committed.\n  At minimum, Mr. President, this Senator would say that we are \nspending a great deal of money on criminal defense lawyers and the \nAmerican taxpayer ought to have timely access to the information that \nwill tell them who is spending their money, and how it is being spent. \nThat is why today I am introducing the ``Disclosure of Court Appointed \nAttorney's Fees and Taxpayer Right to Know Act of 1997''.\n  Under current law, the maximum amount payable for representation \nbefore the United States Magistrate or the District Court, or both, is \nlimited to $3,500 for each lawyer in a case in which one or more \nfelonies are charged and $125 per hour per lawyer in death penalty \ncases. Many Senators might ask, if that is so, why are these exorbitant \namounts being paid in the particular cases you mention? I say to my \ncolleagues the reason this happens is because under current law the \nmaximum amounts established by statute may be waived whenever the judge \ncertifies that the amount of the excess payment is necessary to provide \n``fair compensation'' and the payment is approved by the Chief Judge on \nthe circuit. In addition, whatever is considered ``fair compensation'' \nat the $125 per hour per lawyer rate may also be approved at the \nJudge's discretion.\n  Mr. President, the American taxpayer has a legitimate interest in \nknowing what is being provided as ``fair compensation'' to defend \nindividuals charged with these dastardly crimes in our federal court \nsystem. Especially when certain persons the American taxpayer is paying \nfor mock the American Justice System. A recent Nightline episode \nreported that one of the people the American taxpayer is shelling out \ntheir hard earned money to defend urinated in open court, in front of \nthe Judge, to demonstrate his feelings about the judge and the American \njudicial system.\n  I want to be very clear about what exactly my bill would accomplish. \nThe question of whether these enormous fees should be paid for these \ncriminal lawyers is not, I repeat, is not a focus of my bill. In \nkeeping with my strongly held belief that the American taxpayer has a \nlegitimate interest in having timely access to this information, my \nbill simply requires that at the time the court approves the payments \nfor these services, that the payments be publicly disclosed. Many \nSenators are probably saying right now that this sounds like a very \nreasonable request, and I think it is, but the problem is that often \ntimes these payments are not disclosed until long after the trial has \nbeen completed, and in some cases they may not be disclosed at all if \nthe remains are sealed by the Judge. How much criminal defense lawyers \nare being paid should not be a secret. There is a way in which we can \nprotect the alleged criminal's sixth amendment rights and still honor \nthe American taxpayer's right to know. Mr. President, that is what my \nbill does.\n  Current law basically leaves the question of when and whether court \nappointed attorneys' fees should be disclosed at the discretion of the \nJudge in which the particular case is being tried. My bill would take \nsome of that discretion away and require that disclosure occur once the \npayment has been approved.\n  My bill continues to protect the defendant's sixth amendment right to \neffective assistance of counsel, the defendant's attorney client \nprivilege, the work product immunity of defendant's counsel, the safety \nof any witness, and any other interest that justice may require by \nproviding notice to defense counsel that this information will be \nreleased, and allowing defense counsel, or the court on its own, to \nredact any information contained on the payment voucher that might \ncompromise any of the aforementioned interests. That means that the \ncriminal lawyer can ask the Judge to take his big black marker and \nblack-out any information that might compromise these precious Sixth \nAmendment rights, or the Judge can make this decision on his own. In \nany case, the Judge will let the criminal lawyer know that this \ninformation will be released and the criminal lawyer will have the \nopportunity to request the Judge black-out any compromising information \nfrom the payment voucher.\n  How would this occur? Under current law, criminal lawyers must fill \nout Criminal Justice Act payment vouchers in order to receive payment \nfor services rendered. Mr. President, I have brought two charts to the \nfloor to provide Senators with an example of what these payment \nvouchers look like so that they can get an understanding of what my \nbill would accomplish. These two payment vouchers are the standard \nvouchers used in the typical felony and death penalty cases prosecuted \nin the federal district courts. As you can see Mr. President, the \ninformation on these payment vouchers describes in barebones fashion \nthe nature of the work performed and the amount that is paid for each \ncategory of service.\n  My bill says that once the Judge approves these payment vouchers that \nthey be publicly disclosed. That means that anyone can walk down to the \nfederal district court where the case is being tried and ask the clerk \nof the court for copies of the relevant CJA payment vouchers. It's that \nsimple. Nothing more. Nothing less.\n  Before the court releases this information it will provide notice to \ndefense counsel that the information will be released, and either the \ncriminal lawyer, or the Judge on his/her own, may black-out any of the \nbarebones information on the payment voucher that might compromise the \nalleged criminal's precious sixth amendment rights.\n  Mr. President, I believe that my bill is a modest step toward \nassuring that the American taxpayer have timely access to this \ninformation. In addition to these CJA payment vouchers, criminal \nlawyers must also supply the court with detailed time sheets that \nrecount with extreme particularity the nature of the work performed. \nThese detailed time sheets break down the work performed by the \ncriminal lawyer to the minute. They name each and every person that was \ninterviewed, each and every phone call that was made, the subjects that \nwere discussed and the days and the times they took place. They go into \nintimate detail about what was done to prepare briefs, conduct \ninvestigations, and prepare for trial.\n  Mr. President, clearly if this information were subject to public \ndisclosure the alleged criminal's sixth amendment rights might be \ncompromised. My bill does not seek to make this sensitive information \nsubject to public disclosure, but rather continues to leave it to the \nJudge to determine if and when it should be released. In this way, my \nbill recognizes and preserves the delicate balance between the American \ntaxpayers' right to know how their money is being spent, and the \nalleged criminal's right to a fair trial.\n  I believe we should take every reasonable step to protect any \ndisclosure that might compromise the alleged criminal's sixth amendment \nrights. My bill does this by providing notice to defense counsel of the \nrelease of the information, and providing the Judge with the authority \nto black-out any of the barebones information contained on the payment \nvoucher if it might compromise any of the aforementioned interests. I \nbelieve it is reasonable and fair, and I hope I will have my \ncolleagues' support.\n  I am very pleased the Senate will accept this. I hope the House does. \nI believe they will. Because I think the public has a right to know. As \na matter of fact, I think we have a right to know, case by case, \npayment by payment, how much is being paid by the taxpayer to defend \ncriminals in the Federal court.\n  I yield the floor.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 994) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT \n                   SHOULD NOT MANIPULATE UNIVERSAL SERVICE SUPPORT \n                   PAYMENTS TO BALANCE THE FEDERAL BUDGET.\n\n       Whereas the Congress reaffirmed the importance of universal \n     service support for telecommunications services by passing \n     the Telecommunications Act of 1996;\n       Whereas the Telecommunications Act of 1996 required the \n     Federal Communications Commission to preserve and advance \n     universal service based on the following principles:\n       (A) Quality services should be available at just, \n     reasonable, and affordable rates;\n       (B) Access to advanced telecommunications and information \n     services should be provided in all regions of the Nation;\n       (C) Consumers in all regions of the Nation, including low-\n     income consumers and those in rural, insular, and high cost \n     areas, should have access to telecommunications and \n     information services, including interexchange services and \n     advanced telecommunications and information services, that \n     are reasonably comparable to those services provided in urban \n     areas and that are available at rates that are reasonably \n     comparable to rates charged for similar services;\n       (D) All providers of telecommunications services should \n     make an equitable and nondiscriminatory contribution to the \n     preservation and advancement of universal service;\n       (E) There should be specific, predictable, and sufficient \n     Federal and State mechanisms to preserve and advance \n     universal service; and\n       (F) Elementary and secondary schools and classrooms, health \n     care providers, and libraries should have access to advanced \n     telecommunications services;\n       Whereas Federal and State universal contributions are \n     administered by an independent, non-Federal entity and are \n     not deposited into the Federal Treasury and therefore not \n     available for Federal appropriations;\n       Whereas the Conference Committee on H.R. 2015, the Budget \n     Reconciliation Bill, is considering proposals that would \n     withhold Federal and State universal service funds in the \n     year 2002; and\n       Whereas the withholding of billions of dollars of universal \n     service support payments will mean significant rate increases \n     in rural and high cost areas and will deny qualifying \n     schools, libraries, and rural health facilities discounts \n     directed under the Telecommunications Act of 1996:\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     Conference Committee on H.R. 2015 should not manipulate, \n     modify, or impair universal service support as a means to \n     achieve a balanced Federal budget or achieve Federal budget \n     savings.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 998\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS.

Mr. President, the junior Senator from West Virginia \nwishes to continue, a little bit, the comments that were made by the \nSenator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan]. Needless to say, the Senator \nfrom West Virginia not only wholly agrees with him, but would carry the \nargument even further.\n  The concept of universal service is literally sacred in our country. \nFor the majority of the people of our land, which is rural land, it is \nthe only lifeline they have potentially to the present day and to their \nfuture day. They are able to afford certain kinds of rural rates. But \nif people start to take the universal service fund and use it for any \nother purpose other than what it was originally intended, the whole \nsystem of equality between rural States and urban States, of user \nStates and using States, disappears. The concept of universal service \nis ended.\n  I would like to suggest that this is not a thought which is held by \nmyself alone. I ask at this moment to have printed in the Record a \nletter from the U.S. Telephone Association and a letter from the Rural \nTelephone Coalition on the subject that the Senator from North Dakota \nand I were discussing.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     United States\n\n\n                                        Telephone Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 1997.\n     Hon. Byron L. Dorgan,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dorgan: The United States Telephone \n     Association (``USTA''), representing more than 1,200 \n     companies, is dismayed that Congress has chosen universal \n     telephone service as a vehicle to balance the budget by the \n     year 2002. While USTA recognizes the endeavors of key leaders \n     in rejecting spectrum fees and other inappropriate budget \n     proposals, exploiting the universal telephone service fund to \n     balance the budget is not only bad precedent, it is bad \n     telecommunications policy. Accordingly, USTA strenuously \n     urges you to oppose this proposal in conference.\n       In its effort to meet the budget accord, the U.S. House of \n     Representatives adopted a reconciliation package that \n     maneuvers universal telephone service support moneys to \n     satisfy current budgetary objectives. To make up for a $2 \n     billion budget shortfall, the House's proposal borrows $2 \n     billion in FY 2001 while artificially reducing universal \n     telephone service support by this same amount in FY 2002. \n     This proposal needlessly jeopardizes a privately run support \n     system that continues to work without federal monetary aid. \n     Moreover, such a ``scoring'' device sets a dangerous \n     precedent that could damage this nation's universal telephone \n     service policy necessary to maintain nationwide, affordable \n     telecommunications service.\n       USTA has opposed the Office of Management and Budget and \n     the Congressional Budget Office for more than two years over \n     their claims of authority to reflect universal telephone \n     service transactions on the federal budget. The \n     Telecommunications Act clearly establishes the manner in \n     which universal telephone service funds are collected and \n     disbursed. Pursuant to the Act, universal telephone service \n     moneys logically should not be classified as either federal \n     receipts or federal disbursements and thus should not be \n     associated with the federal budget, as the Administration has \n     insisted and Congress has allowed.\n       USTA appreciates your continued support regarding the \n     elimination of such budget proposals as the imposition of \n     spectrum fees. Similarly, USTA strongly urges you to reject \n     any proposals that would seek to balance the budget at the \n     expense of universal telephone service. We hope we can count \n     on you to help keep such initiatives out of the final \n     conferenced agreement.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Roy Neel,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              NRTA--NTCA--OPASTCO,\n\n\n                                    Rural Telephone Coalition,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 10, 1997.\n       Dear Senator/Representative: The undersigned collectively \n     representing approximately 850 of the nation's small rural \n     incumbent local exchange carriers, have been closely \n     following the struggle of the Congress to develop a \n     reconciliation package that meets the targets assigned by the \n     recent budget accord. Although we understand the difficult \n     nature of this task, we applaud the efforts of key leaders \n     who have prevented the adoption of many of the more \n     unrealistic and unjustified concepts for meeting the \n     agreement's targets. These concepts include auctioning \n     electromagnetic radio spectrum at all costs, imposing new \n     electromagnetic radio spectrum fees and auctioning toll-free \n     ``vanity'' numbers.\n       However, we are alarmed that the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, in its last-minute effort to achieve the \n     budget agreement's targets, adopted a reconciliation package \n     containing language that manipulates universal service \n     support moneys to do so. Universal telecommunications service \n     is a national policy objective, but the moneys that are \n     involved in effectuating this policy are strictly private, \n     not governmental as the House initiative attempts to suggest. \n     The House provision seeks to create the illusion that the \n     U.S. government should somehow have access to these private \n     universal service moneys for the sole purpose of balancing \n     the budget.\n       Specifically, in attempting to make up for a $2 billion \n     budget shortfall, the U.S. House of Representatives has \n     adopted a reconciliation package that uses universal service \n     support moneys to meet its present budget objectives and even \n     seems to suggest that a totally unnecessary appropriation is \n     involved. This proposal borrows $2 billion in fiscal year \n     (FY) 2001 while artificially reducing universal service \n     support by this same amount in FY 2002--budget gimmickry \n     Congress should reject. This proposal unnecessarily \n     jeopardizes a privately run support system that continues to \n     work without federal monetary aid. Such a misleading \n     ``scoring'' device sets a dangerous precedent that could \n     permanently damage the nation's statutory universal service \n     policy and budget process.\n       Our organizations have opposed the Office of Management and \n     Budget (OMB) and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) for \n     more than two years over their claims of authority to reflect \n     universal service transactions on the federal budget. \n     Universal service flow transactions represent the collection \n     and distribution of private moneys, for the sole purpose of \n     recovering private investment and expenses necessary to \n     maintain nationwide universal telecommunications service. \n     Therefore, universal service moneys logically cannot be \n     classified as either federal receipts or federal \n     disbursements and thus legally should not be associated with \n     the federal budget, as the administration has insisted and \n     the Congress has allowed.\n       We are pleased that Congress rejected spectrum fees and \n     other inappropriate proposals that had the sole intent of \n     meeting budgetary targets. However, manipulation of universal \n     service moneys to look like U.S. government resources is not \n     only bad precedent, but also had telecommunications policy. \n     Any measure embracing such a proposal should be strenuously \n     opposed. We hope we can count on your support to keep such \n     initiatives out of the final conferenced reconciliation \n     package. Please feel free to contact any one of our \n     organizations if you have questions about this critical \n     matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     John F. O'Neal,\n     General Counsel, National Rural Telecom Association.\n     Michael E. Brunner,\n       Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer, \n     National Telephone Cooperative Association.\n     John N. Rose,\n       President, Organization for the Promotion and Advancement \n     of Small Telecommunications Companies.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. There is another aspect which worries me greatly. I \nhave heard so many people talk about the importance of technology and \nthe importance of understanding that technology is our future and the \nfact that so many of the people in our rural areas and in our urban \nareas are not hooked up to the Internet and hooked up to all of the \nadvantages that technology and the computer brings us. It was with that \nin mind that during the consideration of the Telecommunications Act, a \nnumber of Senators, led\n\n[[Page S8073]]\n\nby Senator Snowe of Maine, put forward an amendment which would allow, \nfor the very first time, money to be used with the full consent of the \ncarriers, to be used to wire up 116,000 schools in this country, \nendless numbers of public libraries, enormous numbers of rural health \nclinics so that they could develop in the practice of telemedicine and \nother new technologies that are now and will be available.\n  If what is being contemplated by those who are working on the \nreconciliation process is the use of universal service money to plug up \na potential shortfall in the spectrum auction, the entire Snowe \namendment, which relates to whether or not we are going to have a \nfirst- or second-class citizenry in this country --first-class being \nthose who have the money to have computers in their schools and at home \nand then the second class, and that being the majority, being those who \ndo not--all of that will go down.\n  I make the further point that this is not the Government's money. \nSome may try to argue that it is, but it is money that is paid into a \nspecial fund and it is money which is being administered by something \ncalled NECA, which is the ``national exchange cable association''--I \nbelieve that is what it stands for. They are private. They are private. \nThey are a private entity administering this fund.\n  This has been through a Senate process where it was agreed to in a \nbipartisan debate, 98 to 1. It has been through a joint board, FCC \nprocess, that is State and FCC together, voting 8 to nothing, and \nthrough a further final FCC process, 4 to nothing--unanimous, virtually \nthe entire way through.\n  If the budget negotiators use this universal service fund for any \npurpose other than for the purposes that the universal service fund is \nmeant to be used for, I think it begins a tremendous downfall in not \nonly our future in terms of rural rates, but also in terms of learning \nand technology. The Vice President of the United States, our former \ncolleague, Albert Gore, said that in his view the Snowe amendment, \nrelating to 116,000 schools, more public libraries and more rural \nhealth clinics, was the biggest and most important thing that had \nhappened in education policy in the last 30 years. He may have said, in \nthis century.\n  In any event, all of that is in jeopardy, and the resolution, which \nis being circulated, I hope will be carried by staff members and others \nwho hear the voice of the Senator from North Dakota and myself, to \ntheir Senators to know that something called universal service is in \ndire jeopardy as of this moment, because the tampering with that \nuniversal service is now in the bill that may come before us. There has \nto be a change made. Change is hard to come by. In other words, we \nreally are at the ramparts on this issue.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, NECA is the National Exchange Carriers \nAssociation. Mr. President, this association was formed at the breakup \nof AT back in 1984, and it is a private entity, whereby the different \ncarriers, through their trade associations, self-impose, in an \nintermittent fashion, the amounts due and owing in order to constitute \nwhat we call the universal service fund. It is a private entity. There \nis no Federal law that says you can be a member or shall be a member or \nyou cannot be a member. It is not under the Federal law; it is under \nthis particular entity that it was associated with and together at that \nparticular time of the breakup.\n  It depends on the volume of business, obviously. If you get a greater \nvolume and more burdens and so forth--for high-cost areas is really \nwhat it was for, initially. It is now being extended to rural, being \nextended for the schools and the hospitals. But the high-cost areas are \nbeing taken care of under this universal service fund.\n  Mr. President, what we are seeing here--and I hope the conferees on \nreconciliation get the message--this is the epitome of the national \nloot. In 1994, this Congress passed, President Clinton signed into law \nthe Pension Reform Act. Under that Pension Reform Act, it provided \ncertain penalties, whereby you can't loot the pension funds of the \nparticular corporate America. They wanted to make sure that a person in \nthis particular corporation who had worked over the years and \neverything else, didn't have a newcomer in a merger or buyout or \nwhatever it is, abscond with all the moneys and all of a sudden your \npension was gone.\n  Now, it so happens that in the news here, about 6 weeks ago, now 8 \nweeks ago, that a famous American, Denny McLain, the all-time all-star \npitcher, I think it was, for the Detroit Tigers, became a president of \nthe corporation and he used the corporate pension fund in violation of \nlaw to pay the company's debt, and he was promptly sentenced to an 8-\nyear jail sentence. We do it at the Federal level and get the good \nGovernment award.\n  We loot the Social Security pension fund, the Medicare trust fund, \nthe civil service pension trust fund, the military retirees' trust \nfund. They even had in the reconciliation bill --and I put in an \namendment--the looting of the airport and airways improvement fund, \nwhereby the moneys that are supposed to go to the improvement of the \nairways instead is going to the deficit.\n  Now the cabal, the conspiracy that they call a conference committee \nhas the unmitigated gall to provide as follows, and I read:\n\n       The Senate recedes to the House with modifications.\n       3006 of this title provides that expenditures from the \n     universal service fund under part 54 of the Commission's \n     rules for the fiscal year 2002 shall not exceed the amount of \n     revenue to be collected for that fiscal year, less [blank] \n     billion dollars.\n       Section 3006(B) further provides that any outlays not made \n     from the universal service fund in fiscal year 2002 under \n     subsection (A) are immediately available commencing October \n     1, 2002.\n       The conferees note that this subsection shall not be \n     construed to require the amount of revenues collected under \n     part 54 of the Commission's rules to be increased.\n\n  What in the world, how else is it going to be done? If you take the \namount of the funds necessary to keep universal service constant, less \nX billion dollars or million dollars, whatever, that they want to fit \nin here for a budget fix, then the companies and the associations \nthrough their companies that make the contributions are going to have \nto immediately either cut out the service under the service fund and \nthe rules and regulations of the entity that controls it or raise the \nrates, and then the politicians will all run around saying, ``I'm \nagainst taxes, I'm against rate increases,'' when they are causing it \nin a shameful, shameless way in this particular provision and not even \nput in the amount. They have a blank here, and they are going to fill \nin the amount, and it is another smoke and another mirror and another \nloot.\n  Oh, yes, wonderful. We pass overwhelmingly the Pension Reform Act to \nmake sure that it is a trust and it can be depended upon, and here, in \nthe very same Congress, we come around and we loot all the particular \nfunds, and now we find a private one. Maybe they will get the Brownback \nfund before they get through, if they can find it, and add that to it, \ntoo. They can get anybody's fund and put something down in black and \nwhite and they say, ``Oh, what good boys we are. We put in our thumb \nand pulled out a plum, and we balance the budget.''\n  Turn to page 4 on the conference report on a so-called balance budget \nagreement and report for the 5-year period terminating fiscal year \n2002, and on page 4, line 15, the word is not ``balance,'' the word is \n``deficit,'' $173.9 billion deficit.\n  Yet, the print media--I am glad this is on C-SPAN so the people \nwithin the sound of my voice can at least hear it, because they are not \ngoing to print it--the media goes along with the loot, and then they \nwonder why the budget is not balanced. If we only level with the \nAmerican people, they would understand you can't cut taxes without \nincreasing taxes.\n  We have increased the debt with that particular shenanigan to the \ntune now of $5.4 trillion with interest costs on the national debt of \n$1 billion a day. So when you cut down more revenues to pay, you \nincrease the debt, you increase the interest costs, so you get \nreelected next year, because I stood for tax cuts, but they won't tell \nthem that with the child tax cut that they have actually increased the \ntax for the child. Now that is at least in the Congressional Record in \nblack and white.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S8074]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1022, the \nCommerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary appropriations bill for \nfiscal year 1998. The Senate bill provides $31.6 billion in budget \nauthority and $21.2 billion in new outlays to operate the programs of \nthe Department of Commerce, Department of Justice, Department of State, \nthe Judiciary and Related Agencies for fiscal year 1998. When outlays \nfrom prior-year budget authority and other completed actions are taken \ninto account, the bill totals $31.6 billion in budget authority and \n$29.4 billion in outlays for fiscal year 1998. The subcommittee is \nwithin its revised section 602(b) allocation for budget authority and \noutlays.\n  Mr. President, I commend the distinguished subcommittee chairman, \nSenator Gregg, for bringing this bill to the floor. It is not easy to \nbalance the competing program requirements that are funded in this \nbill. I thank the chairman for the consideration he gave to issues I \nbrought before the subcommittee, and his extra effort to address the \nitems in the bipartisan balanced budget agreement. It has been a \npleasure to serve on the subcommittee.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of this bill be printed in the Record at this \npoint.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n           S. 1022, COMMERCE-JUSTICE APPROPRIATIONS, 1998; SPENDING COMPARISONS--SENATE-REPORTED BILL\n                                   [Fiscal year 1998, in millions of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                              Defense  Nondefense    Crime   Mandatory    Total\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-Reported bill:\n  Budget authority.........................................      275     25,587      5,225        522    31,609\n  Outlays..................................................      322     25,188      3,381        532    29,423\nSenate 602(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority.........................................      297     25,588      5,225        522    31,632\n  Outlays..................................................      322     25,479      3,401        532    29,734\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority.........................................      257     26,114      5,238        522    32,131\n  Outlays..................................................      286     25,907      3,423        532    30,148\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority.........................................\n  Outlays..................................................\n \n             SENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO:\n \nSenate 602(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority.........................................

Mr. President, as we consider funding for the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, I would like to raise the issue of \nClean Air Act carbon monoxide violations in my home town of Fairbanks \nwith the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nSenator Chafee.\n  As the chairman knows, Fairbanks has one of the highest rates of \ntemperature inversions in the world. When such inversions occur, \npollutants from any source in the area are trapped at extremely low \naltitudes. For example, it is not uncommon to see the smoke from house \nchimneys trapped directly above a house rather than disbursed in the \natmosphere as in other cities nationwide.\n  While I would have preferred that the EPA not go forward with a bump-\nup on the rating of Fairbanks' air from moderate to serious, I \nrecognize that this bill is not the place to accomplish that goal. I \nwould like to point out that in the past 20 years, Fairbanks has \nreduced its violation days from 160 to as low as 1 last year. It is \nthese last violations that are causing difficulties for communities \nnationwide. However, Fairbanks may never be able to prevent several \nviolations per year due to its unique and extreme cold weather. It is \nmy hope that the EPA would work with Fairbanks to develop strategies to \nmitigate the pollution that is so severely magnified by the extreme \ncold weather of my hometown.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I want to reiterate the concerns expressed by my \ncolleague, Senator Murkowski. The reality may be that no matter what \nFairbanks does, it may never be able to comply with EPA standards \nbecause of its geographic location.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the Senators from Alaska for their remarks about \ncarbon monoxide violations in Fairbanks. Their hometown has \ndramatically reduced the number of exceedences over the past 20 years \nand should be recognized for this success. It is my hope that the EPA \nwill continue to work with Fairbanks to devise pollution reduction \nstrategies that recognize the unique conditions that exist in \nFairbanks.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI: I thank my friend from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                office of the u.s. trade representative\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to discuss one \nprovision in the legislation now before the Senate. Under the heading \nof Related Agencies, the Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill \nprovides funding for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.\n  As my colleagues know, our Nation's Special Trade Representative, \nbacked by the team of staff at USTR, is responsible for negotiating and \nadministering trade agreements and coordinating overall trade policy \nfor the United States. Those are significant responsibilities, and they \nare critical to the economic interests of American firms, workers, \nconsumers, and families.\n  For an agency with such significant duties, USTR does not consume \nmuch in the way of taxpayer monies. Annual funding for USTR has hovered \nat just over $20 million for the past 5 years. In terms of the Federal \nbudget--or for that matter of the several other agencies funded by this \nbill--$20 million is a mere pittance.\n  I might say that for what we get in return, the funds spent on USTR \nrepresent quite a bargain. Thanks to USTR, we have in place trade \nagreements and policies that allow our companies to compete \nsuccessfully worldwide. And where barriers remain, the USTR team works \ncontinuously to make further progress. Their work over the years has \naffected billions of dollars in U.S. trade and contributes enormously \nto the health of the overall U.S. economy.\n  Now, USTR does not require much in funding because for the most part, \nappropriations are spent on two items: salaries and travel. Those basic \nnecessities--the salaries that pay the staff, and the travel that is \nrequired for the various ongoing negotiations with our trading partners \naround the world--make up the bulk of USTR's financial needs. There is \nnot much fat there. Therefore, every dime they get is critical.\n  I want to commend the chairman of the Commerce-State-Justice \nSubcommittee for allocating the full budget request for USTR for fiscal \nyear 1998. Under his bill, the Office of the USTR will receive \n$22,092,000, exactly what the administration sought. I want to thank \nhim for that.\n  Let me raise one concern, however, that I know is shared by \nthe leadership and most members of the Senate Finance Committee. Since \nthe January 1995 implementation of the Uruguay round agreements and the \nWTO, USTR has taken on an enormous new docket of cases in which the \nUnited States is involved, and all of these cases now come with strict \ndeadlines. As of July 1, there were pending some 47 WTO or NAFTA cases \nin which the United States is a plaintiff, a defendant, or otherwise a \nparticipant. That is quite a workload. Yet despite the increase, USTR \nhas not increased its career legal staff. The number of lawyers and \nlitigators now on staff is virtually the same as in the pre-WTO days. \nUSTR has just 12 lawyers in Washington, with 2 more in Geneva, and only \n2 of them are able to devote themselves fulltime to the international \nlitigation. That dearth of staff makes no sense--and only hurts our \nefforts to win our cases.\n\n  I believe USTR must have the resources and personnel that it needs to \nfulfill its responsibilities. While I am delighted that USTR received \nits full budget request, I must say that the budget request amount is \nsimply not realistic for an agency facing these new assignments. Even a \nmodest increase of, say, $1 million--which again, in terms of the \nfederal budget is not even visible--would make a significant and \npositive difference to the ability of USTR to carry out its work. And \nthat in turn would only benefit US workers and families, and the \noverall US economy.\n  I want to urge USTR to press the Office of Management and Budget to \nrecognize their new workload. I have mentioned this repeatedly to \nAmbassador Barshefsky and I hope she will act on it. And I want to \nexhort OMB in the strongest terms possible to adjust next year's budget \nrequest accordingly for\n\n[[Page S8075]]\n\nUSTR. I am confident that such an adjustment would be met with favor by \nthe members of the authorizing committee, namely the Senate Finance \nCommittee.\n  If OMB fails to act, then it may fall to Congress to do the right \nthing, and make the small but necessary increased investment in this \nagency. Indeed, I seriously considered taking such a step during \ntoday's debate. But for now I will wait. Thanks to the good work of the \nchairman, we do have in this bill $22 million in full funding for USTR, \nand I intend to do what I can to make sure that that full $22 million \nbecomes law. However, I call upon the administration in no uncertain \nterms to ensure that in the budget submitted next year, USTR is \nprovided the resources they need.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am happy to say that, after reviewing \nthe bill before the Senate, I find relatively few examples of pork-\nbarrel spending. I stress, relatively few, since I can still find a few \nobjectionable provisions in the bill and many in the report. But there \nare far fewer problems with this bill than the last few appropriations \nbills we have passed in the Senate.\n  This bill contains the usual earmarks for centers of excellence. In \nparticular, bill earmarks $22 million for the East-West Center in \nHawaii and $3 million for the North/South Center in Florida.\n  These amounts represent a combined increase of $16.5 million above \nthe administration's request.\n  Last week, I spoke about the problem of Congress establishing, at \ntaxpayer expense, centers for the study of virtually every subject, \nirrespective of the availability of research and analysis on those \nissues already available from existing universities and private \nresearch institutions.\n  This enormous increase in funding for the East-West and North/South \nCenters is incomprehensible given the dire state of U.S. diplomatic \nrepresentation in many of the newly independent countries of the post-\ncold-war world. They are particularly inexplicable in light of the \ncommittee's decision to zero out the funding for the National Endowment \nfor Democracy, a decision which the Senate fortunately reversed earlier \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, I would not be at all surprised to see in next year's \nbill funding for a North-by-Northwest Center, perhaps to include a \nbanquet room honoring the last Alfred Hitchcock.\n  The bill also contains language that directs the U.S. Marshals \nService to provide a magnetometer and not less than one qualified guard \nat each entrance to the Federal facility located at 625 Silver, S.W., \nin Albuquerque, NM. I must say that this is perhaps the most specific \nearmark I have ever seen, even providing an address to ensure the \nassets are delivered to the proper beneficiaries.\n  Once again, though, the Appropriations Committee has contributed a \nfew new and innovative ways to earmark port-barrel spending.\n  The most interesting is language that I will call a reverse earmark. \nThe report earmarks $8 million to begin addressing the backlog in \nrepair and maintenance of FBI-owned facilities, other than those \nlocated in and around Washington, DC and Quantico, VA. I wonder whether \nmy colleagues from this area were aware that they had been singled out \nfor exclusion from an earmark.\n\n  Other report language earmarks are more typical, such as: Various \nearmarks for southwest border activities, although I note that my \ncolleagues singled out the New Mexico and Texas borders for special \nattention to combat illegal border crossing and drug smuggling \nproblems. I was of the impression that these problems were prevalent \nacross the entire border with Mexico, including Arizona and California.\n  Similarly, the report requires that two-thirds of the additional \n1,000 border patrol agents are to be deployed in Texas sectors, with \nthe remaining 300-plus agencies to be scattered across New Mexico, \nArizona, or California. The report earmarks $1 million for Nova \nSoutheastern University in Florida for the establishment of a National \nCoral Reef Institute to conduct research on, what else, coral reefs. \nAnd it also earmarks $1 million to the University of Hawaii to conduct \nsimilar coral reef studies. I suppose this might be considered a good \nidea to fund competitive research projects, except these institutions \ndid not have to compete to get these funds, nor will they likely have \nto compete to continue to receive hand-outs to continue their coral \nreef research.\n  The report contains $410,000 for the Alaska Eskimo Whaling \nCommission, and $200,000 for the Beluga Whale Commission. It contains \n$2.3 million to reduce tsunami risks to residents and visitors in \nOregon, Washington, California, Hawaii, and Alaska. And it earmarks $88 \nmillion in NOAA construction funds for specific locations in Alaska, \nHawaii, South Carolina, Mississippi, and other States.\n  And finally, this bill contains earmarks for assistance to the U.S. \nOlympic Committee to prepare for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Utah. I \nfound $3 million for communications and security infrastructure \nupgrades, $2 million to formulate a public safety master plan, and \nlanguage directing that NTIA provide telecommunications support to the \nUtah Olympics similar to that provided in Atlanta last summer. As my \ncolleagues know, this is just a small portion of the funding we will \nsee channeled to the Utah Olympics. It is in addition to the money \nincluded in the supplemental passed earlier this year and in other \nappropriations bills that have already passed this body.\n  While the wasteful spending in this bill is less onerous than in \nother bills I have seen in the past 2 weeks, I still have to object \nstrenuously to the inclusion of these earmarks and add-ons in the bill. \nWe cannot afford pork-barrel spending, even the amount contained in \nthis bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of the objectionable provisions \nin this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n  Objectionable Provisions in S. 1022 FY 1998 Commerce/Justice/State/\n                     Judiciary Appropriations Bill\n\n\n                             bill language\n\n       Earmarks for funding for the National Advocacy Center in \n     Columbia, South Carolina, which was authorized in 1993 as a \n     center for training federal, state, and local prosecutors and \n     litigators in advocacy skills and management of legal \n     operations: $2.5 million for operations, salaries, and \n     expenses of the Center, $2.1 million to support the National \n     District Attorney's Association participation in legal \n     education training at the Center.\n       U.S. Marshals Service is directed to provide ``a \n     magnetometer and not less than one qualified guard'' at each \n     entrance to a federal facility (including both buildings and \n     related grounds) at 625 Silver, S.W., in Albuquerque, New \n     Mexico\n       $125,000 of State Department Diplomatic and Consular \n     Programs funding earmarked for the Maui Pacific Center\n       $22 million of USIA funds earmarked for the Center for \n     Cultural and Technical Interchange between East and West in \n     the State of Hawaii, and $3 million for an educational \n     institution in Florida known as the North/South Center\n       Section 606 prohibits construction, repair, or overhaul of \n     vessels for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration in shipyards outside the U.S.\n\n\n                            report language\n\n       Department of Justice:\n       Various earmarks for Southwest Border activities, \n     including: $281,000 for a Southwest Border initiative;

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       methamphetamine initiative\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to thank the chairman of the \nsubcommittee for taking what I believe is a necessary and meaningful \nstep to turn the tide on a growing epidemic in this country, \nmethamphetamine abuse. Although originally confined principally to the \nSouthwest, including my home State of Utah, this epidemic is now moving \nEast. Congress needs to take action to stop meth abuse.\n  Mr. GREGG. I could not agree more with the Senator from Utah. In my \nhome State of New Hampshire, we are now experiencing our own influx of \nmethamphetamine. I am seriously concerned about the effect that the \nproliferation of this drug is going to have\n\n[[Page S8077]]\n\nupon the children of this Nation, particularly in New Hampshire.\n  Mr. HATCH. Meth abuse, unfortunately, is also rapidly becoming one of \nour top public health threats. According to the latest data released by \nSAMHSA in its ``Drug Abuse Warning Network'' report released last week \nthe number of children aged 12 to 17 who have had to go to emergency \nrooms due to meth use increased well over 200 percent between 1993 and \n1995 alone. The number of deaths associated with meth has also \nincreased dramatically. From 1989 to 1994, methamphetamine accounted \nfor 80 percent or more of clandestine lab seizures by the DEA. \nClandestine lab crackdowns are at an alltime high, and many more are \ngoing undetected. Mobile labs in rural areas of Utah, including \nnumerous locations in Ogden, Provo, and the St. George area are making \nmeth with virtual impunity. Local law enforcement does not have the \nmanpower, resources, or technical expertise to cover such vast areas in \na truly meaningful fashion. Federal law enforcement, most principally \nthe Drug Enforcement Administration, has agents specially trained in \nthe areas of methamphetamine lab take downs, but the number of such \nspecialists is extremely limited, and certainly is of insufficient \nnumbers to be any sort of meaningful presence in Utah, as well as the \nrest of the Rocky Mountains.\n  I am deeply concerned about the Methamphetamine problem in Utah, as \nwell as the rest of the Nation. In my State, distribution by Mexican \ntraffickers has been expanded by using networks established in the \ncocaine, heroin, and marijuana trades. Wholesale distribution is \ntypically organized into networks in major metropolitan areas, to \ninclude Salt Lake City. Utah has 2,500 isolated noncontrolled airstrips \nwhich provide a convenient means for drug smugglers to transfer \nmethamphetamine to vehicles for shipment throughout the United States. \nAlso, there are over 65 public airports throughout the State that are \nnot manned on a 24-hour basis, but can be lit from a plane by using the \nplane's radio tuned to a specific frequency.\n  Major highway systems such as I-15, I-70, and I-80 serve to \ninterconnect Mexico with Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming which allows Utah \nto be an ideal transshipment point to major markets on the west coast, \nas well as Minneapolis, Chicago, Detroit, and other Midwestern areas. \nIt also results in such illegal drugs being readily accessible \nthroughout Utah.\n  According to the DEA, methamphetamine seizures nationwide in 1996 \nwere the highest in over a decade. Not easily dissuaded, particularly \nwhen such large profits can be made, Mexican traffickers have begun \nobtaining the necessary precursor chemicals for methamphetamine from \nsources in Europe, China, and India. These precursor chemicals needed \nto manufacture methamphetamine drugs are available in Utah and have \ncontributed to the increased consumption of the drug. Further, \nephedrine tablets are purchased in large quantities and then converted \nto methamphetamine.\n  For these reasons I believe that it is imperative that this Congress \nprovide the necessary resources to the DEA to engage in a meaningful \nmethamphetamine initiative. I fully support the Appropriations \nCommittee's report to S. 1022 that recommends that $16,500,000 of the \nfunds appropriated to the DEA be used to fund a methamphetamine \ninitiative, to include an additional 90 agents and 21 support personnel \nwho will be tasked with implementing a broad approach for attacking \nmethamphetamine abuse in this country. I strongly encourage that some \nof these funds be applied to funding DEA agents with particularized \nmethamphetamine training be stationed in Utah to combat this ever \ngrowing threat in my State, and to prevent the methamphetamine lab \nactivities in Utah from continuing to harm other States throughout this \nNation.\n  Mr. GREGG. It is my intention that these new agents be allocated \nwhere they are most needed. Many States, such as New Hampshire and Utah \nare certainly experiencing the level of increased meth abuse this meth \ninitiative is designed to address.\n\n\n             cooper hospital's trauma reduction initiative\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would like to express my support for Cooper \nHospital's Trauma Reduction Initiative.\n  Cooper Hospital is located in Camden, NJ, one of the most troubled \ncities in the Nation. Between 1994 and 1995, the number of violent \ncrimes declined 4 percent nationwide, while in Camden they rose 8.6 \npercent. Homicides in Camden rose 28.88 percent, while homicides \ndeclined 6 percent nationally. With an estimated population of 82,000, \nCamden ranks as the sixth most violent city in the country when \ncompared to all cities and towns.\n  Cooper Hospital's Trauma Reduction Initiative links hospital staff, \ncommunity leaders, and churches throughout Camden as the frontline of \ncrisis intervention. The Trauma Reduction Initiative represents a \ncommunity-based approach to deal with the types of violence that \ndisrupt our neighborhoods and burden our health care system.\n  According to Government research, by 2003, firearms will have \nsurpassed auto accidents as the leading cause of injury death in the \nUnited States. But unlike victims of car accidents, who are almost \nalways privately insured, four out of five firearm victims are \nreceiving public assistance or are uninsured. Thus, taxpayers bear the \nbrunt of medical costs that have grown to $4.5 billion a year in the \npast decade. Cooper Hospital's violence prevention program is designed \nto help stop the spiral of violent crime and retaliation in Camden. \nThis program could serve as a model for other cities to follow.\n  The Trauma Reduction Initiative has received funding from the Bureau \nof Justice Assistance. I ask my colleagues, the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Subcommittee, if \nthey agree that the Trauma Reduction Initiative is worthy of BJA's \ncontinued support?\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the concerns of the Senator from New Jersey \nabout the disturbing amount of violent crime in Camden. I agree that, \nwithin the available resources, the Trauma Reduction Initiative is \nworthy of BJA's continued support.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I, too, share the concerns of the Senator from New \nJersey about the escalating costs of firearm violence in our country. I \nagree with the chairman that, within the available resources, BJA \nshould continue to support the Trauma Reduction Initiative.\n\n\n                         technical corrections\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would first like to thank the \nchairman and ranking member of the Commerce, Justice, State, and the \nJudiciary Appropriations Subcommittee for joining Senator Boxer and \nmyself in this colloquy regarding our amendment to make technical \ncorrections to title I, section 119 of the Commerce-State-Justice \nappropriations bill. This section, as amended, will allow the \nDepartment of Justice and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to \ntransfer surplus real property to State and local governments for law \nenforcement, fire fighting, and rescue purposes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to join my colleague from \nCalifornia in thanking the chairman and ranking member for all their \nassistance on this issue. I would also like to extend our appreciation \nto the chairman and ranking member of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, without whose suggestions this amendment would not have gone \nforward. I am very pleased to cosponsor this amendment, which modifies \nthe amendment I offered in the Appropriations Committee to include the \nDepartment of Justice Property Transfer Act.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank my colleagues from California for their hard work \nin including this language in the bill. We all know that the police and \nfire departments are the first to respond to crises, and this change in \nlaw will facilitate local agencies in obtaining surplus Federal \nproperty for primary and specialized law enforcement and rescue \ntraining. I am pleased to support this change in law for the benefit of \nour communities.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I join my colleagues in recognizing the value of this \nlanguage. I would like to ask if the Senator from California knows of \nany situations where this change in law would serve immediate benefit?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would be pleased to answer that question. I was \nfirst made aware of the problems that current property transfer laws \nposes by the sheriff of Riverside County in southern California. The \nsheriff's office\n\n[[Page S8078]]\n\nhas obtained, by short-term lease, a portion of March Air Reserve Base. \nThe sheriff's office has been using this land for joint law enforcement \nand fire and rescue training. This legislation will allow the sheriff's \noffice to apply directly to the General Services Administration, which \nwill coordinate the application and approval process with the \nDepartment of Justice and FEMA to transfer the necessary property. Once \nagain, I thank my colleagues for their support of this legislation.\n\n\n                  abusive and exploitative child labor\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to engage the chairman and \nthe ranking member of the Commerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary \nSubcommittee in a colloquy regarding abusive and exploitative child \nlabor.\n  According to the International Labor Organization [ILO], some 250 \nmillion children between the ages of 5 and 14 are working in developing \ncountries and the number is on the rise. I strongly believe that access \nto primary education reduces the incidence of child labor around the \nworld. It is my understanding that the Asia Foundation supports efforts \nto improve access to primary education.\n  I would like to see some language in the conference report urging the \nAsia Foundation to continue its work in Pakistan. I know that our \nstaffs' have conferred, and that you and the ranking member share my \nconcern about abusive and exploitative child labor.\n  Mr. GREGG. I commend the Senator for his concern, and would welcome \nany report language he has regarding the matter. Though it is outside \nthe scope of the conference, I will exploit any opportunity that \npresents itself that would allow language to be inserted in the \nconference report.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The Senator from Iowa has been working this issue hard, \nand I agree with the chairman.\n\n\n                           Ketchikan Shipyard\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, Ketchikan, AK, just north of the \nCanadian border in southeast Alaska, has recently suffered an extreme \neconomic blow due to changes in Federal forest management policies. It \nis a town of just a few thousand people, and the loss of 406 jobs due \nto the closure of one of the town's major industries, a pulpmill, \nseverely disrupted the community.\n  The need for economic revitalization in Ketchikan is great, but the \navailable opportunities are limited. One potentially important \nopportunity is provided by a local shipyard, Ketchikan Ship and \nDrydock. However, the ability of this yard to contribute to the local \neconomy is limited without a significant upgrade of its ability to \nhandle a variety of vessel sizes.\n  It is my understanding that the subcommittee report on this \nappropriation recognizes similar situations in other areas by \nsuggesting that the Economic Development Administration consider \nproposals which meet its procedures and guidelines.\n  Would the distinguished managers of the bill, my friends from New \nHampshire and South Carolina, agree that if the EDA receives a proposal \nfor the Ketchikan shipyard which meets its procedures and guidelines, \nthe EDA should consider that proposal and provide a grant if the latter \nis warranted?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Alaska is \ncorrect. I would urge the Economic Development Administration to \nconsider such a proposal that met its procedures and guidelines and \nurge it to provide a grant if it finds the proposal warranted.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I agree with the response by my friend \nfrom New Hampshire.\n\n\n          nist funding for texas tech university wind research\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to ask the distinguished \nSubcommittee Chairman, Senator Gregg, to engage in a colloquy on a \nmatter of extreme importance to my State and a number of others, and \nthat is the need for more research into wind and severe storm disasters \nand ways to protect people and property from catastrophic harm.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would be happy to yield to the Senator \nfrom Texas and engage in a colloquy.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, as you know, there have been a number \nof severe tornadoes, wind storms, hurricanes and other wind-related \ndisasters in recent months which have killed scores of people and \ndestroyed communities. Earlier this year, the small town of Jarrell, \nTX, experienced a tornado that killed 29 people, seriously injured many \nothers, and caused millions of dollars in damage to homes and \nbusinesses. The President's home State of Arkansas was also hit by a \nwind disaster that resulted in loss of life. The home State of the \nRanking Minority Member of the Subcommittee, Senator Hollings is still \nrebuilding after the devastation of Hurricane Hugo in 1989.\n  Mr. President, there is important work being done at Texas Tech \nUniversity to help improve design construction of buildings to make \nthem more resilient to windstorms. The laboratory building will include \nspace to house a wind tunnel, a structural and building component \ntesting lab and a material testing lab. These laboratory facilities \nwill be used to develop innovative building frames and components that \nare resilient to extreme winds and windborne debris and yet are \neconomically affordable. The research will also produce results to help \ncope with the environmental effects of wind erosion and dust and \nparticulate generation.\n  The Department of Commerce, through the National Institute of \nStandards and Technology, does wind research. NIST in particular is \nengaged in research that complements the Texas Tech project.\n  The Committee has provided $276,852,000 for the scientific and \ntechnical research and services (core programs) appropriation of NIST. \nPart of the increased amount is for continued research, development, \napplication and demonstration of new building products, processes, \ntechnologies and methods of construction for energy-efficient and \nenvironmentally compatible buildings.\n  Senator Gregg, do you concur that it is the intent of the committee \nto direct $3.8 million in funds provided to NIST for scientific and \ntechnical research and services for cooperative research between NIST \nand Texas Tech University to pursue this important wind research?\n  Mr. GREGG. It is the intent of the Committee to direct $3.8 million \nof NIST's scientific and technical research and services funding \nprovided in the bill for cooperative research with Texas Tech \nUniversity. I look forward to working with the Senator from Texas to \nensure that the additional funds provided for core programs for \ncontinued research, development, application and demonstration of new \nbuilding products, processes, technologies and methods of construction \nsupports cooperative wind research between NIST and Texas Tech \nUniversity.\n\n\n                   small business development centers\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I wonder if I could get the attention of the \ndistinguished manager of the bill, Commerce, Justice, State \nAppropriations Subcommittee Chairman Judd Gregg. I have a proposal \nrelated to small business development centers, and I'd like to get him \nto comment on it.\n  Mr. GREGG. I'd be happy to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the Senator. What I propose to do is give more \nSBDCs the tools they need to encourage small companies to start \nexporting. As the Senator knows, the SBDCs are doing a terrific job \nhelping small business owners devise business plans, marketing \nstrategies, and so forth, but many of them simply don't have the \ncapacity to offer advice on how to export.\n  We ought to try to change that, in my view. Exporting is the name of \nthe game today--even for small businesses. And one way to do that would \nbe to broaden access to a successful small business export promotion \nprogram called the International Trade Data Network, or ITDN.\n  Now, what is the ITDN? The ITDN is a computer-based service that \nsmall business owners can use to retrieve a stunning amount of \ninternational trade data--compiled both from Federal Government sources \nand the private sector. With a few quick keystrokes, individuals can \nread about everything from market demographics to descriptions of \nupcoming trade missions to explanations of relevant export and import \nregulations to potential contract leads. Small businesses anxious to \nexport can learn about virtually every industry and virtually every \ncountry.\n  The ITDN was developed in 1988 by the Export Assistance Center at \nBryant College in Smithfield, RI, and it's\n\n[[Page S8079]]\n\nbeen a big help to literally hundreds of Rhode Island's small \nbusinesses. In fact, 18 companies in Rhode Island use the ITDN every \nsingle day.\n  Listen to some of these endorsements from Rhode Island business \nowners. One said, ``The information made available through the ITDN is \nan integral part of our Pre-Entry Level Market Analysis.'' Another \nreported, ``I find the ITDN to be a state-of-the-art, user friendly \nsoftware that is a one-stop shop for international information. It is a \nvital tool for businesses today that need to survive in a global \nenvironment.''\n  But right now, only 30 or so of our 960 Small Business Development \nCenters have direct access to the ITDN. So what I'd like to do is \nexpand the program, so that SBDCs all across the country are connected \nto it. Specifically what I have in mind is converting the ITDN to an \ninternet-based website, and establishing an Interactive Video Trade \nConferencing Center at each State's lead small business assistance \noffice. My proposal would also make the ITDN technology available to \nthe Approximately 2,500 SBDC sub-centers across the country.\n  As I understand the situation, SBDCs are already authorized to \nconduct export promotion activities under Section 21 of the Small \nBusiness Act. In fact, representatives of Bryant College met with the \nSBA's Associate Administrator for the SBDC program earlier this year to \ndiscuss this proposal, and received a very positive response. For one \nreason or another, however, the SBA has been reluctant to dedicate any \nmoney to this purpose.\n  The 1988 Commerce, Justice, State Appropriation bill contains $75.8 \nmillion for the SBDC program, an increase of some $2.3 million over the \n1997 funding level. In talking with the folks at the Export Assistance \nCenter at Bryant College, it's my understanding that expanding the ITDN \ncould be done over 2 years, with a first year cost of about $925,000. \nI'd ask the distinguished manager if I could get his endorsement of my \nproposal.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the Senator's interest in this matter, and I \nagree that we ought to look for ways to increase American small \nbusinesses' capacity to export.\n  Having looked at the Senator from Rhode Island's proposal, and \nlistened to his remarks, I think that the ITDN program could be an \nexcellent tool for opening international markets. I strongly encourage \nthe Small Business Administration to make funds available for the \nexpansion of the ITDN in fiscal year 1998.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I want to thank my friend from New Hampshire for his \nsupport for this initiative.\n\n\n                    ``made in the usa'' advertising\n\n  Mr. KOHL. I understand that the FTC has proposed to weaken the \nstandard for ``Made in the U.S.A.'' advertising from ``all to virtually \nall'' U.S. content to ``substantially all'' U.S. content. The proposal \nsets forth two alternative safe harbors for ``Made in the U.S.A.'' \nclaims: 75 percent U.S. content--U.S. manufacturing costs represent 75 \npercent of the total manufacturing costs for the product and the \nproduct was last substantially transformed in the U.S. or; two level \nsubstantial transformation--The product was last substantially \ntransformed in the United States and all significant inputs were last \nsubstantially transformed in the United States.\n  I also understand that the new proposed guidelines would have the \neffect of allowing products made with 25 percent or more foreign labor \nand foreign materials to be labeled ``Made in the U.S.A.'' In some \ncases, the FTC's proposed guidelines would allow products made entirely \nwith foreign materials and foreign components to be labeled ``Made in \nthe U.S.A.''\n  The ``Made in the U.S.A.'' label, a time-honored symbol of American \npride and craftsmanship, is an extremely valuable asset to \nmanufacturers. Allowing this label to be applied to goods not wholly \nmade in America will encourage companies to ship U.S. jobs overseas \nbecause they can take advantage of the cheaper labor markets while \npromoting their products as ``Made in the U.S.A.'' For products not \nwholly made in the U.S.A., companies already can make a truthful claim \nabout whatever U.S. content their products have--e.g., ``Made in the \nU.S.A. of 75 percent U.S. component parts'' or ``Assembled in the \nU.S.A. from imported and domestic parts''. However, if manufacturers \nseek to voluntarily promote their products as ``Made in the U.S.A.'' \nthey must be honest in that promotion and only apply the ``Made in the \nU.S.A.'' label to products wholly made in the U.S.A.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am aware of the concerns expressed by my colleague on \nthe Appropriations Committee and share the Senator's concerns on the \nneed to protect American jobs. My subcommittee has jurisdiction over \nthe FTC and you can be assured that we will closely watch any action \ntaken by the FTC regarding the current standard for ``Made in the \nU.S.A.''\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I too want to assure the Senator that our Subcommittee \nwill closely monitor any actions on the FTC's part to change the ``Made \nin the U.S.A.'' designation. The ``Made in the U.S.A.'' label should \ncontinue to assure consumers that they are purchasing a product wholly \nmade by American workers.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank Senator Gregg and Senator Hollings for their \ncomments on this important issue. I am reassured by their interest in \nthis matter.\n\n\n                 jefferson parish communications system\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise to discuss with the distinguished \nchairman of the subcommittee, Senator Gregg, the distinguished ranking \nmember of the subcommittee, Senator Hollings, and my distinguished \ncolleague from Louisiana, Senator Landrieu, an important safety issue \nfacing Jefferson Parish, LA.\n  As my colleagues know, the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office is one \nof the most progressive and notable law enforcement offices in the \ncountry. Unfortunately, they have been forced to use a conventional 450 \nMHz UHF radio system that is far too small and antiquated to handle \ncurrent traffic volumes and to provide the secure and varied \ncommunications capabilities necessary in today's law enforcement \nenvironment. Replacing this old system with a new 800 MHz digital \nsystem is necessary to ensure the safety of its residents and guests, \nand to enhance the operational efficiencies of the sheriff's office.\n  Hurricane Danny recently demonstrated the dire need for this new \ncommunications system. Grand Isle, off the southern-most part of \nJefferson Parish, is a barrier island with approximately 2,500 \nresidents. There is, however, only one road leading from Grand Isle to \nthe mainland. When it appeared this road was at risk because of Danny's \n70-75 mph winds and high tides, the sheriff's office decided to \nevacuate the island. Unfortunately, before the island could be safely \nevacuated, one of the radio towers was damaged and rendered inoperable \nby the hurricane. The sheriff's office was forced to borrow cellular \ntelephones in order to evacuate the island.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The Senator makes a fine point, and I would like to add \nthat the new communications system would also support inter-operability \nwith most of the adjoining parishes and the city of New Orleans. This \nwould mean expanded emergency capabilities throughout the region which \nare vital to the entire State of Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, as my colleague knows, the sheriff's \noffice of Jefferson Parish has sought assistance in the past and has \nhelped to highlight the need for Federal assistance to help local law \nenforcement agencies replace outdated communications equipment. In \nfact, the sheriff's office was influential in getting a discretionary \ngrant program created in 1994 that would provide funds for these types \nof activities. However, Congress has consistently earmarked these \nfunds, leaving no funds for grant applicants.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office \nhas demonstrated its commitment to this project by allocating over 50 \npercent of the cost of this initiative in a dedicated escrow account. \nIn a competition for funds, the sheriff's office, with its well \ndeveloped procurement strategy and available matching funds, would no \ndoubt prevail as a deserving candidate.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senators from Louisiana for bringing this \nissue to my attention. I understand that the new communication system \nfor the sheriff's office in Jefferson Parish is a priority and I will \ngive this request my attention and consideration in conference.\n\n[[Page S8080]]\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I too, thank the Senators from Louisiana and believe \nthat this is a project worthy of attention in conference.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I greatly appreciate the assistance of the distinguished \nchairman and ranking member of the subcommittee in this matter. I would \nlike to thank them and my colleague from Louisiana, Senator Landrieu, \nfor joining me in this colloquy.\n\n\n     odyssey maritime discovery center exhibits and lecture series\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would like to urge the chairman and \nranking member of the Commerce, State Justice Appropriations \nSubcommittee to join me in directing the National Marine Fisheries \nService, through the Information and Analyses, Resource Information \naccount, to provide $250,000 to the Odyssey Maritime Discovery Center \nin Seattle, WA.\n  The Odyssey Center is a new educational learning center opening in \nJuly, 1998. This Center will establish an educational link between the \neveryday maritime, fishing, trade, and environmental activities that \noccur in the waters of Puget Sound and Alaska, and the lessons students \nlearn in the classroom. Through high-tech and interactive exhibits, \nover 300,000 children and adults per year will discover that what \nhappens in our waters, on our coast lines, at our ports affects our \nState's and Nation's economic livelihood, environmental well-being, and \ninternational competitiveness. The Center wishes to establish an \nexhibits and lecture series to link the public, particularly school \nchildren, with the maritime, fishing, trade, and environmental \nindustries. Named in honor of the great Senator of Washington, Warren \nG. Magnuson, this series would begin in 1998 and would serve as an \neducational resource on the sustainable development, uses, and \nprotection of our seas and coastal waters. This series would provide a \nfitting tribute to Senator Magnuson, the founder of this Nation's \nFederal fisheries policies and the namesake of our principal fisheries \nmanagement law, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and \nManagement Act.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I join the Senator from Washington in \nsupporting this exhibits and lecture series at the Odyssey Maritime \nDiscovery Center and believe the National Marine Fisheries Service \nshould provide $250,000 through the Information and Analyses, Resource \nInformation account. I too feel this series will provide a fitting \ntribute to the former Senator from Washington and an important learning \ntool for young people.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I also join the Senator from Washington in \nsupporting this lecture series. I think Senator Magnuson would be \nhonored by this educational effort to teach children about the ways of \nthe sea, and the economic and ecological ways of life that depend on \nit.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the chairman and ranking member of the \nSubcommittee for their support and interest.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I join in support of this effort on behalf \nof the Odyssey Maritime Discovery Center and I applaud Senator Murray's \nefforts on the Center's behalf.\n\n\n                        women's business centers\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President. On June 12, I introduced in behalf of \nmyself and Senator Bond, along with 24 other cosponsors, a bill to \nstrengthen the Small Business Administration's [SBA] women's business \ncenters program. This bill, S. 888, the ``Women's Business Centers Act \nof 1997,'' reflects our commitment for a stronger and more dynamic \nprogram for women-owned businesses.\n  I am pleased that the Small Business Committee has included the text \nof this bill into its 3-year reauthorization of the Small Business Act. \nIt is anticipated that this reauthorization bill will be considered by \nthe Senate within the next few months. The language in the \nreauthorization bill, as stated in the ``Women's Business Centers Act \nof 1997,'' increases the annual funding authorization for the women's \nbusiness centers to $8 million from the present level of $4 million, \nauthorizes the centers to receive funding for 5 years rather than the \npresent 3 years, changes the matching Federal to non-Federal funding \nformula, and enables organizations receiving funds at the date of \nenactment to extend their program from 3 to 5 years.\n  Since the Small Business Committee's reauthorization bill has not yet \nbeen considered by the Senate, the additional funds for the women's \nbusiness centers' program are not included in S. 1022. I do want, \nhowever, to thank Senator Gregg, Chairman of the Commerce, State, \nJustice, and Judiciary Subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, for providing full funding of the authorized $4 million for \n1998. This is most appreciated by all of us who support the women's \nbusiness centers' activities, and it is especially important since the \nHouse has requested $1 million less for this program.\n  It will be most beneficial if the Small Business reauthorization bill \nis considered and passed in the Senate and House prior to conference on \nthis appropriations measure. I draw my colleagues' attention to this \nissue because absent the higher authorized funds of $8 million for the \nwomen's centers' program, it means in 1998 we may not be able to \nachieve the expansion of this program as we intended. There will be \ninsufficient funds to expand the program into States who presently do \nnot have women's centers and existing programs cannot extend their \nprograms from 3 to 5 years. This is a serious problem because we are \nwell aware of the positive benefits of the women's business centers in \nhelping women entrepreneurs, the fastest growing group of new small \nbusinesses in the United States. These business centers are able to \nleverage public and private resources to help their clients develop new \nbusinesses or expand existing ones, and their services are absolutely \nessential for the successful and continued growth of this sector of our \neconomy.\n\n  I am also concerned that because there are insufficient funds to \nexpand the women's business centers' program, existing centers will not \nbe able to extend their activities from the present 3-year grant \nprogram to a 5-year schedule. These existing centers in approximately \n29 States have proven track records of support to women entrepreneurs. \nThe Office of Women's Business Ownership within the SBA will continue \nits administration of the overall program and will be able to develop a \nfew new sites in States that do not have centers; however, the office \nis not yet authorized to extend funding an additional 2 years for \nexisting sites. This is most regrettable because these successful \nexisting centers desperately need these small amounts of funds to \ncontinue their professional assistance to their women-owned business \nclients.\n  Mr. President, I want to once again go on record that I am \ndissatisfied that the SBA has not given appropriate attention to the \nwomen's business program. It has failed to provide sufficient \nprofessional personnel to the Office of Women's Business Ownership in \norder to carry out its important tasks. It has repeatedly requested \nless funding than authorized for the program despite the fact that this \nis one of the most successful of all SBA programs. To my knowledge, it \nhas never come to Congress and requested additional monies for the \nprogram; instead, it has expected Congress to do SBA's work in \ntrumpeting the successes of this small but vital program. I find it \nmost discouraging that while we in Congress are well aware of the \noutstanding work of the women's business centers--and the \nadministration's repeatedly publicized the success stories last year--\nthere appears to be minimal support within SBA for expanding the work \nof this very small program. This is a loss to the agency, and it is \nmost assuredly a loss to countless thousands of women entrepreneurs, \nlet alone a loss to our overall national economy.\n  We must keep in mind that the funds in this bill for the women's \nbusiness centers reflect those appropriated in 1997, and, therefore, \nthe expansion of this program as envisioned in S. 888, the ``Women's \nBusiness Centers Act of 1997'' and the reauthorization of the Small \nBusiness Act, may be delayed. As evidenced by cosponsorship of S. 888, \na fourth of the Senate, on a bipartisan basis, supports expansion of \nthe women's business centers' program. We need to be aware of the \nconsequences of this and do everything we possibly can to provide the \nsupport this critical and highly successful program needs in the \nfuture. Thank you.\n\n\n                     The Vermont World Trade Office\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to highlight \na\n\n[[Page S8081]]\n\nprogram in my State which I believe is a model the Small Business \nAdministration [SBA] should consider investing in. Small businesses are \nthe driving force of Vermont's economy. An important reason for their \nsuccess in the State has been the development of a healthy export \nmarket for the goods they produce. Forty percent of Vermont companies, \nemploying some 70,000 Vermonters, are engaged in some degree of export \ntrade. In 1995, Vermont created and funded the Vermont World Trade \nOffice [WTO] to provide technical assistance to Vermont businesses and \ninformation on foreign trade opportunities. The office has been \noverwhelmed by requests from companies interested in exploring trade \nopportunities. To meet that demand and make the office more convenient \nto Vermont businesses, the WTO hopes to open satellite offices in other \nparts of the State, expand services and offer additional seminars for \ninterested businesses. Funding from the SBA would make this expansion \npossible. I believe that a modest investment by SBA would yield a \nvaluable demonstration of the importance of export assistance in \nbuilding and expanding markets for small businesses. Does the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire agree that this would be an appropriate use of SBA \nfunding?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont for \nbringing this project to my attention. I agree that many small \nbusinesses do not have adequate access to information on building an \nexport market for their goods. A demonstration of the importance of \nthis assistance by the Vermont World Trade Office would benefit other \nStates considering a similar system. I urge the SBA to consider \nproviding the Vermont World Trade Office with $150,000 to conduct such \na demonstration.\n\n\n                           violence institute\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I want to express my support for the University of \nMedicine and Dentistry of New Jersey's [UMDNJ] Violence Institute, \nwhich provides valuable assistance to our efforts to curb violent \nbehavior in all aspects of our society. The Violence Institute's \nprograms are not directed solely at violent behavior of a criminal \nnature, but also focus on issues of domestic violence, and violence \nagainst women and children. I want to note that the Violence Institute \nwas one of only a handful of projects recommended for special funding \nin the conference report accompanying the fiscal year 1997 Commerce, \nJustice, State appropriations bill.\n  I ask my colleagues, the chairman and ranking member of the Commerce, \nJustice, State Appropriations Subcommittee, Senators Gregg and \nHollings, if they agree that the Violence Institute's initiatives to \ncurb violent behavior are consistent with the Department of Justice's \nobjectives and that such programs are worthy of the Department's \nsupport?\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the concerns of my colleague from New Jersey \nabout reducing violent behavior in our society, and I agree that the \nViolence Institute provides valuable assistance in addressing the \nepidemic of violent crime in the United States. Successful programs \nthat provide research into the basic causes of violence, and that \ndevelop initiatives to prevent the spread of violent crime, can be \nvaluable tools in our Nation's fight against crime. I believe that \nprograms such as the ones conducted at the Violence Institute are \nworthy of the Department's support.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I, too, share the concerns of the Senator from New \nJersey about violent crime in our society. The Violence Institute's \nresearch in this area makes a significant contribution to the \nDepartment of Justice's efforts to address this problem, and I agree \nwith the chairman that programs like the Violence Institute are worthy \nof the Department's support.\n\n\n           communications assistance for law enforcement act\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Chairman Gregg and the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State and the Judiciary recognize in \nthe Report for S. 1022 that the ``pace of technological change in the \ntelecommunications industry poses enormous challenge'' both to law \nenforcement and national security agencies in conducting court-\nauthorized wiretaps and ``in the conduct of foreign counterintelligence \nand terrorism investigations in the United States.'' The Communications \nAssistance for Law Enforcement Act [CALEA], which I sponsored in the \n103d Congress, addressed this public safety and national security \nproblem, after considerable debate and hearings in the Judiciary \nCommittees of both the House and the Senate. I commend the chairman and \nthe subcommittee for recognizing ``that digital telephony is a top law \nenforcement priority.''\n  CALEA authorizes $500 million for the Attorney General to pay \ntelecommunications carriers for costs associated with modifying the \nembedded base of equipment, services, and facilities to comply with \nCALEA. Nevertheless, S. 1022 does not include any funding for this law, \nbased upon the Committee's finding ``that the Bureau has adequate \nresources available.''\n  Moreover, the report recommends that no funds be expended for CALEA \nuntil the following requirements are met: First, the Bureau creates a \nworking group with industry officials approved by the House and Senate \nAppropriations Committees, and second, the working group develops a new \n``more rational, reasonable, and cost-effective CALEA implementation \nplan'' that is satisfactory to the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n  Would Chairman Gregg agree with me that in addition to the \nAppropriations Committees, the Judiciary Committees of both the House \nand Senate, which authorized CALEA, should also be involved in \napproving the industry officials on the working group and any plan \nprovided by the working group?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes. It is appropriate for the Committees on the Judiciary \nof both the House and the Senate to be involved and that was the \nintention of the committee when it prepared the report.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes. I agree with Senators Leahy and Gregg.\n  Mr. LEAHY. This addresses one of the concerns I have with the \nreport's new requirements for expenditures of money for CALEA \nimplementation.\n  I am also concerned about whether creation of the working group \ntasked with developing a CALEA implementation plan will delay, rather \nthan facilitate, implementation of this law and compliance by \ntelecommunications carriers with the four law enforcement requirements \nenumerated in this important law. Indeed, the report places no time \nconstraints on creation of this working group or on when the Bureau-\nworking group implementation plan must be submitted to the specified \ncommittees.\n  Further delay in implementation of CALEA poses risks for the \neffectiveness of our law enforcement agencies. As the committee \nacknowledges, they are already encountering problems in executing \ncourt-authorized wiretaps. The industry, with the input of law \nenforcement, has drafted a specifications standard for CALEA. I am \nconcerned that objections from the Bureau over elements in that \nproposed standard are delaying its adoption. I would like to see the \nBureau accept that standard and get on with CALEA implementation.\n  I am also concerned that the working group proposed by the committee \nwill work behind closed doors, without the accountability that CALEA \nintended. We should make sure that any meetings of the working group \nwill be open to privacy advocates and other interested parties.\n  I fully appreciate that questions have been raised about how the \nimplementation of CALEA is proceeding. That is why, over a year ago, \nSenator Specter and I asked the Digital Privacy and Security Working \nGroup, a diverse coalition of industry, privacy and government reform \norganizations, for its views on implementation of CALEA, and other \nmatters. We circulated to our colleagues on June 20, 1997, a copy of \nthis group's ``Interim Report: Communications Privacy in the Digital \nAge.'' The report recommends that hearings be held to examine \nimplementation of CALEA, how the Bureau intends to spend CALEA funds, \nand the viability of CALEA's compliance dates. This recommendation is a \ngood one.\n  We should air these significant questions at an open hearing before \nthe authorizing Committees. I would rather see the authorizing \nCommittees work in that fashion with the Appropriations Committees to \nmake funds immediately available and insure those\n\n[[Page S8082]]\n\nfunds are spent to establish a minimum standard that serves law \nenforcement's pressing needs, without some of the enhancements being \nproposed by the FBI that industry claims are delaying the process of \nimplementation. The committees should insist on some priorities in \nterms of geographic need and capability. I think we could resolve this \nwith a little oversight, and return to the spirit of reasonableness \nthat characterize the drafting of CALEA.\n\n\n                         technical corrections\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the following are technical corrections to \nthe fiscal year 1998 Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the \nJudiciary and related agencies appropriations report: First, under \n``Title I--Department of Justice'', on page 7, line 3, delete \n$17,251,958,000; and insert $17,278,990,000; on page 7, line 6, delete \n$826,955,000 and insert $853,987,000; and second, under ``Title V--\nRelated Agencies, Small Business Administration'', on page 126, line \n22, delete $8,756,000 and insert $8,756,000,000.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 979\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we now adopt \nthe managers' amendment, which is the pending amendment No. 979.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 979) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 999 through 1021, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I now send a series of amendments to the \ndesk and ask unanimous consent that they be considered read and agreed \nto, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any \nstatements relating to these amendments be inserted at this point in \nthe Record, with all of the above occurring, en bloc.\n  These amendments have been cleared by both sides of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 999 through 1021) were agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 999\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following: \n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Economic \n     Development Administration is directed to transfer funds \n     obligated and awarded to the Butte-Silver Bow Consolidated \n     Local Government as Project Number 05-01-02822 to the Butte \n     Local Development Corporation Revolving Loan Fund to be \n     administered by the Butte Local Development Corporation, such \n     funds to remain available until expended.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1000\n\n   (Purpose: To require a non-profit public affairs organization to \n    register with the Attorney General if the organization receives \n contributions in excess of $10,000 from foreign governments in any 12-\n                             month period)\n\n       On page 65, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n       Sec. 120. (a) Section 1(d) of the Foreign Agents \n     Registration Act of 1938, as amended (22 U.S.C. 611(d)) is \n     amended by inserting after ``The term `agent of a foreign \n     principal' '' the following: ``(1) includes an entity \n     described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(vi) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 that receives, directly or indirectly, from a \n     government of a foreign country (or more than one such \n     government) in any 12-month period contributions in a total \n     amount in excess of $10,000, and that conducts public policy \n     research, education, or information dissemination and that is \n     not included in any other subsection of 170(b)(1)(A), and \n     (2)''.\n       (b) Section 3(d) of such Act (22 U.S.C. 613(d)) is amended \n     by inserting ``, other than an entity referred to in section \n     1(d)(1),'' after ``any person''.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment is basically a sunshine \nprovision that would require nonprofit public affairs organizations to \nregister with the Attorney General if such organizations receive \ncontributions in excess of $10,000 from foreign governments in any 12-\nmonth period.\n  This provision would not affect churches, hospitals, or other \nnonprofit, 501(c)3 organizations which are not focused on public policy \nmatters. In fact, this amendment only affects those public policy \nnonprofit organizations that do accept foreign government money.\n  Furthermore, this amendment does not prohibit or object to such \nforeign government contributions. It only requires that organizations \npublicly acknowledge such contributions--when they are over a threshold \nof $10,000 a year from all foreign government sources--by registering \nthis information with the Attorney General under the Foreign Agents \nRegistration Act.\n  Mr. President, I'm sure that many of my colleagues may be wondering \nwhat triggered the need for this legislation. Let me state that this \namendment is not directed at any particular organization or nonprofit \nentity. This is simply a common-sense provision that will help make the \npublic affairs environment healthier by the disclosure of when foreign \ngovernment money is supporting a given nonprofit public affairs \norganization and when not.\n  These nonprofit organizations are organized for the public good and \nthey are subsidized by the American people. To the degree that these \norganizations are weighing in on important public policy matters--\nparticularly on our Nation's economic policies and defense strategies, \nbut also in other public policy areas--and are receiving foreign \ngovernment contributions to support their activities, I believe that \nthe American public has the right to know that such foreign government \ncontributions have been made to that organization.\n  Members of Congress and their staff meet regularly with \nrepresentatives of many nonprofit public affairs organizations--which \nare permitted to engage in public education activities on the Hill. But \nwhile some organizations like the Japan Economic Institute and Korea \nEconomic Institute are quite straightforward about their primary \nfunding sources and register with the Attorney General that their \nsources of funding are foreign governments, some other nonprofit public \naffairs organizations actually try to keep from public view the fact \nthat they receive substantial foreign government revenue.\n  When these groups meet with Members of Congress and staff, mail \ninformation all around the country, and organize public affairs events \nwithout ever disclosing the fact that their funding comes from other \ncountries' national governments, something is wrong.\n  Mr. President, this amendment has a different target than the \ndiscussions going on about campaign finance reform. It is focused on a \nrather narrow window in the law which allows some nonprofits to be \nbolstered by foreign government funds while not having to be upfront \nwith the broader public.\n  I believe that our public policy process can only benefit by the \ndisclosure that this legislation would require. And I trust that my \ncolleagues will agree and hope that they will support this amendment \nwhich I am offering today.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1001\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n       Sec.   . The Office of Management and Budget shall \n     designate the Jonesboro-Paragould, AR Metropolitan \n     Statistical Area in lieu of the Jonesboro, AR Metropolitan \n     Statistical Area. The Jonesboro-Paragould, AR Metropolitan \n     Statistical Area shall include both Craighead County, AR and \n     Greene County, AR, in their entirety.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1002\n\n       On page 29 of the bill, on line 18, before the ``:'' insert \n     the following: ``, of which $25,000,000 shall be for grants \n     to states for programs and activities to enforce state laws \n     prohibiting the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors or the \n     purchase or consumption of alcoholic beverages by minors''.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, of the funds appropriated for law \nenforcement grants in the bill before us, my amendment would ensure \nthat $25 million would be provided for grants to states for programs \nand activities to enforce state laws regarding youth access to alcohol. \nThis amendment adds no money to the bill and needs no offset.\n  All states prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors. In \naddition, thee are a range of other laws regarding youth access to \nalcohol that states may have on the books. For instance, some states, \nin addition to prohibiting the sale of alcoholic beverage to minors, \nhave laws prohibiting the consumption of alcoholic beverages by minors, \nand still others ban possession of alcoholic beverages by minors.\n  Mr. President, just today in The Washington Post there is an article \nregarding a sting operation in Arlington County in establishments that \nsell alcohol to minors. According to the officer in charge of the \noperation, minors purchased alcoholic beverages without any kind of \nI.D. check in 57 percent of the establishments visited. This is a\n\n[[Page S8083]]\n\ndisgrace, Mr. President, and, I am afraid, a not uncommon occurrence. I \nconcur wholeheartedly with a quote of Eric, who is 19 years old and who \nparticipated in the sting operation. According to Eric, ``We've figured \nout why we have an underage drinking problem.'' With the media and \nadvertisements besieging our nation's youth with unrealistic messages \nabout alcohol consumption combined with insufficient enforcement of \nlaws already on the books, what you wind up with is, indeed, an \n``underage drinking problem.'' The article concludes by saying that \nCounty officials even warned establishments that they would be using \nunderage people to buy alcohol, and, still, 57 percent of the time the \nunderage participants in the operation were able to purchase alcohol \nwithout challenge. What would the percentage have been had the letters \nnot been sent? Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article \nfrom The Washington Post be printed into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Alcohol Sales to Minors Targeted--170 of 294 Businesses Sold to Teen \n                                Testers\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 24, 1997]\n\n                         (By Brooke A. Masters)\n\n       When the Arlington County police decided to crack down on \n     restaurants, hotels and stores that sell alcohol to minors, \n     they were shocked by the results.\n       Since mid-June, they have sent 18- and 19-year-old testers \n     to 294 establishments, and the testers were able to buy booze \n     at 170 of them. Servers and clerks failed to check \n     identification at everything from the Ritz-Carlton Hotel to \n     two out of three restaurants in the Fashion Centre at \n     Pentagon City to dozens of small convenience stores.\n       ``We're making purchases at 57 percent of the places we go \n     to. It's really absurd,'' said Lt. Thomas Hoffman, who is \n     overseeing the sting. ``We figured we'd get 30 percent.''\n       Eric, a 19-year-old Virginia Tech sophomore who \n     participates in the stings, said, ``We've figured out why we \n     have an underage drinking problem.''\n       Eric, who is not being fully identified because he's still \n     out trying to buy alcohol, and his fellow student aides wear \n     recording devices when they enter a store or a restaurant. \n     They carry no identification, so stores and restaurants can't \n     claim that the testers provided fake IDs.\n       In restaurants, the students order drinks, and county \n     police officers take over once the alcohol arrives, Hoffman \n     said. They pour the drinks into evidence bottles, take \n     pictures of the server and hand out arrest warrants.\n       In stores, the students take beer or wine up to the \n     counter, pay for it and leave. Then an officer goes in and \n     makes an arrest, he said. Often, the employees claim that \n     they usually check ID or that the tester is a regular. The \n     employees all have been charged with serving alcohol to a \n     minor, a misdemeanor.\n       At Hard Times Cafe in Clarendon, the young female tester \n     came in with an older man, and the server ``looked at the guy \n     and assumed he's her father and he wouldn't let her drink \n     under age,'' said Su Carlson, the general manager. ``We were \n     wrong. But it's slightly entrapment. It's better to put an \n     undercover person in an establishment, and if they see \n     someone underaged drink, ID them.''\n       The sting also has caught four underage people selling \n     alcohol, which also is illegal, Hoffman said. One of those \n     caught was a 10-year-old working beside her father at a \n     family-run store, he said.\n       Testers have revisited 12 stores and restaurants after \n     busting employees a first time, and two of them, a Giant \n     pharmacy and a CVS drugstore, failed to card a second time, \n     police records show.\n       ``We are constantly educating our people about selling \n     alcohol to minors with training sessions, booklets and \n     videos,'' Giant Vice President Barry Scher said. ``But we \n     have 5,000 checkers, and we do the best we can.''\n       The Virginia Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control has \n     started administrative proceedings against 29 establishments \n     where arrests have been made, and that's just the beginning. \n     ``It is our intention to file a charge against each and every \n     establishment,'' said Philip Disharoon, assistant special \n     agent in charge of the Alexandria/Arlington ABC office.\n       The sting, while it is Arlington's first in recent years, \n     is not unprecedented in the Washington area. In 1994, \n     Montgomery County sent underage drinkers to 25 county hotels \n     and eventually cited 14 businesses for selling alcohol to \n     minors in hotel rooms.\n       Nor did the operation come out of the blue: Arlington \n     officials sent letters to all licensed stores, restaurants \n     and hotels in April warning that they would be using underage \n     people to buy alcohol.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, alcohol is the drug used most by teens with \ndevastating consequences. According to statistics compiled by the \nNational Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, among children \nbetween the ages of 16 and 17, 69.3 percent have at one point in their \nlifetimes experimented with alcohol. As I consistently remind my \ncolleagues, in the last month, approximately 8 percent of the nation's \neighth graders have been drunk. Eighth graders are 13 years old, Mr. \nPresident! Junior and senior high school students drink 35 percent of \nall wine coolers and consume 1.1 billion cans of beer a year. And I \nwill repeat what is common knowledge to us all--every state has a law \nprohibiting the sale of alcohol to individuals under the age of 21. \nKnowing this, how is it then that two out of every three teenagers who \ndrink report that they can buy their own alcoholic beverages? As if the \ndangers of youth alcohol consumption are not bad enough, statistics \nhave shown that alcohol is a gateway to other drugs such as marijuana \nand cocaine.\n  Drinking impairs one's judgment and when mixed with teenage driving \nthere are too often lethal results. In 1995, there were 2,206 alcohol-\nrelated fatalities of children between the ages of 15 and 20. For many \nyears, I have taken the opportunity when addressing groups of youth \nWest Virginians to warn them about the dangers of alcohol, and I have \nsupported legislative efforts to discourage people, particularly young \npeople, from drinking any alcohol. I am proud to have sponsored an \namendment two years ago which requires states to pass zero-tolerance \nlaws that will make it illegal for persons under the age of 21 to drive \na motor vehicle if they have a blood alcohol level greater than .02 \npercent. This legislation helps to save lives and sends a message to \nour nation's youth that drinking and driving is wrong, that it is a \nviolation of the law, and that it will be appropriately punished.\n  Our children are besieged with media messages that create the \nimpression that alcohol can help to solve life's problems, lead to \npopularity, and enhance athletic skills. These messages coupled with \ninsufficient enforcement of laws prohibiting the consumption of alcohol \nby minors give our nation's youth the impression that it is okay for \nthem to drink. This impression has deadly consequences. In the three \nleading causes of death for 15 to 24 year olds, accidents, homicides, \nand suicides, alcohol is a factor. Efforts to curb the sale of alcohol \nto minors have high payoffs in helping to prevent children from \ndrinking and driving death or injury.\n  There is a link between alcohol consumption and increased violence \nand crime, and I believe that directing funding to programs to enforce \nunderage drinking and sale-to-minors laws will have a positive effect \non efforts to address juvenile crime. According to the Center on \nAddiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, on college \ncampuses, 95 percent of violent crime is alcohol-related and in 90 \npercent of campus rapes that are reported, alcohol is a factor. 31.9 \npercent of youth under the age of 18 in long-term, state operated \njuvenile institutions were under the influence of alcohol at the time \nof their arrest. These statistics are frightening and they need to be \naddressed.\n  This amendment will send a clear message to states that the federal \ngovernment recognizes that enforcement of underage drinking laws is an \nimportant priority and that we are willing to back that message up with \nfunds to assist states in their efforts. It is not good enough to \nsimply urge better enforcement. We must provide the resources.\n  In addition, Mr. President, I would like to say to my good friend, \nthe Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, that I intend \nto work with him when S. 10, the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender \nAct of 1997, is being reauthorized and before the Senate in order to \nauthorize funding for this program in the coming fiscal years.\n  I call on my colleagues to support this amendment which will help \nstates and localities better enforce youth alcohol laws and protect our \nchildren.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1003\n\n       On page 86, line 3 after ``Secretary of Commerce.'' insert \n     the following:\n       Sec. 211.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE EXEMPLARY SERVICE \n                   OF JOHN J. R. BERG TO THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       Whereas, John H. R. Berg began his service to the United \n     States Government working for the United States Army at the \n     age of fifteen after fleeing Nazi persecution in Germany \n     where his father died in the Auschwitz concentration camp; \n     and,\n       Whereas, John H. R. Berg's dedication to the United States \n     Government was further exhibited by his desire to become a \n     United States citizen, a goal that was achieved in 1981, 35 \n     years after he began his commendable service to the United \n     States; and,\n       Whereas, since 1949, John H. R. Berg has been employed by \n     the United States Embassy in Paris where he is currently the \n     Chief of the Visitor's and Travel Unit, And, this year has \n     supported over 10,700 official visitors, 500 conferences, and \n     over 15,000 official and unofficial reservations; and,\n       Whereas, John H. R. Berg's reputation for ``accomplishing \n     the impossible'' through his dedication, efficiency and \n     knowledge has become legend in the Foreign Service; and,\n       Whereas, John H. R. Berg has just completed 50 years of \n     outstanding service to the United States Government with the \n     United States Department of State,\n       Therefore Be It Resolved, it is the Sense of the Senate \n     that John H. R. Berg deserves the highest praise from the \n     Congress for his steadfast devotion, caring leadership, and \n     lifetime of service of the United States Government.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President it is my great pleasure to offer this sense \nof the Senate to recognize and commend John H.R. Berg for 50 years of \nservice to the U.S. Government on behalf of myself and Senator Warner. \nMr. Berg's employment with the U.S. Government began at age 15 working \nfor the U.S. Army in 1946. From July 1947 to February 1949 he worked \nwith the American Graves Registration Command in Paris.\n  In July 1949, Mr. Berg began his employment with the U.S. Embassy in \nParis. Currently, he is the chief of the visitors and travel unit in \nour Embassy in Paris. Currently, he is the chief of the visitors and \ntravel unit in our Embassy in Paris. So far this year, as chief of the \nEmbassy's travel and visitors office, Mr. Berg and his staff of three \nhave supported over 10,700 official visitors, 500 conferences, and over \n15,000 official and unofficial reservations. The position entails \ncoordinating all travel, transportation, housing control rooms and \nairport formalities for visits and conferences. Mr. Berg's dedication, \nefficiency, and wide range of useful host government and private sector \ncontacts have been invaluable to the Embassy and the U.S. Government. \nHis support efforts, personal interest, and ability to accomplish the \nimpossible have become legend in the Foreign Service and to those of us \nwho know his work personally.\n  I know I speak for those who have worked with Mr. Berg when I say \nthat he has devoted his life to providing dedicated, faithful, and \nloyal service to the U.S. Government. He willingly and cheerfully works \nlong hours--evenings, weekends and holidays--to ensure that our visits \nare handled in the most skillful and efficient manner possible. And he \nhas received five Department of State Meritorious Honor Awards for his \noutstanding work.\n  A little known fact about John Berg was that he was a stateless \nperson at the beginning of his service to the U.S. Government. He was \nborn in Germany in 1930, but lost his German citizenship in 1943 due to \nNazi Jewish persecution. After his father was deported to Auschwitz, he \nand his mother with a small group of brave Jews, hid in Berlin from the \nGestapo until the end of the war. The heroism they exhibited and the \ndangers they faced are documented in the book, ``The Last Jews of \nBerlin,'' by Leonard Gross. His father died in the concentration camp. \nAnd after World War II, John Berg moved to France where he began \nworking for the American Government, and has now completed 50 years of \nservice to the U.S. Government. For all his adult life, John Berg's \nmost fervent desire was to become a U.S. citizen. That goal was \nrealized, and he was sworn in as an American citizen in 1981.\n  Mr. President I cannot think of a better role model for those in the \npublic sector. Therefore, I believe that John Berg deserves the \nabsolute highest praise from the President and the Congress for his 50 \nyears of dedicated service to the U.S. Government.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am privileged to join my friend from \nIowa, Senator Harkin, in putting in the Senate's recognition of John \nBerg--an institution himself.\n  His service to Americans was his life. No task was insurmountable; no \ntask was performed with less than all-out dedication.\n  My most memorable among many trips to Paris was during the \nbicentennial of the Treaty of Paris in 1983. President Reagan had \nappointed me as his representative to the many events the French hosted \nto honor the first treaty to recognize, in 1783, a new Nation--the 13 \ncolonies as the United States of America. John Berg was my aid-de-camp \nthroughout that visit. I should add to that official visits to the 40th \nand 50th recognitions of D-day, June 6, 1944.\n  And so it goes for all of us in Congress as we salute John Berg. Well \ndone, sir.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1007\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section:\n       ``The Administrative Office of the United States Courts, in \n     consultation with the Judicial Conference, shall conduct a \n     study of the average costs incurred in defending and \n     presiding over federal capital cases from the initial \n     appearance of the defendant through the final appeal, and \n     shall submit a written report to the Chairman and Ranking \n     Members of the Senate and House Committees on Appropriations \n     and Judiciary on or before July 1, 1998, containing \n     recommendations on measures to contain costs in such cases, \n     with constitutional requirements.''\n       ``: Provided Further, That the Attorney General, shall \n     review the practices of U.S. Attorneys' Offices and relevant \n     investigating agencies in investigating and prosecuting \n     federal capital cases, including before the initial \n     appearance of the defendant through final appeal, and shall \n     submit a written report to the Chairman and Ranking Members \n     of the Senate and House Committees on the Appropriations and \n     Judiciary on or before July 1, 1998, containing \n     recommendations on measures to contain costs in such cases, \n     consistent with constitutional requirements, and outlining a \n     protocol for the effective, fiscally responsible prosecution \n     of federal capital cases''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1008\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate with respect to slamming)\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE WITH RESPECT TO SLAMMING.\n\n       (a) Statement of Purpose.--The purposes of this statement \n     of the sense of the Senate are to--\n       (1) protect consumers from the fraudulent transfer of their \n     phone service provider;\n       (2) allow the efficient prosecution of phone service \n     providers who defraud consumers; and\n       (3) encourage an environment in which consumers can readily \n     select the telephone service provider which best serves them.\n       (b) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) As the telecommunications industry has moved toward \n     competition in the long distance market, consumers have \n     increasingly elected to change the company which\n\n[[Page S8085]]\n\n     provides their long-distance phone service. As many as fifty \n     million consumers now change their long distance provider \n     annually.\n       (2) The fluid nature of the long distance market has also \n     allowed an increasing number of fraudulent transfers to \n     occur. Such transfers have been termed ``slamming'', which \n     constitutes any practice that changes a consumer's long \n     distance carrier without the consumer's knowledge or consent.\n       (3) Slamming is now the largest single consumer complaint \n     received by the Common Carrier Bureau of the Federal \n     Communications Commission. As many as one million consumers \n     are fraudulently transferred annually to a telephone consumer \n     which they have not chosen.\n       (4) The increased costs which consumers face as a result of \n     these fraudulent switches threaten to rob consumers of the \n     financial benefits created by a competitive marketplace.\n       (5) The Telecommunications Act of 1996 sought to combat \n     this problem by directing that any revenues generated by a \n     fraudulent transfer be payable to the company which the \n     consumer has expressly chosen, not the fraudulent transferor.\n       (6) While the Federal Communications Commission has \n     proposed and promulgated regulations on this subject, the \n     Commission has not been able to effectively deter the \n     practice of slamming due to a lack of prosecutorial resources \n     as well as the difficulty of proving that a provider failed \n     to obtain the consent of a consumer prior to acquiring that \n     consumer as a new customer. Commission action to date has not \n     adequately protected consumers.\n       (7) The majority of consumers who have been fraudulently \n     denied the services of their chosen phone service vendor do \n     not turn to the Federal Communications Commission for \n     assistance. Indeed, section 258 of the Communications Act of \n     1934 directs that State commissions shall be able to enforce \n     regulations mandating that the consent of a consumer be \n     obtained prior to a switch of service.\n       (8) It is essential that Congress provide the consumer, \n     local carriers, law enforcement, and consumer agencies with \n     the ability to efficiently and effectively persecute those \n     companies which slam consumers, thus providing a deterrent to \n     all other firms which provide phone services.\n       (c) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Federal Communications Commission should, within 12 \n     months of the date of enactment of this Act, promulgate \n     regulations, consistent with the Communications Act of 1934 \n     which provide law enforcement officials dispositive evidence \n     for use in the prosecution of fraudulent transfers of \n     presubscribed costumers of long distance and local service; \n     and\n       (2) the Senate should examine the issue of slamming and \n     take appropriate legislative action in the 105th Congress to \n     better protect consumers from unscrupulous practices \n     including, but not limited to, mandating the recording and \n     maintenance of evidence concerning the consent of the \n     consumer to switch phone vendors, establishing higher civil \n     fines for violations, and establishing a civil right of \n     action against fraudulent providers, as well as criminal \n     sanctions for repeated and willful instances of slamming.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1009\n\n(Purpose: To foster a safer elementary and secondary school environment \n  for the nation's children through the support of community policing \n                                efforts)\n\n       On page 65, line 10, insert the following: ``Section 120. \n     There shall be no restriction on the use of Public Safety and \n     Community Policing Grants, authorized under title I of the \n     1994 Act, to support innovative programs to improve the \n     safety of elementary and secondary school children and reduce \n     crime on or near elementary or secondary school grounds.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1010\n\n(Purpose: To limit the funds made available for the Office of the Under \nSecretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property Policy, if such office \n                is established, and for other purposes)\n\n       On page 75, line 3, strike all beginning with \n     ``$20,000,000,'' through line 8 and insert the following: \n     ``such funds as are necessary, not to exceed 2 percent of \n     projected annual revenues of the Patent and Trademark Office, \n     shall be made available from the sum appropriated in this \n     paragraph for the staffing, operation, and support of said \n     office once a plan for this office has been submitted to the \n     House and Senate Committees on Appropriations pursuant to \n     section 605 of this Act.''.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1011\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n       ``Section 1701(b)(2)(A) of title I of the Omnibus Crime \n     Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3796dd) is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(A) may not exceed 20 percent of the funds available for \n     grants pursuant to this subsection in any fiscal year.''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1012\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert ``Provided further, That \n     none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available to \n     the Immigration and Naturalization Service may be used to \n     accept, process, or forward to the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation any FD-258 fingerprint card, or any other means \n     used to transmit fingerprints, for the purpose of conducting \n     a criminal background check on any applicant for any benefit \n     under the Immigration and Nationality Act unless the \n     applicant's fingerprints have been taken by an office of the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service or by a law \n     enforcement agency, which may collect a fee for the service \n     of taking and forwarding the fingerprints.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1013\n\n (Purpose: To strike a restriction concerning the transfer of certain \npersonnel to the Office of Legislative Affairs or the Office of Public \n                 Affairs of the Department of Justice)\n\n       On page 2, lines 17 through 22, strike the colon on line 17 \n     and all that follows through ``basis'' on line 22.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1014\n\n       On page 125, strike lines 3-9.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1015\n\n (Purpose: To provide a waiver from certain immunization requirements \n             for certain aliens entering the United States)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following: WAIVER OF \n     CERTAIN VACCINATION REQUIREMENTS\n       Sec.    . (a) in general.--Section 212 of the Immigration \n     and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182) is amended by adding at \n     the end the following:\n       ``(p) The Attorney General should exercise the waiver \n     authority provided for in subsection (g)(2)(B) for any alien \n     orphan applying for an IR3 or IR4 category visa.''.\n\n  Mr. McCain. Mr. President, This is intended to resolve a potentially \nserious problem involving foreign children emigrating to the United \nStates for the purpose of being united with their adoptive parents. \nQuite simply, the amendment urges the Attorney General to exercise that \nauthority to waive vaccination requirements for certain categories of \nemigres that is part of current law.\n  Last year, my colleague from Arizona, Senator Kyl, succeeded in \ngetting passed legislation authorizing the Attorney General to waive \nthe immunization requirements for legal aliens entering the country if \nmedical, moral or religious considerations so warrant. Unfortunately, \nthat authority has not been exercised, despite extenuating \ncircumstances that clearly argue for such a waiver from the \nimmunization requirement. No where is this failure to exercise that \nauthority more damaging than in the area of foreign-borne orphans being \nadopted by U.S. citizens.\n  Neither Senator Kyl nor I would argue that immigrants with serious \ncommunicable diseases should be allowed into the United States. What we \nare saying is that children whose medical conditions cannot be \naccurately determined without a more thorough examination than can be \nadministered in their home country should not be subjected to \nvaccinations that may trigger unforeseen reactions, for instance, from \nallergies to a specific serum. Additionally, other medical conditions \nmay exist that make immunization at a specific time unadvisable, as \nwould be the case with a child suffering from influenza. All this \namendment does is tell the Attorney General to do what common sense \ndictates should be done anyway: not subject children to vaccinations to \nwhich their systems may not be immediately adaptable.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

Mr. President, my amendment excludes Haitians from the \nU.S. who have been involved in extrajudicial and political killings in \nHaiti. Specifically, it does this by denying funds for the issuance of \nvisas to these persons.\n  There have been numerous cases of politically-motivated \nassassinations in Haiti. Some of these extrajudicial killings occurred \nwhile former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was in exile. Many others \ntook place after he returned to power. Unfortunately, these killings \nhave continued after Mr. Aristide left office and Rene Preval became \nPresident.\n  The Haitian Government has assigned over eighty extrajudicial and \npolitical killing cases to the Special Investigative Unit. The Haitian \nGovernment claims that they have fired several government employees who \nare suspects in these killings.\n  But the sad fact remains that to date, no one has been convicted for \nany of these assassinations. Simply stated, there has been no \nsubstantial progress in these investigations.\n  We need to encourage the Haitians to bring these killers to justice. \nWe need to let them know that these killings cannot be tolerated.\n  My amendment denies funding for the issuance of visas to those who \nhave been credibly alleged to have ordered, carried out, materially \nassisted, or sought to conceal these extrajudicial and political \nkillings. The amendment exempts persons for medical reasons, or if they \nhave cooperated fully with the investigation of these political \nmurders.\n  The legislation also includes a reporting requirement. The \nAdministration would be directed to submit, to the appropriate \ncongressional committees, (1) a list of those who have been credibly \nalleged to have ordered or carried out the extrajudicial and political \nkillings; (2) a list of those refused entry to the United States as a \nresult of this provision; and (3) a report on this matter, to be \nsubmitted once each year, until such time as the Government of Haiti \nhas completed the investigation of these extrajudicial and political \nkillings and has prosecuted those implicated in these murders.\n  It is an unfortunate reality that political violence has been a way \nof life in Haiti. Too many Haitians have died due to acts of political \nviolence. The adoption of this amendment will not solve their problems \novernight. But it can help. I believe this legislation sends a strong \nsignal that violence must not be used as a political tool in Haiti. It \nalso sends a message to the Haitians that we will vigorously support \nthose who want to end political violence and create a lasting society \nof peace and prosperity in Haiti.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of this amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1018\n\n                     (Purpose: To improve the bill)\n\n       On page 114, strike lines 14-23.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1019\n\n(Purpose: To delay the effective date of the amendments made by section \n   233 of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996)\n\n       At the appropriate place in title I of the bill, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 1  .

Mr. President, on Thursday evening, July 10, 1997, the \nSenate confirmed the nomination of George J. Tenet, of Maryland, to be \nthe Director of Central Intelligence. I am delighted that the Senate \nhas taken this action, based on the unanimous recommendation of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee.\n  George Tenet is well known to many members of the Senate, as he \nserved with distinction as a staff member, and then Staff Director of \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee during the service of Senator David \nBoren, of Oklahoma, when he was Chairman of that Committee. When \nSenator Boren retired, to take up the post of President of the \nUniversity of Oklahoma, George became the Assistant to the President \nfor Intelligence matters on the staff of the National Security Council, \nand served with great distinction in that capacity. As a result of that \nservice, he was asked by Mr. John Deutsch to be the Deputy Director of \nCentral Intelligence when Mr. Deutsch was appointed Director, and he \nhas served as the Acting Director since January of this year when Mr. \nDeutsch returned to the private sector. Mr. Tenet has been praised on \nthe floor by the current leadership of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, by the Chairman, the distinguished Senator from Alabama, Mr. \nShelby, and the Ranking Democrat, the distinguished Senator from \nNebraska, Mr. Kerrey. They have praised Mr. Tenet's capabilities, \njudgment and character. I wish to express my own confidence in his \nleadership and I believe he has the capacity to bring the agency out of \nthe unfortunate period that it has recently experienced which was \ntarnished by espionage scandals, and too rapid a turnover in the Office \nof the Director. He faces the challenge of bringing morale up, as well \nas restoring public and Congressional confidence in the intelligence \norganization of the nation. It is his responsibility to ensure that the \nIntelligence Community performs on the basis of the highest standards \nof integrity, and that the tremendous analytical, technical, and \npersonnel resources that the community possesses, without rival in the \nworld, are brought to bear on the often dangerous and difficult targets \nand areas of concern that constitute the intelligence agenda of the \nnation.\n  Mr. Tenet is already known as a strong leader with clear focus and a \nbroad vision. I do not believe there is any recent Director of Central \nIntelligence that I have dealt with that brings as strong a knowledge \nof and constituency in the Senate as he enjoys. Intelligence in the \nconfusing and shifting world of this post-cold war era is vital to both \nbranches of the national government, and to be successful must enjoy \nthe strong support of both of them. George is uniquely qualified to \nbring about a working consensus on the priorities, activities and \nbudget of the intelligence community. He enjoys an extraordinarily deep \nreservoir of support here in the Senate, and I believe in the White \nHouse and the Intelligence Community as well. He is an outstanding \nchoice, and the President is to be commended on his selection. I look \nforward to working with him to ensure that the highly dedicated, \ntalented and courageous individuals who serve the nation silently day \nand night across the globe enjoy the support that they need to carry \nout their duties. I wish him a long, fruitful and rewarding tenure as \nour new Director of Central Intelligence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/24/senate-section/article/S8087-4", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8087-S8089]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CNN'S COVERAGE OF THE SENATE CAMPAIGN FINANCE HEARINGS\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, Cable News Network announced this week that \nit would provide live television coverage of the Senate Governmental \nAffairs Committee hearings on campaign finance activities. But, Mr. \nPresident, their decision was based only on the fact that former \nRepublican National Committee chairman, Haley Barbour, is scheduled to \ntestify.\n  CNN has been suspiciously absent in its live coverage of the \nhearings, only allowing its viewers to see the opening statements of \nthe chairman and the ranking member during the past 2 weeks of the \nhearings.\n  As I understand it, CNN based its decision to provide live coverage \nof Mr. Barbour's testimony on the judgment that he has celebrity \nstatus. Or, as CNN's own Washington Bureau chief, Frank Sesno, called \nthem yesterday, ``major players''.\n  That is a decision more fitting of the program ``Entertainment \nTonight'', instead of a network which prides itself on being the \nworld's leader of news.\n  I am certain that I am not the only one disappointed by CNN's \ndecision to forgo live coverage of the hearings. In fact, on CNN's own \nInternet web page, an overwhelming number of CNN's viewers are \ndistressed over the network's failure to provide live coverage.\n  One viewer wrote, and I quote:\n\n       Although I am very pleased that you are carrying the \n     campaign finance hearings through your Web site, I must say \n     after all of the interminable O.J. hearings you carried live \n     on CNN, why on God's earth aren't you carrying the hearings \n     as well? I am very disappointed.\n\n  It was signed by Jim Merrick on July 16.\n  Mr. President, there has been such sufficient controversy over the \nCNN's lack of live coverage of the hearings--and even the lack of \nregular coverage of the hearings by the other television networks--that \nCNN devoted a substantial portion of its program ``Inside Politics'' on \nTuesday, to discuss the uproar.\n  In a roundtable discussion, where journalists interview each other \nabout what a great job they're doing, CNN's Judy Woodruff asked ABC's \nHal Bruno about the difference of these hearings as compared to the \nWatergate and Iran-Contra hearings. Hal Bruno replied, and I quote:\n\n       Government was at a standstill in Washington as a result of \n     Watergate and the whole country was immersed in it. And the \n     same was true to a lesser degree with Iran-Contra. These were \n     major stories of revelations of criminal wrongdoing.\n\n  Mr. President, Hal Bruno's comment is an outrage.\n\n[[Page S8088]]\n\n  For one, the country was immersed in these events because the \ntelevision networks were carrying the hearings live.\n  And furthermore, the campaign finance hearings have uncovered much \nmore serious charges and allegations. They include: Espionage, foreign \ninfluence peddling, campaign corruption and even money laundering. Just \nlook at this summary by the staff of the Governmental Affairs Committee \non what has been revealed so far during 2 weeks of hearings.\n  Hal Bruno's statement is ludicrous, and CNN's lack of live coverage \nof the hearings proves that they are ignoring a major news story.\n  Mr. President, I have written a letter to CNN president, Tom Johnson, \nand CNN Washington Bureau chief, Frank Sesno, expressing my \ndisappointment and anger over their decision. This is the same network \nthat covered endless hours of the O.J. Simpson murder trial--a news \nevent that affected relatively few Americans. I have not yet received a \nreply from my letter, and I doubt I will.\n  Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the summary of highlights of the first 2 weeks of hearings by \nthe Governmental Affairs hearings, and my letter to CNN's president and \nWashington Bureau chief.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Republican Policy Committee,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 22, 1997.\n     Mr. Tom Johnson,\n     President, CNN, Atlanta, GA.\n       Dear Mr. Johnson: I am disappointed over CNN's \n     unwillingness to provide live, gavel-to-gavel coverage of the \n     Senate Governmental Affairs hearings on campaign finance \n     activities. If you had been carrying the hearings, your \n     viewers would have been able to watch the testimony of \n     witnesses who gave compelling evidence of criminal wrongdoing \n     by foreign donors to the Democratic party during the 1996 \n     elections. The result of such testimony even prompted a key \n     Democrat on the committee, Senator Joseph Lieberman of \n     Connecticut, to publicly acknowledge that there was a Chinese \n     government plan to influence the elections. Unfortunately, \n     CNN viewers were not given the opportunity to draw their own \n     conclusions.\n       Now, I have come to learn that your network is planning to \n     provide live coverage of this week's scheduled testimony of \n     former Republican National Committee chairman, Haley Barbour. \n     Unlike previous witnesses, who linked one Democratic \n     fundraiser to possible charges of espionage and illegal \n     influence buying and peddling, Mr. Barbour has not been \n     charged with any crime nor has he broken any laws. Why does \n     CNN deem Mr. Barbour's testimony so important as to merit \n     live coverage? Is your network ``celebrity watching''--like \n     ``Entertainment Tonight''?\n       What can be said about CNN's decision to only provide live \n     coverage of Mr. Barbour's testimony is media bias at best, \n     and tabloid journalism at worst. Your intensive coverage of \n     the O.J. Simpson trial suggests that the later is more \n     accurate. It's apparent that CNN has already decided what the \n     public is interested in watching instead of the public making \n     that decision for themselves.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Larry E. Craig,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Summary of Highlights of Testimony of First Two Weeks of Hearings by \nthe Committee on Governmental Affairs Into 1996 Campaign Finance Abuses\n\n       DNC Finance Director Richard Sullivan acknowledged that the \n     DNC's process for vetting contributions had ``atrophied,'' \n     and that the Republican Party's system for vetting \n     contributions was ``much more systematic, complex and \n     thorough'' than the Democratic Party's system.\n       The Committee learned that John Huang was pushed for his \n     job at the DNC by a foreign corporation and its head, James \n     Riady, a close friend of President Clinton.\n       The Committee learned that Huang was also pushed for his \n     fund-raising position by senior White House officials, like \n     Harold Ickes, but he was not hired by the DNC until President \n     Clinton himself pushed for Huang's hiring.\n       The Committee revealed several instances of foreign \n     contributions being laundered into the DNC:\n       (1) Yogesh Gandhi made a $325,000 contribution to the DNC \n     at an event at the Sheraton-Carlton Hotel in Washington in \n     1996 and shortly thereafter received two $250,000 wire \n     transfers from a Japanese businessman named Tanaka to cover \n     the contribution. This was Gandhi's first US political \n     contribution and the $325,000 represented more than half the \n     funds raised by the DNC at the Sheraton-Carlton event.\n       (2) Johnny Chung contributed $50,000 to the DNC in March \n     1996, at a time when he had less than $10,000 in his account. \n     A few days after making the contribution Chung received a \n     $50,000 wire transfer from the Bank of China. Soon after \n     making the $50,000 contribution from these funds, Chung \n     attended the President's weekly radio address with 5 visiting \n     Chinese officials and guests.\n       (3) In 1992 John Huang contributed $50,000 on behalf of Hip \n     Hing Holdings, a Riady-owned company in Los Angeles, and \n     sought reimbursement for the contribution from Lippo Group in \n     Indonesia.\n       The Committee also revealed that Chinese arms merchant Wang \n     Jun, son of a prominent Communist official whose arms company \n     has been accused of selling cruise missiles to Iran, attended \n     an event with the President after he contributed $50,000 to \n     the DNC through Ernest Green of Lehman Brothers.\n       The Committee learned that Gregory Loutschansky, a former \n     Soviet citizen living in Tel Aviv who is reputed to be an \n     international gun-runner and drug-smuggler, was invited by \n     the DNC to an October 1995 dinner with the President, but was \n     denied a visa by the State Department to enter the US.\n       The Committee learned that Roger Tamraz, a US citizen and \n     major DNC donor, was invited by the DNC to meet with the Vice \n     President, but the invitation was withdrawn after the Vice \n     President's staff objected because Tamraz had ``a shady \n     reputation.'' Despite the fact that Tamraz was deemed \n     unacceptable to meet the Vice President, the DNC invited \n     Tamraz to four subsequent events with the President.\n       The Committee learned that President Clinton's friend \n     Charlie Trie made a $50,000 contribution to the DNC in June \n     1995 and raised large amounts for the Presidential Legal \n     Expense Trust, even though a financial disclosure form he \n     filled out after securing a presidential appointment showed \n     he earned only $60,000 that year.\n       The Committee learned that John Huang had worked for Lippo \n     Bank in Los Angeles, but the CEO of the Bank did not know \n     what Huang did in his office.\n       The Committee learned that Lippo Group, run by the Riady \n     family, which employed Huang, had over the past few years \n     become a major business partner with China Resources, a \n     trading company wholly owned by the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China, which has reportedly served as an \n     intelligence-collection front for China.\n       The Committee learned that Huang was given a political \n     appointment in the Commerce Department, but his boss, \n     Commerce Under secretary Jeffrey Garten found Huang totally \n     unqualified for the position and limited his activities to \n     administrative duties.\n       The Committee learned that Huang was ``walled off'' from \n     handling China trade policy and was allowed to handle only \n     some matters related to Taiwan.\n       The Committee learned that despite being ``walled off'' \n     from China policy, Huang was given intelligence briefings on \n     China.\n       The Committee learned that while he was at the Commerce \n     Department, Huang had a Top Secret security clearance and \n     received 37 intelligence briefings, at which he was shown 10 \n     to 15 intelligence reports, meaning that he saw between 370 \n     and 550 pieces of intelligence.\n       The Committee learned that of the pieces of intelligence \n     shown to Huang, he kept possession of 12 classified documents \n     until the end of his tenure at the Commerce Department.\n       The Committee learned that while he served as a relatively \n     low-level political functionary at the Commerce Department, \n     Huang made at least 67 visits to the White House, often \n     meeting with senior officials on US trade policy.\n       The Committee learned that while he worked at the Commerce \n     Department, Huang routinely and regularly used the office of \n     Stephens Inc., a Little rock-based company with an office \n     across the street from the Commerce Department, to send and \n     receive phone calls, faxes, and packages, which a Stephens \n     employee testified no other non-Stephens employee did.\n       The Committee learned that Huang had over 400 contacts with \n     Lippo bank and Lippo group employees and associates while he \n     worked at the Commerce Department, was receiving classified \n     information, attending White House briefings, and using the \n     Stephens Inc. office to send and receive messages and faxes.\n       The Committee learned that Huang did make personal calls \n     from his Commerce Department phone, indicating that he was \n     not using the Stephens office to avoid using his official \n     phone for personal matters.\n       The Committee learned that while he served at the Commerce \n     Department, Huang made six visits to the Chinese Embassy and \n     had three other contacts with Chinese Embassy officials, even \n     though he had been ``walled off'' from anything having to do \n     with China.\n       The Committee learned that while he served at the Commerce \n     Department, Huang may have illegally solicited several large \n     contributions for the DNC, for which his wife Jane was listed \n     as the solicitor by the DNC, from several individuals.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    July 22, 1997.\n     Mr. Tom Johnson,\n     President, CNN, Atlanta, GA.\n       Dear Mr. Johnson: I am disappointed over CNN's \n     unwillingness to provide live, gavel-to-gavel coverage of the \n     Senate Governmental Affairs hearings on campaign finance \n     activities. If you had been carrying the hearings, your \n     viewers would have been able to\n\n[[Page S8089]]\n\n     watch the testimony of witnesses who gave compelling evidence \n     of criminal wrongdoing by foreign donors to the Democratic \n     party during the 1996 elections. The result of such testimony \n     even prompted a key Democrat on the committee, Senator Joseph \n     Lieberman of Connecticut, to publicly acknowledge that there \n     was a Chinese government plan to influence the elections. \n     Unfortunately, CNN viewers were not given the opportunity to \n     draw their own conclusions.\n       Now, I have come to learn that your network is planning to \n     provide live coverage of this week's scheduled testimony of \n     former Republican National Committee chairman, Haley Barbour. \n     Unlike previous witnesses, who linked one Democratic \n     fundraiser to possible charges of espionage and illegal \n     influence buying and peddling, Mr. Barbour has not been \n     charged with any crime nor has he broken any laws. Why does \n     CNN deem Mr. Barbour's testimony so important as to merit \n     live coverage? Is your network ``celebrity watching''--like \n     ``Entertainment Tonight''?\n       What can be said about CNN's decision to only provide live \n     coverage of Mr. Barbour's testimony is media bias at best, \n     and tabloid journalism at worst. Your intensive coverage of \n     the O.J. Simpson trial suggests that the later is more \n     accurate. It's apparent that CNN has already decided what the \n     public is interested in watching instead of the public making \n     that decision for themselves.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Larry E. Craig,\n     Chairman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/24/senate-section/article/S8087-5", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8089]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       HONORING THE SUETTERLINS ON THEIR 50TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, families are the cornerstone of America. \nThe data are undeniable: Individuals from strong families contribute to \nthe society. In an era when nearly half of all couples married today \nwill see their union dissolve into divorce, I believe it is both \ninstructive and important to honor those who have taken the commitment \nof ``till death us do part'' seriously, demonstrating successfully the \ntimeless principles of love, honor, and fidelity. These characteristics \nmake our country strong.\n  For these important reasons, I rise today to honor Catherine and \nMartin Suetterlin of St. Louis County, MO, who on September 27, 1997, \nwill celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary. My wife, Janet, and I \nlook forward to the day we can celebrate a similar milestone. The \nSuetterlins' commitment to the principles and values of their marriage \ndeserves to be saluted and recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/24/senate-section/article/S8089-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8089]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL SAFE PLACE WEEK\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a Senate \nresolution submitted by the distinguished Senator from Idaho. Senate \nResolution 96 sponsored by Senator Larry Craig would designate the week \nof March 15 through March 21, 1998 as ``National Safe Place Week.''\n  Project Safe Place is a creative approach to serving youth and \nfamilies in crisis. I am particularly pleased to cosponsor this \nresolution on behalf of the first program started in my home State of \nKentucky. Project Safe Place began in a firehouse in Louisville, KY in \n1983, providing a safe haven from various negative influences such as \nchild abuse, substance abuse, and crime. Safe Places put distressed \nchildren and families in touch with the resources they need to keep \nthem safe. This assistance often comes in the form of counseling and a \nsafe and secure place to stay.\n  Today, the Safe Place Program has spread to 34 States across the \ncountry. More than 6,000 business locations displaying the black and \nyellow Safe Place sign indicating that those in need can seek help from \nthose inside.\n  The Safe Place Program exemplifies the best in our local communities. \nProject Safe Place is about community businesses and volunteers working \ntogether to help the most vulnerable in our society. It is essential \nthat we bring this valuable program to every community, because those \nin need feel more comfortable in turning to resources in their own \nneighborhoods and communities.\n  By designating March 15 through March 21, 1998 as ``National Safe \nPlace Week,'' we not only bring public awareness to this outstanding \nprogram, but recognize those volunteers and businesses who give so much \nto make our communities a truly safe place. I urge my colleagues to \nlend their names to this worthwhile legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/24/senate-section/article/S8089-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8089]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RETIREMENT OF CAROLE STEVENSON\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about a \ndedicated Senate employee, Carole Stevenson, who is retiring after 30 \nyears of Federal service. Carole worked for me when I served as \nchairman of the Rules Committee. She currently works on the staff of \nour colleague, Tim Johnson.\n  Carole held a number of jobs as she went about acquiring her 30 years \nof service. She worked for Senators Capehart and Kefauver in the \nfifties, the Architect of the Capitol and the executive branch in the \nsixties, and the Office of Technology Assessment in the mid-seventies. \nShe even took off a decade to have and raise a family.\n  Carole joined the staff of the Senate Rules Committee in 1977 and \nstayed for 20 years. She held a variety of jobs, moving from front \noffice receptionist, to room reservationist, to secretary and staff \nassistant in the Technical Services section of the Rules Committee.\n  To put it simply, Carole was a hard worker who took pride in her \nwork. She always wanted to do a good job for her employer, and she did. \nShe loves the Senate, so she did her best.\n  I want to personally thank Carole for her service to the Senate. Her \nmany friends in this great institution will miss her. All of us wish \nher well in her retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/24/senate-section/article/S8089-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8089]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.

This legislative proposal is designed \nto ensure that the complete transition to the new ``cancellation of \nremoval'' (formerly ``suspension of deportation'') provisions of the \nIllegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 \n(IIRIRA; Public Law 104-208) can be accomplished in a fair and \nequitable manner consistent with our law enforcement needs and foreign \npolicy interests.\n  This legislative proposal would aid the transition to IIRIRA's new \ncancellation of removal rules and prevent the unfairness of applying \nthose rules to cases pending before April 1, 1997, the effective date \nof the new rules. It would also recognize the special circumstances of \ncertain Central Americans who entered the United States in the 1980s in \nresponse to civil war and political persecution. The Nicaraguan Review \nProgram, under successive Administrations from 1985 to 1995, protected \nroughly 40,000 Nicaraguans from deportation while their cases were \nunder review. During this time the American Baptist Churches v. \nThornburgh (ABC) litigation resulted in a 1990 court settlement, which \nprotected roughly 190,000 Salvadorans and 50,000 Guatemalans. Other \nCentral Americans have been unable to obtain a decision on their asylum \napplications for many years. Absent this legislative proposal, many of \nthese individuals would be denied protection from deportation under \nIIRIRA's new cancellation of removal rules. Such a result would unduly \nharm stable families and communities here in the United States and \nundermine our strong interests in facilitating the development of peace \nand democracy in Central America.\n\n[[Page S8090]]\n\n  This legislative proposal would delay the effect of IIRIRA's new \nprovisions so that immigration cases pending before April 1, 1997, will \ncontinue to be considered and decided under the old suspension of \ndeportation rules as they existed prior to that date. IIRIRA'S new \ncancellation of removal rules would generally apply to cases commenced \non or after April 1, 1997. This proposal dictates no particular outcome \nof any case. Every application for suspension of deportation or \ncancellation of removal must still be considered on a case-by-case \nbasis. The proposal simply restores a fair opportunity to those whose \ncases have long been in the system or have other demonstrable equities.\n  In addition to continuing to apply the old standards to old cases, \nthis legislative proposal would exempt such cases from IIRIRA's annual \ncap of 4,000 cancellations of removal. It would also exempt from the \ncap cases of battered spouses and children who otherwise receive such \ncancellation.\n  The proposal also guarantees that the cancellation of removal \nproceedings of certain individuals covered by the 1990 ABC litigation \nsettlement and certain other Central Americans with long-pending asylum \nclaims will be governed by the pre-IIRIRA substantive standard of 7 \nyears continuous physical presence and extreme hardship. It would \nfurther exempt those same individuals from IIRIRA's cap. Finally, \nindividuals affected by the legislation whose time has lapsed for \nreopening their cases following a removal order would be granted 180 \ndays in which to do so.\n  My Administration is committed to working with the Congress to enact \nthis legislation. If, however, we are unsuccessful in this goal, I am \nprepared to examine any available administrative options for granting \nrelief to this class of immigrants. These options could include a grant \nof Deferred Enforced Departure for certain classes of individuals who \nwould qualify for relief from deportation under this legislative \nproposal. Prompt legislative action on my proposal would ensure a \nsmooth transition to the full implementation of IIRIRA and prevent \nharsh and avoidable results.\n  I urge the Congress to give this legislative proposal prompt and \nfavorable consideration.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to authorize the President to award a gold medal on \nbehalf of the Congress to Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew in \nrecognition of his outstanding and enduring contributions toward \nreligious understanding and peace, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n     CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL FOR ECUMENICAL PATRIARCH BARTHOLOMEW\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, today I join my friend and colleague from \nthe Banking Committee, Senator Sarbanes, to offer a bill that would \nauthorize a congressional gold medal in recognition of the tremendous \nleadership role--in interfaith relations, international affairs, the \npromotion of global environmental protection, and the defense of human \nrights worldwide--of his all holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew \nof Constantinople.\n  In addition, we are submitting a concurrent resolution providing for \nthe use of the rotunda of the Capitol for a ceremony honoring Patriarch \nBartholomew on his visit to the United States in late October of this \nyear.\n  The Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew is the 270th successor of the \nnearly 2,000 year old Orthodox Christian Church founded in 36 A.D.\n  As the spiritual leader of the Orthodox Christian Church, Patriarch \nBartholomew is the voice for nearly 300 million followers around the \nworld--5 million of which live in the United States and are of Greek, \nRussian, Ukrainian, and Serbian descent. The contributions of these \nAmericans to our history and culture exemplify the values, ideals, and \ndreams of this great Nation.\n  A champion of religious unity and cooperation, Patriarch Bartholomew \nis working to promote interfaith dialog between the Orthodox Church and \nthe Roman Catholic Church, leading Protestant denominations, Muslim \nleaders, and various faiths of America's multiethnic diversity.\n  Patriarch Bartholomew has also sought to strengthen the bonds between \nJudaism and Orthodox Christianity. In 1994, he worked side by side with \nRabbi David Schneier and the Appeal of Conscience Foundation to \ncosponsor the Peace and Tolerance Conference, bringing together \nChristians, Jews, and Muslims for human and religious freedom.\n  As a citizen of Turkey, Patriarch Bartholomew is deeply concerned \nabout the need to sustain the cause of peace. He has been a dynamic \nleader in efforts to ease Greek-Turkish tensions and to promote \ninternational cooperation, adherence to international law, and respect \nfor the human rights of victims of aggression.\n  The impact of Patriarch Bartholomew's compassion is far-reaching. In \nthe war-torn countries of the Balkans,\n\n[[Page S8092]]\n\nPatriarch Bartholomew has helped to advance reconciliation among \nCatholic, Muslim, and Orthodox communities.\n  Mr. President, Patriarch Bartholomew also cares very deeply for the \nenvironmental legacy we will one day leave to our children. Together \nwith global leaders, he convened an international environmental \nsymposium emphasizing the health and well-being of the world's oceans. \nThe Patriarch is also a cosponsor of an annual conference addressing \nthe protection of our global environment.\n  Born in Turkey in 1940, Patriarch Bartholomew has selflessly \ndedicated his life to religious service. He is a graduate of the \nrenowned Theological School of Halki, which was forced to close by the \nTurkish Government in 1971. This school must re-open as a basic matter \nof religious freedom.\n  Patriarch Bartholomew has also received numerous honorary doctorates \nand academic honors from institutes and universities all across the \nglobe.\n  Mr. President, in October of this year, Patriarch Bartholomew will \nvisit the United States to offer his spiritual message of unity, \ncompassion, and brotherhood. It is our belief that Congress honor the \nwork of this great leader in recognition of his outstanding and \nenduring contributions to: the freedom of the world's religions, world \npeace, conflict resolution and the rule of law, global environmental \nprotection, the betterment of humankind, and the protection of dignity \nand human rights of every man, woman, and child.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, it is fitting and appropriate that this \nbody bestow the congressional gold medal upon a visionary for our \ntimes, his all holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1062\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew--\n       (A) is the spiritual leader of nearly 300 million Orthodox \n     Christians around the world and millions of Orthodox \n     Christians in America; and\n       (B) is recognized in the United States and abroad as a \n     leader in the quest for world peace, respect for the earth's \n     environment, and greater religious understanding;\n       the extraordinary efforts of Ecumenical Patriarch \n     Bartholomew continue to bring people of all faiths closer \n     together in America and around the world;\n       (3) the courageous leadership of Ecumenical Patriarch \n     Bartholomew for peace in the Balkans, Eastern Europe, the \n     Middle East, the Eastern Mediterranean, and elsewhere \n     inspires and encourages people of all faiths toward his dream \n     of world peace in the new millennium; and\n       (4) the outstanding accomplishments of Ecumenical Patriarch \n     Bartholomew have been formally recognized and honored by \n     numerous governmental academic, and other institutions around \n     the world.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n       (a) Presentation Authorized.--The President is authorized \n     to present, on behalf of the Congress, a gold medal of \n     appropriate design to Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew. in \n     recognition of his outstanding and enduring contributions \n     to religious understanding and peace.\n       (b) Design and Striking.--For the purpose of the \n     presentation referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of \n     the Treasury (hereafter in this Act referred to as the \n     ``Secretary'') shall strike a gold medal with suitable \n     emblems, devices, and inscriptions, to be determined by the \n     Secretary.\n\n     SEC. 3. DUPLICATE MEDALS.\n\n       The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of \n     the gold medal struck pursuant to section 2 under such \n     regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, and at a price \n     sufficient to cover the costs thereof, including labor, \n     materials, dies, use of machinery, overhead expenses, and the \n     cost of the gold medal.\n\n     SEC. 4. NATIONAL MEDALS.\n\n       The medals struck pursuant to this Act are national medals \n     for purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS; PROCEEDS OF SALE.\n\n       (a) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is hereby \n     authorized to be charged against the Numismatic Public \n     Enterprise Fund an amount not to exceed $30,000 to pay for \n     the cost of the medal authorized by this Act.\n       (b) Proceeds of Sale.--Amounts received from the sales of \n     duplicate bronze medals under section 3 shall be deposited in \n     the Numismatic Public Enterprise Fund.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator D'Amato, \nchairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs, in introducing legislation awarding the congressional gold \nmedal to Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the spiritual leader of \napproximately 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwide. The occasion \nof this legislation is to honor Patriarch Bartholomew's first visit to \nthe United States as Patriarch and to recognize his outstanding \ncontributions to world peace and understanding during his tenure as \nhead of this ancient branch of Christianity. As a Greek-Orthodox \nAmerican and member of the Greek Orthodox Cathedral of the Annunciation \nin Baltimore, I am particularly gratified to join in this tribute.\n  During his American visit, which will take place from October 19 \nthrough November 17, 1997, Patriarch Bartholomew will meet with \nthousands of Orthodox faithful and will take the opportunity to convey \nhis message of reconciliation to Americans of all backgrounds and \nbeliefs. His All Holiness has been a leader in ecumenical understanding \nand has convened important meetings which have brought together \nparticipants of all religious backgrounds. In 1994, in cooperation with \nRabbi David Schneier and the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, he \ncosponsored a peace and tolerance Conference in Istanbul where \nChristians, Jews, and Muslims joined together to discuss important and \npressing issues.\n  As spiritual head of world Orthodoxy, Patriarch Bartholomew has been \na leader in the quest for peace throughout the world, particularly in \nEastern Europe, the Balkans, and the Middle East. He has vigorously \nspoken out against extremists and those who would use violence to \nachieve their ends and has counseled respect for all peoples, \nirrespective of their nationality and religion; his ministry has been a \ncall to our best virtues.\n  From his historical seat in Istanbul, Turkey, Patriarch Bartholomew \nhas served as a mediator between East and West, Christians and Muslims, \nand as a force for openness and tolerance in the newly emerging \nindependent countries of Eastern Europe.\n  As he pursues the goal of peace, Patriarch Bartholomew is equally \nvigorous in his desire to preserve and promote the earth's environment \nas a reflection of God's creation. Working with the European \nCommission, the Worldwide Fund for Nature, and his Royal Highness \nPrince Philip, he has cosponsored significant international conferences \non the environment, including one scheduled for this fall on the future \necological health of the Black Sea.\n  I believe it is most fitting that the visit and the accomplishments \nof Patriarch Bartholomew should be recognized and honored by this gold \nmedal as it will reflect the appreciation of the American people for \nhis ministry of peace and reconciliation.\n  I am also pleased to join Senator D'Amato in submitting a concurrent \nresolution providing for the use of the rotunda for a ceremony honoring \nPatriarch Bartholomew.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 1063. A bill to suspend temporarily the duty on KN001 (a \nhydrochloride); to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                       TEMPORARY DUTY SUSPENSION\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I am introducing a duty \nsuspension bill that will not only benefit the chemical workers in my \nstate of West Virginia, but also will enable U.S. farmers to grow more \ncrops at lower cost and protect the environment at the same time.\n  This legislation will suspend the U.S. duty on a hydrochloride known \nby its code name of KN001. This substance is a key raw material in a \nnew, environmentally safe family of agricultural chemicals invented by \nDuPont in the 1980's. These new agricultural chemicals, called \nsulfonylureas, are used in extremely small amounts by farmers to \ncontrol weed growth in their fields without harming the crops that the \nfarmers are trying to grow. By suppressing weed growth, these chemicals \nmake sure that all of the available soil nutrients and moisture go into \ngrowing the crops instead of growing weeds. Because sulfonylureas \noperate on plant enzymes, they do not affect insects or animals, and \nbecause they biodegrade\n\n[[Page S8093]]\n\nrapidly, they are among the most environmentally friendly crop \nprotection chemicals in use today.\n  An additional benefit of suspending the duty on KN001 is the effect \nit will have on jobs in my home state of West Virginia. DuPont is in \nthe process of constructing a $20 million revitalization project at \ntheir plant in Belle, West Virginia, and KN001 is the cornerstone of \nthat project. The new investment will enable the production at Belle of \na new sulfonylurea product family that uses KN001 as a feedstock. This \nrevitalization project will preserve 50 existing jobs at Belle and \ncreate over a dozen new jobs.\n  On top of all that, I've been told that this duty suspension is \nunlikely to result in any substantial revenue loss to the U.S. \nTreasury. Because it is used in the manufacture of new products, U.S. \nimports of this chemical are very small, and the resulting duty is also \nsmall. Equally important is the fact that this substance is not \nmanufactured in the United States by another company, so no U.S. \nproducer should be disadvantaged by the duty suspension.

A bill to amend the Alaska National Interest Lands \nConservation Act to more effectively manage visitor service and fishing \nactivity in Glacier Bay National Park, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n         THE GLACIER BAY MANAGEMENT AND PROTECTION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \naddressing several important aspects of the administration and \nmanagement of Glacier Bay National Park, one of the most popular and \nunique tourist destinations in the country.\n  This bill will encourage the continuation of the Park Service's \nongoing efforts to work with concession operators to improve visitor \nservices, as well as deal fairly and finally with a long-standing \ndispute over the status of commercial and subsistence fishing.\n  On the latter subject, this bill reflects the progress of several \nyears of discussions with local interests and the Park Service. These \nefforts have been positive, but have been hampered from achieving \nconsensus by some groups' unwillingness to compromise. Insofar as \npossible, this bill represents an attempt to stake out reasonable and \nresponsible middle ground that respects the wishes of all concerned.\n  Mr. President, commercial fishermen have plied the waters of Glacier \nBay and the outer coast of the area now included in the park for over \n100 years. local native villagers, the Huna Tlingit people, have done \nso for thousands of years. At no time have these activities damaged the \npark or its resources, nor have they harmed the area's wild and scenic \nqualities in any way.\n  This simple fact cannot be overemphasized. To put it another way--\ncommercial fishermen and local villagers have continually fished in \nGlacier Bay since long before it became a park or a monument, and the \nfact that we value it so highly today is proof that they have not had \nan adverse impact on the species of the bay.\n  Unfortunately, some interests don't care about fairness, and would \nlike to see fishing and gathering banned no matter how environmentally \nbenign or how critical to local livelihoods.\n  On subsistence, this bill corrects inconsistencies in the Alaska \nNational Interest Lands Conservation Act [ANILCA] concerning \nsubsistence fishing and gathering in Glacier Bay National Park. \nVillagers living near Glacier Bay, whose ancestors have used the bay \ncontinually for the last 9,000 years, must be allowed to use the bay's \nresources to feed their families --to fish for halibut, salmon, and \ncrabs, and to collect clams, seaweeds, berries, and other foods that \nare traditional in their culture.\n  Let me emphasize that we are talking about a relative handful of \nfamilies from the local Native village of Hoonah, which has a \npopulation of less than 900, and a few people from other nearby \ncommunities such as Elfin Cove, Gustavus, and Pelican. We are not \ntalking about thousands of people. These Alaskans do not have \nconvenient supermarkets. They deserve respect--they deserve to have \ntheir historic use recognized and provided for by this Congress.\n  My bill also addresses commercial fishing in the park. For \ngenerations, commercial fishermen have caught salmon, halibut, and \ncrabs in Glacier Bay and have fished the rich grounds of the outside \ncoast.\n  There is no biological reason for restricting commercial fishing \nactivity anywhere in the park. The fishery resources are healthy, \ndiverse, closely monitored, and carefully regulated. It should also be \nnoted that of the park's approximately 3 million acres of marine \nwaters, only about 500,000 are productive enough to warrant significant \ninterest.\n  These fisheries already are restricted as to method and number of \nparticipants, and are carefully managed to ensure continued abundance. \nThere is nothing in this bill, and there is no desire by the fishing \nindustry, to change these controls or increase the level of this \nsustainable activity. Closely monitored by the State of Alaska, which \nhas proven itself a reliable custodian of the fisheries resources, \ncommercial fishing does not harm the environment in any way.\n  Mr. President, in the grand scheme of this Nation's economy, these \nfisheries are small potatoes. But to the fishermen who depend upon \nthem, to their families, and to the small, remote communities in which \nthey live, these fisheries are of utmost importance. They are harm-\nfree, and those who participate in them deserve their government's \nhelp, not the destruction of their simple lifestyle.\n  This bill authorizes fishing throughout the park. However, because \nthere are special sensitivities inside Glacier Bay itself, it also \ndesignates the waters inside the bay--as opposed to the outer coast--as \na special scientific reserve, for which a joint Federal-State group of \nscientists will make recommendations on where fishing should or should \nnot occur, and at what level.\n  A further special provision is also included in the one area where \nthere is a significant potential for conflict between fishermen and \ncertain nonmotorized uses such as kayaking. This area is the Beardlee \nIslands, near the entrance to the bay. Under this bill, the only \ncommercial fishing that would be allowed in the Beardslees would be \ncrab fishing, and that only by the very small number of people--perhaps \nhalf a dozen--that can show both a significant history of participation \nand significant dependence on that fishery for their livelihoods. This \nprivilege could be transferred to one successor when the original \nfisherman retires, but will cease after that. And at any point, the \nPark Service could eliminate all fishing in the Beardslees with a fair \npayment to the individual fishermen. The\n\n[[Page S8094]]\n\nreason for such a special rule in the Beardslees is simply that these \nfishermen have no other option than fishing in the Beardslees, due to \nthe size of their vessels, their reliance on this one fishery, and \nother factors.\n  This bill will not contribute to any increase in fishing pressure; in \nfact, over time the opposite may occur. It will simply provide for the \nscientifically sound continuation of an environmentally benign \nactivity.\n  In closing, Mr. President, let me add that the continuation of both \nsubsistence and commercial fishing enjoys wide support from local \nresidents, including environmental groups such as the Southeast Alaska \nConservation Council.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord and look forward to my colleagues' support for this measure.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1064\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Glacier Bay Management and \n     Protection Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the geographical area comprising Glacier Bay National \n     Park has been recognized as having important national \n     significance since the creation of Glacier Bay National \n     Monument by Presidential proclamation on February 26, 1925, \n     and the subsequent Presidential proclamation expanding the \n     monument on April 18, 1939;\n       (2) in 1980, Congress enlarged and redesignated the \n     monument as Glacier Bay National Park;\n       (3) the Park provides valuable opportunities for the \n     scientific study of marine and terrestrial resources in \n     various stages of a postglaciation period;\n       (4) the Park is a popular tourist destination for cruise \n     ship and tour boat passengers, recreational boaters, \n     fishermen, back-country kayakers, hikers, and other users;\n       (5) improvements to the Park's infrastructure and an \n     increase in small passenger vessel capacity within the Park \n     are needed to provide for increased enjoyment by visitors to \n     the Park and more efficient management of Park activities;\n       (6) Huna Tlingit Indians residing near Glacier Bay have \n     engaged in subsistence fishing and gathering in and around \n     the bay for approximately 9,000 years, interrupted only by \n     periodic glacial advances, and reestablished after each \n     glacial retreat;\n       (7) commercial fishing has occurred in and around Glacier \n     Bay for over 100 years, long before the area was recognized \n     by the Federal Government;\n       (8) commercial fishing and subsistence fishing and \n     gathering in Glacier Bay National Park occur at stable levels \n     of activity that have no perceivable adverse effect on the \n     health or sustainability of marine resources in the Park, \n     including the marine resources of Glacier Bay;\n       (9) commercial fishing and subsistence fishing and \n     gathering are of great importance to local residents who \n     often lack other alternatives for sustaining their \n     livelihood; and\n       (10) the continuation of commercial fishing and subsistence \n     fishing and gathering in Glacier Bay has widespread support \n     among local residents and Glacier Bay users, including the \n     environmental community and operators of back-country kayak \n     tours.\n\n     SEC. 3.

My bill would allow members of America's \nfarmer-owned cooperatives to passthrough the small producer tax credit \nfor ethanol to cooperative members, who are currently not able to take \nthis credit.\n  Farmer-owned cooperatives are at the heart of America's rural \ncommunities. Cooperatives and cooperative members--family farmers whose \nsurvival and prosperity are essential for our whole country--work hard, \ninvest, and contribute to their communities daily. We owe them their \nfair share of that daily effort, along with a level playing field to \ncompete on with other businesses.\n  I am therefore introducing legislation that will allow the small \nethanol producer credit to pass through to cooperative owners and \nmembers. Farmer-owned cooperatives have invested over $1 billion in \nethanol production and marketing, and more than 857,000 farmers have a \nstake in the continued development and growth of this important \ndomestic value-added industry. Yet, the members of these cooperatives \nare unable to benefit from this tax credit because cooperatives are not \nallowed to passthrough the credit.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. \n        Johnson, Mr. Daschle, and Mr. Conrad):\n  S. 1066.

This situation is extremely unfair--owners of other \nethanol production facilities are able to take advantage of this \nincentive, yet we are denying family farmers their fair share of the \nbenefit. While I strongly support the preservation and extension of the \nethanol tax incentives--vital for this maturing industry--passthrough \nof the small producer credit is a separate issue of fundamental \nfairness for family farmers.\n  I believe all Members can agree that family farmers, who have made a \nsubstantial investment in ethanol production, should be able to take \nadvantage of the same tax benefits that other small business owners who \nproduce ethanol now enjoy. Passthrough of this tax credit is not a \ncorporate subsidy and does not benefit large corporations, but is an \nincentive for America's family farmers to help produce a fuel that \ndecreases our foreign oil dependence, spurs rural development, and \nimproves our Nation's air quality.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill as ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1066\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prohibit United States military assistance and \narms transfers to foreign governments that are undemocratic, do not \nadequately protect human rights, are engaged in acts of armed \naggression, or are not fully participating in the United Nations \nRegister of Conventional Arms; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n           THE CODE OF CONDUCT ON ARMS TRANSFERS ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Code of Conduct \non Arms Transfers Act of 1997, a bill to place restrictions on military \nassistance and arms transfers to governments that are not democratic, \ndo not respect human rights, are engaged in armed aggression, or are \nnot participating in the U.N. Register of Conventional Arms.\n  Before I discuss the specifics of the legislation, I want to take a \nmoment to pay tribute to our former colleague and long-time champion of \nthis effort, Senator Mark Hatfield. During his four terms in the \nSenate, Senator Hatfield developed a reputation as a man committed to \nthe search for peace and a staunch advocate of nonmilitary solutions \nfor international problems. It was natural for Senator Hatfield to take \nthe lead in an effort to make U.S. arms sales policy more reflective of \nAmerican values. He did not succeed in winning passage of a Code of \nConduct, but he placed the issue in front of the Senate and the public, \nand moved the debate forward. I am sure he is gratified to see that the \nHouse of Representatives adopted a version of the Code as an amendment \nto the bill to authorize State Department activities for fiscal year \n1998. I am honored to follow in his footsteps and introduce derivative \nlegislation, the 1997 Code of Conduct Act.\n  The Code of Conduct on Arms Transfers Act embodies a fundamental \nshift in the way that the United States will deal with the transfer of \nconventional weapons to the rest of the world. Like many other aspects \nof our national security structure, arms sales and other military \nassistance must be adjusted to the realities of the post-cold-war era. \nThe central theme of our foreign policy has changed from containment of \ncommunism to expansion of democracy. We no longer need to send massive \namounts of weaponry to our surrogates around the world in an arms race \nagainst communism. Instead we must evaluate the effect that arms \ntransfers have on regional stability, the promotion of democracy and \nthe protection of human rights.\n  Unfortunately, our arms transfer policies have not adjusted to this \nreality. The United States continues to be the primary supplier of arms \nto the world. We ranked first in arms transfer agreements with \ndeveloping nations from 1988 to 1995. In 1995 the United States ranked \nfirst in deliveries to the developing world for the fourth year in row. \nThe United States share of all arms transfers to developing nations \nrose from 11.1 percent in 1988 to 44.1 percent in 1995. In constant \ndollars the United States has increased deliveries to developing \nnations from $5.5 billion in 1988 to $9.5 billion in 1995. It is \ndisturbing to me that an analysis done by the Project \non Demilitarization and Democracy revealed that, of the arms transfers \nto developing nations over a 4-year period, 85 percent went to non-\nDemocratic governments. It is clear that other factors, including \nshort-term economic benefits from sales, dominate the U.S. Government's \ndecision making process concerning arms\n\n[[Page S8097]]\n\nsales and the nature of the recipient regimes appears to be of little \nconsequence.\n\n  The Code of Conduct seeks to elevate the consideration of democracy, \nhuman rights and nonaggression from their current status as policy \nafterthoughts to primary criteria for decisions on arms transfers. A \nquote from a February 17, 1995 press release from the White House \nillustrates--by what it omits--the unfortunate tendency to ignore these \nfactors. The release states, in part: ``The U.S. continues to view \ntransfers of conventional arms as a legitimate instrument of U.S. \nforeign policy--deserving U.S. government support--when they enable us \nto help friends and allies deter aggression, promote regional security, \nand increase interoperability of U.S. forces and allied forces. * * * \nThe U.S. will exercise unilateral restraint in cases where overriding \nnational security or foreign policy interests require us to do so.''\n  The criteria denoted in that statement are, indeed, critical \ncomponents of a sound U.S. policy on arms transfers and should continue \nto be considered as such. But the statement omits what should be the \nvery important consideration of the effects arms transfers are likely \nto have on democratization, nonaggression, and human rights. The U.S. \nis the largest exporter of weapons to developing nations and we must \nlearn to exercise unilateral restraint not just for national security \nand foreign policy interests, but also for the furtherance of democracy \nand human rights.\n  By exercising restraint, we cannot only further our foreign policy \ngoal of fostering democracy, but also enhance our security as well. The \nJune 1996 Report of the Presidential Advisory Board on Arms \nProliferation Policy concluded that U.S. and international security are \nthreatened by the proliferation of advanced conventional weapons. \nAccording to the Report, ``The world struggles today with the \nimplications of advanced conventional weapons. It will in the future be \nconfronted with yet another generation of weapons, whose destructive \npower, size, cost, and availability can raise many more problems even \nthan their predecessors today. These challenges will require a new \nculture among nations, one that accepts increased responsibility for \ncontrol and restraint, despite short-term economic and political \nfactors pulling in other directions.'' The Code of Conduct is a step \ntoward that new culture.\n\n  The bill I am introducing today differs from past versions of the \nCode of Conduct in two significant ways. Most importantly, the language \nno longer requires that Congress pass legislation to accept a \nPresidential waiver for countries that do not meet the criteria. Under \nprevious versions of the legislation, the President was required to \nsubmit to Congress an annual list of countries determined to meet the \ncriteria for human rights, democracy, and non-aggression. For countries \nthat failed to meet this threshold, the President could have requested \na national security waiver, but the Congress would have had to enact \nthe waiver through legislation. In my judgment, this approach made \ngranting a waiver pass a very stiff test. Consequently, this provision \nwas a major impediment to passage of the Code. Under the terms of the \nbill being introduced today, the President will still submit the annual \nlist of countries that meet the criteria, but a Presidential request \nfor a national security waiver does not require further action by the \nCongress. Congress could, of course, disapprove the waiver through the \nnormal legislative process, but that likely would require overriding a \nPresidential veto. The design of the waiver process in the bill I am \nintroducing is the same as that passed by the House.\n  The second difference from past versions of the Code is the inclusion \nof a section to promote an international arms transfer regime. We are \nfar and away the world's biggest arms merchant and we must lead the way \nfor the rest of the world in addressing this issue. But the United \nStates cannot do this alone. We should not deceive ourselves regarding \nthe ability or willingness of other arms-producing nations to rush in \nand fill any gap we create. Russia, France, China, and other nations \nall have the potential to provide weapons the United States and its \nmanufacturers will not provide. My legislation will require the \nPresident to expand international efforts to curb worldwide arms sales \nand to work toward establishing a multilateral regime to govern the \ntransfer of conventional arms. It requires the President to notify \nallied governments when the United States determines a nation is \nineligible under the Code for arms transfers, and request that our \nallies join the United States in refusing to transfer arms to that \nnation. The bill also requires the President to report annually to the \nCongress on steps he is taking to gain international acceptance of the \nprinciples incorporated in this legislation and on the progress he is \nmaking toward establishing a permanent multilateral structure for \ncontrolling arms transfers.\n\n  If some of my colleagues view this effort as naive in a rough and \ntumble world, I call their attention to a commentary editorial in the \nJune 16, 1997, issue of Defense News which endorses the Arms Trade Code \nof Conduct as passed by the House of Representatives. The editors \nconcluded that the Code ``would create a useful tool to shine light on \nsome nations' darkest human rights and other unsavory secrets.'' The \neffort to establish an international Code of Conduct has won the \nsupport of former Costa Rican President Oscar Arias and a dozen of his \nfellow Nobel Peace laureates. Similar legislation has been introduced \nin the European Union and several of its member nations, and the new \ngovernment in the United Kingdom has expressed support for the concept.\n  The United States should lead the way and stop selling arms to \nnations that ignore the rights and needs of their citizens that use \nthose arms to bully their neighbors or their own populations. We should \nlead the way to establishment of a multilateral regime that will \neffectively prevent such nations from obtaining arms with which to \nenforce and administer nefarious activities. This legislation, and the \nsimilar legislation already passed by the House of Representatives, can \nbe the vehicle to accomplish this objective.\n  I want to thank Senator Dorgan, who previously has offered a Code of \nConduct provision as an amendment to other legislation, for joining as \na cosponsor today, along with Senators Feingold, Leahy, Moseley-Braun, \nWellstone, Landrieu, Kennedy, and Harkin.\n  With their support, and the support of other Senators whose support I \nam confident will be forthcoming, I am hopeful that we will see the \nCongress enact and the President sign into law this year legislation \nthat will ensure that the values of democratization, human rights, and \nnonaggression--which are so important to our Nation and so often lauded \nand referenced by elected officials from both parties--will be legally \nestablished as criteria for arms sales and transfers to other nations \nby the United States.\n  I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be printed following my \nremarks.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1067\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE EXEMPLARY SERVICE \n                   OF JOHN H. R. BERG TO THE UNITED STATES\n\n       Whereas, John H. R.

SENSE OF THE SENATE WITH RESPECT TO SLAMMING.\n\n       (a) Statement of Purpose.--The purposes of this statement \n     of the sense of the Senate are to--\n       (1) protect consumers from the fraudulent transfer of their \n     phone service provider;\n       (2) allow the efficient prosecution of phone service \n     providers who defraud consumers; and\n       (3) encourage an environment in which consumers can readily \n     select the telephone service provider which best serves them.\n\n[[Page S8104]]\n\n       (b) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) As the telecommunications industry has moved toward \n     competition in the long distance market, consumers have \n     increasingly elected to change the company which provides \n     their long-distance phone service. As many as fifty million \n     consumers now change their long distance provider annually.\n       (2) The fluid nature of the long distance market has also \n     allowed an increasing number of fraudulent transfers to \n     occur. Such transfers have been termed ``slamming'', which \n     constitutes any practice that changes a consumer's long \n     distance carrier without the consumer's knowledge or consent.\n       (3) Slamming is now the largest single consumer complaint \n     received by the Common Carrier Bureau of the Federal \n     Communications Commission. As many as one million consumers \n     are fraudulently transferred annually to a telephone consumer \n     which they have not chosen.\n       (4) The increased costs which consumers face as a result of \n     these fraudulent switches threaten to rob consumers of the \n     financial benefits created by a competitive marketplace.\n       (5) The Telecommunications Act of 1996 sought to combat \n     this problem by directing that any revenues generated by a \n     fraudulent transfer by payable to the company which the \n     consumer has expressly chosen, not the fraudulent transferor.\n       (6) While the Federal Communications Commission has \n     proposed and promulgated regulations on this subject, the \n     Commission has not been able to effectively deter the \n     practice of slamming due to a lack of prosecutorial resources \n     as well as the difficulty of proving that a provider failed \n     to obtain the consent of a consumer prior to acquiring that \n     consumer as a new customer. Commission action to date has not \n     adequately protected consumers.\n       (7) The majority of consumers who have been fraudulently \n     denied the services of their chosen phone service vendor do \n     not turn to the Federal Communications Commission for \n     assistance. Indeed, section 258 of the Communications Act of \n     1934 directs that State commissions shall be able to enforce \n     regulations mandating that the consent of a consumer be \n     obtained prior to a switch of service.\n       (8) It is essential that Congress provide the consumer, \n     local carriers, law enforcement, and consumer agencies with \n     the ability to efficiently and effectively persecute those \n     companies which slam consumers, thus providing a deterrent to \n     all other firms which provide phone services.\n       (c) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Federal Communications Commission should, within 12 \n     months of the date of enactment of this Act, promulgate \n     regulations, consistent with the Communications Act of 1934 \n     which provide law enforcement officials dispositive evidence \n     for use in the prosecution of fraudulent transfers of \n     presubscribed customers of long distance and local service; \n     and\n       (2) the Senate should examine the issue of slamming and \n     take appropriate legislative action in the 105th Congress to \n     better protect consumers from unscrupulous practices \n     including, but not limited to, mandating the recording and \n     maintenance of evidence concerning the consent of the \n     consumer to switch phone vendors, establishing higher civil \n     fines for violations, and establishing a civil right of \n     action against fraudulent providers, as well as criminal \n     sanctions for repeated and willful instances of slamming.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        ROBB AMENDMENT NO. 1009\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS (for Mr. Robb) proposed an amendment to the bill, S. \n1022, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 65, line 10, insert the following:\n       ``Sec. 120.

Mr. President, I rise to commend the members of the \nSubcommittee on VA/HUD Appropriations for their work to provide \nadequate benefits to veterans. In a letter to the Chairman, I urged the \nsubcommittee to support a level of spending that adequately funded \nveterans' benefits in rightful recognition of their efforts to defend \nour country in war. I am pleased to learn that the VA will get a full \nappropriation which shows a total budget increase of $222.6 million \nabove last year and $92.9 million above the President's request.\n  I also applaud their foresight in voting $68 million additional \nfunding over the President's request for the medical care account. The \nhigh priority which the subcommittee placed on this area reflects the \nheightened concern the country feels for providing appropriate health \ncare to those who have served us so well.\n  The mandatory spending has also been increased by $1.26 billion over \nlast year for pensions and compensation.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that the subcommittee has included a \nprovision which will allow the VA to retain third-party collections, \nwhich I have long supported, in addition to the regular appropriation. \nThis additional estimated $604 million will be retained by the VA \nmedical centers giving the care. This will provide much needed \nadditional revenue which should allow the centers to treat more \nveterans. It will also provide an incentive to improve health care for \nmore veterans at each of the 171 facilities throughout the country.\n  The committee report supports the restructuring efforts of the \nVeterans Health Administration; I will be interested to see the results \nof this effort over the next 5 years as this, too, will improve health \ncare for our veterans. I also share the subcommittee's concerns that \nthe VA has yet to develop a nationwide plan for community-based \noutpatient clinics to ensure equitable access to medical care \nnationwide. We will be seeing great changes at the VA in the next few \nyears that will make it a more streamlined and improved provider of \nservices to veterans.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee for \ntheir efforts to help America's veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/24/senate-section/article/S8106-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8106-S8107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            PROGRESS FOR WOMEN'S ATHLETICS IN WEST VIRGINIA\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I want to reflect on the \npositive results of our country's growing commitment to equal \nopportunities for women in college sports and to the elimination of \ndiscrimination in our Nation's educational programs. During this time \nof commemorating the 25th anniversary of title IX, Americans recognize \nthe success of our Nation's athletes as they continue to grow both on \nthe field and in the classroom.\n  I take this opportunity to commend the achievement of women in \ncollege and university sports and to support their advancement in the \nathletic world. Expanded opportunities for women as a result of title \nIX have enabled more young women from all arenas to challenge \nthemselves and each other, develop the competitive spirit, and truly \nenrich their academic lives.\n  In West Virginia, title IX's impact on college and university sports \nis made clear by the success of their women's athletic programs. It \npleases me to see the competitive spirit grow within West Virginia and \nto include the aspirations of our daughters as well as our sons. I am \nproud to commend our individual athletes who deserve praise for their \nconstant and persistent efforts.\n  Over the past years, West Virginia's fine institutions that include, \nto cite just one example, Bluefield State College, in Bluefield, WV, \nhave given scholarship money that significantly increased participation \nin women's athletics. Alderson-Broaddus College in Phillipi, WV, in \nthis past year alone has had an award-winning WVIAC women's softball \nteam, with players like Laura Granger, who balances a competitive \nsports schedule, her honors GPA, and her enrollment in a difficult \nsports medicine program.\n  At the University of Charleston [UC], the Golden Eagles Volleyball \nTeam complied an impressive 29-4 record in 1996 and continues to strive \ntoward success. UC's basketball team is also on the high rise with \nathletes like Jodie Prenger, who plays Division II basketball and \nspends the rest of her time devoted to academics.\n  With a devotion to the team and to their own growth as individuals, \nthese women athletes will provide role models for our future daughters. \nI can see how perseverence learned in athletics contributes to the \nacademic lives of these high-achieving students.\n  I am pleased to hear of the progress we as a State have made by \nsupporting greater opportunities for women in sports, and I want to \ncontinue to honor\n\n[[Page S8107]]\n\nsuch dedication on the parts of our athletes and school administrators \nwho prize and promote such equality. As the struggle to root out \ndiscrimination from all realms of life continues, I am very proud to \nsay West Virginia is a strong part of the extraordinary progress that \nAmerica is celebrating during title IX's anniversary year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/24/senate-section/article/S8106-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                EMERITUS LAW PROFESSOR J. WILLARD HURST\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, last month, this Nation lost one \nof its most distinguished scholars when J. Willard Hurst, Emeritus \nProfessor of Law at the University of Wisconsin, died at his home. He \nwas 86.\n  Professor Hurst was that wonderful and rare combination of truly \ngifted scholar and great teacher. Indeed, his scholarship was so \nprofound, it was responsible for the creation of a new field of study, \nand today Willard Hurst is widely recognized as the Founding Father of \nAmerican legal history.\n  Hurst was born in Rockford, IL in 1910. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa \nfrom Williams College in 1932 and went on to Harvard Law School, where \nhe graduated at the top of his class in 1935.\n  Hurst worked as a research fellow for Prof. Felix Frankfurter, who \nwas later named to the U.S. Supreme Court, and clerked for Supreme \nCourt Justice Louis D. Brandeis before heading to Wisconsin, at \nBrandeis's suggestion, where he joined the University of Wisconsin law \nschool faculty.\n  When Hurst first joined the law school faculty, Dean Lloyd Garrison \nencouraged him to design a program in law and society that investigated \nhow the State's legal system and economy related to each other. Hurst \nbegan that project by studying the law's impact on the State's lumber \nindustry, research that would result in his seminal work, ``Law and \nEconomic Growth: The Legal History of the Wisconsin Lumber Industry.'' \nThat landmark study chronicled the social and economic forces that \nshaped and used the laws of property, contracts, accident compensation, \nand other legal areas to destroy the greatest natural stand of timber \nin the world between 1830 and 1900.\n  That work was a classic application of the new scholarly discipline \nof American legal history, a discipline Hurst himself had created--his \ngreat legacy and a field he dominated directly or indirectly even in \nretirement. As Lawrence M. Friedman of Stanford Law School was quoted \nas saying of legal historians, ``You're either a Hurstian or a revisor \nof Hurst.''\n  In a 1990 article in the New York Times about Professor Hurst, David \nMargolick wrote of the state of the study of law when Hurst attended \nlaw school. ``The law was a self-contained science and the law library \nits laboratory,'' Margolick reported. ``One need not study how law \nactually affected people or how legal institutions evolved; all wisdom \ncould be gleaned from appellate decisions. This approach not only gave \nlaw professors a shot at omniscience but also spared them from having \nto learn other disciplines, set foot in a courtroom or state \nlegislature, or even step outside.'' As Margolick added, from the \nmoment he arrived at the University of Wisconsin Law School, Professor \nHurst changed all that.\n\n  University of Wisconsin Emeritus Law Professor Bill Foster said Hurst \nforced people to think of problems separate from the law in an historic \nsense and think about the economic, social and political consequences. \n``He trained us to see around corners.'' As Stanford Professor Hendrik \nHartog noted, Hurst's interest in the relationship between the law and \nsocial sciences, especially economics, was really a study of how law \nwas experienced by people.\n  That approach to studying law found a nurturing home at the \nUniversity of Wisconsin, which was heavily influenced by the so-called \nWisconsin Idea, the Progressive Era philosophy which encouraged \nscholars to view the entire State as their campus, and which envisioned \nacademics as a vital resource for reform-minded government.\n  Willard Hurst and Wisconsin were a perfect match. Hurst loved \nWisconsin. On three occasions he turned down offers to be Dean of the \nYale Law School. He also turned down the offer of a chair at Harvard. \nHurst said, ``I guess I was just too pleasure-loving. I was having too \ngood a time in Wisconsin.''\n  At Wisconsin, Hurst was a prolific writer, contributing to law \nreviews, writing articles, and authoring over a dozen books, including \n``The Law Makers'' (1950), ``Law and Conditions of Freedom'' (1956), \n``Law and Social Process in U.S. History'' (1960), ``Justice Holmes on \nLegal History'' (1964), and ``A Legal History of Money in the United \nStates'' (1973).\n  Hurst was more than a great original thinker. He was an enormously \ntalented and caring teacher. Robben Fleming, former president of the \nUniversity of Michigan and former Chancellor of the University of \nWisconsin, said that Hurst was the finest teacher he ever had. \nUniversity of Wisconsin Law Professor Stewart Macaulay said Hurst was \nwonderfully generous. ``What Willard would do is go out to lunch with \nsomeone who was an absolute beginner. He would give you time, make \nincredible suggestions, make contacts for you.''\n  Willard Hurst continued to be an academic force in retirement with a \nsteady flow of research and writing. As Margolick reported in the \nTimes, even in retirement Hurst remained one of the few legal scholars \nwhose work could be ``measured in shelf feet--and shelf feet of bona \nfide research rather than cut-and-paste cases and comments.''\n  A number of his books became standard texts for law students. In \nfact, I still remember of the five books I was asked to read before I \nentered Harvard Law School, two were written by Willard Hurst.\n  As the acknowledged grandfather of American legal history, Hurst's \nlegacy is not only a new field of study, but generations of law \nstudents, and dozens of distinguished scholars. Willard Hurst was a \ngiant intellect, but a gentle giant who cared about his students and \nwho loved his adopted State. I was privileged to have known \nhim.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/24/senate-section/article/S8107-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CHANGE OF CLOTURE MOTION SIGNATORIES\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

HAMRE FOR DEPUTY SECRETARY OF \n                                DEFENSE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it is a distinct pleasure for me to \nconvey to the entire Senate what I communicated to the Senate Armed \nServices Committee earlier today--I am an enthusiastic supporter of \nJohn Hamre for Deputy Secretary of Defense. I am pleased to note that \nthe committee reported out his nomination unanimously. Evidently they, \nlike many of their colleagues, are already well aware of John's \nexceptional background and skills, and his impressive record. \nTherefore, I will not belabor these points--except to say that I think \nthey make John an excellent choice for this critically important post.\n  Less known to some of my colleagues perhaps is the fact that John is \nfrom South Dakota, my home State. In fact, John was born in the tiny \ntown of Willow Lake, South Dakota and grew up in Clark, SD. His rise to \nthe No. 2 civilian position in the world's number one military force is \na tribute not only to John and his family, but to the entire state of \nSouth Dakota and its people.\n  Like many of the families in our state, John's family's story reads \nlike a Charles Kuralt profile of small-town America. His maternal \ngrandfather was a Lutheran preacher who lived to be 100 years old \n(which should eliminate any chance of John having to take an early \nretirement). His paternal grandfather was a farmer and county sheriff. \nOne of John's uncles, Julian, was killed in action as an aviator in the \nPacific during World War II. John's father, Mel, was a banker and his \nmother, Ruth, was a teacher. They have lived in Clark all their adult \nlives. If you happen to visit Clark on a Sunday morning, chances are \nyou would hear them performing with their church choir.\n  John graduated with a degree in political science from Augustana \nCollege in Sioux Falls, SD. After that, he did what every political \nscientist does: headed off to Harvard to earn a masters degree in \nDivinity. It was the first time he had ever really been away from South \nDakota. From Harvard, John went on to earn a masters degree and \ndoctorate degree in 1978 from the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced \nInternational Studies. I would just note parenthetically: If John is \nconfirmed, he may be the first Deputy Secretary of Defense who can say \nthe Lord's Prayer--in Russian.\n  After graduate school, John joined the staff of the Congressional \nBudget Office [CBO]. In 1984, he joined the staff of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, where he developed a reputation for being able to \nwork closely with both sides of the aisle.\n  John was appointed Undersecretary of Defense--comptroller by former \nDefense Secretary Les Aspin. In his new position, John will be the \nsecond highest-ranking civilian in the Pentagon's\n\n[[Page S8109]]\n\nchain of command. The Deputy Secretary of Defense is one of the most \ncritical national security positions in the U.S. Government. He or she \nis given full power and authority to act for the secretary of Defense \nin the secretary's absence.\n  As a indication of the trust and confidence Secretary Cohen has in \nJohn's talents, he recently asked John to head up the Defense \nManagement Reform Task Force--perhaps the most critical study the \nPentagon will undertake in the next decade or so. If our available \ndefense resources are to match our proclaimed defense policies for the \n21st century, it is crucial that the Pentagon adopt more efficient \nbusiness methods. The task force John will head is charged with the \nresponsibility of overhauling the Defense Department's accounting \nmethods and streamlining its business practices. Such reforms are long \noverdue and much needed if we are to get a dollar of defense for each \ndollar we provide the Pentagon. On behalf of the Congress, I wish John \nwell in this endeavor and will be closely following his progress.\n  Anyone who has spent any time with John Hamre knows his passion for \ndefense policy. From his days at CBO in the late 1970's to his present \nposition at the Department of Defense, he has demonstrated time and \nagain his mastery of defense policy issues. Throughout his career, Dr. \nHamre has consistently demonstrated an even-handedness and objectivity. \nThat has allowed him, in turn, to establish and maintain good relations \nwith members of the Congress. The regard in which he is held by both \nparties will enable him to serve the President well. Even more \nimportantly, it will enable him to serve his country well.\n  In conclusion, it is an honor and a privilege to commend a true South \nDakotan, a man who has dedicated his life to integrity, love of his \ncountry and outstanding achievement, and who will serve his country \nwell as Deputy Secretary of Defense.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to announce my \nsupport for Mr. John J. Hamre's nomination to be the next Deputy \nSecretary of Defense.\n  Mr. President, my support in favor of the Hamre nomination may come \nas a surprise to some of my colleagues.\n  A yes vote on the Hamre nomination may appear to be totally \ninconsistent with all that I have said here on the floor about the \nnominee.\n  I have made a series of critical speeches about Mr. Hamre since \nJanuary.\n  I have criticized Mr. Hamre for failing to control the money and make \nsure it is spent according to law.\n  I have attempted to hold him accountable.\n  In my book, accountability in government should be a top priority.\n  My criticism of Mr. Hamre boils down to one main problem area.\n  As Chief Financial Officer at the Department of Defense [DOD], Mr. \nHamre pursued a policy on progress payments that the Inspector General \n[IG] had declared illegal.\n  The General Accounting Office [GAO] has just completed another review \nof the Department's progress payment policy.\n  As of July 21, 1997, the GAO report indicates that the policy \ndeclared illegal by the IG remains in operation.\n  It remains in operation today--at this very moment.\n  Mr. President, I am happy to report that Mr. Hamre has promised to \nchange the policy.\n  He has made a commitment to bring the Department's progress payment \npolicy into compliance with the law.\n  This happened at an important meeting on Tuesday evening, July 22d.\n  The meeting took place in the office of Senator Strom Thurmond, \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee.\n  This meeting was attended by Senators Thurmond, Levin, Warner, and \nthe Senator from Iowa.\n  The nominee, Mr. Hamre, was also present.\n  Mr. President, I don't quite know how this meeting came about, but I \nsuspect that my good friend from Virginia, Senator Warner, was the \nmotivating force behind it.\n  I would like to extend a special word of thanks to my friend from \nVirginia for helping me out.\n  He helped me find a reasonable solution to a very difficult dilemma.\n  The Senator from Virginia was instrumental in resolving the dispute.\n  At this important meeting, Mr. Hamre made a commitment to bring the \ndepartment's progress payment policy into compliance with the law.\n  To do that, the IG says DOD has taken two distinct steps.\n  Step One: The Director of Defense Procurement, Ms. Eleanor Spector, \nis issuing a new contract regulation--known as a DFAR.\n  The DFAR will authorize contracting officers--or ACO's--to require \nthat each contract contains specific funding instructions.\n  These would be fund citations.\n  Step Two: The Comptroller, Mr. Hamre, has ordered the Defense Finance \nand Accounting Service or DFAS to shut down the current operation.\n  DFAS must issue payment instructions that match up with the DFAR.\n  This would allow DFAS to match the money with the work performed--as \nrequired by law.\n  This would allow the disbursing officers to post payments to the \ncorrect accounts.\n  Since DOD makes about $20 billion a year in progress payments, this \nshould help to clean up the books.\n  It should cut down on overpayments and erroneous payments.\n  It should cut down on costly reconciliation work done by the big \naccounting firms like Coopers & Lybrand.\n  The new policy should save money.\n  But the fix won't happen overnight.\n  It will take time to phase down the old system and get the new policy \nup and running.\n  The IG is planning on a kick off date of October 1, 1997.\n  At the meeting, Senator Levin raised questions about the cost of the \nnew policy.\n  Mr. Hamre responded by saying that he would have to add 50 people to \nthe DFAS work force.\n  The extra people would be needed to manually process the payments \nunder the new policy.\n  The software necessary to support automated computer processing will \nnot be available until the year 2000 or beyond, according to Mr. Hamre.\n  Now, Mr. President, that sounds like more Pentagon nonsense to me.\n  Businesses, like NationsBank, routinely conduct 15.5 million \ncomparable matching operations in a single day--using computers.\n  The software is here--now!\n  This is off-the-shelf stuff--not leading edge technology.\n  DFAS needs to get on the stick.\n  Senator Levin also insisted that the new policy should apply just to \nnew contracts--and not be retroactive.\n  That makes sense to me.\n  Senator Levin raised one other very valid concern.\n  He said: ``Maybe we need to change the law? Maybe the law governing \nthese payments doesn't make sense?''\n  These are valid questions. They need to be explored.\n  But I would like to offer a word of caution on this point.\n  If Congress should decide to change the law--as Mr. Hamre proposed \nlate last year, Congress must then change the way the money is \nappropriated.\n  We must never allow DOD to merge the appropriations at the contract \nlevel, while Congress continues to appropriate and segregate money in \nspecial accounts.\n  That would subvert the whole appropriations process.\n  If DOD were authorized to merge the money at the contract level, then \nCongress would have to consolidate accounts upstream in appropriations.\n  We might, for example, create an acquisition account by merging R \nand procurement money in one big account.\n  Quite frankly, Mr. President, I don't think that idea would be a very \npopular around here.\n  Segregating the money in the R and procurement accounts gives \nCongress some broad and general control over how the money is used--as \nintended by the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, I left the meeting in Sentor Thurmond's office \nbelieving that something important had been accomplished.\n  First, Mr. Hamre made a commitment to bring the Department's policy \ninto compliance with the law.\n  Second, it was agreed that the IG would send a letter to the \ncommittee.\n  This letter would serve two purposes.\n  The IG would certify that the Department had taken the two steps \nnecessary to bring the policy into compliance with the law.\n\n[[Page S8110]]\n\n  And the IG would agree to provide Congress with periodic follow-up \nreports to ensure that the new policy is, in fact, executed.\n  Mr. President, I have the IG's letter here in my hand.\n  It provides the assurances I sought.\n  With those assurances in hand, I can support the Hamre nomination \nwith a clear conscience.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my letter requesting certification by \nthe IG and the IG's response be printed in the Record.\n                                                Inspector General,\n\n\n                                        Department of Defense,\n\n                                     Arlington, VA, July 23, 1997.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This is in response to your request for \n     my views as to whether the Department of Defense has made a \n     good faith effort to address previous audit findings on \n     progress payments to contractors and whether the Department \n     has established a reasonable schedule to implement the \n     changes needed to bring progress payment practices into \n     compliance with fiscal law.\n       On June 30, 1997, the Director, Defense Procurement, issued \n     the requisite contracting guidance in draft form for comment. \n     While we cannot prejudge or speculate as to the outcome of \n     the comment period, I can tell you that at this time this \n     office concurs with the draft guidance as written. The \n     guidance should be issued in final form by October 1, 1997.\n       The first elements of the necessary guidance for paying \n     offices, two Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) \n     memoranda, were signed out today. Given current statutory \n     requirements, we believe that the procedures and timelines \n     outlined in those memoranda are appropriate at this time and \n     demonstrate positive movement toward fixing this longstanding \n     problem. Between now and the planned October 1, 1997, \n     implementation date for the new progress payment distribution \n     policy, we will work with the Comptroller and the Defense \n     Finance and Accounting Service to ensure that sound desk \n     procedures are developed for the paying offices.\n       This office is already auditing various aspects of DoD \n     vendor payment operations and will ensure that coverage of \n     the implementation of the new progress payment procedures \n     receives high priority. We will provide periodic status \n     reports to the Department and the Congress starting in \n     January 1998.\n       Thank you for seeking our views on this important issue. If \n     we can be of further assistance in this matter, please \n     contact me or Mr. Robert J. Lieberman, Assistant Inspector \n     General for Auditing, at (703) 604-8900.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Eleanor Hill,\n     Inspector General.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 21, 1997.\n     Hon. John W. Warner,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear John: I am writing to clarify my position on the \n     nomination of Mr. John J. Hamre to be Deputy Secretary of \n     Defense.\n       My opposition to Mr. Hamre's nomination boils down to one \n     main problem area. As Chief Financial Officer at the \n     Department of Defense, Mr. Hamre aggressively pursued a \n     policy on progress payments that the Inspector General (IG) \n     declared illegal. The General Accounting Office has just \n     completed a review of the department's progress payment \n     policy. This report clearly indicates that the policy \n     declared illegal by the Inspector General remains in \n     operation today--at this very moment.\n       John, that's the bad news. There is some good news, \n     however.\n       I can see a solution looming up on the horizon.\n       The IG is telling me that Mr. Hamre is moving to bring the \n     policy into compliance with the law. The IG says that the \n     department must issue: 1) new contract (DFAR) regulations; \n     and 2) The Defense Finance and Accounting Service must issue \n     new payment instructions to match the DFAR regulations. The \n     IG says the new policy directives are in the process of being \n     issued. The new policy must then be put into practice.\n       John, I will not oppose the Hamre nomination if two \n     conditions are met: 1) The IG certifies in writing that the \n     department has taken the two steps necessary to bring the \n     policy into compliance with the law; and 2) The IG provides \n     Congress with periodic reports to ensure that the new policy \n     is, in fact, being executed.\n       Your assistance in this matter is appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles E. Grassley,\n     U.S. Senator\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 24, 1997.\n     Senator Charles E. Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Chuck: Enclosed is a copy of a letter from the \n     Department of Defense Inspector General received today by the \n     Committee on Armed Services. The letter addresses the \n     concerns that you expressed in the meeting in my office on \n     July 22.\n       With kindest regards and best wishes,\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Strom Thurmond,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I only hope Mr. Hamre understands my \nposition on this issue.\n  From day one, I have merely tried to hold him accountable for the \nimproper progress payment policy.\n  I do my best to watchdog the Pentagon.\n  And when the IG tells me something is wrong, then I'm going to speak \nout. I'm going to dig and bore in--until things are right.\n  That's what I did in this case.\n  I believe that together we have crafted a constructive solution to \nthis problem.\n  I thank the committee for its leadership and for helping me resolve \nthis issue.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I strongly support the nomination of Dr. \nJohn Hamre to be Deputy Secretary of Defense. The position of the \nDeputy Secretary of Defense is one of the most important members of the \nSecretary of Defense's team. The Deputy serves as the Secretary's alter \nego; he traditionally exercises primary responsibility for the internal \nmanagement of the Department of Defense; and he acts for the Secretary \nwhen the Secretary is absent.\n  Those are all very important responsibilities. The decisions that \nSecretary Cohen and his deputy make will have a major impact on the \nsecurity of our Nation, on the protection of our national interests, \nand on the well-being of the men and women of our Armed Forces. I have \ncomplete confidence in John Hamre's ability to perform these important \nresponsibilities.\n  John is, of course, very well known to many Members of the Senate \nfrom the 8 years he spent on the staff of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. Since leaving the committee staff in 1993, John has moved on \nto serve as the Comptroller and Chief Financial Officer of the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  In this capacity, John has devoted a tremendous amount of time and \nenergy to bringing about meaningful and much-needed reform in financial \nmanagement within DOD. John would be the first to acknowledge that the \njob is far from finished, but the progress under his leadership has \nbeen substantial in my view. For example:\n  DOD is in the process of consolidating its accounting offices, moving \nfrom 333 offices to only 21 in less than 5 years. DOD had closed 230 \naccounting offices through fiscal year 1996 and is scheduled to close \nan additional 103 in fiscal year 1997 and fiscal year 1998.\n  As a result, DOD has been able to reduce employment at the Defense \nFinance and Accounting Service [DFAS] from more than 31,000 in fiscal \nyear 1993 to 24,000 today. DFAS operating costs have dropped 25 percent \nin 4 years, from $1.6 billion in fiscal year 1993 to $1.2 billion in \nfiscal year 1997, in constant fiscal year 1993 dollars.\n  DOD has consolidated its civilian pay systems from 25 systems in \nfiscal year 1991 to 2 systems today and hopes to be down to a single \nsystem next year. The system that DOD has designated to take over all \ncivilian pay accounts has gone from handling 15 percent of DOD accounts \nin fiscal year 1992 to a projected 73 percent in fiscal year 1996 and \n83 percent in fiscal year 1997.\n  DOD has consolidated its military pay systems from 24 systems in \nfiscal year 1991 to 4 systems today and hopes to be down to 2 systems \nnext year, with only the Marine Corps maintaining a separate system. \nThe system that DOD has designated to take over all military pay \naccounts has gone from handling 15 percent of DOD accounts, other than \nMarine Corps accounts, in fiscal year 1991 to a projected 65 percent in \nfiscal year 1996 and 90 percent in fiscal year 1997.\n  DOD contract overpayments have dropped from $592 million in fiscal \nyear 1993 to $184 million in fiscal year 1996.\n  The two most significant categories of problem disbursements--\nunmatched disbursements and negative unliquidated obligations [NULO]--\nhave dropped from $34.3 billion in June 1993 to $7.9 billion in January \n1997. Unmatched disbursements are cases in which a payment has been \nmade, but cannot be matched to its obligation authority; NULO's are \ncases in which too much money is disbursed, for example, contractor \noverpayments, or the wrong obligation has been charged.\n\n[[Page S8111]]\n\n  The third category of problem disbursements--in-transit \ndisbursements--has increased recently, but is still down substantially \nover the long run, from $16.8 billion in June 1993 to $11.1 billion in \nJanuary 1997. In-transit disbursements are cases in which a payment has \nbeen made, but the obligation has not yet been matched to its \nobligation authority, and more than 180 days have passed.\n  Over the last several months, a number of statements have been made \nabout Dr. Hamre's handling of progress payments under complex contracts \nusing money from more than one appropriation. While there is no \nevidence that the existing progress payment system has ever resulted in \na violation of the Antideficiency Act, Dr. Hamre has acknowledged that \nthis system is incapable of meeting all applicable requirements, and he \nhas been working hard to address the problem.\n  On Wednesday afternoon, I received a letter from Eleanor Hill--the \ninspector general of the Department of Defense--who first identified \nthe progress payment issue. In response to a joint request from the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee and myself, Ms. Hill reviewed \nthe steps taken by Dr. Hamre to address the progress payment issue. Her \nletter concludes:\n\n       Given current statutory requirements, we believe that the \n     procedures and timelines outlined in those memoranda are \n     appropriate at this time and demonstrate positive movement \n     toward fixing this longstanding problem.\n\n  I am pleased that Dr. Hamre has taken the actions necessary to \naddress the progress payment issue in compliance with existing \nrequirements. But we also need to make sure that these changes are in \nthe best interest of the taxpayers and the Department of Defense. I \nhave asked Dr. Hamre to review the issue and let the Armed Services \nCommittee know if any legislative changes may be needed in this regard.\n  Mr. President, I think President Clinton and Secretary Cohen have \nmade an excellent choice with this nomination. I strongly support John \nHamre's nomination to be Deputy Secretary of Defense, Mr. Chairman, and \nI look forward to working closely with him and Secretary Cohen in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Ms. Hill's letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n       There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be \n     printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                                Inspector General,\n\n\n                                        Department of Defense,\n\n                                     Arlington, VA, July 23, 1997.\n     Hon.
