Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue that \nwas brought up on this floor yesterday by my friend, the senior Senator \nfrom Montana, Senator Baucus, who proceeded to give us certain views on \na number of amendments to the Interior appropriations bill that he \nproposed be stripped from that particular package.\n  Mr. President, I think it is appropriate that this body have an \nopportunity to view the arguments on the other side of the issues, and \nI think it is fair to perhaps provide a little history on what these \namendments are and the rationale associated with the arguments for or \nagainst their merits.\n  There were originally nine proposed amendments in the Baucus package. \nTwo of them have been removed. So we are addressing amendments to strip \nthe Glacier Bay language, King Cove language, and the Tongass language, \nroad decommissioning, section 321 of the forest planning, the issue of \nthe reintroduction of grizzlies in Idaho and Montana, and the Columbia \nand Snake River Dams, and the likely removal. I am going to enunciate a \nlittle further on these as I go along, but I wanted to give you a view \nof the issues in their\n\n[[Page S11136]]\n\nentirety so that we can, first of all, recognize that these have \ncertain environmental overtones.\n  I think it is appropriate that we recognize the extent to which the \nenvironmental community has gone to encourage these be stricken. \nApproximately 2 weeks ago, there was a press conference downtown in one \nof the restaurants where the media was invited. There was a \npresentation condemning these issues, and obviously an effort to try to \ngenerate a one-sided view from the media.\n  As chairman of the Energy Committee, and representing the State of \nAlaska, to which three of these particular amendments to strike are \nassociated, and not having an opportunity to have an invitation \nextended to me, we felt it necessary to balance the process at that \npoint. So we proceeded with a small press conference in the Energy \nLibrary. We invited basically the same media. We had a good attendance. \nI also invited my friend from Montana to attend in the hopes that we \ncould respond to some questions from the media on these individual \npoints. Unfortunately, he was unable to be there. As a consequence, we \nhave each had an opportunity to express our views to the media.\n  I think it is also appropriate to recognize that there used to be, \nmore or less, a gentleman's agreement in this body relative to resource \nissues and issues that affected a particular State. When Senators from \nthe State made specific recommendations with regard to what was in the \nbest interests of their State, it usually stood. But that has changed \nover the years. I recognize that. Now we have the input of the special \ninterest groups relative to issues. That is kind of where we are today.\n  What I have done here is attempted to set the stage a little bit. I \nthink it is fair to recognize that there are other influences. I noted \ntoday a statement of our Vice President in the White House Briefing \nRoom from yesterday. It is relatively brief, but it does criticize the \nRepublican Congress, the Republican leadership, and I think the third \nparagraph bears some attention. It suggests that there is a sneak \nattack being perpetrated by the Republicans and by their special \ninterests riders in the budget bills where they hope no one will find \nthem. He further indicates that the proposals are to carve roads \nthrough the wilderness, force overcutting in the national forests, sell \nthe taxpayers short, and keep us from addressing global warming, and \nthat these issues cannot stand the light of day.\n  I think it is appropriate to recognize that there are other \ninfluences. I was checking with my staff before I was recognized this \nmorning. Mr. President, I am advised that the Congressional Budget \nOffice has scored all of these particular riders as revenue neutral.\n  Since we are in the interest of full disclosure, I think it also is \nimportant to recognize another fact; that is, the accusation of putting \nanti-environmental riders on the Interior appropriations bill for \nfiscal year 1999. It seems to be a pretty one-sided argument, because I \nam sure the Senator from Montana would not object to the process of \nriders, recognizing that there are 150--150--riders on the Interior \nbill.\n  From the standpoint of the special interest groups, maybe the Vice \nPresident, and others, we could remove all such riders, including the \nmoratorium of offshore oil drilling off the coast of California, and \nitems on mining. I think it is fair to point out that the National \nForest System--at least the first 21 million acres of the Forest \nSystem--was created by riders and amendments to the 1897 appropriations \nbill.\n  So, indeed, we have a history of riders. I think if you look at the \nissues from the standpoint of the environmental groups, they would say, \nwell, the riders that I have mentioned are good riders. So I think it \nis fair that we recognize we have a time-honored tradition of riders. \nAnd if riders are under attack, so be it. But it is clearly not a \nreality because many of these riders could be perceived as \nantienvironment suggests that somehow there is a sleight of hand here.\n  I think it is appropriate to note that my friend from Montana did not \ncare to go into that, to recognize that all the riders in question here \nhave had hearings. Hearings have been held, which suggests that this \nwas not done in the dark of night, somehow by subterfuge.\n  So again I would like to examine this a little bit more so that we \ncan get, I think, a better understanding of just what is going on here, \nand the question of merit: Do these particular seven issues have merit? \nI am not going to go into detail on all of them because a few of them \nare not necessarily related to my State, but I think it fair to \nhighlight certainly a few. I am going to start with the issue of \nGlacier Bay.\n  The issue of Glacier Bay started a long, long time ago. Back in 1885, \nlong before Glacier Bay was declared a national monument, commercial \nfishing was recognized as a way of life by the residents around the \narea.\n  I should point out, Glacier Bay is in southeastern Alaska. It is west \nof Juneau. Juneau is over here. I was a little chagrined yesterday in \nthe debate when my friend from Montana could not find Juneau, which is \nour State capital. I made a point to make sure I knew where Helena is \nbefore this morning, before I started the debate.\n  But in any event, it is in the area across icy straits. It is an \nextraordinary area of great beauty. As you move out of Glacier Bay and \ngo out west, you run into the Gulf of Alaska or the Pacific Ocean. On a \nmap of Alaska, it would be the northernmost point of southeastern \nAlaska. But the significance of it is that it is a national monument. \nAs such, it is under special consideration relative to the regulations \nof the Park Service, which manages Glacier Bay.\n  Over the years, local residents in the area--and I am suggesting to \nyou there are very few local residents. There is no population in \nGlacier Bay. There is a lodge there but no year-round population, with \nthe exception of those who are associated with the lodge and a few \npeople in Gustavus, which is out on the edge of Glacier Bay. The \ngeneral feeling in Alaska was that there would be a compatibility \nbetween the Park Service, the management of Glacier Bay, and the \ntraditional uses, and there was no prohibition, no anticipated \nprohibition, on commercial fishing in the marine waters of Glacier Bay.\n  I have a small picture here, Mr. President, that shows one of the \nfishing vessels in Glacier Bay. It gives you an idea that these are \nsmall one- and usually two-person operations. This is a small boat, \nwith probably a skipper, a deckhand, maybe the skipper's wife, and this \nis the kind of fishing that is done there. It is relatively \ninsignificant in the overall magnitude of fishing in southeastern \nAlaska. The fishery consists of a few vessels fishing salmon, halibut, \ncrab, a few bottom fish; and these fisheries pose no threat--there is \nno danger to these resources. All are carefully managed for a \nsustainable harvest by the State of Alaska and most are under a limited \nentry, which means that you can't expand the fishery, or particularly a \nfishery associated with that type of vessel.\n  Arguments that this fishing is somehow incompatible with the use of \nkayaking or some other activity by the concession operators who favor a \nprohibition is a little hard to justify in real terms. Commercial \nfishing is important to the smaller communities of Gustavus and Hoonah. \nFishing provides a few jobs and local employment. All the communities \nurge continuation of commercial and sports fishing in Glacier Bay.\n  We have had our local environmental groups working with us, and we \nhave reached a consensus that management of commercial fishing under \nthe State regulation is entirely appropriate and entirely adequate and \nthe fisheries can be managed on a sustained basis. The interest of the \nDepartment of Interior's insistence on an administrative rulemaking \ninstead of legislation has really been a roadblock, and it has had a \ndetrimental effect, if you will, on working together within the local \ngroups. There is a lot of criticism and fear in the communities that \nboth commercial fishing and subsistence fishing will be terminated as a \nconsequence of the pressure by the environmental community.\n  When we look at the communities we are talking about--I mentioned \nGustavus; it has about 346 residents, 55 of whom are engaged in \nfishing; Elfin Cove, 54 people--that is total residents--47 engaged in \nfishing; Hoonah,\n\n[[Page S11137]]\n\nwhich is a Tlingit Indian village, has 900 people, about 228 in \nfishing; Pelican has 187 residents, 86 in fisheries.\n  That might not sound like much, but in reality, if you are one of \nthose people and you are dependent on fishing--that is the livelihood \nyou know--it is recognizable that these communities cannot survive \nwithout fishing. And what this appropriation language does as to \nGlacier Bay is to allow discussions to proceed at the local level and \nreserve the right of the Congress to make a decision on fisheries in \nGlacier Bay.\n  Now, what the Park Service is attempting to do is to phase it out \nover a 7-year period. Well, to phase it out is to ultimately do away \nwith it, and the rationale behind that is that the Park Service wants \nto regulate the area. These are inland waters in the State of Alaska, \nand to suggest the Park Service should initiate another level of \nregulation I think is without any justification.\n  We talk about how a fishing boat or a small amount of activity in \nGlacier Bay would somehow detract from a visitor's experience. Let's \ntalk a little bit about the visitor's experience, because between \nMemorial Day and Labor Day cruise ships go into Glacier Bay--as I \nindicated, a very large body of water. The cruise ships pick up at \nInlet Bay a Park Service lecturer and proceed up the bay and may go \ninto Tarring or may go up Muir Inlet, depending on whatever the \nparticular direction is that day.\n  But it is important to note that these are commercial passenger \nships. There is a commercial activity associated with this. These are \npaying passengers. These ships carry 2,500, 3,000, 3,200 passengers. It \nis a commercial activity that is going on in a national park. It is \ntaking place, if you will, in this general area of the so-called \nwilderness.\n  Now, the wilderness, of course, is on the land, and we have yet to \nhave a determination of just what ``wilderness waters'' means. I am not \ngoing to go into that in this debate today. But the point I want to \nmake is, the small amount of commercial fishing that takes place there \nand the residents in the surrounding area who depend on access into \nGlacier Bay is what we are talking about.\n  Now, the Senator from Montana would suggest that somehow this \ncommercial activity is foreign or inappropriate to take place in a \nnational monument. We have nowhere in the United States any body of \nwater as unique as Glacier Bay. It is open to the ocean. Commercial \nvessels can come in. It is State of Alaska waters. But within the area, \nof course, is the national park of Glacier Bay.\n  The point I want to make is that the Park Service is attempting to \neliminate the small amount of commercial fishing and, equally \nimportant, the small amount of subsistence fishing that takes place in \nthe park by the Native residents of Hoonah and some of the other \ncommunities nearby. There is no justification for this in the sense of \nany detrimental effects on the fisheries resources which are basically \noverseen by the State of Alaska.\n  I might point out that in this area there are no major anadromous \nstreams, that being streams that will support salmon fry. The salmon \ndon't go into these areas because this is all glacial types of water.\n  As a consequence, they simply cannot survive in the runoff from the \nglaciers. As a consequence, this is not considered an area that \nsupports significant salmon runs. There is some halibut in here, some \nsalmon, some crab. Again, it is a relatively small area, but the point \nis, what we are seeing here is more big government, more takeover from \nthe local people who have had access to commercial fishing, who have \nhad access to sport fishing, as well as access to subsistence.\n  In summary, the objection that I have is here is Big Brother \nencroaching more and more upon authority that has been vested within \nthe State of Alaska to manage the fisheries in this area. It just \nsimply makes no sense, and there is no justification for it.\n  I want to turn now to another issue that is on the list of my friend \nfrom Montana, and that is the issue of King Cove, Cold Bay. Many \npeople, of course, are not aware of just where this area is.\n  Roughly, it is about halfway out in the Aleutian Islands, about 700 \nmiles west of Anchorage. We have a small village of about 700 residents \nin King Cove. The area is on the Pacific Ocean, and it is surrounded by \nmountains. It lends itself to a situation where if you want to get out \nof King Cove, you have to fly over to Cold Bay or go by boat. It \ndoesn't look like much on the map, but the problems we have are \nextraordinary weather conditions associated in the King Cove/Cold Bay \narea.\n  There is a small gravel strip at King Cove. Sometimes we have a \nwindsock blowing one way at one end of the runway and a windsock at the \nother end blowing the opposite way because of the various types of \nwinds that come over the mountains. The people of the area have \nsuggested it would be appropriate to have a road come over to Cold Bay.\n  There is going to be an extended debate on this issue tomorrow, so I \nam not going to go into great detail other than to say that we have had \n11 lives lost in the last 10 years in plane crashes half of which \ninvolved medivacs. This chart shows pictures of some of the individuals \nwho have passed away in aircraft accidents trying to get over to Cold \nBay to get a medivac to Anchorage, AK.\n  What these people are asking for is simply access out by road. What \nwould this consist of, Mr. President? It would consist of extending the \nroad in an area that is currently a wilderness. The proposed \nlegislation which we are going to be offering tomorrow suggests that we \nwould take the area in the wilderness and do a land exchange. We would \ntake the area out of the wilderness, approximately 85 acres, and put it \ninto a refuge. That will add about 580 acres additional into the \nwilderness. It would be a net gain into the wilderness of some 580 \nacres. This road would be about 7 miles long and would allow the \nresidents of King Cove to have access for medical evacuations and \ntransportation when the weather is so severe that the airplanes cannot \nfly.\n  Let me show you a picture of the current method by which the medivacs \ntake place, and you can get some idea of the extremes we are up \nagainst. Here is what a small boat trying to get across water in that \narea in the wintertime looks like. You don't get very far doing that. \nWe have other pictures that will make you seasick. This is one of the \nvessels going across. That is a schooner going across in the \nwintertime.\n  You cannot appreciate the terror associated with making one of those \ntrips. Not only do most people get deathly seasick, but there is a fear \nthe storm is going to progress and damage the vessel or sink the \nvessel. I have been on some of those trips, and I could not begin to \ndescribe the terror of the situation where you are trying to get people \nout so that they can get medical care in an emergency and are subjected \nto this type of exposure when 7 miles of road circumventing a \nwilderness area would be adequate.\n  This airport at Cold Bay was built during the Second World War. It \nhas crosswind runways and is operational virtually year-round. What we \nhave is a small village, less than 700 people, simply trying to have \nthe same right of access for medical evacuation that you and I take for \ngranted, and it is being denied them by objections from some in the \nenvironmental community that say that this is striking in the heart of \nthe wilderness.\n  It is not in the wilderness, Mr. President. We are taking this area \nout of the wilderness, putting it in the refuge and proposing a right \nof way that could be used for a road going through and actually adding \n580 acres to the wilderness. That, to me, seems like a fair and \njustifiable proposal.\n  I will also add that we do not require any funding for this. This is \nsimply a land exchange. The road would be under the control and \njurisdiction of the refuge manager and, basically, under the control of \nthe Secretary of the Interior.\n  The weather in the King Cove area is something that is pretty hard to \nimagine. It is the third windiest city in the United States. It is the \ncloudiest city in the United States. It has the third highest number of \ndays of rain, and one can argue it has the worst weather in the Nation. \nTo take a boat or small plane out of King Cove when winds are 60 to 70 \nmiles an hour, with a 10-to-20 foot sea is a tough situation.\n  We have had babies born in fishing boat galleys on a table, and we \nhave\n\n[[Page S11138]]\n\nhad people who have had to be taken up off the boats in slings. This \nland exchange will allow a one-lane gravel road to be built. It will be \nat the option of the State. The State is evaluating the merits of this. \nWe are simply proposing that the State has the ability to consider this \noption through the land exchange. We see no justification for those who \nobject to what is really a win, win, win for the environment.\n  I also think it fair to point out that we have seen and have a long \nhistory in this body of changes in boundaries. To suggest somehow this \nis a precedent is, again, unrealistic and is unfounded by fact. We have \nhad boundary adjustments on many existing wilderness areas. In the \nState of Montana alone, we had 67 acres of land that was deleted from \nAbsaroka Bear Tooth Wilderness; 28 acres have been deleted from the \nU.L. Bend Wilderness. The boundary changes were made to exclude private \nlands, portions of existing roads, parking areas and public facilities \nthat were inadvertently included when the wilderness area was \nestablished in 1978.\n  The U.L. Bend deletion was made to reinstate access through a \nwildlife refuge wilderness area. What for? For access to a popular \nfishing spot at nearby Fort Peck Reservoir. This history says to me \nthat Montanans didn't object to a boundary change in the wilderness \nwhen it met their needs. So I fail to understand why my friend, the \nSenator from Montana, believes that moving a wilderness boundary to \naccess a fishing hole is OK, but moving 85 acres to save the lives of \nmy constituents is not.\n  That is, basically, what we are looking at, Mr. President, an issue \nof equity. I think I have made the point that, indeed, we are not \nsetting a precedent. We can look back also to the Lee Metcalf \nWilderness Management Act of 1983 where there was a land exchange.\n  Hopefully, I have countered with factual information some of the \npoints that were made and the allegations from my good friend who has \nnot been to either Glacier Bay, nor has he been to King Cove and does \nnot speak from personal knowledge.\n  The last point I want to make is on the issue of Tongass National \nForest. I have a couple charts to show the President and my colleagues \nat this time--let me have the small chart first, if I may--because it \naddresses the Tongass which is the largest of all our national forests.\n  Very briefly, what we have here in the red are the areas that are \nwithdrawn in wilderness areas in the Tongass National Forest. You know, \nthat is probably 58 percent or thereabouts. The green areas are the \nareas for multiple-use lands which provide timber harvest. And the gold \nareas are Native withdrawals, basically private land.\n  If you look at this, you can immediately tell that most of the \nTongass is already reserved in perpetuity in wilderness areas. I think \nthat makes the point that 84 percent of the Tongass is currently \nreserved for nontimber harvesting purposes.\n  Ninety-three percent of all the old-growth forest remain standing in \nthe Tongass today. And it is pretty hard to communicate to my friends \nwho have never been there, but forests live and die. And a large \npercentage of the Tongass National Forest is either dead or dying. \nAbout one-third, 30 percent, of the standing trees are dead or dying. \nThe reality of how you utilize those trees is a matter that has been \nunder discussion for some time.\n  Basically, the value of that particular timber is in wood fiber, and \nmost of that either goes into chips or is used to go into pulp mills. \nBut because of environmental pressures, we closed our own two year-\nround manufacturing plants in the State, and they are down permanently. \nAnd those were pulp mills. So now we face a difficult situation of \ntrying to determine what we are going to do with that old growth.\n  There is a possibility of that dead and dying timber to be put in \nveneer. But nevertheless, the point I want to make here today is to \ncounter the argument that somehow we are proposing to increase the \nharvest 50 percent over last year.\n  In order to respond to that criticism, I think you have to look at \nthe harvest in the Tongass since--well, modern times began in about \n1947, after the war. The allowable cut was somewhere about 1.375 \nbillion board feet. That was the allowable cut in 1947. These are set \nby the Forest Service. Then under statehood we came in and the \nallowable cut was 1.3 billion. Then when we had the Alaska Native \nSettlement Claims Act and we dropped down to 950 million. Now, this \nbasically in this timeframe supported two pulp mills and a half dozen \nsawmills.\n  Then when we came in with the ANILCA legislation and the volumes \ndropped, and the allowable cut went down to 450 million. We were able \nto maintain an industry at that level, but it was marginal. Then we \ncame down to the Tongass Timber Reform Act in 1991, and it dropped down \nto about 310 million. And then we came under what is known as the \nTongass Land Management Plan or TLUMP, which was to settle at 267 \nmillion board feet. And the Forest Service has not been able to put \nthat up.\n  Currently, they have this year about 30 million that they have been \nable to put up and anticipate somewhere in the area of another 100 \nmillion. So to suggest that--in this proposal, what we have done is we \nhave simply said that if the Forest Service does not put up what they \nsaid they were going to put up under the TLUMP, which took 10 years and \n$13 million to develop, why then that differential that previously went \nto the boroughs and school districts comes out of the Forest Service \nbudget.\n  But this is an effort to try to get the Forest Service to commit on \nwhat they said they would provide. And to suggest, as my friend from \nMontana has, that suddenly we are trying to double the harvest is not \nonly misleading, it is an absolute falsehood, because clearly the \nForest Service says under this study that took them 10 years to \ncomplete and $13 million, that they would provide an allowable cut of \n267 million. We are saying, ``OK, do it. And if you don't do it, there \nought to be some penalty,'' because we have lost the revenue to \ncontinue to offset from the standpoint of our boroughs and our schools \nassociated with that harvest under the formula that provides some of \nthe funds from the timber harvesting back to the communities. We are \nnot doubling, Mr. President, by any means, the amount of timber----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The amount of time allotted to \nthe Senator from Alaska has expired.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for \nanother 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  So, Mr. President, where we are today is we are fighting a battle to \nmaintain an industry on a substantially reduced basis. As I have \nindicated, that industry has declined dramatically over the last 10 \nyears. And the Forest Service clearly has not been acting in good faith \nto get out the timber that they promised. And the fact that the Forest \nService has seen fit to initiate over a 10-year period this \nextraordinary evaluation of what the TLUMP would provide and the \nassurance of whatever figure they set they would be committed to is \nwhat this issue is all about.\n  So, again, in conclusion, on the Tongass issue, it is not a question \nby any means, Mr. President, of doubling the cut. And that is what some \nof our friends on the other side would like to make this issue seem \nlike. If we were going to double the cut, we would go back to 450 \nmillion board feet. That is not what we are talking about today.\n  Finally, a couple of other issues that I think need some \nclarification very briefly, and that is the requirement of \ndecommissioning our unauthorized roads. It is not an issue that is \nunique to my State by any means, but under this provision the Forest \nService is prohibited from using funds for decommissioning National \nForest System roads until the regional forester certifies that \nunauthorized or so-called ghost roads have either been decommissioned \nor reconstructed to standard.\n  Funding is appropriated for decommissioned roads including roads \nwhich are not part of the transportation Forest Service, and it is not \nprevented from addressing or pursuing stabilization of these roads. So \nwhat we have here is a recognition that the administration says that \nthey have a backlog over the last 5 to 10 years of over $10 million.\n\n[[Page S11139]]\n\n  They have said in reported stories they have discovered 60,000 miles \nof ghost road that they did not even know they had. What we propose is \nthat they go ahead and address the ghost roads and get rid of them \nbefore they start proceeding on decommissioning their so-called map \nroads. If you have a situation where you have so-called unauthorized \nroads, then you should take care of those first before you start \ndecommissioning map roads.\n  The other issue revolving around the Forest Service, and not \nnecessarily addressing the needs of my State, is the prohibition of \nforest plans until the administration publishes new regulations.\n  Late in 1995, the Secretary of Agriculture promised a revised forest \nplan. He promised cost-effective changes. Well, these plans are not \ncompleted today. And as a consequence, we see no justification for \nproceeding in publishing new regulations until you get your current \nForest Service revision plan done.\n  The last issue I want to talk about, and again it is not unique to my \nState, but it is to some of the areas involved, and that is the \nreintroduction of the grizzly bear into Idaho and Montana. I think that \nis a matter that should be addressed by the individuals from these \nStates. But I know the ranchers and others have certain views about \nreintroduction of the grizzlies.\n  And one thing about the bears, the moose, and the elk, and so forth, \nthere are no boundaries or State lines that prohibit their crossing. \nThey move in ranges depending on a lot of factors, including \nregulations on hunting. So to suggest that somehow reintroduction of \nthe grizzly bears in the Sellway-Bitterroot areas of Idaho and Montana \nshould be proceeded by the Department of Interior over the objection of \nthe residents is something that is best left up to those in Idaho and \nMontana. What we are proposing to do is to refrain from reintroducing \nthose bears at this time pending an evaluation and input from the local \npeople.\n\n  In the Columbia/Snake River Dams--remove language that requires \ncongressional approval for changes in the dam system to the Columbia \nand Snake River and tributaries. We are saying the disposition of dams \nshould come before the Congress. The Secretary of the Department of the \nInterior should not have the authority to arbitrarily proceed. After \nall, these dams were built with public funds. The merits and \ncontributions of these dams have provided an extraordinary level of \nstandard of living for many in these areas, and have created \nagricultural areas of prosperity. As a consequence of the water and \npower, we have the aluminum industry.\n  To suggest that somehow Congress should not be a part of any decision \nto eliminate these dams is unrealistic. What we would propose here is \nthat there would be a requirement that any change in the dam system \nmust be approved by the Congress of the United States.\n  I appreciate the additional time allotted to me. I see several \ncolleagues on the floor are looking for recognition. I do want to \nadvise my colleagues, I think late tomorrow morning, that we will be \nproceeding with the disposition of the King Cove Road. We have 6 hours \nproposed for debate on the issue. It is my understanding that we \nanticipate about 3 hours, 1\\1/2\\ hours equally divided.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 30 \nminutes under the control of the distinguished Senator from Arizona, \nMr. McCain.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/30/senate-section/article/S11135-8", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11139-S11142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          DEFENSE PREPAREDNESS\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, 7 months ago, three out of the four \nservice chiefs testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee \nthat the President's fiscal year 1999 defense budget was well balanced \nand that the operating and maintenance accounts and manpower accounts \nwere about correct.\n  Yesterday, in a hearing held by the Senate Armed Services Committee, \nthere was a dramatic reversal of those statements that were made by \nthree of the four Service Chiefs. Yesterday, the Service Chiefs \nacknowledged that there is a long-term degradation in our ability to \nfight and win a war and that immediate action, indeed, emergency \nsupplemental funds are called for.\n  I am sure that there were a number of factors that contributed to \nthis incredibly candid display yesterday before the Senate Armed \nServices Committee. I have the utmost respect and regard for every one \nof the military leaders of our services. But the reality is that this \nproblem has been building for years, not just 7 months. I believe that \nsome of the problems that we are going to have to address in emergency \nfashion now could have been addressed in a much more measured way if \nthe Joint Chiefs had been more candid in their testimony before the \nArmed Services Committee and the Congress in the past years, not to \nmention 7 months ago.\n  The preparedness problem within the military is compounded by both \nthe ``can do'' attitude of the military, which I admire, and the \npressure that senior leadership puts on its ranks to not report bad \nnews. Our men and women in uniform have a history of making do, of \nadjusting to civilian decisions, and working out potential solutions \neven at the cost of assuming higher risks. But we commit a grave \ndisservice to those very men and women when we fail to provide the \nresources they need to do their job, and when political considerations \nprohibit our military leaders from telling Congress and the American \npeople the truth about their ability to execute our National Military \nStrategy. At yesterday's Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff told us the truth about our declining military \nreadiness--something that has long been apparent to those of us who \nhear regularly from lower-level officers and enlisted personnel in the \nfield, who risk their careers by making Congress aware of the readiness \ngaps not acknowledged by their superiors.\n  In mid-July, I sent letters to each of the Service Chiefs expressing \nmy concern about the military's overall state of readiness. In order \nthat I might gain a better understanding of current readiness and \nreadiness trends in the military, I asked each Chief to address key \nreadiness issues in his Service, and to provide me with written answers \nto a series of questions that addressed these problems. I requested \nthat the responses to the questions also include an assessment of \nNational Guard and Reserve readiness. I have now received answers from \neach of the Chiefs. Their responses are thoughtful and thorough, and I \nwas grateful that they and their staffs took the time to describe in \ndetail our current state of military readiness.\n  I have now received answers from each of the Chiefs. Their responses \nare thoughtful and thorough, and I was grateful they and their staffs \ntook the time to describe in detail our current state of military \nreadiness.\n  These responses do not reveal a single reason for the continued \ndegradation of the Services, or a single set of answers as to how these \nproblems can be solved. Each service has a unique mix of readiness \nproblems and has made different trade-offs in efforts to compensate. \nThe data provided by the Service Chiefs clearly demonstrate that both \nthe Executive Branch and the Congress are to blame. They show that the \nAdministration is to blame for underfunding some aspects of readiness \nat the expense of others, and that Congress is to blame for using \nreadiness for parochial and other special interest projects. Moreover, \nfor two years now, we have turned down pleas by the Secretary of \nDefense and the President for additional base closure rounds, causing \nmoney earmarked for readiness and modernization accounts to be used \ninstead to maintain bases built to sustain a Cold War force structure. \nThe central issue is not, however, who is to blame, but how to reverse \nthese alarming trends.\n  The world is a very tough neighborhood and requires a tough cop. As \nthe world's sole superpower, we have no choice but to patrol this beat \nin order to defend our interests. Safeguarding our security and \nadvancing the cause of freedom may well require us to send young \nAmericans into battle against the enemies of peace. The very least we \ncan do is to make sure that the men and women we send into harm's way \nare equipped and trained to fight and\n\n[[Page S11140]]\n\nwin. What I greatly fear, though, is that they will be sent less than \noptimally combat-ready, which leads to the inevitable consequence of \ncasualties that are unnecessary and tragic.\n\n\n                      Today's Readiness Challenges\n\n  In their replies to my letters, the Service Chiefs identified a \nseries of general risks that affect each service, and which both the \nAdministration and the Congress must consider in funding an adequate \ndefense program.\n  The Illusion of OPTEMPO. One example is the current effort to \nmaintain high levels of operational activity or OPTEMPO. Our military \nforces cannot be ready if they do not constantly maintain high levels \nof training, and there is merit in ensuring that we do not reduce their \noperational tempo as we cut total force strength and defense spending. \nHowever, if such levels are funded at the expense of major overhauls \nand depot maintenance, of keeping personnel deployed for excessive \nperiods such as our military deployments to Bosnia, Somalia, SOUTHERN \nWATCH and PROVIDE COMFORT in Southwest Asia, and at the general cost of \nstraining our military forces and our major combat equipment, they \ntrade this year's readiness for going hollow in the future.\n  On a given day, one-third of our Navy ships, submarines and squadrons \nare deployed overseas. In his testimony yesterday morning, Admiral \nJohnson stated that well over 50 percent of the Navy's surface fleet is \ndeployed around the globe. In 1992, that figure was 37 percent. Of \nparticular concern is the Chief of Naval Operations' comments on the \ncontinuing erosion of non-deployed readiness in the sea service. \nAdmiral Johnson writes,\n\n       A decade ago, non-deployed naval units were at the highest \n     states of readiness (C1/C2) nearly 70 percent of the time. \n     Today, that figure is barely 50 percent. Non-deployed \n     readiness has fallen to the point that an intense effort is \n     required by our Sailors to regain a deployable level of \n     readiness, and that peak is being reached closer and closer \n     to deployment. This compression of training and maintenance \n     puts tremendous strain on our people as they struggle to meet \n     commitments, pressure that negatively impacts the personal \n     and professional quality of life of our Sailors.\n\n  The high levels of OPTEMPO reported by each service are no longer a \nguarantee against going hollow. In fact, to a large degree, the nature \nof contingencies driving OPTEMPO is the surest guarantee that readiness \nwill degrade.\n  Furthermore, time and again, we have learned that our system for \nmeasuring readiness is unrealistic and fails to anticipate real-world \ndemands on operating funds. In the past, data that indicated a decline \nin readiness was considered ``merely'' anecdotal.\n  Increasing Depot Level Backlogs. A tangible indicator of decreasing \nreadiness is the fact that the price of correcting our depot level \nmaintenance backlogs has been rising for the last six years, despite \nsizable reductions in force structure. That backlog now totals $1.6 \nbillion compared to $420 million in 1991. Similarly, the cost of our \nbacklogs in real property maintenance (RPM) have risen from $3 billion \nin the mid-1980s to over $10 billion today.\n  Underfunding Quality-of-Life. More than anything else, our victory in \nDesert Storm was a tribute to the men and women in our military--a \nclear victory for the all-volunteer force. Displaying the ``can do'' \nattitude not found anywhere else in the world, our military personnel \nexhibited an overall level of individual combat performance that had \npreviously been limited to a small portion of our total force.\n  At the same time, our economy has prospered, producing historically \nhigh levels of employment, resulting in the emergence of a very \ndifficult recruiting and retention environment. Maintaining this top-\nquality force requires a military personnel system that has the \nflexibility to react quickly to the dynamics of the civilian market and \nthe leadership and confidence to follow through with critical personnel \ndecisions rather than neglecting them out of fiscal opportunism. \nHowever, first, second, and third term enlisted retention, pilot and \nmid-grade officer retention, and recruiting are all short of goal for \neach of the Services.\n  Recruiting and retaining quality individuals requires pay scales that \nadjust to meet prevailing rates rather than fall 14 percent behind \ncomparable civilian pay. It requires adequate funding for recruiting. \nIt requires proper promotion rates--not promotion boards that take five \nmonths to process reports of promotion boards, as is the case with the \nNavy. It requires proper living conditions and morale, welfare and \nrecreation services. It requires reasonable tours of duty and a higher \nquality of civilian leadership and ``role models'' to deal with matters \nfairly. It requires a reinstatement of the 50 percent retirement plan \nand a close examination as to whether the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) or \na 401K-type plan has utility in the military pay system. General Reimer \nwrites that\n\n       . . . the retirement package we have offered our soldiers \n     entering the Army since 1986 is inadequate. Having lost 25 \n     percent of its lifetime value as a result of the 1980's \n     reforms, military retirement is no longer our number one \n     retention tool. Our soldiers and families deserve better. We \n     need to send them a strong signal that we haven't forgotten \n     them.\n\n  The military medical health care system, particularly the TRICARE \nprogram, has been described by Service Chiefs as falling far short of \nwhat is warranted and needed. We cannot ignore the erosion of \nretirement and health care benefits, and the resultant impact on \nretention and readiness. General Reimer writes, ``The loss in medical \nbenefits when a retiree turns 65 is particularly bothersome to our \nsoldiers who are making career decisions.'' From the Service Chiefs' \nanswers, it is highly questionable whether we are meeting any of these \nrequirements. On the contrary, it is clear that there is much work to \nbe done.\n  Finally, it is demoralizing to the men and women we send into harm's \nway, and is incomprehensible to the American people, who expect a well \ntrained and well equipped force, to witness military personnel, up to \n25,000, on food stamps. One tax provision that I have tried to reverse \nthis year excludes uniformed men and women in the military from \nbeneficial tax treatment on the profits resulting from the sale of \ntheir homes. We order servicemembers to move from place to place, but \nwe do not afford them the same tax treatment as other U.S. citizens. \nShould this issue have been permitted to exist for so many years?\n  Underfunding Manpower Strength. President Clinton's defense budget \nand National Military Strategy calls for force levels of 1.37 million \nservicemembers. This is nearly 250,000 less than the Base Force \nadvocated by President Bush. What must be determined by the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, however, is whether we really have the resources to \nmaintain a force of much over 1 million servicemembers by the year \n2000. The end result may be manning levels that are too low to meet our \nreadiness needs and too low to provide effective combat capability. \nThis fact is compounded by the ever increasing number of contingency \noperations that increase OPTEMPO and PERSTEMPO and put additional \nstress on our men and women in uniform and the equipment they use. We \nhave to be certain that our force levels are adequate to meet \ndeployments, and that rotations conform properly to overseas \ncommitments. Admiral Johnson stated in his responses to me that ``. . . \ndeployed readiness is trending downward, owing mostly to personnel \nshortages.'' The Chief of Staff of the Army had similar concerns. \nGeneral Reimer has written that:\n\n       The readiness of our Armed Forces is more difficult to \n     understand and more complex to manage today than at any other \n     time in our Nation's history. We have reduced the Total Army \n     by 34 percent--nearly 650,000 Active, Army National Guard, \n     and U.S. Army Reserve soldiers and Department of Army \n     civilians--and have closed over 700 bases worldwide. \n     Meanwhile, the requirements for land forces are greater than \n     ever. In the 40 years prior to 1989, the Army participated in \n     10 major deployments. Since then, the Army has participated \n     in 29 major deployments--a dramatic increase in operational \n     tempo.\n\n  Manpower Turbulence and Insecurity. According to the Joint Chiefs' \nresponses, each service is experiencing near-record levels of \nturbulence and insecurity. This is reflected in extended tours of duty, \nsudden changes of assignment, high rates of relocation, and a series of \nchanges in personnel policies that essentially eliminate the ability of \npersonnel, thereby complicating decisions on whether to stay in the \nservice.\n  These problems are compounded in the case of military families. \nAcross each service, extended family separations are the number one \nreason why\n\n[[Page S11141]]\n\nenlisted personnel and junior officers are leaving the military. \nSpouses often lose their jobs with relocations, moves mean significant \nunexpected expenses, and dependents often have adjustment problems. At \nthe same time, unit and crew continuity is lost, as moves break up well \ntrained, cohesive units, depriving them of much of their readiness.\n  Underfunding Base Maintenance and Repair. Ships, aircraft, and \nweapons systems are kept ready through planned maintenance and \nmodernization programs. Buildings, runways, truck bays, piers, barracks \nand utilities are equally important assets that must be kept ready \nthrough a similar level of commitment and fiscal support. Historically, \neach of the Services have used infrastructure to pay the bill for other \naccounts. General Krulak has said, ``Our Backlog of Maintenance and \nRepair will reach $1 billion by FY03 and our plant replacement cycle \nwill grow to nearly two hundred years.'' Admiral Johnson writes, ``We \nhave mined as much as we can from the infrastructure accounts; we are \nnot at an unacceptable level and QOL in the workplace environment is \nnegatively affecting morale and readiness.'' General Reimer's response: \n``We have been forced to underfund our Base Operations (BASOPS) and \nReal Property Maintenance (RPM) accounts--84 percent and 58 percent of \nrequirements respectively in Fiscal Year 1999. This level of resourcing \nhas proven insufficient to run our bases in a way that provides our \nsoldiers and families with an adequate quality of life. As a result, \nour commanders have been forced to divert funds from training accounts \nin order to maintain their installations.''\n  Underfunding Equipment Modernization. Prior to the 1990s, our \nNational Military Strategy and corresponding force structure were \noriented overwhelmingly toward the Soviet threat. That emphasis, \nobviously, is less relevant today. The December 1997 National Defense \nPanel Report put it this way:\n\n       We must look beyond the challenges for defense and assess \n     the relevance of the National Security Act of 1947 for the \n     next millennium. This framework served us well during the \n     Cold War, but we must objectively reexamine our national \n     security structure if we intend to remain a world leader. It \n     will take wisdom to walk the delicate line that avoids \n     premature decisions and unintended ``lock-in'' with equipment \n     purchases, operational concepts, and related systems whose \n     effectiveness may quickly erode in a rapidly changing \n     environment.\n\n  Furthermore, comprehensive developmental test and evaluation is \nexpensive and it is tempting to cut corners by reducing resources. Any \nreduction, however, means a loss of readiness.\n  Current critical needs for modernization include funding improved \nmedium troop lift, amphibious lift, amphibious vehicles and fire \nsupport for the Marine Corps. They include increasing shipbuilding \nrates, funding mine warfare, naval fire support, improved \ninteroperability and battle management, and improved fighter/strike \naircraft for the Navy.\n  They include funding for digitizing the force (Force XXI), \ninformation dominance and interoperability, maintaining combat \novermatch through increased lethality of ground weapon systems, \nimproved attack and other combat helicopters for the Army.\n  Finally, they include funding improved strategic lift, precision \nguided munitions, bomber force upgrades, air dominance fighter aircraft \nand space initiatives for the Air Force.\n  Underfunding Training and Excessive Reliance on Simulation. We must \ncontinue to fund training in order to maintain mission and unit \nreadiness. Critical training includes unit-level operations, the flying \nhour program, the number of steaming days, combined arms exercises, \ntemporary duty in conjunction with operations, student skills training, \nand professional development. Better business practices, through the \nmilitary's Revolution in Business Affairs, and increased usage of \nsimulators are being incorporated as quickly as possible to ensure \nefficient use of existing training resources. Any reductions to the \nServices' training accounts cannot be tolerated because they will \ndirectly reduce readiness.\n  Simulation can be an extremely useful supplement to training, but it \ncannot replace it. It is tempting, however, to save money on exercises \nand other high cost training scenarios and increase reliance on \nsimulations even when this produces a significant cut in real world \nreadiness. For example, the Air Force over the past three years has cut \npilot flying hours and increased pilot simulation hours by equal \namounts. I do not believe the two are interchangeable. Excessive \nreliance on simulation may produce lower training costs, but it is no \nsubstitute for the real thing.\n  Underfunding Major Equipment Life Cycles. History has proven that \nperiods of diminishing defense resources inevitably mean that equipment \nand munitions must be kept in service much longer than the military \nservices originally planned. In General Krulak's letter, he wrote:\n\n       We have reached a critical point in the life cycle of our \n     ground and aviation equipment. We are facing virtual block \n     obsolescence of crucial items. Time needed by our units for \n     training in the field is being spent in the motor pools, \n     hangars, and armories. Our commanders are finding it more and \n     more difficult to train their units because their equipment \n     is ``deadlined'' or evacuated for repair. Our amphibious \n     assault vehicles (AAVs) are, on average, seven years older \n     than their already extended programmed service life.\n\n  The general goes on to say that two aviation workhorses, the CH-46E \nand the CH-53D helicopters, are 27 and 30 years old on average, \nexceeding their projected service lives by many years. Another example \nof this is the continued practice of the Marine Corps' retreading tires \non the humvees (HMMVV's) and five-ton trucks of the First and Second \nMarine Expeditionary Forces.\n  The age of our military equipment, along with high operational tempo, \nhas dramatically increased the cost of equipment maintenance in man-\nhours and money while dramatically reducing the availability of that \nequipment for training. Our equipment readiness rates remain high only \nbecause of the dedication of our men and women in uniform, who \nroutinely work twelve to sixteen hours per day, six to seven days a \nweek, on overlapping and rotating shifts to maintain this equipment. \nUnless a concerted effort is made to adjust maintenance and overhaul \ncycles to provide for service lives, existing readiness standards will \ncontinue to drift further towards a hollow force.\n  Underfunding Munition Stocks. Each of the Services now tends to meet \nits munitions goals by redefining the stocks on hand as adequate to \nmeet a shrinking force posture. As Air Force Chief of Staff General \nRyan wrote me, ``While we lived off the surplus from the 40 percent \ndrawdown of our forces in the early 90s, funding has not matched our \nneed for the last several years.'' The net result is smaller stocks of \nmunitions per weapon system, and a failure to purchase the most \nadvanced forms of smart weapons, fuzes, and conventional weapons in the \namount required by our National Military Strategy. Admiral Johnson \nwrites,\n\n       I am concerned about the inventory levels of modern \n     weaponry, particularly the Tomahawk Block III missile, and \n     the resultant increased risk in fighting two nearly \n     simultaneous Major Theater Wars (MTW). We have maintained the \n     current level by limiting the fleet's training allowances, \n     with some units only receiving one training missile per year \n     of our costly leading edge weapons, and by significantly \n     reducing funding for development of future weapons.\n\n  In the process, we are risking our industrial base for smart and \nconventional munitions by reducing orders below a critical threshold or \nto achieve the production economies which would result from a higher \nprocurement rate.\n  Balancing Act of Emerging Technologies. There is a growing tendency \nto reduce force posture and readiness in anticipation of the \nintroduction of technological innovations like network-centric warfare \nand interoperability and weapon systems that are not yet in the force \nstructure. This ``betting on things to come'' trades readiness we have \non hand for technology that is still in the bush. Historically, we have \nnever deployed such systems on time, at the estimated cost, or, often, \nwith the anticipated effectiveness.\n  However, the risks of such efforts to trade readiness in the near-\nterm for future technologies must be balanced with the statement of \nGeneral Krulak:\n\n       For the military, this is a time when emerging \n     technologies, if exploited, will fundamentally alter and \n     substantially increase our warfighting capability. To the \n     maximum extent possible, consistent with the imperative for \n     maintaining current readiness, we\n\n[[Page S11142]]\n\n     should leverage these ``leap ahead technologies'' which \n     promise a warfighting edge well into the next century. We \n     should minimize expenditures on procuring evolutionary \n     technologies and maintaining old systems that do not promise \n     a significant edge on tomorrow's battlefield.\n\n  Funding Operations at the Expense of Readiness. We are already deep \nin the process of using readiness funds to pay for peacekeeping and \nhumanitarian operations. In theory, much of this expenditure will be \nrepaid through supplemental appropriations or out of Department of \nDefense contingency funds. In practice, it is very unlikely that the \nservices will ever be fully repaid for the cost of their operations, \nand they will be forced to pay for peacekeeping and humanitarian \nactions in a way that will affect their readiness. In Bosnia, the \nArmy's actual reimbursement is about 90 cents on the dollar.\n  Spending Savings Before We Achieve Them. It is very easy to achieve \nmanagement efficiencies on paper, and to cut infrastructure or reduce \nsupport funding to achieve budget savings. In practice, however, there \nis an increasing tendency to cut first and determine the practicality \nof such savings later. On February 10, 1998, General Reimer testified \nto the Senate Armed Services Committee that\n\n       We have programmed $10.5 billion worth of efficiencies \n     across the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP). These \n     efficiencies are based upon better business practices and \n     reform initiatives . . . these are risks associated with this \n     budget.\n\n\n          Repeating the 1970s, the Road to Going Hollow Again\n\n  Whatever we do, let us not repeat the mistakes of the 1970s. In the \nPost-Vietnam era, much of the decline in active duty force levels \nthrough the 1970s was the result of decisions made by the individual \nservices to funnel resources into badly needed modernization programs. \nTo at least some extent, however, the numbers also reflected the \ndifficulty the services were having attracting and retaining quality \nrecruits. A number of factors combined to complicate the challenge of \nmanning the all-volunteer force. First, military pay generally lagged \nwell behind pay in the private sector. Second, the end of the Vietnam \nWar saw cuts in many personnel benefits, including the education \nbenefits of the Montgomery GI Bill.\n  In the post-Vietnam era, I remember all too well, from first-hand \nexperience, U.S. Navy ships that could not get underway for lack of \nmanning and from serious maintenance shortfalls. I remember too many \naircraft--we called them hangar queens--parked in the hangar bay, never \nto fly during a deployment for lack of spare parts, sacrificed so that \nother jets could launch from the decks of the carrier.\n  As a matter of national security, we must solemnly commit that the \ndangerous decline in military readiness that followed the conclusion of \nthe Vietnam War will not be repeated as we continue to draw down our \nCold War-era forces. Credible warnings that we are approaching the \n``hollow force'' levels of the 1970s can no longer be ignored. Let us \nact now to avoid this calamity.\n  Acting responsibly requires an awareness of the ways in which forces \ncan go hollow. Simply attempting to avoid the mistakes of the 1970s \nwill not necessarily protect us as the United States prepares to enter \nthe new millennium as the preeminent political, economic, and military \npower in the world.\n  My Naval Academy classmate and former roommate in flight school, \nAdmiral Chuck Larson, had this to say about readiness when he was the \nCommander-in-Chief of the Pacific (USCINCPAC) in 1993:\n\n       When the system of readiness begins to crumble, the decay \n     will normally start from the inside out to the cutting edge. \n     We should be on guard when it becomes necessary to increase \n     operational tempo requirements to meet routine commitments; \n     funds must be transferred among accounts to support increased \n     OPTEMPO, unforseen operations, or contingencies; and, we are \n     compelled to decrease, cancel or defer planned maintenance, \n     training or logistics support activities and functions.\n\n  Mr. President, in 1777, Thomas Paine said, ``Those who expect to reap \nthe blessings of freedom must undergo the fatigue of supporting it.'' \nYesterday, the Joint Chiefs made clear that this Administration has not \nadequately supported our armed forces. We must labor to provide this \nsupport or face the dire consequences of inaction. The blessings of \nfreedom may ultimately hang in the balance.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, I thought it was important--and maybe \neven a similar event yesterday--the testimony of the Service Chiefs \nbefore the Senate Armed Services Committee; their candor and frank \nassessment of the challenges that we face were more than welcome. I and \nothers expressed our disappointment that this candor was so long in \ncoming. But we should applaud the fact that it was there.\n  Mr. President, I picked up the Washington Post this morning and saw \nthat there is evidence that Iraq is now developing a nuclear weapon.\n  In Kosovo, there are horrible pictures on the front page of the New \nYork Times of the ethnic cleansing and barbaric, terrible, murderous \nbehavior of the Serbs that is going on there. Two weeks ago, we learned \nthat the North Koreans had launched a three-stage nuclear capable \nmissile, and this administration seems to believe that bribing them to \nsomehow modify their behavior is the way to go when clearly there are \nindications that their acts have become more bellicose. Their efforts \nto acquire nuclear capable weapons and the testing of missiles indicate \nthat that policy has failed.\n  I could go to other places in the world of potential flashpoints \nwhich may entail the expenditure of American blood and treasure. I am \nvery concerned, Mr. President, about our ability to meet those \npotential challenges. I am more concerned after the testimony of the \nJoint Chiefs yesterday. I strongly argue for a change, I mean a very \nsignificant change--that the administration sit down with the Congress \nof the United States, the people's representatives, and try together to \nchart out a way we can rectify these wrongs that have taken place over \nthe last 6 years. We must act together in a bipartisan fashion. If the \nadministration continues to ignore the Congress, we will have to act \nourselves, which is not always in the benefit of the Nation. However, \nwe as Members of Congress have to readjust our priorities concerning \nbase closings and most efficient use of depots, including unneeded and \nunwanted military construction projects and many other parochial \nprojects, so that we can divert all of these scarce resources to \nprotecting our national security.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 30 \nminutes under the control of the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, \nMr. Hagel. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I wish to commend my friend and distinguished \ncolleague from Arizona for his comments. He is on target. I wish to \nassociate myself with those comments and pick up where Senator McCain \nleft off, addressing some of the same issues but from a different \nperspective, although it is part of the total perspective, and that is \nforeign policy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/30/senate-section/article/S11139-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11142-S11146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNITED STATES FOREIGN POLICY\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, foreign policy to Nebraskans and many \nAmericans is not theory or some abstraction suspended between \nuniversity classrooms, State Department corridors, or congressional \nhearing rooms. Foreign policy is the framework policy for America's \ninterests in the world--trade and commerce, national security, \nfinancial markets, international economics, coalitions and alliances, \nnarcotics policy, technology, immigration, all part of foreign policy. \nForeign policy is America's future. It represents the complete and \nintegrated policy that affects every dynamic of American life. Foreign \npolicy connects all other policies. The world is interconnected. And \nthe one overarching policy process America has to engage the world is \nforeign policy.\n  President Kennedy spoke of new frontiers in his 1961 inaugural \naddress. He spoke of the long-term challenges in the long twilight \nstruggle against communism. Today, just as in 1961, and throughout \nhistory, mankind has been presented with new sets of challenges and new \nfrontiers. These new challenges dominate after every global \ntransformation. President Bush's new book deals directly with our \npresent-day world transformation-- ``A World Transformed''--and we \nrecall President\n\n[[Page S11143]]\n\nKennedy's words in that inaugural speech and apply them to the \nchallenges of the 21st century.\n\n\n                         Historical Perspective\n\n  Today, as in 1961, America stands again at a crossroads, at a unique \nbut not unprecedented time in history. We have witnessed other great \nglobal shifts at several points in the 20th century. In the early days \nof Teddy Roosevelt, we saw America emerge as a global power. After \nWorld War I, America retreated into a mindless isolationism as economic \ndepression and tyranny spread throughout the world. In 1941, World War \nII again thrust America into a leading role in the world and made us \nagain a dominant power. The rise of the Soviet Union ushered in the \ncold war with its deadly arms race, nuclear brinkmanship, and policies \nof containment enforced by American soldiers.\n  For over 40 years, the world was divided between two powerful enemies \ncapable of destroying each other and the world. During this period, \nhope, opportunity, and freedom were held captive in many nations to \nauthoritarian rule. Hundreds of millions of people across the globe \nwere victims of political slavery. And then in 1989 the Soviet empire \ncrumbled as freedom broke through the Iron Curtain.\n  In the decade of the 20th century, we have seen great changes as the \nworld settles out from the cold war. We stand at the edge of a great \nprecipice. The world is changing around us, under us, above us. The \nrate of change is phenomenal, almost incalculable, for both good and \nevil. This change unnerves us, it challenges us, and will dominate us \nunless we shape the change and lead the force of change for good in the \nworld.\n  History provides valuable lessons, but it holds no clear blueprint or \nroadmap for the future. The rise of technology and communications has \nconnected the world in every way. Our economics are intertwined. Our \neconomies are interconnected. Today we live in a global community \nanchored by global economies.\n  We also face new threats. Unlike the past, these threats do not come \nfrom a single country or a single enemy or a single state; they are \nborderless threats. The scourge of terrorism brings with it the deadly \nthreat of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The trafficking \nof illegal drugs respects neither boundaries nor borders nor \ngovernments. The confluence of economic and national security concerns \nhas created mutual threats and mutual self-interests among all nations \nof the world.\n  What do we do? Where does the United States go from here? After great \nglobal shifts, there is always a time of uncertainty and instability. \nThere is no clearly lit path to follow. Different times call for new \nsolutions to new challenges, borderless challenges.\n  One thing is clear, Mr. President. The United States of America must \nlead the world in the 21st century. We are the only dominant power in \nthe world today, which provides us with immense opportunity but yet \nawesome responsibility. America must lead. America must not be \nintimidated by the unprecedented rate of change and uncertainty in the \nworld. The diffusion of new geopolitical, economic, and military power \nthat will develop over the next few years will form the world's power \nstructure well into the next century. Of this we can be certain: \nAmerica must engage this natural development, welcome it, and lead it.\n  Timidity is not America's heritage. Boldness inspires. As George Bush \nsaid, as he accepted the Republican nomination for President in 1988,\n\n       One issue overwhelms all others and that's the issue of \n     peace. . . . One by one the unfree places fall, not to the \n     force of arms but to the force of an idea: freedom works. . . \n     . It's a watershed. It is no accident. It happened when we \n     acted on the ancient knowledge that strength and clarity \n     [strength and clarity] lead to peace; weakness and \n     ambivalence lead to war.\n\n\n               Facing the Challenges of the 21st Century\n\n  America's objectives in this new century must be to help build \nsecurity, hope, and opportunity. The United States and all nations will \nprosper in the 21st century if we lead a world of more freedom, \nstronger democracies, and unlimited trade and investment. Such a world \nis in our national interests. It is in the mutual self-interests of all \npeoples.\n  The next 2 years are especially critical.\n  They will help set precedents for much of the early part of the 21st \ncentury. Events will occur in the next 2 years that will change the \nshape of the world.\n\n\n       The Future of America in the Next 2 Years and Beyond 2000\n\n  The future of America into the next century will be dominated by \nforeign policy. Because of our interconnected world, foreign policy is \nno longer just the practice of statecraft.\n  The completeness of foreign policy will include a strong national \ndefense first, and Senator McCain was very clear in his statement on \nthat point. Second, the completeness of foreign policy will include a \nstrong economy. And third, foreign policy will include clear, concise, \ncomprehensive international policies--trade policies--all wrapped into \na foreign policy.\n  The two essential parts of a successful foreign policy in the 21st \ncentury will be, one, building consensus, building consensus both in \nthe United States with the American people and internationally by \nworking with coalitions of willing partners; and, two, projecting \nstrong U.S. leadership in the world.\n\n\n   Building Consensus through Alliances, Institutions and Coalitions\n\n  In the next century, the United States must work to build \ninternational consensus through coalitions, alliances and institutions. \nThe diffusion of power throughout the world will result in regional \nspheres of influence. In this structure and the challenges it presents, \nno one nation, no matter how powerful, can singlehandedly control the \noutcome.\n  Borderless challenges will require borderless solutions. The United \nStates will be most effective when we work with our allies and those \nwilling to work with us. That does not mean weakening or compromising \nour national sovereignty. But we will be successful when we work with \nothers to achieve our mutual goals. The coalition assembled by \nPresident Bush to drive Iraq from Kuwait was a good example of what we \ncan accomplish when working in concert with those who share our aims--\nall with mutual self-interests.\n  As we approach the 21st century, America must evaluate its current \npartnerships and build new ones. We first need to review our current \nglobal commitments, alliances, coalitions and institutions. Many of \nthese entities were created to address the challenges of a world that \nno longer exists.\n  The nations that assembled at Bretton Woods in 1944 and created the \nIMF and World Bank faced a dramatically different economic system than \nwe currently find today. The current debate that rages on and on and on \nover IMF funding and IMF reform is a timely example of this point.\n  I agree, as does the IMF, that it needs reform, but what kind of \nreform? Not the reform of glancing blows and cheap political rhetoric \nand demagogic rhetoric for partisan gain. Today, we are struggling to \ndefine our world's financial and economic infrastructure and center of \ngravity, even while we swirl and swirl in its sea of changes. What \nshould be the role of the G-7? Should it be revitalized? Is the G-7 \nstill relevant, especially since the introduction of the European \nMonetary Union?\n  The United Nations was formed during the beginning of the cold war \nand has gone far beyond its original charter and objectives. What \nshould be the role of the United Nations in the next century? How do we \ncontinue to fund it and at what amount? Is the United Nations \noverburdened with too many assignments and expectations? What about \nmissile defense for the United States of America? Is the 1972 ABM \nTreaty with a nation once described by President Reagan as being \n``relegated to the dustbin of history'' still relevant? Does this \ntreaty protect America from rogue nations with weapons of mass \ndestruction? I don't think so.\n  We need a debate on this issue. We need to take a clear-eyed, \ninsightful and penetrating look at these institutions and \nrelationships. We need to ask tough questions: Are they relevant to the \nchallenges of the 21st century? Are their objectives still meaningful? \nCan they adapt to address new challenges?\n  If we cannot answer these questions, then we need to change these \ninstitutions or create new ones to meet our\n\n[[Page S11144]]\n\ncurrent global economic and security challenges. One of the relevant \nnew organizations for the 21st century is the World Trade Organization. \nCreated to provide a structure for determining global trade practices \nand settling trade disputes, the WTO is a good example of an \norganization born to deal with the new challenges of the new century.\n  Regional alliances will play a greater role in a world unshackled \nfrom the restraints of the cold war. They will not be isolated blocs, \nbut regions of mutual interest within an interconnected world. These \ncoalitions will and do exist because of mutual economic and security \ninterests and can play an important role in expanding security, growth \nand opportunity in the world. They can help build, encourage and \nsupport new democracies and market economies and ensure hope for all \npeoples.\n  These are critical building blocks for the 21st century. As Hugh \nSidey once wrote:\n\n       Hope energizes . . . doubt destroys.\n\n  Hope is fundamental to the human condition. Without it, desperation \ntakes hold. We know desperate men do desperate things. War, conflict \nand poverty are the enemies of all peoples. America must pull back the \ncurtain of the status quo and take a long, thoughtful look at the \nneeds, problems and cultures of developing countries. If we would have \ntaken more care and invested more thought and time in Vietnam, we may \nnot have blundered into that tragic mistake.\n  The building of new regional alliances will require finding common \ndenominators of interests within a region. For example, the fate of the \nnations in the Caspian Sea region are linked to each other. No nation \nwill prosper in that area of the world until they all prosper. Much of \nEurope has already determined that it is in their mutual self-interest \nto link their monetary and currency policies through the creation of a \nsingle currency, the Euro. The conflict in the Middle East will not be \nresolved until there is regional peace. Economic prosperity also awaits \nthat peace.\n  Regional alliances left over from the cold war also need to be \nreviewed. We have done this to some extent with NATO when we added \nthree new members. But we need to step back and take a closer look at \nNATO and at the role NATO should play in a new century. What will be \nNATO's purpose? How far should NATO expand? Should it expand? What are \nthe consequences, costs and benefits of continued expansion of NATO? \nAny further expansion must be based on a clearly defined role for NATO.\n  In light of the current mass destruction and war in Kosovo of which \nSenator McCain spoke, and Bosnia before it, one must ask this question: \nIs NATO relevant since it is a European security organization? The \nslaughter in Kosovo goes on. Yet the world looks on while NATO and the \nUnited Nations stand by issuing empty ultimatums to Milosevic.\n  One could legitimately ask, What is the mission of NATO in the United \nNations? To stop the butchery in Kosovo? Or after a while stop it? Or \ntalk about stopping it? Or what? How long will NATO troops stay in \nBosnia, especially in light of the recent elections in Serbska where \nMrs. Plavsic, the candidate of the west, was defeated by the \nnationalist, Mr. Poplasen?\n  We are going to need to build new coalitions to address today's \nborderless challenges. These need not be former alliances or new \nmultilateral institutions. The United States needs to address today's \nchallenges with those nations willing and able to join us. Again, \nAmerica must lead.\n  Prime among those borderless challenges is navigating a global \neconomy. The current world financial crisis is presenting the best \nminds around the globe with unparalleled challenges. In some ways, we \nface a situation similar to when Christopher Columbus set sail from the \ncoast of Spain in the 15th century.\n  At that time, back onshore, the debate raged on whether the Earth was \nflat or round. The answers were unknown. Only by sailing the \nunpredictable seas and safely reaching the new world was Columbus able \nto deliver an answer. We are currently navigating the most turbulent of \neconomic waters. This storm of financial instability has left many of \nthe world's economies reeling. As of yet, the full brunt of this storm \nhas not yet reached American shores, but it is out there, and we do not \nknow what path it will take. Will it engulf Brazil and sweep up through \nthe Americas? We do not know. We do know that America alone cannot stem \nthis tide. We will only find a way to calm this storm by working with \nthe other nations of the world and by rethinking and restructuring \ninternational organizations like the IMF and the World Bank.\n  Free, fair, open trade will be the engine of growth in the new \ncentury, as it has been for the last half of the 20th century. All \nnations must work to break down barriers that inhibit global commerce \nand trade. Only then will all the world prosper. We in the United \nStates must do far more to educate our people and our leaders on this \nissue.\n  I have concluded, Mr. President--and you and I have worked on this \nissue for over 2 years--I have concluded that economic ignorance \nfavoring the short term over the long term and concentrations of \nselfish political and economic power are the main reasons why free, \nfair and open trade is not universally supported in the United States \nor in this Congress.\n  We must also stand up against protectionists at home and abroad who \nwould take the world back to the disastrous days of the 1930s. We must \nnot underestimate this threat, especially in light of last week's \ndefeat of fast track in the House of Representatives. Economic \nisolation is impossible if for no other reason than the world Internet \nrevolution.\n  Terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction pose \nthe greatest dangers and threats to global security in the 21st \ncentury. No nation will be immune and no one nation can fight these \nenemies alone. The trafficking of illegal drugs also threatens security \nand hope around the world. Those engaging in these despicable acts must \nbe made the pariahs of the civilized world, stopped at every turn and \ndealt with harshly. But we need coalitions built on mutual self-\ninterest to deal with these scourges.\n\n\n                       Projecting U.S. Leadership\n\n  While we must work with the other nations of the world, there can be \nno leadership by committee. We currently have a vacuum of leadership in \nthe world. History has taught us that the world is most dangerous and \nunpredictable when there are vacuums of global leadership.\n  Leaders and nations lead through the force of confidence, character, \nhonesty and trust. Our leadership must be based on credibility. The \nword of the United States should be the strongest of currencies in \ninternational relations. The nations of the world must trust our word \nand trust our commitment. We must remember the words of Teddy Roosevelt \nwho once said, ``The one indispensable requisite for both a nation and \nan individual is character.'' This gives America the moral authority to \nlead, not the religious authority, not the holy authority, but the \nmoral authority to lead.\n  Our allies must respect us and our adversaries must fear us. Rhetoric \nwithout actions will result in failure and will encourage dictators and \nworld instability. Today, again as Senator McCain mentioned minutes \nago, Iraq and North Korea are directly and openly challenging the \ncivilized world. The United States must have a clearly defined American \nforeign policy that is backed with the might of the U.S. military. \nGenuine leadership is more than crisis management. The ability to lead \nrests on others knowing where you stand.\n  The guarantor of a nation's foreign policy is its national defense. A \nnation's word is only as strong as the military and the will that \nstands behind it. The United States must make strengthening our \nmilitary one of its most immediate top priorities. Without a strong \nmilitary, our threats are hollow.\n\n\n             The Role Of Congress In Shaping Foreign Policy\n\n  The role of Congress in helping shape American foreign policy must be \ngreater as we move into the 21st century. America cannot lead the world \nwithout the support of the American people. Foreign policy and \neverything it encompasses must be relevant--must be relevant--to the \ndaily lives of the American people. Responsibility for\n\n[[Page S11145]]\n\nmaking foreign policy relevant ultimately rests with the President and \nhis foreign policy team. However, the Congress must be part of the \ndevelopment of foreign policy--setting objectives and priorities, \nproviding oversight and advice, allocating resources and helping set \nstrategic direction. Congress should be a full partner with the \nPresident in foreign policy. The Congress cannot implement or execute \nforeign policy, nor should it try. That is the President's job.\n  Foreign policy should be bipartisan. America's leaders need to speak \nwith one voice to the world. We may debate the best course in this \nCongress, in committee, as we should, but there is no room for partisan \npolitics and partisan gain in doing what is right in this Nation in the \ninternational arena. The Truman-Vandenberg relationship is a good \nmodel.\n  Engaging the American people is just one aspect of a greater role for \nCongress in shaping foreign policy. To craft policies that will allow \nAmerica to engage in and lead the world, Members of Congress will need \nto acknowledge and understand the completeness of foreign policy, the \ninterconnects of foreign policy.\n  What can Congress do? Over the next 2 years I propose--and I will be \nproposing this to the bipartisan leadership of this Congress--that the \n106th Congress, which will assemble in January of next year, start \nholding oversight hearings on every facet of America's foreign policy. \nCongress should encourage new ideas and new solutions from our best \nforeign policy thinkers during these hearings. The Foreign Relations \nCommittee in the Senate and the International Relations Committee in \nthe House should coordinate at these hearings, under the direction of \nthe bipartisan leadership of Congress, and review every multilateral \nrelationship the United States has, every institution, alliance and \ncoalition, review the mission, the organization, the relevancy, the \ncost, the benefits.\n\n  In many instances, there should be joint hearings with committees, \nsuch as Armed Services and Foreign Relations, Banking and Foreign \nRelations, Finance and Foreign Relations, and other combinations of \ncommittees. The results of these hearings should be summarized and sent \nto the President and his foreign policy team, every Member of Congress, \nthe President's Cabinet, and be made available to the American people. \nThe results of these hearings will help formulate America's foreign \npolicy for the next century.\n  In the next 2 years, Congress must develop a comprehensive trade \npolicy and pass much-needed trade reform legislation. Our trade policy \nneeds an overhaul to meet the challenges of a global economy, \nespecially our sanctions policy.\n  Sanctions are a legitimate foreign policy tool but they are not a \nsubstitute for foreign policy. Unilateral sanctions do not work in an \ninterconnected world. The imposition of sanctions fails to take into \naccount the long-term consequences for America and ties the President's \nhands, giving him no flexibility to react to the unique international \nsituations which may require delicate diplomacy, diplomatic \nmaneuvering, or decisive, tough, strong action.\n  Approving fast-track authority should be part of this trade package. \nCongress should make maximum use of blue-ribbon commissions like the \nRumsfeld Commission on missile defense and the Kassebaum-Baker \nCommission on gender-integrated training in our Armed Forces.\n  America wastes a tremendous amount of talent and experience when we \ndo not use our former highly respected members of Government and \nCongress to help us solve our complicated and interconnected challenges \nand problems. This will all stimulate and frame a national debate on \ncritically important issues that will help inform and educate America \non the great challenges, the important, the vital challenges of our \ntime. Foreign relations--and all that it encompasses--must not be held \nhostage to politics or partisan gain. It will not work any other way in \nthis interconnected world of short-term and long-term danger.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  When history records the world, and this time in the world, and the \nworld's move from the 20th to the 21st century, will it show that \nAmerica and the world squandered a most precious opportunity and unique \ntime in the history of man? Will it record an era of ``inter-cold war'' \nafter 40 years of cold war? A time of world anarchy and growing \ndisorder? A period when the world, in fact, went backwards and allowed \nthe progress of the last 50 years to erode? Will it lament \nopportunities not taken, and are thus forever lost?\n  The answers will be determined by the role the United States plays in \nthe world during the next few years. We do have choices. But the \nchoices we make first must be based on the values and the ideals of a \njust nation. Our foreign policy must be in our national interest--\nclearly defined, driven by priorities, objectives, and implemented with \nfocused strategies. A random conduct of foreign policy will not do. The \nPresident and the Congress must forge a strong bipartisan partnership \nunderpinned by a strong congressional bipartisan effort.\n  This Congress must use the next 2 years to help prepare America and \nthe world for this new dynamic competitive center. America must be \nnimble in putting together a coalition of countries allied around the \ncommon interests of civilized people. We must be smart in how we \nmultiply our power and interest around the world.\n  The United States must be careful not to overload multilateral \ninstitutions like the United Nations and the IMF. They are equipped to \ndo only so much. When their circuits are overloaded, they will fail, \nand fail dramatically, thus causing great uncertainty, leaving deep and \nwide vacuums of confidence in the world. The next 2 years are going to \nbe difficult years for the United States. They may be dangerous years, \nas well. The President of the United States is wounded. He is, maybe, \nfatally wound. This will affect his international standing and \nleadership. This is of his own doing. America must pull together to \npresent to the world a unified nation with respect to our global \nleadership responsibilities. We must do this so that we will continue \nto gain the confidence of the world that gives us the credibility to \ncontinue to lead the world. The Congress will be called upon for \ngreater international leadership. It must be prepared for this role.\n\n  For all our flaws and imperfections, the world looks to America for \nleadership because the world trusts us because of our people. Americans \nare innately fair and decent people with a wonderful abundance of \ncommon sense. Our system of government allows the fairness and decency \nof the American culture to dominate all aspects of our way of life. It \nallows the best of our people and our culture to soar high. Yes, we are \nsometimes misguided, heavy-handed and even arrogant. But we have this \nintangible ``self-correction'' process built deep into our national \npsyche. We can and often do ``self-correct''--both personally and \nnationally. Which the world sees, trusts, and admires.\n  It is within our grasp to help shape a world that has the potential \nto do more good for more people than man has ever known. This is an \nawesome responsibility but one that America is up to if America does \nwhat it always does best--work together. At the end, when the curtain \ncomes down, and we are held accountable, all that really matters is \nwhat this century's greatest leader, Winston Churchill, once said:\n\n       What is the use of living, if it be not to strive for noble \n     causes, and to make this muddled world a better place for \n     those who will live in it after we are gone?\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Under a previous order, there \nwill now be 25 minutes under the control of the Senator from Kansas, \nMr. Roberts.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, first, I commend my good friend and \ncolleague from Nebraska for providing the Senate and all of our \ncolleagues and all who have listened, and I hope, the Nation's press \nand the international press, a comprehensive statement with regard to \nforeign policy. We have many Senators who certainly have expertise in \nthis field, but I know of no one in the Senate who has given a more \narticulate overview of what America faces in our role to the world than \nSenator Hagel.\n\n[[Page S11146]]\n\n  Senator Hagel and I have been extremely concerned about the trade \npolicy of the United States, not only in regard to the administration, \nbut in regard to this Congress. In Nebraska and Kansas, States we are \nprivileged to represent, our livelihood, our very livelihood, depends \non progressive, consistent trade policy. We both know and we both have \ntalked for almost a year now about the Asian flu, the global contagion, \nand how that has impacted especially agriculture--our Kansas farmers \nand our Nebraska farmers--but everybody that depends on trade.\n  We have been very concerned about the lack of funding for IMF and \nnormal trading status for China, fast-track legislation--which, I must \nsay, the withdrawal of fast track and now the defeat of fast track in \nthe House is a terrible blow; it is like shattered glass, if you will. \nIt is like an embargo. I think we are going to pay enormous penalties \nfor that. And then sanction reform, as the Senator mentioned. Until we \nget our act together, until we get a consistent and positive policy in \nregard to trade, I am afraid we will go through some very, very \ndifficult times.\n  The Senator from Nebraska has seized the issue. He has given a very \ncomprehensive view. I want to thank him for it. I hope that many pay \nattention. I look forward to working with the Senator in this regard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/30/senate-section/article/S11142-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11146-S11148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 KOSOVO\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a related issue. \nThe Senator from Nebraska touched on foreign policy and how it affects \nour national security. I want to express my concern that President \nClinton and the United States, in coordination with NATO, is once again \npreparing to take military action with very little, if any dialog, with \nthe Congress or the American people.\n  Once again, the President of the United States may be about to \n``plant the flag'' of U.S. credibility that will lock this Nation in \nanother expensive, long involvement without any clear discussion--it \nmay be warranted; it may be in the national interest, but without any \nclear discussion of U.S. vital national interest--and that involvement \nis in a place in the world called Kosovo.\n  The news today is pretty grim. The news from Kosovo has been and \ncontinues to be very grim. In the Washington Post, here is a story as \nof this morning:\n  ``New Kosovo Massacre May Spur NATO To Act.'' This is not pretty. I \nam quoting from the Post story by Mr. Guy Dinmore:\n\n       Their bodies lay as they fell, throats cut or shot in the \n     back of the head--19 ethnic Albanians believed to have been \n     executed by Serbian police units in the most harrowing \n     massacre of civilians since warfare erupted in Kosovo seven \n     months ago.\n       Relatives and neighbors today dug graves for the dead--most \n     of them women, children and elderly people--as they tearfully \n     recounted the massacre that occurred Saturday when government \n     forces entered this village in the Serbian province of Kosovo \n     following the killing of seven policemen by separatist \n     guerrillas.\n       With the death toll in the bitter conflict between \n     government forces and ethnic Albanian rebels steadily \n     mounting and little sign that Serbia will adhere to a \n     unilateral cease-fire senior NATO sources said today there is \n     a growing possibility that the Western alliance will \n     intervene militarily in Kosovo as early as next month.\n       Serbia is the dominant Republic of Yugoslavia, and NATO \n     sources say the alliance's next step would be to deliver an \n     ultimatum to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic demanding \n     a cease-fire and full access to refugees from the Kosovo \n     conflict. If the demands are not met, they said, NATO would \n     proceed with plans set in motion at a NATO defense ministers \n     meeting last week to launch airstrikes against Serbian \n     targets. Last week, the U.N. Security Council issued a call \n     for an immediate cease-fire and the withdrawal of government \n     forces from Kosovo.\n\n  In the New York Times--and as Senator McCain pointed out a few short \nmoments ago, and completes the pictures--there is a very disturbing \nstory summed up:\n\n       Senior officials in Washington and NATO last week stepped \n     up their threats of military force against Milosevic and \n     demanded that his forces stop their rampage.\n\n  A USA Today headline, ``Yugoslavian Army Takes Steps to Avoid \nStrikes.''\n\n       Up to 150 Yugoslavian army vehicles pulled out of southern \n     Kosovo Tuesday in an apparent move to avoid NATO airstrikes, \n     Yugoslavia media reported. But the Pentagon said it had seen \n     no evidence of a large-scale pull back, and NATO stepped up \n     its plans for military strikes to stop the Yugoslav \n     onslaught.\n\n  Then in the London Times, a story by Tom Walker, the reporter who \ndiscovered the tragedy:\n\n       I discovered the bodies of 16 Albanian civilians [now it is \n     up to 19] massacred by Serb forces in a remote village in \n     Kosovo yesterday.\n\n  I won't go into the gory details.\n  The international press and our local national press are forecasting \nwhat I think everybody in the Senate certainly is aware of.\n  I commend to my colleagues the latest issue of Time Magazine. The \nheadline reads, ``The Balkan Mess: The West has been fiddling while \nKosovo burns and regional peace strategies falter.''\n  This is precisely the topic that Senator Hagel was talking about. I \ndon't like saying this, but the headline says it: ``And Bill Clinton is \ntoo distracted to pay proper attention.''\n  The highlights of the article are as follows:\n\n       But Kosovo is far and away the worst of the current crises. \n     Vowing not to permit another slaughter like Bosnia's, the \n     NATO allies threatened Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic \n     last June with airstrikes unless he halted his security \n     forces' attacks on the rebellious Albanians. Even if Clinton \n     hadn't been bedeviled by scandal, the threat would have been \n     difficult to carry out. France [in typical fashion] refused \n     to go along with the military action unless the U.N. Security \n     Council approved, and Russia promised to veto any resolution \n     that authorized it.\n       Washington was also stuck in internal wrangling. Secretary \n     of State Madeleine Albright wanted the White House to push \n     harder for NATO military action, but Defense Secretary \n     William Cohen balked, fearing air strikes would only \n     embolden the Kosovo Liberation Army, then at the peak of \n     its strength and demanding an independent state, which \n     Washington opposed. Clinton was too distracted to knock \n     bureaucratic heads or force the allies to carry out their \n     threat. The indecision ``proved to be a disaster,'' said a \n     U.S. diplomat. ``Milosevic took the measure of the west \n     and decided he could take advantage of it.''\n       By last month, The Serb leader had turned his \n     counteroffensive against the rebel army into a campaign of \n     terror against Albanian villages. Suddenly, whole sections of \n     the population were being driven from their homes, but the \n     Western response remained inaudible. In part, critics charge \n     that the U.S. tacitly let Milosevic go ahead because the West \n     also wanted to break the back of the rebel army, whose lack \n     of structure threatened regional stability.\n\n  That is a sad, sad commentary if in fact that is true.\n\n       So last week the Security Council finally passed a Franco-\n     British resolution demanding that Milosevic halt his \n     offensive and begin negotiations, or face the possibility of \n     armed intervention. The attack plan calls for U.S. cruise \n     missiles to be launched first . . .\n\n  I'll repeat that.\n\n       The attack plan calls for U.S. cruise missiles to be \n     launched first against Serb military targets in Kosovo; then, \n     if needed, NATO would mount a wider air campaign outside \n     Kosovo against security facilities in Serbia.\n       Even if the Administration rouses itself to take charge of \n     the Balkan situation--\n\n  Senator Hagel tried to point this out, and Senator McCain has tried \nto point this out, as others have--\n\n     damage to U.S. foreign policy may have already been done. \n     Allies sense distraction and are growing worried, but are \n     unable to step in. Enemies may see opportunities for making \n     mischief.\n\n  That is certainly true, with the third-stage rocket being tested by \nNorth Korea, and Saddam Hussein is certainly not behaving. And India \nand Pakistan are continuing their war of words. There is very little \njustification, by the way, for the missile strike in regard to Sudan \nand the Khartoum chemical plant. I won't go into all of that, but let \nme say on record that I do not think that the justification can be \nverified:\n\n       Enemies may see opportunities for making mischief. For \n     rogue leaders like Saddam Hussein and North Korea's Kim Jong \n     Il, the Balkans may convey a different message: Now is the \n     best time to take what they want.\n\n  Senator McCain talked about this last week, and he did so a few \nmoments ago, also. Last week, he repeated the observation made by the \nformer majority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, who tearfully told an \naudience he had been to Kosovo and was shocked in regard to the number \nthat have been killed, the atrocities, and the tragedy that 250,000 \npeople are in the mountains hiding,\n\n[[Page S11147]]\n\ntrying to prevent them and their families from being killed. I don't \nknow what is going to happen, but it is a human tragedy. Bob Dole said, \n``For goodness sake, let's not repeat Bosnia.''\n  Let me say that I just came from an intelligence briefing as of \nyesterday with Senator DeWine of Ohio. He and I are extremely concerned \nabout the situation. I can tell you that our sources from the various \nintelligence assets certainly confirm what the press has reported--a \nhuman tragedy in the making, a foreign policy disaster that bears upon \nthe ability of NATO to function. Now, what do we do about it? Last \nJuly, I offered an amendment to the Defense Appropriations bill that \nrequired the President to come before the American people and the \nCongress before he committed the U.S. to a military involvement in \nterms of Kosovo. The amendment asked the President to address several \nitems to make his case before we intervened.\n  Why is it in our national interest? You can argue it both ways. You \ncan say we are into another Bosnia, another $10 billion, and year after \nyear of presence; or you can say that the future of NATO is in danger. \nYou can even make a case that it is in our national interest to \nintervene. But regarding the amendment, I went on to ask, how many \ntroops will be required? Now, that is a good question because when the \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama, Chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee, and I were visiting the new NATO countries just a month or 2 \nago, we were at a social event and one of the generals who certainly \nplays an important role regarding NATO indicated to me privately that \nit would take 70,000 troops to be on the ground-- ``peacekeepers,'' as \nhe called them. I have no idea how 70,000 troops can be in that part of \nthe world, with that rough terrain, in the middle of winter, with no \naccessible roads and a very difficult situation where the Serbs are \ntrying to kill the ethnic Albanians. I don't know how we can put 70,000 \ntroops in there. But if we are going to do that, we at least ought to \ngo over those contingencies.\n  Then, again, I stated it should be mandatory to state what the \nobjectives would be, when we expected the troops to be withdrawn, and \nwhat criteria would signal ``mission complete,'' what the cost would be \nand what would be the funding source.\n  I am going to interrupt again and say that, yesterday, as Senator \nMcCain pointed out, the Joint Chiefs of Staff came before the Congress, \nand it was a pretty candid session. That is putting it mildly. I don't \nagree with the press coverage in the Post as of this morning regarding \nSenators raising holy ned with the Joint Chiefs of Staff. We wanted \ncandor and they gave us candor, and it pointed out that the joint \nchiefs--all of the services combined said we need $21 billion to keep \nour services in a status where at least we could honor our \nresponsibilities regarding readiness.\n  I pointed out that the President has requested $1 billion. It has to \nbe offset in the rest of the defense budget. The Marine Corps needed \n$1.9 billion just to put new tires on trucks, and other essentials. So \nhe is going to get $51 million, but he has to offset it in another way. \nThe rest of the services said we need $5 billion or $6 billion, or the \n``nose of the plane,'' in terms of readiness, will go into the ground, \nand the President requested $1 billion that has to be offset, and $1.9 \nbillion in terms of emergency funding regarding Bosnia. This is a \ndisaster. We do not even have enough funds to keep our services in a \nreadiness posture, and here we are talking about going into Kosovo, and \nperhaps we should, but there has been no dialog. What would be the \nimpact on an overstressed military? We are stressed and we are strained \nand we are hollow in some portions.\n  The distinguished present occupant of the Chair summarized it very \nwell when we had that hearing. The Senator from Oklahoma was the \nReadiness Subcommittee chairman. He had a hearing last week that \npointed this out. The first obligation to the Federal Government is to \nguarantee our national security, and we are not doing that today. Also, \nas of today, nothing has been heard on the subject from the \nadministration regarding Kosovo. Now, that train has left the station \nwhile the Nation has been preoccupied with other matters.\n  Let me point out what has happened in the Serbian province of Kosovo \nsince July. Mr. Milosevic has steadily increased the level of violence \nagainst the Albanian majority. Estimates put the number of deaths at \nseveral hundred. We read the latest reports, and the number of refugees \nis probably around 250,000. As I have indicated before, we have \nintelligence assets and there is talk of humanitarian relief--and I am \nfor that--but we can't even find these folks. Why? Because they are \nhiding in the trees, on the mountains, in the snow, and women and \nchildren are starving, because they are afraid Serbs will kill them. \nNATO has developed plans for military action against the Serbian \nforces. I will point out that NATO had a flyover, called ``Determined \nFalcon.'' That was one falcon who wasn't very determined. These planes \nflew over for about 3 minutes. What was the signal sent to the Serbs? \nWe were not really serious about it. They took advantage. What was the \nmessage that was given to liberation army on the other side? It was: I \nthink the United States is going to come to our aid. So there wasn't \nany real dialog. I wonder why that demonstration was even started.\n  Humanitarian groups, including U.S. State Department, have warned \nthat a human disaster is in the making if the refugees do not find \nshelter and food before winter starts. Winter has started. This week, \nthe first snows have fallen in Kosovo.\n  The U.N. has adopted a resolution under Article 7 of the U.N. Charter \ndemanding an immediate cease-fire. Under Article 7, military force can \nbe used to ``compel compliance,'' Mr. President.\n  NATO members are being canvassed about the number of troops and \nequipment they are willing to commit to an ``undefined operation in \nKosovo.'' We have several hundreds troops in Macedonia. The general \ntold us, when we were over in the NATO countries, they need at least \n70,000 people. You know the U.S. would have a larger portion than 200 \nor 300.\n  I am calling for the administration to come to the Congress now and \nnot after a military action and the commitment of U.S. credibility and \nfully discuss what the plans are, what is the objective, how many \ntroops, what is the cost, what is the national interest for military \naction in Kosovo. None of the questions addressed in my amendment have \nbeen answered, but it is clear to me the United States and NATO are \nvery close to a prolonged, costly involvement in another part of the \nBalkans.\n  And the risks of such an involvement is great. The risk of not taking \naction is equally great. As I have indicated, we have several hundred \nU.S. troops on the ground in the neighboring country of Macedonia. What \nrisk would they be in if we strike? What is the risk of destabilizing \nthe entire region if we incite a broader conflict in Kosovo? What is \nthe risk if we do not? How likely will a conflict in Kosovo draw Turkey \nand Greece into the fray as opponents? These are tough issues. They \nrequire very close examination before we get involved, and not after a \nmilitary demonstration strike of cruise missiles.\n  The administration and the national security team, with all due \nrespect, is the most doggone outfit I have ever seen in terms of \nplanting the flag; and, then, after the flag is planted we have the \nchoice of whether we are going to withdraw while the troops are in the \nfield. You can't do that. So the flag is planted, and then we are \nstuck.\n  If the administration thinks threats of military action may alter the \nbehavior of President Milosevic, what clearer signal of intent could we \nsend that we were prepared to forcibly stop the violence against the \nAlbanians than by having the President of the United States lay out the \nissues to the American people?\n  It might be a good idea to come back and confer with the Senate, as \nSenator Warner, the distinguished Senator from Virginia, the leading \nspokesman for defense and foreign policy, has requested the \nadministration to come up and consult. It might be a good idea to get \noff the fundraising trail, Mr. President, and come back and do that.\n  The President owes this Nation and the Congress the full explanation \nof intent if we are to become even more involved in Kosovo.\n  There is no need to discuss the military details of any proposed \naction. I\n\n[[Page S11148]]\n\nam not asking for that. No one is asking for that. We don't need to \nknow the timing, or the types or selection of weapon platforms. But we \ndo need a dialogue on why this is necessary, and why this is in our \nU.S. vital national interests.\n  I indicated just a moment ago that Senator Warner has requested \nSecretary Cohen, our national security adviser to the President, Sandy \nBerger, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and anybody else that \nwill listen, especially the President of the United States, to please \ncome down here, to please come to the Capitol, and to please consult \nwith us. What is going on?\n  As I have indicated, we are having a very tough time in regard to the \nnational defense.\n  As I said, it is a national disgrace. And before we commit American \nmen and women in uniform to a possible combat role overseas and an \nadditional role as opposed to what we are doing in Bosnia, we have to \nbe consulted. Mr. President, what is going on?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/30/senate-section/article/S11146-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11148-S11150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE BALANCED BUDGET\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I don't know to what extent it will run in \nheadlines in the papers tomorrow or to what extent it will be a feature \non the news tonight, but today is a very important day because today, \nfor the first time since 1969, the Federal Government has balanced its \nbudget. Today, for the first time since 1969, the Federal Government \nhas done what every family and every business in America has to do \nevery year, and that is balance their books. And it is a very big deal. \nIt is a very big deal because it gives direct benefits to every citizen \nbecause we are not going to borrow any money next year. What it means \nis that the Federal Government, with all of its borrowing power, will \nnot be crowding out small businesses, will not be competing against \nhomeowners, and, as a result, rather than the Federal Government \nrunning a $200 billion deficit, which would be $200 billion we would \nborrow, taking it away from small businesses that would have created \njobs and new economic opportunity, taking it away from families that \nwould build new homes, new farms, and invest in building new factories, \nnow that money will go in the private sector.\n  I noticed on Saturday that there was a headline in the Real Estate \nsection that said, ``Loan Rates Fall to 30-year Low.'' It is not a \ncoincidence that we have balanced the budget for the first time in 30 \nyears. If we had a deficit today at the same level that we had 5 years \nago, mortgage rates, rather than being 7 percent, would probably be \n9.5.\n  What that would mean is that millions of Americans who today can \nbuild and buy their own homes would not be able to build and buy those \nhomes. People would be paying hundreds of dollars a month in interest \npayments that they are not now paying. We have literally created \nmillions of jobs. We have seen the largest growth in equity values in \nthe history of the country. Today, the average American family has more \nmoney in financial assets than it does in the equity of its home. That \nhas never happened before in American history, and it is probably true \nthat last year the average white-collar worker saw the value of their \nfinancial assets in their 401(k)s and their IRAs grow more than their \nincome.\n  So the American people are happy. The approval rating for the \nPresident is at a record high. The approval rating for Congress is at \nthe highest ever recorded for any Congress in history. And I think the \nbasic reason is because we have balanced the Federal budget, the \neconomy is strong, and, despite all the economic problems in the world, \nthere is one economic oasis of prosperity, and that economic oasis is \nAmerica. It is the product of a Government which has been willing to \nsay no when no is the right answer.\n  What I would like to do today is the following. I would like to try \nto address this sort of age-old question of who did it. I don't want to \nspend a lot of time on that because I am willing personally to give \ncredit to lots of different people and institutions, but I want to make \nan important point about the role of the American people. I then want \nto talk about a threat that I see on the horizon, and that threat is \nthat I see growing signs in the waning days of this session that \nCongress is poised, at the prodding of the President, to initiate \nanother spending spree that could endanger the surplus, that could \ndrive up interest rates, and that could reverse everything that we have \ndone.\n  So let me begin with a question. I have a chart here. It is about \nbalancing the budget, and it really poses the questions: Who led? Who \nfollowed? And who got out of the way? My guess is, to the extent that \nanybody in the country is interested, there is going to be a lot of \neffort today for people to try to claim credit, so I thought it would \nbe instructive to go back to 1995.\n  In 1995, we have a new Congress, a Republican majority for the first \ntime since 1954. We have had a dramatic election which has changed the \npolitical landscape of the country. And President Clinton, in January \nof 1995, submits a budget that has a deficit of approximately $200 \nbillion. That $200 billion deficit rises for a couple of years and then \nbasically comes back to a $200 billion level. In fact, the President in \nthat budget that he submitted showed for the fiscal year 1998 an on-\nbudget deficit of $274.8 billion, with an off-budget surplus with \nSocial Security of $78 billion. So roughly a $200 billion deficit. That \nwas the budget the President submitted in 1995.\n\n  The new Republican Congress submitted a budget that sought to \nimplement this document which was much discussed in 1995--is largely \nforgotten today; unfairly forgotten, in my opinion--and this document \nis the Contract With America: A Bold Plan to Change America.\n  The budget that flowed from this plan--this plan principally being a \nplan developed by Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey in the House--produced a \nbudget submission that, for the first time since 1969, proposed to \nbalance the budget, in this case over a 7-year period, with a practical \nprogram to achieve that result.\n  What actually happened? You can look at the red to see what Clinton \nproposed, and that is $200 billion deficits as far as you can see. You \ncan see what the new Republican Congress proposed, and that is a \nproposal to gradually, consistently lower the deficit to balance the \nbudget in the year 2002.\n  Finally, you can see in yellow and black what actually happened. What \nactually happened was, with the election of a Republican majority in \nboth Houses of Congress, interest rates started to fall immediately, \nequity values started to rise almost immediately, and the net result \nis, the American people started to believe that something might have \nactually changed because they went to the polls in 1994 and voted for a \nchange. The net result is, we have a balanced budget today.\n  The point I want to make is, if you want to know who led, the \nAmerican people led. Those who should be given credit here--and I think \nthe lion's share of the credit--are basically the people who came out \nand voted for a change in 1994. Elections have consequences. Elections \nmake a difference. They rarely live up to their billing. We did reform \nwelfare. The House did vote on every item they committed to in the \nContract With America. But, as you know, the President vetoed the \nspending cuts and the substantial tax cut contained in the Contract \nWith America. So Republicans advertised more than they were actually \nable to deliver.\n  The point is, by changing the political environment in Washington, \nDC, the American people did the rest. The economy performed, and we \nhave a balanced budget today.\n  Who led? The American people led. Who followed? Republicans followed. \nAnd who got out of the way, and reluctantly got out of the way? Bill \nClinton.\n  Today, we are facing a new crisis. I guess it was predictable. With a \nsurplus, the first surplus in many of our adult lives, we are seeing an \nintensifying debate about what to do about it.\n\n[[Page S11149]]\n\n  Everybody will remember the President in the State of the Union \nAddress stood up and said:\n\n       But whether the issue is tax cuts or spending, I ask all of \n     you to meet this test: Approve only those priorities that can \n     actually be accomplished without adding a dime to the \n     deficit.\n       Now, if we balance the budget for next year, it is \n     projected that we'll then have a sizable surplus in the years \n     that immediately follow. What should we do with this \n     projected surplus? I have a simple . . . answer: save Social \n     Security first.\n       Tonight, I propose that we reserve 100 percent of the \n     surplus . . . every penny of [it going to Social Security].\n\n  That is what the President said on January 27.\n  Then he said it even more clearly on February 9. This was in a speech \non Social Security at Georgetown University. He said:\n\n       I think it should be the driving principle of this year's \n     work in the U.S. Congress: Do not have a tax cut; do not have \n     a spending program that deals with that surplus; save Social \n     Security first.\n\n  Interestingly enough, this clear rhetoric by President Clinton has \nstarted to change. If you follow the evolution of it, it has changed in \none fundamental way, and that is, he has stopped talking about \nspending. All he is talking about now is tax cuts.\n  I read from the Washington Times on September 27. The President says:\n\n       The Republican tax plan drains billions of dollars from the \n     surplus before we have done the hard work of strengthening \n     Social Security. It is dead wrong to return a portion of the \n     surplus to the American people via tax cuts.\n\n  But for the last month, the President has not mentioned spending.\n  The President started out in January saying, ``Don't spend it, and \ndon't give it back in tax cuts.'' When the President stood up and said \nthose things, since I and many others have been working on trying to \ndevelop a plan to rebuild the financial foundations of Social Security, \nI applauded.\n  What has happened--and it has been a subtle change which I am sure \nhas not been recognized by many people--is the President has gone from \nsaying, ``Don't spend it, and don't give it back in tax cuts, save it \nfor Social Security,'' to, ``It's dead wrong to return a portion of the \nsurplus to the American people via tax breaks.''\n  What is left out is a discussion of spending.\n  The minority leader, Senator Daschle, says:\n\n       We're not opposed to tax cuts, we're just opposed to using \n     the Social Security trust fund to pay for those tax cuts.\n\n  Where is the rhetoric about using the Social Security trust fund to \npay for new spending?\n  Let me tell you why the President and his supporters have stopped \ntalking about spending. They have stopped talking about spending \nbecause they have started spending.\n  Under the President's proposals, those that have already been adopted \nand those that are pending before the Congress and those that are being \ndealt with day and night now in the last 2 weeks of this session, the \nPresident has proposed busting the budget by up to $20 billion.\n  The tax cut in the House, which the President has committed to veto \nbecause it takes money away from Social Security, costs, according to \nthe Congressional Budget Office, $6.6 billion in fiscal year 1999. The \nPresident has said, ``Don't give that $6.6 billion back to the American \npeople; save it for Social Security.'' But the President has proposed, \nand Congress has either adopted or is in the process of adopting, up to \n$20 billion of new spending.\n  I ask the question: If it hurts Social Security to give $6.6 billion \nback to working families, to repeal the marriage penalty and to get rid \nof the earnings test which prevents people who are retired from being \nable to work to supplement their income without losing their Social \nSecurity--both of those provisions I strongly support, but both those \nprovisions I am willing to defer if the money is going to Social \nSecurity. What I don't understand is, if it is wrong to give $6.6 \nbillion back in tax cuts, how can it be right to spend $20 billion--\nover three times as much--on new Government programs?\n  So the President's first speech was right in January. He told the \nwhole story: ``Don't spend it. Don't give it back in tax cuts. Use it \nto save Social Security.'' But for the last month, the President never \nmentions spending anymore. You read quote after quote from the \nPresident's allies, and over and over and over again you find the same \nthing: They are against cutting taxes, but they never mention spending.\n  Congressman Bonior, who is the House Democrat Whip, said in the \ndebate on the tax cut, ``This tax bill is a raid on the Social Security \ntrust fund. It is nothing less.'' Where is his speech about $20 billion \nworth of new Government programs now pending before this Congress?\n  Are we concerned about raiding the trust fund only when the money is \ngoing back to working Americans, or do we have any concern when the \nmoney is going to spend money on the same old Government programs? \nObviously, for some people it is only a problem if it is going back to \nthe taxpayer; if Government is spending it, it is not a problem.\n  Some might ask, how is this happening, given that we have a budget \nand that we have committed to a balanced budget? Well, how it is \nhappening is a loophole in that agreement that allows the President to \ndeclare spending an emergency. And by declaring it as an emergency, it \ncan become law in violation of the budget.\n  I want to, in the brief time I have left--and let me ask, Mr. \nPresident, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 40 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I ask unanimous consent that I have 10 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me review for you the emergencies the President wants \nto spend money on. Let me remind you of the Daschle quote. And the \nDaschle quote was, he was not against tax cuts, he was simply against \ntaking the money away from Social Security.\n  I am not going to argue that any of these things are bad uses of \nmoney, but what I am going to argue is, they are not emergencies, most \nof them are ongoing problems. We are spending $1.7 trillion in the \nFederal budget this year. Any one of these things could have been \nfunded had the President chosen to make them a priority. But back when \nhe submitted his budget, they were not even a priority, they did not \nexist as a priority. Today they are an emergency. Why? Because the \nPresident wants to bust the budget and spend $20 billion.\n  The first problem is the problem related to the fact that we are \nabout to enter a new millennium. It seems that we have suddenly \ndiscovered that the year 2000 is only 2 years away--in fact, a year and \n3 months away.\n  Does this come as a shock to anyone? And I thought I would look back \nat: How long have we known there was going to be a year 2000? Some \nmight find it instructive that we started using the term ``in the Year \nof Our Lord,'' AD, in the calendars in the year 525--an abbot in Rome \nstarted in the year 525 to measure dates in the modern era from the \nbirth of Christ--``in the Year of Our Lord.'' It came into common usage \nand then was officially adopted by papal decree in the Gregorian \ncalendar in 1582. In short, we have known for 1,470 years that the year \n2000 was coming, and yet all of a sudden it is an emergency.\n  If we have a problem with computers about the year 2000, why did \nthose problems not exist when the President submitted his budget? Why \nall of a sudden is this an emergency? Well, my point is, it is clearly \nnot a surprise. For 1,470 years we have known the year 2000 was coming, \nand for at least the last decade we have known that some computers \nwould have difficulty in making the transition. We have an \nadministration that claims to be a high-tech, computer-literate \nadministration. Our Vice President pled in vain for the Government to \ntake over and create an information superhighway where the Government \nwould run the Internet. We rejected it. And now the Internet continues \nto flourish as basically a private system.\n  But the point is, the President is asking between $3.25 billion and \n$5.4 billion as an emergency for something we have known about for \n1,470 years and something he could have asked money for and did not \nwhen he submitted his budget.\n  The second emergency is, we are going to have to do a census in the\n\n[[Page S11150]]\n\nyear 2000. That hardly comes as a surprise. The Constitution, in \narticle I, requires that there be a census every 10 years. We have done \na census every 10 years in the history of the Republic. It is hardly a \nsurprise that we are going to do a census this year. But everybody who \nis familiar with it knows that this administration has consistently \nunderfunded the census, and now they are on the verge of declaring it \nan emergency, when they created the emergency.\n  Embassy security. Everybody knows the terrible tragedy of where we \nhad two Embassies bombed in Africa. Both of those Embassies had asked \nfor enhanced security, and in both cases the administration had \nrejected it, to spend money on other things. But the important point \nis, the $1.6 billion being requested will be spent over the next 10 \nyears.\n  I could understand if you said, ``Well, we want to begin it now, and \nuntil we can write a new budget and make it part of our budget, would \nyou designate that as an emergency?'' I could understand that. But the \nPresident is asking us to designate as emergency spending an item which \nwe have been debating and looking at for a decade and an item which in \nmany cases the money will not actually be spent, and the construction \nwill not occur, for 4 or 5 or 6 years.\n  Then there is defense readiness. All of a sudden, this administration \nhas discovered that we have been cutting defense spending every day \nthat President Clinton has been in office. And these dramatic \nreductions in defense spending are beginning to affect retention, they \nare beginning to affect recruitment, they are beginning to affect \nmodernization.\n  This is hardly a surprise. Many Members of the Senate, both Democrats \nand Republicans, have stood up and denounced these cuts in defense. But \nyet they have been made so that money could be spent on programs that \nwere deemed by this administration to be of higher priority. Now that \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff have gone public for something they clearly \nmust have known for years, but remained silent about because the \nprocess has become politicized, in my opinion. Now the President is \nsaying we have an emergency in defense.\n  My point is, this emergency was created by an administration that \nwould not support defense, and now they want to bust the budget to try \nto correct problems that they produced. My alternative is, let the \nPresident, in next year's budget, propose a permanent change in defense \nspending within the overall cap in spending that he agreed to last \nyear. And I will support it. But let's not raid Social Security to try \nto correct a problem that, in fact, has been created by our own budget \ndecisions.\n  The next emergency is Bosnia. There is an emergency because we have \ndiscovered that we have troops in Bosnia.\n  That sounds almost comical.\n  We sent troops to Bosnia in December of 1995 and they were supposed \nto be there until December of 1996. Then we expanded the mission in \nOctober of 1996 and they were supposed to be there until March 1997. \nAgain in November 1996 we extended the deployment of troops to Bosnia \nuntil June 1998. Finally, in December of 1997 the President announced \nthat troops would be deployed to Bosnia indefinitely.\n  Now, how can it be an emergency to fund troops in Bosnia when they \nhave been there since 1995 and the President has told us they are going \nto be there indefinitely? Why didn't the President put money in his \nbudget to pay for troops in Bosnia? You know why he didn't. He didn't \nbecause he wanted to take the money out of Social Security.\n  So here is where we are and this is the concern that I want to raise. \nThe President has said--and rightly so, in my opinion--we have a big \njob to do next year in fixing Social Security. Don't cut taxes, don't \nincrease spending, and let's take this surplus and fix Social Security \nfirst and then we will decide what to do if any is left. That is what \nhe said on January 27 of 1998. Since then, the President has said less \nand less about spending, more and more about taxes, and now the \nPresident is saying, ``Don't cut taxes with a Social Security \nsurplus;'' but, at the same time, the President is pushing $20 billion \nworth of new spending. The tax cut passed in the House would cost $6.6 \nbillion; the President is talking about increasing spending by $20 \nbillion.\n  Now, my point is a very simple point. If it hurts our ability to save \nSocial Security to cut taxes by $6.6 billion, and that is wrong, how \ncan it be the right thing to do to increase spending by $20 billion--\nmore than three times as much?\n  The bargain I would like to strike so that I and others could support \nthe President on a bipartisan basis: we won't do our tax cut, you don't \ndo your spending. Let's just say no. Then next year, let's fix Social \nSecurity. I believe we will have money left for a substantial tax cut \nnext year, but let's not start a spending spree this year that would \nendanger our ability to save Social Security next year.\n  Now, I know that as people get ready to go home it is always hard to \nnot say yes to every spending interest in the country. But I believe \nthe President took the right position in January. He has changed that \nposition now.\n  My proposal is straightforward and simple: Don't cut taxes this year \nand don't increase spending this year. Save the $6.6 billion that we \nwould have used on tax cuts for Social Security next year; save the $20 \nbillion or as much of it that we can that we would have spent this year \nfor Social Security next year. And once we have fixed Social Security, \nthen let's look at cutting taxes for the American people.\n  That is the challenge. We are going to see this debate in the next \nfew weeks. I intend to be here saying no on spending--not because I \ndon't want to build up defense. I voted against many of the defense \ncuts of the last 5 years. But nobody can say that this is an emergency \nwhen we created it and the President created it through his budget \nproblems or policy. Nobody can say it is a shock that the year 2000 is \ncoming and the President didn't know about it when he sent us his \nbudget in January. Nobody can say they didn't know we were going to do \na census. Nobody can say they didn't know we were going to be in \nBosnia. These are not emergencies as the law was intended to apply to \nemergencies.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand up for the President's position and \ncall on the President to do it. The President said on January 27th, \ndon't cut taxes and don't increase spending. I say yes, don't cut \ntaxes, don't increase spending.\n  The only problem is the President continues to say don't cut taxes, \nbut the President is the driving force behind an effort to increase \nspending by $20 billion this year. And that spending, every penny of \nit, will come out of Social Security, and it will diminish our ability \nto rebuild the financial foundations of Social Security. I say no.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from South Dakota is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Susan Hansen \nof my staff have floor privileges during my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have reached an extraordinary point in \nour Nation's contemporary history with the finding of the Office of \nManagement and Budget that we will, in fact, at the end of this fiscal \nyear, be running a significant budget surplus.\n  I think there are a great number of causes for that, a great number \nof people who could be commended for that, but I think to put this in \nsome perspective, it is worthwhile to note that some 6 years ago when \nPresident Clinton took office, the annual deficit each year by the U.S. \nGovernment was running in the range of $292 billion each year. We were \nspending $292 billion more revenue than we had coming in. The size of \nthe Federal deficit had exploded through the 1980s, and we had reached, \nfinally, this terrible point in 1992.\n  Since that time, we have had 6 years of successive declines in the \nFederal budget deficit until, finally, this year for the first time in \n30 years we are now at least in a unified budget in surplus.\n  What an extraordinary accomplishment. At a time when other nations' \neconomies are suffering, this country\n\n[[Page S11151]]\n\nhas reduced its debt relative to its gross domestic product to a lower \nlevel than any other industrialized nation on Earth. Again there are a \ngreat many people who can take some credit for this. But I think that \nthe leadership of this White House has been a key part of it.\n  Now, the Senator who preceded me had a chart showing one of President \nClinton's plans. It did not show the plan that actually was acted upon \nwhich has led to this decline in the deficit. It did show the \nalternative competing Republican plan that was offered in 1992 which, \nas many of us recall, was premised on plundering the Medicare fund, \neducation, and the environment. One of the constructive steps that this \nPresident took was to lead the way, ultimately with a budget plan which \nbrought us to a balanced budget--in fact, to a surplus--and showed, in \nfact, we did not need to plunder education, Medicare, and health care \nin order to get to this point.\n  So we have had 6 years of declining deficits. That is the good news. \nHowever, there is a point of great concern that I have as a member of \nthe Senate Budget Committee. That is, we reached this point because \nthere was an agreement between Congress and the President that we would \nput our country on a pay-as-you-go basis. That is, no tax cuts unless \nit is simultaneously explained who is going to pay more taxes or whose \nprograms will be cut to pay for those tax cuts, and no spending \nincreases unless it is simultaneously explained who is going to pay \nmore taxes or have their programs cut to pay for those increases. Every \nstep had to be budget neutral, scored over a 5-year period by the \nOffice of Management and Budget and by the Congressional Budget Office, \nthe CBO.\n  After years of wandering in the wilderness of faulty and unsuccessful \nmechanisms that go back over a decade, we finally reached a formula \nthat put this country on a commonsense, pay-as-you-go basis, something \nwe should have been doing for 200 years but which we have been doing \nnow for about 6 years.\n  Because we now have this unified budget surplus, we find there are \nthose in Congress who grow giddy about this projected surplus. By some \nprojections it could run as high as $1.6 trillion over the next decade. \nKeep in mind that those projections are not money in hand, they are \nsimply projections, and they are premised on the notion that our \ncountry will continue to have economic growth in the range of 2.2 GDP \ngrowth annually from here to the horizon, and that we will never \nstumble into a recession and that our economy will never slow down \nagain.\n\n  Well, while we have had a remarkable run of good fortune over the \nyears of the Clinton Presidency, with record low unemployment, low \ninflation and high economic growth, I think it would be foolhardy for \nany of us to assume that somehow business cycles have been abolished, \nthat we are on an upward plain and that economic growth will never end. \nSo I think we need to approach these projections with a great deal of \ncaution and some skepticism, given what is going on today with the \neconomies in Asia, Russia, and increasingly in Latin America.\n  Secondly, the other point of caution that I think needs to be stated \nwith great emphasis is that the budget surplus that we have today, as \nnoteworthy as it is, and as worthy of applause as it is, is a unified \nbudget surplus; that is, our operating budget is still in the deficit. \nThat is, the surplus that we have is only a surplus if you count \nrevenue flowing into the Social Security trust fund. I think the chart \nthat I have with me here graphically shows the circumstances we face \ntoday.\n  The Federal surpluses--and it is simply amazing that we are even \ntalking about surpluses, given where we have been over the last \ndecade--the Federal surpluses are projected to grow steadily all the \nway out through the year 2008, and that is the farthest out anyone has \ndared make a projection. That is a positive thing.\n  Before we get carried away about how to spend the surplus, whether \nfor tax cuts or for new programs, the red line represents where we are \nwithout counting Social Security money. If you look at that, we will \nnot be in the black until the year 2002. That is even assuming \ncontinued economic growth. We are not in the black--we have nobody's \nmoney to spend other than the Social Security revenue until the year \n2002. We will dip back into deficit, in fact, briefly, under current \nprojections, in 2003. It is approximately 2005 before we will be \nconsistently in the black, without counting Social Security surplus \ndollars and the interest earnings that are attributable to Social \nSecurity. Finally, in about 2005, if we behave ourselves and continue \nto go on pay-as-you-go, if the economy continues to grow, we will be in \nthe black, without counting the money that needs to be reserved for \nSocial Security.\n  So the President was exactly right as he talked to both the House and \nthe Senate this year, saying, ``do not be thinking about how to spend \nthis surplus this year when we have not yet decided what we are going \nto do about our long-term reform for Social Security.'' That issue will \nbe up next year in the 106th Congress. It is not for certain it will be \nresolved in 1 year, either. We have some reforms that no doubt will \nhave to be made for the long-term viability of Social Security. If we \ndo nothing, the Social Security trust fund will eventually be drawn \ndown and today's baby boomers will receive only about 75 percent of \ntoday's buying value of Social Security. It is not as if Social \nSecurity will go away. It is not as though the system will collapse, \nbut as you get far out into the 2032 range, today's boomers and today's \nyounger people, who are also relying on Social Security, will find that \nthe buying power of that program has been reduced by about one-fourth. \nSo there is a need to make changes, and the sooner they are made to \npreserve the full 100-percent buying power of Social Security for those \noutyears, the better off we are. But in the meantime, to use money that \nhas been raised and collected from the American taxpayers for the \npurposes of a strong Social Security system, and to use it for another \npurpose, is simply wrong.\n\n  If we approach this with the kind of responsibility that I think is \nneeded, and with the kind of bipartisanship I believe is needed, we \nwill reject the tax proposal coming to this body from the House of \nRepresentatives, which calls for a tax cut paid for out of Social \nSecurity revenue.\n  Now, the Senator who preceded me was making reference to a $6.6 \nbillion tax cut. That is only the cost to the Treasury next year. It is \nan $80 billion tax cut over 5 years, $170 billion over 10, and it goes \ninto perpetuity, forever, constantly taking more and more money out of \nthe Social Security surplus fund--all the more reason to nip that in \nthe bud, stop now and take a deep breath, albeit an election year and \nthere is a temptation on the part of our friends in the other body to \noffer what looks like a free giveaway.\n  There is a need in this body, I think, to respond responsibly to that \nkind of proposal coming to us from the House. There may be room for \nsome tax relief this year. I applaud the leadership of Senator Daschle, \nthe Democratic leader, and others who have worked with him, including \nthose from the White House, in suggesting that we could find in the \nrange of a $25 billion tax relief package, which could be focused on \nthe needs of the middle class and working families, and it could be \ndone through savings in the existing budget, through new efficiencies \nin the existing budget, from the closure of loopholes in the existing \nTax Code. That could free up in the range of $25 billion to be utilized \nfor tax relief for middle class and working families. So it is not a \nquestion of are you for tax relief or not; I think there is room for \nsome tax relief. But it has to be financed out of the existing budget, \nrather than going the easy route and that is raiding the Social \nSecurity trust fund.\n  I think something needs to be said as well about the requests for \nemergency funds. Much has been said about the requests from the \nPresident for emergency funding. I think there is a possibility that \nsome of those requests could be offset from within the existing budget, \nbut I think it also needs to be clear that the needs being presented to \nthe Congress by the White House were not foreseen either by the White \nHouse or by the Congress in either political party. It was not foreseen \nthat we would have expenses at the scope that they are for dealing now \nwith the year 2000 computer problem, and the delay of addressing that \nproblem will only cost the taxpayers and the economy\n\n[[Page S11152]]\n\npotentially enormous sums later down the road. Congress did not \nforesee, nor did the White House, when the original budget was \npresented last year, the full cost of our Bosnia role, or the need to \nupgrade security at our embassies, or the scope of the farm crisis \ntoday.\n  Again, it is my hope that perhaps some of this could be offset by \nreductions elsewhere in the budget. But the fact is that the budget \nagreement that was agreed to, which led us on the track toward the \nreduction of that $292 billion deficit to a surplus today, was premised \non the assumption that we would, from time to time, have emergency \nneeds that would have to be funded outside of the budget. There is no \nsurprise to that. I think we need to use discipline so we don't wind up \ndenominating everything that comes along that we would like to do as an \nemergency. But it is in the nature of emergency funding, and it is one \ntime only that it could not be reasonably foreseen, as these were not \neither by the White House or by the Congress, and that they have some \nextraordinary level of urgency about them.\n  The budget agreement that led to this elimination of the budget \ndeficit did foresee that we would have these emergencies come up from \ntime to time. So nobody should be surprised today that we do, in fact, \nhave a need to address some issues that may have to be outside the pay-\nas-you-go framework that has, overall, led us to the budget deficit. \nBut what we cannot afford to do is to use Social Security surpluses as \na source of funding for nonemergency, in perpetuity-type expenditures, \nwhether it be domestic spending programs or for tax relief that could \nnot otherwise be funded. I, for one, think that the next priority, \nafter preserving Social Security, probably ought to be to begin to pay \ndown the existing accumulated debt that this country has in the $5 \ntrillion range, or more. To the extent that we do that, we are, in \nfact, hoping that every taxpayer in this country--to the extent that \nthe U.S. Government is not competing for credit dollars and that we \nbring down interest rates--buying a car, buying a home, sending a kid \nto college, or expanding a business and creating jobs, is made easier \nand all the more affordable for the private sector of our economy to \ndo.\n\n  If we act with budget responsibility here, keep our Federal budget in \nequilibrium with the pay-as-you-go mechanism that was passed initially \nin the 1993 budget agreement--legislation which has passed and has \ncontributed more than any other single legislative policy step taken in \nCongress, passed without a vote of a single Republican Member, passed \nexclusively with Democratic votes in both the House and the Senate. And \nthere were many Members of Congress, many Democrats, frankly, who lost \ntheir seats in Congress, in the House and the Senate, over the \ncontroversy, over the contention, that the passage of that landmark \nlegislation caused because it was a bold step. It was a courageous \nstep. It reduced our Federal budget deficit from $292 billion to a \nsurplus today. But as is often said in politics, no good deed goes \nunpunished. And that was certainly the case of many of our colleagues \nwho are no longer here; who did the right thing and paid a dear price \nfor it. But here we are with positive consequences of that legislation \nwhich has led us now to a surplus with a unified budget. The great \ndanger we have is to abandon the discipline which that budget \nlegislation set in place.\n  I am hopeful as we finish up these closing weeks that we will reject \nthis shortsighted and I believe somewhat demagogic, frankly, effort \ncoming out of the other body to raid the Social Security trust fund.\n  I hear people saying, ``Well, the President wants to address \nemergency crises. So we ought to just pile on and spend more money out \nof the Social Security trust fund.'' That is the logic that is not \nworthy of a third grader, in my view. We have some emergency crises of \none time only that we will face, and we will decide how to finance \nthat, whether it is out of the ordinary budget, or whether it is \nthrough an offset, or some combination of both. But to set us on track \ndown the road in perpetuity for nonemergency, long-term expenditures \nout of the Social Security trust fund makes no sense whatever.\n  Of the $1.6 trillion surplus projected over the next decade, \nvirtually the entire sum is attributable to Social Security and the \ninterest earnings due to Social Security.\n  So let's resolve one problem at a time: Maintain the discipline that \nhas made this much progress over the last half dozen years of the \nClinton administration; preserve Social Security so we can make some \ndifficult policy choices in the coming years about what we need to do \nfurther to maintain its viability on into the next generation. When we \nhave done that, then we may be in a position ultimately, if we have \nsurpluses at that point, to decide what combination of investments in \nour schools, in child care, in health care, in medical research and, \nyes, possibly in tax relief for American taxpayers might be able to \ncome out of that surplus. But don't get put the cart before the horse. \nDo not be demagogic in an election year about this kind of issue. We \nneed some statesmanship. We need some bipartisan responsibility as we \ndeal with what I believe is one of the most fundamental most \nchallenging responsibilities that our Congress has; that is, how do we \nsustain our economic growth? How do we sustain the pay-as-you-go \ndiscipline that has brought us to this good point after so many years--\nafter 30 years--of budget deficits?\n  Mr. President, I conclude by saying that it is certainly my hope that \nstatesmanship will rise to the top; that we will abide with the \nPresident's recommendation; that we not raid the Social Security trust \nfund during these closing days of this Congress; that we go home and \ntell our constituents that we did the right thing; we did the right \nthing by them; we did the right thing by our government; we did the \nright thing by our Nation by retaining fiscal responsibility; and by \npreserving the opportunity to have a strong Social Security program on \ninto the future years, at least until we decide what future changes are \nneeded. By doing that we will keep the cost of money down for the \nprivate sector, and we will do as much as possibly can be done to put \nus on track to sustain what has been record economic growth, low \ninflation, low unemployment, and increased opportunity for all of our \ncitizens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have been wanting to come to the floor \nfor some time to talk a little bit about the situation that we are in \nhere in the Senate, here in the Congress, the amount of work that we \nhave to do in a relatively short time, and, frankly, to urge my \ncolleagues that we get on with it.\n  The immediate need, of course, is to deal with the appropriations, to \ndeal with continuing to finish what has to be done this year so that we \nkeep the Federal Government operating, so that we do the things that \nneed to be done.\n  At last count, it seems to me, out of 13 appropriations, I think only \nthree have been passed: one prepared by the Presiding Officer, which is \nthe only one I think signed by the President.\n  In any event, we have a great deal to do. Of course, as is always the \ncase, there are many things being talked about, some of which are \namendments on appropriations. Others are freestanding bills. But a lot \nof things could wait. None of us like to see things wait that are ours, \nof course. But I guess I am prepared to say that the appropriations are \nwhat we need to do, and finish this job so that a week from Friday we \nwill be out of here. I think that is what we really need to do.\n  It is an opportune time, having had almost all year dealing with \nappropriations, to remind my colleagues that we ought to take a look at \na biannual appropriations process where we do that every other year, \nwhere we appropriate for 2 years as they do in almost all legislatures, \nwhich not only gives the agencies more time to know what\n\n[[Page S11153]]\n\nmoney they have to spend, but I submit to you that one of the important \nthings that the Senate doesn't do as well as we should, which is \noversight. One of the reasons is we spend all of our time on \nappropriations. So I hope that is something that we can do.\n  I understand it is perfectly proper to promote those things that you \nfeel strongly about. I understand that there are different points of \nview. That is part of the reason for this system. Substantially we have \ndifferent points of view: The more liberal point of view, and the more \nconservative point of view. Those are valid, and we ought to promote \nthem. But I think when we have diversionary tactics, as we have seen on \nthe other side of the aisle over the last month, that keep us from \ndoing what we ought to do, that we have to take kind of a long look at \nit.\n  It has been clear for some time that has been the strategy--to move \noff of appropriations--a strategy of my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle to move off of those onto other kinds of things.\n  I hope the total end game is not to get us into this business of \nthreatening to shut down the Government so that the President has \nleverage to tell the Congress we are going to do this or else. That is \nnot good government. That is not what we ought to be doing. And I hope \nthat doesn't happen.\n  The Interior bill is a very important one, particularly to me. I \nhappen to be on the Interior Committee. I stay very involved because of \nthe large amounts of Federal lands that have been sidelined largely \nbecause of unrelated issues that have been used almost daily--issues \nlike campaign finance reform, important as it may be. We have already \ndealt with that several times. It continues to come up. It continues to \nbe threatened. Minimum wage--we have been through minimum wage, which \ncontinues to come up constantly. Patients' Bill of Rights. Good idea. \nAnd there are two Patients' Bills of Rights out there--one, of course, \nby the Senator from Massachusetts, one by the Republicans. Many of the \ncomponents of the bills are the same. There are some very important \ndifferences. But that comes up constantly, and I am afraid what is \nhappened is, it is simply being used to extend it as a political \nactivity through the election time without really the purpose of \npassing it at all. I think the majority leader has said that there is a \ndesire apparently to debate the bill as long as possible to use it as a \ncampaign issue.\n\n  Now, that is too bad. That is too bad. There is no one who likes to \nargue about different points of view better than I, but we have things \nto do and we ought to be moving, we ought to be moving on them.\n  So the President, I think, has joined in that diversionary tactic \nnow. His spokesman, McCurry, is saying that these appropriations bills \nwill have to be done to the President's satisfaction. Well, I want to \nremind the Senate, as did our good friend, Bob Byrd, the other evening, \nthat--let me quote from his talk to the Senate a week ago--\n\n       The legislative branch must be eternally vigilant over the \n     powers and authorities vested in it by the Constitution. It \n     is vitally important to the security of our constitutional \n     system that checks and balances and separation of power be \n     maintained.\n\n  He said further:\n\n       We as legislators have a responsibility to work with the \n     Chief Executive, but it is intended to be a two-way street. \n     The framers did not envision the Office of President as \n     having the attributes of royalty.\n\n  I certainly agree with that. And that is kind of what you see as we \ncome down to the end of the appropriations--some attributes of royalty: \nIt is either my way or the highway.\n  Well, that is not the way you do legislative business. That is not \nthe way it turns out best, and it is not the way we ought to be doing \nit.\n  My good friend from Arkansas spent some time the other day speaking \nin terms of where we are with the economy. He was talking specifically \nabout the proposed House tax reduction and was citing the 1993 Clinton \ntax increase as the reason for the balanced budget.\n  I take exception to that. I don't think there is any evidence of that \nat all. He pointed out it was the largest tax increase in history, with \nnot a single Republican vote. But anyone can raise revenue to close \ndown the deficit. What you have to do is hold down spending, which has \nnever been done by the White House, has never been done by this \nadministration, but has in fact been done by the Republican Congress \nsince 1994.\n  Really, balancing the budget is the control of spending, and that is \nthe way it ought to be. That is the way it ought to be. We have the \nhighest taxes now that we have had since World War II, and we ought to \ndo something about that. The American people and the business community \nare the ones who have balanced the budget by successfully competing in \nthe world marketplace, by creating jobs and paying taxes.\n  I had a letter from a constituent in Cody, WY, who has a point of \nview not everyone would agree with, but I thought it was interesting. \nHe was talking about President Clinton's claim to have balanced the \nbudget, and he said--this is from his letter:\n\n       This is an extraordinary conclusion. It is mind-boggling \n     because President Clinton has nothing to do with the \n     successful economy. In fact, his efforts have only created \n     problems for the business community--overtaxation, \n     overregulation, endless legal challenges.\n\n  That is a point of view. In any event, I think it is necessary to \nreally be more precise about where we are.\n  It is interesting now; we hear, of course, the President speaking out \nseveral times talking about ``save Social Security,'' and that all the \nsurpluses ought to be saved for that. I think we ought to keep in mind \nthat the Social Security surpluses over time have been used for \nGovernment spending, have constantly been used by Democratic Congresses \nall through the years, without having a balanced budget. The idea from \nthe White House of ``saving Social Security'' has been a soundbite \nreally without any outline particularly of how that is going to happen. \nWe have to have some ideas, and there are some out there that are \nlegitimate and good ones.\n  The idea of saving the surplus and then coming up with almost a $20 \nbillion supplemental request out of the same fund doesn't make any \nsense at all. It doesn't make any sense at all. We need to do something \nabout Social Security. I am not a big fan of tax cutting, frankly. I \nthink it might be more important to pay off some of the debt. This \nyear, the defense budget will be about $250 billion and interest on the \ndebt will be almost $25 billion more than that, about $275 billion--\ninterest on the debt, paying for things that some of us have enjoyed \nand these young people sitting down here are going to pay for because \nwe put it on the credit card.\n  It wouldn't be a bad idea to pay off some of that debt. It seems to \nme maybe that is what we really ought to do.\n  There are ways to fix Social Security, even though the White House \nhasn't come forth with any program except to say ``save Social \nSecurity.'' There are some ideas that are good ones. Take part of the \n12 percent, let it be made into a personal account for you and for me, \nand be able to invest it. And we can do that. And the return, of \ncourse, would be much greater. Furthermore, if for some reason you \ndon't utilize all of it, it becomes part of your estate. It is \nsomething that people then would own.\n  Now, that is a solution. That is more than just talking about ``save \nSocial Security'' without having any plan to do that.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that we can address ourselves to this idea \nof completing our work here. I hope that we don't find ourselves using \nthe special allocations beyond spending limits as a means of increasing \nthe budget without moving the spending limits. I think we have promised \nourselves we were going to do that. It seems to me that we--and this, \nof course, is my view; not everyone shares it; I understand that--ought \nto have several objectives over time, and one is to have a smaller, \nmore efficient Government. I think we ought to constantly work for \nthat.\n  There are lots of things we are doing that the Federal Government \ndoesn't do perhaps as well as local government, doesn't do as well as \nthe private sector. We ought to pay down the debt so that we don't have \nthis problem of the single largest line item in the budget is to pay \ninterest on the national debt in this time of great prosperity. We \nought to reduce taxes. We have, since World War II, the highest taxload \non families in this country, and we ought to\n\n[[Page S11154]]\n\nchange that. Generally, in my view, they ought to be taken in that \norder.\n  So, Mr. President, I guess I have shared my view that we have some \nreally important things to do. We have a very short time to do it. I \nhope we can get the obstacles out of the way and deal with our \ndifferences. We have them, but let's resolve those questions that are \nour responsibility to resolve.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/30/senate-section/article/S11152-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my constituents in the Pacific Northwest \nand the Members of this body know that I am not a fan of the current \nversion of the Endangered Species Act, a law that has proven to be a \nfailure not only for endangered species but also many rural communities \nand private property owners as well. In fact, I have spent much of my \ntime as a U.S. Senator looking for ways to improve that law. The \nEndangered Species Act has inflicted grave harm on natural resource \nindustries based in the Northwest with little to show in return, \nespecially if we attempt to measure the law's success in bringing \nsalmon back to Northwest rivers and streams.\n  In fact, the Puget Sound region faces the possibility of more ESA \nlistings over the next year. Local leaders in the Pacific Northwest \nlooked to the Washington State congressional delegation during this \nyear's appropriations process for funds to implement the salmon \nrecovery plan personalized to respond to our unique needs in the Puget \nSound region. I believe that we will be successful. The local \nscientists and leaders know that a creative plan that is supported by \nthe communities surrounding the Puget Sound area will be the best \nchance we have to achieve success and avoid the heavy hand of the \nEndangered Species Act, a law implemented by D.C. bureaucrats with \nplans and standards that may not fit with the challenges and competing \ninterests that must be balanced in the Northwest.\n  As my constituents put all of their energies behind this last-ditch \neffort to avoid the crushing impact of yet another listing in the \nPacific Northwest, another group has been using every tool at its \ndisposal to avoid the implications of the Endangered Species Act on its \nactivities.\n  Puget Sound and Columbia River Indian tribes in Washington and Oregon \nare proclaiming themselves exempt from the constraints already imposed \non their commercial fishing for salmon and steelhead by the Endangered \nSpecies Act. As a result of Clinton administration Executive and \nSecretarial orders, Pacific Northwest tribes believe they should be \nable to decide for themselves whether or not to restrain their \ncommercial gillnetting activities, while at the same time nontribal \ncommercial and sport fishers face the full impact of the Endangered \nSpecies Act in the form of extensive fishing closures.\n  On June 5, 1997, the Secretaries of Commerce and Interior issued a \njoint Secretarial order declaring that Indian lands and activities are \nnot subject to the same controls as Federal public lands and privately-\nowned lands when it comes to enforcement of the ESA.\n  This Secretarial order, signed by Commerce Secretary William Daley \nand Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, was the result of more than a \nyear and a half of negotiations among Clinton administration, Federal \nGovernment agencies, and Indian tribes from across America. President \nClinton's similar Executive order was signed on May 14, 1998.\n  Mr. President, I am frustrated and dismayed. While I have identified \nmany flaws in the D.C.-driven implementation of the Endangered Species \nAct, I also strongly believe this law will have no chance of success if \nthe administration is allowed to decide certain segments of the \npopulation and certain interest groups are not bound by it. The Members \nof this body have heard me criticize the enormous amount of money spent \nwithout result by the Federal Government in an attempt to save species \nof Pacific Northwest salmon and steelhead. In fact, it is estimated \nthat each endangered or threatened fish preserved in the Northwest may \nhave cost tens of thousands of dollars, if we consider the amount of \nmoney spent on recovery efforts as compared with our level of success. \nWe must get a better bang for our buck, and I don't see how we can \nimprove the return from our investment unless everyone in the Northwest \ncomplies with the restrictions imposed by the Act.\n  In response to the unilateral actions taken by the administration \nover the last 2 years, which I consider beyond the scope of Executive \nand bureaucratic authority, I included a provision in this and last \nyear's Interior appropriations bills expressing the contrary intent of \nCongress. The Endangered Species Act, as written, should apply equally \nto all Americans.\n  Before the negotiations that resulted in the Secretarial and \nExecutive orders I mentioned, the Federal Government's position was \nthat ``ESA applies to Indian Country, period.'' By the time \nnegotiations were completed, however, the Clinton administration had \ncapitulated to tribal demands that the tribes decide for themselves, on \na case-by-case basis, whether or not to respond to the conservation \nprinciples of the ESA.\n  How can the Endangered Species Act work unless tribal fisheries share \nequitably in the conservation burden?\n  The Clinton administration is pursuing a policy of preferential \ntreatment. Under this policy, the conservation burden falls mainly upon \nnon-Indians. According to the orders released by the administration, \nrestrictions on Indian harvest of endangered and threatened species, \nboth on and off-reservation, can be considered only if ``the \nconservation purpose of the restriction cannot be achieved by \nreasonable regulation of non-Indian activities'' and ``voluntary tribal \nmeasures aren't adequate'' to achieve ESA goals\n  It certainly wasn't Congress' intent when the Endangered Species Act \nwas passed into law that any group of Americans would be exempted from \nits provisions or that one group should have to bear conservation \nburdens greater than another group. And Members of this body know that \nnon-Indians certainly can't stave off the impact of the Endangered \nSpecies Act by pursuing ``voluntary'' recovery plans after a species \nhas been declared threatened or endangered.\n  The efforts of the administration to exempt tribes from the \nEndangered Species Act don't stop at Secretarial and Executive orders. \nThe National Marine Fisheries Service recently issued a draft rule \nmodifying existing tribal exemptions under the ESA. Not only will \ntribes be able to continue ``ceremonial and subsistence'' take of \nthreatened or endangered species in tribal fisheries, the tribes also \nwill be able to engage in ``commercial'' take of threatened species, \nsuch as chinook salmon and steelhead trout.\n  Allowing a tribal commercial exemption from the ESA would \ndramatically reduce the likelihood of recovery for threatened or \nendangered salmon and\n\n[[Page S11155]]\n\nsteelhead species. Non-tribal commercial and sport fisheries for \nchinook and coho salmon have been significantly curtailed in Puget \nSound and on the Columbia River, and it is likely that chinook \nharvesting could be shut down entirely by next year. Yet the tribes and \nadministration proclaim the tribes have a treaty right to continue to \nfish as they always have, regardless of the conservation needs of the \nfish.\n  This is very unfair and contrary to Supreme Court decisions. The \ntribes should bear an equal share of the conservation burden, just as \nthey enjoy a 50-percent share of the harvest when fish numbers are \nplentiful and healthy.\n  Harvest restrictions necessary under the terms of the ESA must be \napplied in an equitable manner that is fair and consistent for all user \ngroups, tribal and nontribal, if we are to meet conservation goals and \nsee recovery of endangered salmon and steelhead in our lifetimes.\n  Just a few weeks ago, the tribes, with the support of the \nadministration, attempted to take their circumvention of the Endangered \nSpecies Act one step further. Fortunately, U.S. District Judge, Malcom \nMarsh, in Portland, OR, denied the request of the Federal Government \nand five Pacific Northwest tribes to reopen the tribes' commercial \nharvest season for fall chinook salmon. This opening for the tribes, \nrequested by the Clinton administration, would have taken place while \nall types of nontribal fisheries were closed.\n  The States of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho opposed the tribal \nfishery, noting that the Federal Government had issued no biological \nopinion on what effect the tribal fishery might have on ``threatened'' \nSnake River and Columbia steelhead. Judge Marsh agreed with the States' \ncontention that National Marine Fisheries Service had failed to issue a \nbiological opinion showing tribal gillnet fishing wouldn't harm \nsteelhead stocks protected under the ESA.\n  Judge Marsh made the following statement in his ruling: ``While I am \nhighly sensitive to the importance of the tribes' treaty fishing \nrights, I am also mindful of the fact that no one will be fishing if \nthe resource is depleted to the point of extinction.''\n  Instead of being concerned primarily with the long-term preservation \nof the listed steelhead, the Judge stated, ``The Federal Government \nappears to be more concerned with what the tribes are willing to accept \nas reductions to their fall commercial harvest than they are with the \nneeds of the listed species.''\n  Judge Marsh concluded, in his ruling against the tribes and Federal \nGovernment: ``Federal agencies may not circumvent the unambiguous \nstatutory mandate of the ESA simply to avoid more difficult issues or \nto appease one interested party at the expense of the others. \nRegardless of the result, the process must comply with the law and I \nfine the proposal submitted to me [by the Clinton administration and \nthe tribes] . . . fails in that respect.''\n  Yet, the tribes contend that, despite Judge Marsh's ruling, they can \nkeep fishing. All that State governments can do is ask the public not \nto buy the fish the tribes catch, since technically they would be \nfishing under the ``ceremonial and subsistence'' exemptions to ESA.\n  As a practical matter, however, in this technological age of flash \nfreezing and vacuum-packaging, it is impossible for the States \nmeaningfully to enforce this prohibition on the commercial sale of \nendangered wild fish netted by the tribes in their ``ceremonial and \nsubsistence'' fisheries.\n  The National Marine Fisheries Service and the Clinton administration \nhave embarked upon a policy doomed to produce more strife and fewer \nfish for future generations of Indians and non-Indians alike.\n  The solution to this problem is to pass legislation I introduced in \nJuly: the Tribal Environmental Accountability Act (S. 2301). This bill \nprohibits a tribe from claiming sovereign immunity as a defense if a \ntribe is a defendant in a case brought to enforce a Federal \nenvironmental law, such as the ESA. This much-needed legislation would \nallow tribes to be sued to mandate compliance with Federal \nenvironmental laws to the same extent that State governments or private \nentities can be sued. If the administration is unwilling equally to \nenforce the mandates contained in the Endangered Species Act across all \nuser groups, then other interest groups must have the opportunity to \npursue enforcement of this law, no matter how flawed it may be, in the \ncourts of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  the PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). the clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/30/senate-section/article/S11154-4", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11155-S11162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, there are just a few remaining days in \nthis Congress, and the Republican leadership continues to block action \non a Patients' Bill of Rights. It is clear what is going on here. It is \nclear to every Member of the Senate. It should be clear to the American \npeople. The American people want Congress to pass strong, effective \nlegislation to end the abuses by HMOs, managed care plans, and health \ninsurance companies.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights, sponsored by Senator Daschle and Senate \nDemocrats, provides the needed and long overdue anecdote to these \nfestering and growing abuses. Our goal is to protect patients and see \nthat insurance plans provide the quality care they promise but too \noften fail to deliver, and to make sure that the plans, having given \nassurances to those who sign up for the plans, include the protections \nthey say are going to be there. They aren't in too many of the cases \ntoday. And we want to remedy that.\n  Our bill was introduced last March. Earlier legislation was \nintroduced more than a year and a half ago, but the Senate has taken no \naction because the Republican leadership has been using every trick in \nthe procedural playbook to prevent a meaningful debate.\n  The Republican leadership is abusing the rules of the Senate so that \nhealth insurance companies can continue to abuse patients. The \nRepublican leadership wants to gag the Senate so that HMOs can continue \nto gag doctors who tell patients about needed treatments that are \nexpensive for HMO balance sheets. The Republican leadership wants to \ndeny a fair debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights so that HMOs can \ncontinue to deny needed patient care. The Republican leadership wants \nto avoid accountability in the U.S. Senate so that managed care plans \ncan avoid accountability when their unfair decisions kill or injure \npatients.\n  This record of abuse should be unacceptable to the Senate, and it is \ncertainly unacceptable to the American people. Almost 200 groups of \npatients, doctors, nurses and families have announced their support for \nour bill and are begging the Republican leadership to listen to their \nvoices.\n  Mr. President, here on the Senate floor we have listed some of the \nvarious groups that support the Patients' Bill of Rights, which, as I \nhave pointed out, was introduced last March. We introduced similar \nlegislation a year and a half ago. We were denied effectively any \nhearings; denied any consideration by the committee; denied any \nconsideration here on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  On this chart is the list of some of the organizations that support \nthis legislation that we are trying to debate, even in the final days \nof the session, in which we have been denied the opportunity to debate. \nYou can see them and read them. They have been put into the Record \nconstantly: the American Medical Association, the American Cancer \nSociety, the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, the National \nPartnership for Women and Families, the National Association of \nChildren's Hospitals, the AFL-CIO, the American Nurses Association, the \nAmerican Heart Association, the National Breast Cancer Coalition, the \nChildren's Defense Fund, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the \nNational Council of Senior Citizens.\n  There it is--the doctors, the nurses, representatives of the working \nfamilies, the associations representing the children, the associations \nrepresenting women--the National Lung Association, the Paralyzed \nVictims of America, the American Psychological Association, the \nConsumers Union. The list\n\n[[Page S11156]]\n\ngoes on and on, all the way to the Multiple Sclerosis Society, the \nAmerican Academy of Neurology, and the Center for Disabilities, \nrepresenting the various disability groups. All 170 of them are \nsupporting our effort to bring this legislation to the floor of the \nSenate to enact it or debate it or even bring the proposal that our \nRepublican friends want and permit us to have debate on it and attempt \nto amend it.\n  Over the course of this debate, there are some who have criticized \nthose of us who have been trying to have this legislation considered on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate. But it is interesting. They do not have a \nchart like this. They don't have a chart that lists the organizations \nthat support their proposal because they haven't got any.\n  I have stated repeatedly on the floor of the U.S. Senate that we are \nwaiting for one of our colleagues who is supporting the Republican \nposition, or who is part of the Republican leadership, to indicate to \nus one association that represents doctors, one association that \nrepresents nurses, one association that represents consumers, one \nassociation that represents any group of health professionals. Just \ngive us one. They can't. There is silence over there.\n  We have here the partial listing of virtually every single \nprofessional medical association in America, every nursing association, \nevery consumer rights association, virtually every one of those \nassociations. Mr. President, every one of them, as I will show in just \na few moments, is advocating that we move ahead with legislation now--\nnot tomorrow, not the next day, but now. Move ahead, start the debate \nand see us resolve these issues in the period of the next few days.\n  But what does the Republican leadership say? No, no. The Republican \nleadership says they have other things in mind. They want to debate and \nconsider the Vacancies Act. This is what the Republican leadership is \ntelling us--that the Vacancies Act is more important than debating and \nconsidering how we are going to treat a child with cancer in our \ncountry.\n  That is effectively what they are saying. They want us to debate the \nVacancies Act. They want us to debate the Internet tax issues. We are \ngoing to have a cloture vote tomorrow. We are not going to schedule the \nconsideration of this legislation tomorrow. We are going to have a \ncloture vote on the Internet tax proposal. And we had, just last week, \nthe consideration of the salting legislation--salting legislation. The \nRepublican leadership said we ought to consider the salting \nlegislation. Then they had other pieces of legislation they brought \nup--child custody, bankruptcy, affects 1,200,000 people every year. \nThey wanted us to consider that legislation, which we did. There were \ninitially close to 40 amendments on there and still the leadership \nscheduled it even when Senator Daschle had offered a more limited list \nof amendments if we considered the Patients' Bill of Rights. And now we \nare considering the financial services legislation. These are all \npieces of legislation that we either had last week or this week or will \nhave the first of next week while we are virtually silent on the \nconsideration of legislation that is in such extraordinary demand \nacross this country.\n  Mr. President, just this week a letter arrived from 52 rehabilitation \nhospitals and other providers of rehabilitation services to people \nrecovering from terrible injuries, strokes, heart disease or coping \nwith disabilities. These facilities deal with some of the most \nseriously ill people in our society, and here is what they said. Here \nis what they said:\n\n       We encourage you to continue your fight on this issue. We \n     support S. 1890 because it offers the greatest level of \n     protection for patients with disabilities and chronic \n     conditions. We feel that enactment of S. 1890 should be of \n     the utmost importance to Congress. Enactment of the Patients' \n     Bill of Rights is a priority for patients needing \n     rehabilitation services, but it is not a priority for the \n     Republican leadership.\n\n  This is effectively the total leadership in this country that is \nreflecting their concern and their support for the Patients' Bill of \nRights, saying that we ought to act on it and we ought to act on it \nnow. We are prepared to act on it. We are prepared to deal with this \nissue as the next order of business. We are prepared to call the roll \non whether this legislation provides for the kind of protections that \nthose individuals in our society who have physical and mental \ndisabilities--I call them challenges--should be able to have. We ought \nto be able to debate that.\n  Virtually every organization that represents those individuals says \nwe want this now in this Chamber. But not the Republican leadership. \nNo. No, not the Republican leadership. They say let's debate the \nVacancies Act. Virtually every organization that is concerned about \ncancer in our society says start the debate and start on it now. Not \nthe Republican leadership. No. No, they want to consider the Internet \ntax bill.\n  Every child organization--the American Academy of Pediatricians, \nevery group that represents children in our society says start the \ndebate now, start calling the roll, start the debate on how we are \ngoing to protect the children in our society. We can't wait. Too many \nchildren are in need today. Not the Republican leadership. They say we \nwant to debate salting. We want to debate salting; we are not going to \nlisten to the various organizations that are out there representing \nchildren in our society. We are not going to listen to the \norganizations that are out there representing the cancer patients in \nour society. We are not going to listen to the organizations that are \nout there representing the disabled in our society. We are not going to \nlisten to the organizations that represent the doctors and nurses and \nconsumers in our society.\n  No, because, as the Republican leader says, we are in the majority, \nand we are going to set the schedule. We are in the majority, and we \nare going to set the schedule. And the schedule they have set is \nfinancial services, bankruptcy, child custody, salting, and the \nVacancies Act. And the list goes on.\n  But not with regard to the Patients' Bill of Rights, Mr. President. \nLast week, there was a march on Washington by cancer patients and \nfamilies of cancer patients from all over the country. Cancer is a \ndisease that has touched almost every family in our country. It is \nperhaps the most dreaded diagnosis that any person can confront. The \nmarchers called for expanded cancer research and assured access to the \nbest possible care for every cancer patient.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights deals with both of those issues. That is \nwhy it is supported by virtually every major cancer organization in \nthis country. The Patients' Bill of Rights guarantees access to quality \nclinical trials. It assures timely access to needed specialists and \ncenters of excellence equipped to treat patients, particularly cancer \npatients.\n  We have more than 14 cancer centers around this country that \nspecialize in different forms of cancer. They have been enormously \npositive in terms of remedies and new modalities in the treatment of \nthis disease. We have one in my own State of Massachusetts that deals \nwith children's disease and the progress that has been made has been \nabsolutely incredible--absolutely incredible. There should be no debate \nover a child who has cancer getting the kind of specialized care that \nthat child needs and deserves.\n  The progress we have made in the war on cancer over these past years \nhas been greater in children than any other group, and they need \nspecialty care; they need primary care, as all children do. They need \npreventive care, as all children do. Children are the healthiest group \nin our society. The totality of children only account for about 6 \npercent of the health budget in our Nation. They don't drain the health \ncare budget, although more of them are living in poverty than any other \ngroup in our society. But we ought to be able to say, if a child is \ngoing to be attacked by cancer, we ought to give them a specialist. \nThat is what this bill does, Mr. President. That is what this bill \ndoes. The Republican bill doesn't do it. If they think theirs is \nbetter, let's have the opportunity to debate it.\n  Our legislation also, with regard to treating the particular needs of \neither children or those who are afflicted with cancer, requires the \nHMOs to give the patients access to the needed prescription drugs, not \njust the drugs that happen to be on the plan's list because they are \nthe cheapest.\n  I don't know how many of our colleagues remember the testimony that \nwe had the other day from those who were representing many of the \nmentally ill and who were part of HMOs\n\n[[Page S11157]]\n\nand what they were told when they needed certain kinds of prescription \ndrugs--that they had to take the prescription drugs that were on the \nlist of the HMO rather than the prescription drugs that was being \nrecommended by the doctor. They had to take that and demonstrate that \nit wasn't working for them not just once but twice. And then the third \ntime perhaps they would have the opportunity to be able to get the \nprescription drugs that were needed.\n  The tragic circumstances that flowed from those kinds of requirements \nshouldn't happen here. When the individual was signing up, they could \nlook over and they could see formularies that deal with some of the \nproblems in terms of mental health. They figured that their particular \nneeds, if they were going to require them, were going to be attended \nto. And then comes the time that they need those various prescription \ndrugs and they say, no, you have to take these here, and you have to \nshow they don't work. Then you come back again and you have to take \nthem again and show that they don't work and have a doctor certify, and \nthen maybe, maybe, we will give you the kinds of drugs that the doctor \nprescribed in the first place. That is happening today. That is \nhappening today. And we want to remedy that.\n  This legislation assures continuity of care so that someone in the \nmiddle of a course of a cancer treatment will not be forced to change \ndoctors because their employer changes plans or because their health \nplan changes the providers in its network. We want to say that if you \nhave a life-threatening situation and you are being treated with \nchemotherapy or a member of your family is, and then suddenly your \nemployer goes out and changes delivery, we don't want the circumstance \nwhen you are at a time of enormous personal stress and tension to be \ntold, Oh, no, you can't go to your doctor anymore. You have to go to \nanother doctor. Oh, I know that doctor didn't know your case before. I \nknow the doctor hasn't examined you before. I know the doctor hasn't \nbeen a part of this whole process over the last year, year and a half, \nbut you are not able to go ahead and have your old doctor who has been \ntreating you, with whom you have established a relationship, who \nunderstands your case, understands those particular needs of yours. No, \nno. You can just be dropped there.\n\n  We prohibit that. We insist in those circumstances that a patient be \nable to continue that kind of care until there is some resolution of \nthat particular illness. It is very important, Mr. President, very \nimportant, in terms of treatment, in terms of quality, in terms of what \nwe as a society like to believe we have established in terms of a \ndoctor-patient relationship--one of trust, one of intimacy, one of \nunderstanding, one of caring, which is so important.\n  That has an enormous impact. All of that has an impact on recovery. \nIf you provide the opportunity for a parent to be with a sick child at \nthe time of a critical illness, they can demonstrate that the child's \nrecovery is 30 to 40 times more rapid than it would be without that \nparent. We can demonstrate that.\n  It has a dollar-and-cents saving, obviously; but the important point \nis that once in a while, at least we feel on this side, we ought to \ngive some attention to the child and the parent and the family, and \nquality. That is what we are talking about when we insist that that \ndoctor-patient relationship, in terms of special needs, is going to be \nprotected, particularly in the area of cancer, but it is important in \nany critical illness.\n  Access to the quality clinical trials is particularly important. \nThese trials are often the only hope for patients with incurable cancer \nor other diseases where conventional treatments are ineffective. They \nare the best hope for curing these dread diseases.\n  Insurance used to routinely pay the doctor and hospital costs \nassociated with clinical trials. They used to always do that. But \nmanaged care plans are refusing to allow their patients to participate \nor to pay these costs. Our bill requires them to respond to this need. \nThe Republican bill does not, and the Senate leadership does not want \nto debate this bill.\n  Listen to what Bruce Chabner, who is the clinical director of MGH \nCancer Center, a professor of medicine at Harvard University, and the \nchief medical officer at the Dana Farber Partners Cancer Care, one of \nthe outstanding cancer researchers and cancer personnel in the country, \nhas to say:\n\n       I am here to support the bill that would require HMOs and \n     insurance companies to support clinical research. I would \n     like to explain briefly the role of insurance coverage in \n     research.\n\n  This is important, Mr. President, because we have heard so much about \nthe costs of various proposals. Listen to this:\n\n       Most of the costs in clinical research are associated with \n     the cost of discovery. Laboratory experiments and the \n     development of new treatments are supported by Government \n     grants, by industry and by institutional commitments from \n     hospitals and medical schools. These contributions provide \n     the hundreds of millions of dollars that lead to new \n     treatments and hope to millions of our patients with cancer. \n     However, the clinical treatment of these patients requires \n     support for the routine care associated with these clinical \n     trials. The only source of such support for routine care \n     costs is health care insurance and HMO contribution. This is \n     the final step in proving that a new treatment or a new \n     device actually works in people. Without this step, research \n     is meaningless and has no impact on people, nor does it save \n     lives. We are not asking the insurance companies and HMOs to \n     support the vast effort to discover new treatments.\n\n  Do we understand that, Mr. President? The researchers and the centers \nof research are not asking the HMOs for additional resources for \nbreakthroughs. What they are basically asking is:\n\n       We are not asking for support for the cost of analyzing \n     data and support during the clinical trials. We are only \n     asking them to continue support for patient care costs.\n\n  Just continue the costs for treating the patients and permit them to \ngo into these trials. That is the only thing they are asking. Isn't \nthat amazing? One would think the HMO would say, ``Gee, if our patient \ngets better, it will be less costly for the HMO.'' One would think \nsomebody in the financial system would say that. But, no, they just \nwon't let them and, in too many instances, will not give them the \nassurance that if a doctor says it is in your best interest that you \nshould be in a clinical trial because you have breast cancer--and the \nenormous progress we have made in the area of breast cancer is just \nabsolutely extraordinary. Still, one out of every seven women in our \nsociety--is afflicted by breast cancer. That number is enhanced every \nyear, tragically, even with the progress we have made.\n  We are saying: Look, we have made important progress; we are \ncontinuing to make progress; let us have those individuals who can \nbenefit go into these clinical trials at really no extra cost to the \nHMO. If that patient is going to be able to be cured, then, obviously, \nthere is going to be less cost. The patient obviously is going to be \nbetter off. But the costs will be reduced as well.\n  Dr. Chabner continues:\n\n       I am sure that every Member of Congress, if faced with the \n     awful dilemma of cancer, would want this kind of continued \n     support for their family member.\n\n  Meaning the clinical trials:\n\n       This research provides the only hope our patients have of \n     conquering this disease and the only hope our society has for \n     curing cancer.\n\n  There it is, Mr. President, with regard to cancer. Our bill insists \non it, and no such provision is in their proposal at the current time, \neven though it is recommended by every part of the medical profession. \nBut it is still not there.\n  As Dr. Chabner points out, access to clinical trials is critical if \nwe are to make progress in conquering this dread disease, but it is \nalso critical for patients. Often, particularly in the case of cancer, \nclinical trials offer the only hope for cure or improvement. Too often, \nmanaged care is locking patients out of the clinical trials that offer \npotential benefit--in effect, passing a death sentence.\n  Yesterday, I read extensively from the statement of Diane Bergin, a \nmother of two and a patient with ovarian cancer, about her struggles to \nobtain access to clinical trials and the emotional roller coaster she \nfaced in dealing with her plan. I will not repeat her full statement \ntoday, but I would like to read the conclusion to her comments, because \nshe speaks for similarly situated patients all over this country. She \nsays:\n\n       No one facing a serious illness should be denied access to \n     care because that treatment\n\n[[Page S11158]]\n\n     is being provided through a clinical trial. Sometimes, it is \n     the only hope we have.\n\n  That is where we stand, Mr. President. That is where we firmly stand, \nthose of us who believe in a Patients' Bill of Rights. We stand for \nhope for these patients. This is what she says:\n\n       Sometimes, it is the only hope we have. And the benefit to \n     me, whether short or long term, will surely help those women \n     who come after me, seeking a cure, a chance to prolong their \n     life for just a little while, just so they can attend a \n     graduation, or a wedding, or the birth of a grandchild.\n\n  That is what is at issue in this Patients' Bill of Rights, Mr. \nPresident. That is what we ought to be debating here. And still, the \nRepublican leadership says, ``Oh, no; you have to debate the Vacancies \nAct, salting, child custody, and the Internet tax; you can't debate \nthis kind of critical issue.''\n  We find that completely unacceptable. But Republicans have made the \njudgment and decision of denying, not just those of us in the U.S. \nSenate who support it--it isn't denying us, it is denying the \nrepresentatives of all the medical societies in our country, the \ndoctors, all the nurses, all the representatives of the cancer groups \nin this country. That is who they are denying, and it is denying the \npeople they represent--their patients.\n  Diane continues:\n\n       I strongly support, and my family is right there with me, \n     requiring insurers to pay for the routine costs----\n\n  Routine costs----\n\n     of care that are part of an approved clinical trial. I think \n     the cures of the future depend on it.\n\n  Diane Bergin is a patient at Georgetown University's Lombardi Cancer \nCenter. Now listen to this, Mr. President. Listen to this. At the same \nforum where Diane spoke, we also heard from Karen Steckley, a nurse who \nis the director of clinical operations at the Lombardi Cancer Center, \nwhere Diane Bergin is a patient. She has eight full-time master's level \nnurses on her staff who spend virtually all of their time arguing with \nmanaged care companies that do not want to pay for clinical trials, \neven when that is clearly the best treatment available for a patient.\n  Do we understand that, Mr. President? Let me just mention that. Here \nat the Lombardi Cancer Center, in the shadow of the Capitol, one of the \ngreat medical centers in this country, dearly named after one of the \ngreat American heroes of our Nation, here is the director saying they \nemploy eight full-time professional nurses to spend their whole time \narguing with HMOs to permit these patients to participate in these \nclinical trials when their doctors have suggested that that offered \nthem the best hope and opportunity for survival.\n  Imagine that. We hear from our friend from Texas about bureaucracy \nand red tape. Imagine having those top-flight nurses out there \nparticipating and working with doctors to try to ease the pain and be a \npart of a team to try to find some breakthroughs in these cancers. That \nis what is happening. Here is the documentation. And it is not just in \nthe Lombardi Cancer Center, it is in all of these major centers across \nthe country. And we cannot find time to debate whether that is in the \ninterest of the health of our American people, Mr. President, when that \nis happening today?\n  I do not know how many people are being turned back today. I do not \nknow how many women who have breast cancer are being told no by their \nHMO and are being closed out from participating in those clinical \ntrials at the Lombardi Cancer Center and are virtually taking a death \nsentence in many of those instances, Mr. President. I read into the \nRecord yesterday what the results are when you do not have that kind of \nparticipation, particularly in the early times of diagnosis. But that \nis what is happening.\n  Mr. President, the opponents of this legislation talk a lot about \ncosts associated with our bill. We know that every independent analysis \nof our legislation has concluded that the cost will be negligible \nbecause it simply requires all health plans to provide the services \nthey promise when they collect the premiums.\n  That is basically what we are trying to do, Mr. President, to say \nwhen you go out and you sell this product--the HMO--make sure you are \ngoing to comply with what you represent. That is often not the case.\n  I gave the tragic instance just a few days ago about what happened in \nmy own State of Massachusetts when patients with mental illness were \nguaranteed a certain number of days in-house, and then they were denied \nthem--tragic circumstances where a patient went out and committed \nsuicide. He still had 17 days left, but the HMO would not put him in \nthere. That had a devastating impact on the three children and the wife \nas a result of that decision by the HMO, and the fact that there is no \nrecovery at all; that family is absolutely devastated, Mr. President. \nAnd we have remedies for them as well.\n  Mr. President, 14 leading organizations of cancer patients, \nrepresenting 8 million Americans surviving with cancer, and the 1.5 \nmillion Americans who will be newly diagnosed with cancer this year, \nhave spoken out strongly on the need for this amendment. These are \norganizations that patients and physicians, alike, look to for guidance \non cancer issues--the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship, \nCancer Care, Incorporated, the Candlelighters Childhood Cancer \nFoundation, the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, the National \nAlliance of Breast Cancer Organizations, the North American Brain Tumor \nCoalition, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the Alliance for \nLung Cancer Advocacy, Support and Education, the Friends of Cancer \nResearch, the Leukemia Society of America and the Oncology Nursing \nSociety. That is about it, Mr. President; all of them say, ``Pass this, \nand pass it now, there is nothing more important that we can do''--\nevery one of them. But no, the Republican leadership says, ``No. We're \ndeciding--we're deciding what the agenda is going to be.'' And that \nlegislation is not part of the agenda.\n  Meanwhile, these abuses continue every single day, Mr. President. And \nhere is what those groups in a joint statement said: ``Clinical trials \nrepresent the standard of care for cancer patients. Patient care in \nclinical trials is no more expensive than standard therapy.''\n  So now, Mr. President, we know what needs to be done.\n  I can continue. I see my colleagues here on the floor of the Senate. \nI will just wind up with what we have said before, Mr. President, that \nevery one of these protections in the Patients' Bill of Rights has \neither been recommended unanimously by a bipartisan group that was set \nup by the President of the United States--you had to have virtual \nunanimity in order to get the recommendation. The vast majority of \nthese protections were recommended by that President's panel--not in \nthe form of legislation, but as protections for consumers.\n  The vast majority of these are in effect in Medicare, and they are \nworking to provide protections for our senior citizens. A vast majority \nof these are recommended by the health plans themselves, the HMOs \nthemselves. They say they ought to have these kinds of inclusions and \nprotections, but they are not written into the law. A large proportion \nof them are recommended by the insurance commissioners, a bipartisan \ngroup, across this country. There is not a single protection on here \nthat does not have the recommendation of one of these groups. This is a \ncommonsense approach to try to ensure that we are going to have quality \ncare for every American, supported by virtually every one of the health \ncare provider groups in our society.\n  All we are asking, Mr. President, is that we have the debate. It is \nno secret about the various provisions that we have included in this. \nThere is no secret here, Mr. President. We all understand it. We all \nknow we can debate these issues and reach a resolution. But let us get \nabout doing the country's business.\n  Let's do something in terms of protecting the American family. Let's \ndo something about protecting children to make sure they get the \nspecialty care; for women who have breast cancer, to make sure they are \ngoing to be in the clinical trials; to the emergency cases, to make \nsure they are not going to have the ambulances drive by the nearest \nhospitals. Let's go out and protect the doctors and the nurses so they \ncan recommend the medical procedures in the best interests of those \npatients. Let's go out and protect the American people. Let's continue \nto demand that\n\n[[Page S11159]]\n\nwe are going to have the Patients' Bill of Rights as the piece of \nlegislation that we are going to debate before this Congress adjourns.\n  There are just a few remaining days in this Congress, and the \nRepublican leadership continues to block action on a Patients' Bill of \nRights.\n  It is clear what is going on here. It is clear to every member of the \nSenate. And it should be clear to the American people.\n  The American people want Congress to pass strong, effective \nlegislation to end the abuses by HMOs, managed care plans, and health \ninsurance companies. The Patients' Bill of Rights sponsored by Senator \nDaschle and Senate Democrats provides the needed and long-overdue \nantidote to these festering and growing abuses. Our goal is to protect \npatients and see that insurance plans provide the quality care they \npromise, but too often fail to deliver.\n  Our bill was introduced in March. Earlier legislation was introduced \nmore than a year and half ago--but the Senate has taken no action \nbecause the Republican leadership has been using every trick in the \nprocedural playbook to prevent a meaningful debate.\n  The Republican leadership is abusing the rules of the Senate, so that \nhealth insurance companies can continue to abuse patients.\n  The Republican leadership wants to gag the Senate, so that HMOs can \ncontinue to gag doctors who tell patients about needed treatments that \nare expensive for HMO balance sheets.\n  The Republican leadership wants to deny a fair debate on the \nPatients' Bill of Rights, so that HMOs can continue to deny needed \npatient care.\n  The Republican leadership wants to avoid accountability in the United \nStates Senate, so that managed care plans can avoid accountability when \ntheir unfair decisions kill or injure patients.\n  This record of abuse should be unacceptable to the Senate--and it is \ncertainly unacceptable to the American people. Almost 200 groups of \npatients, doctors, nurses, and families have announced their support \nfor their bill and are begging the Republican leadership to listen to \ntheir voices. They range from the American Medical Association to the \nAFL-CIO, from the American Heart Association to the American Academy of \nPediatrics, from the Consortium of Citizens with Disabilities to the \nAmerican Cancer Society, from the National Alliance for the Mentally \nIll to the National Partnership for Women and Families.\n  Just this week, a letter arrived from 52 rehabilitation hospitals and \nother providers of rehabilitation services to people recovering from \nterrible injuries, strokes, heart disease, or coping with disabilities. \nThese facilities deal with some of the most seriously ill people in our \nsociety--and here is what they said: ``We encourage you to continue to \nyour fight on this issue. [We] support S. 1890 because it offers the \ngreatest level of protection for patients with disabilities and chronic \nconditions. . . . We feel that enactment of S. 1890 should be of the \nutmost importance to Congress.'' Enactment of a Patients' Bill of \nRights is a priority for patients needing rehabilitation services--but \nit is not a priority for the Republican leadership.\n  Last week, there was a march on Washington by cancer patients and \nfamilies of cancer patients from all over this country. Cancer is a \ndisease that has touched almost every family in our country. It is \nperhaps the most dreaded diagnosis that any person can confront. The \nmarchers called for expanding cancer research and assuring access to \nthe best possible care for every cancer patient.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights deals with both those issues. That is \nwhy it is supported by virtually every major anticancer organization in \nthis country. The Patients' Bill of Rights guarantees access to quality \nclinical trials; it assures timely access to needed specialists and \ncenters of excellence equipped to treat the patients' particular \ncancer; it requires HMOs to give patients access to needed prescription \ndrugs, not just the drugs that happen to be in the plan's list because \nthey are the cheapest. It assures continuity of care, so that someone \nin the middle of a course of cancer treatment will not be forced to \nchange doctors because their employer changes plans or because their \nhealth plan changes the providers in its network.\n  Access to quality clinical trials is particularly important. These \ntrials are often the only hope for patients with incurable cancer or \nother diseases where conventional treatments are ineffective. They are \nthe best hope for learning to cure these dread diseases. Insurance used \nto routinely pay the doctor and hospital costs associated with clinical \ntrials--but managed care plans are refusing to allow their patients to \nparticipate or to pay these costs. Our bill requires them to respond to \nthis need--but the Republican bill does not, and the Senate leadership \ndoes not want a debate on this issue.\n  Dr. Bruce Chabner, a distinguished oncologist, commented on the \nimportance of this provision.\n  As Dr. Chabner points out, access to clinical trials is critical if \nwe are to make progress in conquering this dread disease. But it is \nalso critical for patients. Often, particularly in the case of cancer, \na clinical trial offers the only hope of cure or improvement. But, too \noften, managed care is locking patients out of clinical trials that \noffer potential benefit--in effect passing a death sentence. Yesterday, \nI read extensively from the statement of Diane Bergin, a mother of two \nand a patient with ovarian cancer, about her struggles to obtain access \nto clinical trials and the emotional roller coaster she faced in \ndealing with her health plan. I will not repeat her full statement \ntoday, but I would like to read the conclusion to her comments--because \nshe speaks for similarly situated patients all over this country.\n  She says, ``No one facing a serious illness should be denied access \nto care because that treatment is being provided through a clinical \ntrial. Sometimes, it is the only hope we have. And the benefit to me, \nwhether short or long term, will surely help those women who come after \nme, seeking a cure, a chance to prolong their life for just a little \nwhile, just so that they can attend a graduation, or a wedding, or the \nbirth of a grandchild.\n  ``I strongly support, and my family is right there with me, requiring \ninsurers to pay for the routine costs of care that are part of an \napproved clinical trial. I think the cures of the future depend on \nit.''\n  Diane Bergin is a patient at Georgetown University's Lombardi Cancer \nCenter. At the same forum where Diane spoke, we also heard from Karen \nSteckley, a nurse who is the director of clinical operations at the \nLombardi cancer center, where Diane Bergin is a patient. She has eight \nfull-time masters level nurses on her staff who spend virtually all \ntheir time arguing with managed care companies that do not want to pay \nfor clinical trials, even when that is clearly the best treatment \navailable for a patient. Often, they are able to get patients into \ntrials--but sometimes they fail, and patients die or suffer needlessly \nas a result.\n  Mr. President, the opponents of this legislation talk a lot about the \ncosts associated with our bill. We know that every independent analysis \nof our legislation has concluded that the cost will be negligible, \nbecause it simply requires all health plans to provide the services \nthey promise when they collect premiums from their subscribers and that \ngood plans provide as a matter of course. But think of the high cost \nand waste in the current system--when patients are denied timely care, \nso that they must be treated when their illnesses have become much \nworse and much more costly to treat. And think of the criminal waste \ninvolved when eight master-level nurse practitioners must spend their \ntime arguing with insurance companies instead of caring for patients.\n  Fourteen leading organizations of cancer patients, representing the \neight million Americans surviving with cancer and the 1.5 million \nAmericans who will be newly diagnosed with cancer this year, have \nspoken out strongly on the need for this amendment. These are \norganizations that patients and physicians alike look to for guidance \non cancer issues. They include the National Coalition for Cancer \nSurvivorship, Cancer Care, Incorporated, the Candlelighters Childhood \nCancer Foundation, the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, the \nNational Alliance of Breast Cancer Organizations, the North American \nBrain Tumor Coalition, US TOO International, the Y-ME National Breast \nCancer Society,\n\n[[Page S11160]]\n\nthe American Society of Clinical Oncology, the Alliance for Lung Cancer \nAdvocacy, Support and Education, the Friends of Cancer Research, the \nLeukemia Society of America, and the Oncology Nursing Society.\n  Here is what they say: ``Clinical trials represent the standard of \ncare for cancer patients. Patient care in clinical trials is no more \nexpensive than standard therapy. Cancer will strike roughly one in \nthree Americans during their lifetimes. Even those who escape the \ndiagnosis will have friends and family touched by the disease. Any \npatient rights or quality care legislation will be a shallow promise \nfor people with cancer if it does not include provisions ensuring \naccess to clinical trials.''\n  A shallow promise. Our program has it. The Republican plan does not. \nThat is one of the reasons why these organizations and the patients \nthey represent conclude: ``Among the various proposals being considered \nby the Congress to improve access and quality for the patients under \nmanaged care, the only one that provides meaningful relief for people \nwith cancer is the one sponsored by Senators Daschle and Kennedy in the \nSenate and Congressmen Dingell and Ganske in the House, S. 1890 and \nH.R. 3605. We urge you in the strongest possible terms to support the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. This legislation . . . is a necessity for \npeople with cancer. Nothing less is acceptable.''\n  These organizations also point to another issue that is critical for \npatients with cancer--access to specialty care. They say, ``the primary \nalternative proposals [to the Patients' Bill of Rights] does not offer \nsignificant assurances of access to specialty care that may mean the \ndifference between life and death for a person with cancer.'' The \ndifference between life and death for a person with cancer. That is \nwhat this debate is about--but the Republican leadership won't even \nbring legislation to the floor.\n  The American public wants action to provide better care for cancer \npatients. They want to guarantee that any family member with a member \nafflicted by this dread disease will get the best possible care. But, \ntoo often, managed care plans say, ``no''. And now, the week after the \ngreat cancer march, the Republican leadership continues to say ``no'' \nto cancer patients and their families--and yes to protecting insurance \ncompany profits. That is just plain wrong.\n  We have held a series of forums focussing on the needs of children, \nfamilies, cancer patients, the disabled, small businesses, women and \nothers. At each one, the message to the Republican leadership is the \nsame. Stop delaying action through procedural maneuvers. Patients and \nfamilies are suffering. Allow a full and fair debate, so that the \nPatients' Bill of Rights can pass. Stop putting industry profits ahead \nof patients. It is because patients and families and doctors and nurses \nall over this country understand the need to stop insurance company \nabuse with meaningful reform that almost 200 organizations representing \nthem have endorsed the Patients' Bill of Rights, but not one has \nendorsed the Republican alternative. And all of these organizations \nwant the Senate leadership to stop hiding behind procedural tricks and \nabuse of the rules and bring legislation to the floor.\n  But Senator Lott continues to say no. Last Wednesday, Senator Lott \neven circulated a consent agreement that would have allowed unlimited \ndebate and amendments to the Internet tax bill--with one exception. No \nhealth amendments.\n  It is clear that the Republican leadership will go to almost any \nlengths to prevent a debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights. Earlier \nthis month, they forced the Senate into a meaningless quorum call for \nsix hours and then forced the Senate to adjourn--not just to block \nconsideration of the Patients' Bill of Rights but to stop Senators from \neven talking about the issue. We have only two weeks left in this \nsession. We have many bills to consider and act upon. But the \nRepublican leadership would rather close down the Senate than allow \neven a discussion of managed care reform, much less a vote by the \nSenate.\n\n  The Republican leadership was willing to shut down the entire federal \ngovernment three years ago in order to slash Medicare and provide tax \nbreaks for the wealthy. Now they're willing to shut down the entire \nSenate in order to protect the profits of HMOs.\n  All we want is a fair and full debate on the Senate floor. But the \nRepublican leadership continues to say, ``no,'' because they don't want \nthe loopholes in their plan exposed and fixed.\n  The fundamental flaws in the Republican bill mean greater profits for \ninsurance companies and lesser care for American patients. Senator Lott \ndoes not want the Senate to vote to fix these flaws. He does not want a \nvote: on whether all Americans should be covered, or just one third of \nAmericans as the Republicans shamefully propose, on whether there \nshould be genuine access to emergency room care, on whether patients \nshould have access to the specialists they need when they are seriously \nill, on whether doctors should be free to give the medical advice they \ndeem appropriate, without fear of being fired by their HMO, on whether \npatients with incurable cancer or Alzheimer's disease or other serious \nillnesses should have access to quality clinical trials where \nconventional treatments offer no hope, on whether patients in the \nmiddle of a course of treatment can keep their doctor if their health \nplan drops them from its network, or their employer changes health \nplans, on whether the special health needs of the disabled, and women, \nand children should be met, on whether patients should be able to \nobtain timely independent review of plan decisions that deny care, on \nwhether health plans should be held responsible in court for decisions \nthat kill or injure patients.\n  The list of flaws in the Republican bill goes on and on.\n  The Republican leadership's record on this issue is painfully clear. \nTheir cynical strategy is to protect the insurance industry at all \ncosts, by blocking any reform at all, or by passing only a minimalist \nbill so weak that it would be worse than no bill at all.\n  This obstruction has been going on for more than a year. HMO reform \nnever appeared on any priority list of the Republican leadership. The \nRepublican Policy Committee issued periodic attacks on any attempt to \nprevent insurance abuses. No Senate committee was permitted to consider \nany legislation to protect patients and American families.\n  Meanwhile, the momentum for reform across the country continues to \ngrow. This summer, the stonewall strategy finally collapsed in the face \nof public pressure. So the Republican leadership did the next worse \nthing. They introduced a bill that had the name of reform--but not the \nreality. They dug in their heels again, and refused to allow a fair \ndebate by the Senate to change that bill from a sham to genuine \nreform--from a bill that protects industry profits to a bill that \nprotects patients--from a bill that would be deservedly vetoed by the \nPresident to a bill that could be signed into law as a genuine \nachievement for every family.\n  Bill Gradison, the head of the Health Insurance Association of \nAmerica, was asked in an interview published in the Rocky Mountain News \nto sum up the strategy of the special interests committed to blocking \nreform. According to the article, Mr. Gradison replied ``There's a lot \nto be said for `Just say no.''' The author of the article goes on to \nreport that ``At a strategy session * * * called by a top aide to \nSenator Don Nickles, Gradison advised Republicans to avoid taking \npublic positions that could draw fire during the election campaign. \nOpponents will rely on Republican leaders in both chambers to keep \nmanaged care legislation bottled up in committee.''\n  Instead of participating in a genuine debate on how to assure that \nall patients have the protections now available only to those fortunate \nenough to be enrolled in the best plans, insurance companies and their \nallies in the business community have heeded the call of the Republican \nleadership. A leadership aide told the industry to ``get off their \nbutts and get off their wallets'' and block reform. They directed their \nspecial interests friends to write the ``definitive paper trashing all \nthese bills.''\n  The Republican leadership could have called up the Patients' Bill of \nRights at any time for a full and fair debate. Instead, they have \nproposed a\n\n[[Page S11161]]\n\nseries of phony ``consent'' agreements that would prevent fair debate \nand make passage of real reform impossible. These stalling tactics are \nclearly meant to run out the clock, so that managed care reforms cannot \nbe passed before Congress adjourns, and so that the Republican \nleadership can avoid taking responsibility for its defeat.\n  The record of Republican attempts to avoid the blame for inaction \nwould be laughable, if the consequences for patients across the country \nwere not so serious.\n  On June 18, Senator Lott proposed to bring up the bill, but on terms \nthat made a mockery of the legislative process. His proposal would have \nallowed the Senate to start considering HMO reform, but he would have \nbeen permitted to end the debate at any time. The proposal also barred \nthe Senate from considering any other health care legislation for the \nrest of the year. So if Senator Lott did not like the direction the \nbill was headed, he could kill it and tie the Senate's hands on HMO \nreform for the remainder of the year.\n  On June 23, 43 Democratic Senators wrote to Senator Lott to urge that \nhe allow a debate and votes on the merits of the Patients' Bill of \nRights. We requested that the Senate take up this issue before the \nAugust recess.\n  In response, on June 24, Senator Lott repeated his earlier \nunacceptable offer.\n  On June 25, Senator Daschle proposed an agreement in which Senator \nLott would bring up a Republican health care bill by July 6, so that \nSenator Daschle could offer the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights, \nand other Senators could offer amendments on HMO reform. We would agree \nto avoid amendments on any other subject. Only amendments related to \nthe Patients Bill of Rights would be eligible for consideration. \nSenator Lott rejected this offer as well.\n  On June 26, he offered once again an agreement that allowed him to \nwithdraw the legislation at any time, and bar any further consideration \nof any health care legislation for the remainder of the year.\n  On July 15, Senator Lott made yet another offer. This time, he \nproposed an agreement that permitted only one amendment. He could bring \nup his bill. We could bring up ours. And that would be it--all or \nnothing. No votes on key issues.\n  On July 29 and on September 1, the Republican leadership offered \nvariations of this proposal, with amendments restricted to three for \nDemocrats and three for Republicans.\n  The reason the Republican leadership wants to restrict amendments so \ndrastically is obvious. Senator Lott knows his legislation is deeply \nflawed, and that it cannot possibly be fixed with just three \namendments. He believes that he and his special interest friends can \nhold most of the Republican Senators for a few votes, but he fears that \nthey will not be willing to stand before the American people on the \nSenate floor and cast vote after vote for the special interests and \nagainst the interests of American families.\n  Our Patients' Bill of Rights was introduced in March--and a \npredecessor bill was introduced by Congressman Dingell and myself more \nthan eighteen months ago, at the beginning of this Congress.\n  Senator Daschle, in an effort to be responsive to the Republican \nLeader's ultimatum that an agreement on the terms of the debate must be \nreached before the debate can begin, has offered reasonable proposal \nafter reasonable proposal--and every one was rejected.\n  Yet the Republican leader has allowed the Senate to debate many other \nbills this year, with ample time and ample opportunity for amendments.\n  We had 7 days of debate on the budget resolution, and considered 105 \namendments. Two of those were offered by Senator Nickles.\n  We had 6 days of debate on the defense authorization bill, and \nconsidered 150 amendments. Two of those were offered by Senator Lott \nand he cosponsored 10 others. We 8 days of debate on IRS reform and \nconsidered 13 amendments.\n  We had 17 days of debate on tobacco legislation--a bill we never \ncompleted--and considered 18 amendments.\n  We had 5 days of debate on the agriculture appropriations bill and 55 \namendments.\n  We had nineteen days of debate on the highway bill, with 100 \namendments.\n  The Republican leadership has allowed five days of debate and 24 \namendments to the bankruptcy bill.\n  They have allowed 36 amendments and two days of debate on the FAA \nbill passed last Friday.\n  All these bills were important, and all deserved reasonable debate \nand opportunities for amendments. They were brought up without any \nundue restrictions on debate. That is the normal way of doing business \non important pieces of legislation in the Senate.\n  The Republican leadership was willing to have an adequate opportunity \nto debate and vote on these other important measures. But when the \nissue is protecting American families instead of insurance industry \nprofits, different ground rules apply to protect the industry and deny \nthe rights of patients.\n  Senator Daschle has offered yet another reasonable approach to \nresolve the impasse that Senator Lott has created by his efforts to \nprevent meaningful reform. He offered to agree to let the Senate debate \nother bills during the day, and use evenings to debate the Patients' \nBill of Rights. The American people expect us to work for them--and if \nthat means a few late nights, so be it. Senator Lott continues to say \nmy way--or no way. And his way is not the way that serves the interests \nof the American people. The American people deserve a Senate that works \nas hard as they do. They deserve managed care reform.\n  Last Friday, we recessed at 1:00 pm. Most of the time the Senate was \nin session was spent in morning business rather than doing legislative \nwork. Monday, we did not come in until noon and we did not do \nlegislative business until 3:30. Throughout this year, we have \neffectively worked less than a four day week. There is no excuse for \nour not doing the people's business--and one of the highest priorities \nfor American families is a Patients' Bill of Rights. There is no excuse \nfor not acting this year.\n  If the Majority Leader will stop abusing the rules of the Senate and \nallow this debate to proceed, I believe that the Senate will pass \nstrong reforms that will be signed into law by the President. The \nAmerican people deserve real reform, and I believe that when the Senate \nvotes in the clear light of day, it will give the American people the \nreforms they deserve. This issue is a test of the Senate's willingness \nto put a higher priority on the needs of families than on the profits \nof special interests. And it is time for the Senate to act.\n  The choice is clear. The Senate should stand with patients, families, \nand physicians, not with the well-heeled special interests that put \nprofits ahead of patients.\n  The American people know what's going on. Movie audiences across the \ncountry erupt in cheers when actress Helen Hunt attacks the abuses of \nmanaged care in the film ``As Good As It Gets.'' Helen Hunt won an \nOscar for that performance, but managed care isn't winning any Oscars \nfrom the American people. Everyone knows that managed care today is not \n``as good as it gets.''\n  Too often, managed care is mis-managed care. No amount of distortions \nor smokescreens by insurance companies can change the facts. The \nPatients' Bill of Rights can stop these abuses. Let's pass it now, \nbefore more patients have to suffer.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent to speak out of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am joined on the floor today by the \nSenator from Nebraska, Senator Kerrey. I cannot help but mention the \npresentation just made by Senator Kennedy. I fully support and agree \nwith his presentation. He talks about the agenda. What is the agenda \nhere in the Senate? What do the leaders of this Congress feel is \nimportant for this country?\n  I gave a presentation on the Senate floor one day about a young boy \nnamed Ethan, who was born with severe difficulties from cerebral palsy, \nfor which he required intense physical therapy. And the HMO said, ``No, \nwe're going to cut off that therapy because he will not make \nsignificant progress.'' Now what\n\n[[Page S11162]]\n\nthey defined as ``insignificant progress'' was the ability to walk by \nage 5. It was not doctors who were making that decision. It was \naccountants in an HMO who were saying, ``Being able to walk by age 5 is \ninsignificant.'' So there was a matter of dollars and cents versus a \nyoung boy's health.\n\n  That is the point the Senator from Massachusetts makes about the \nurgency of having an agenda on the floor of the Senate that deals with \nreal issues that affect real people. We have a ``legislative landfill'' \nhere. You know landfills. Almost all landfills are out of sight, over \nthe hill, down the valley. You go through a big gate and don't even see \nit. You drive your merchandise down there that you want to dispose of, \nthen you dump it and they cover it up.\n  We have a legislative landfill here in the 105th Congress. There was \ntobacco legislation. It was sent out to the landfill, and covered up. \nCampaign finance reform also went into the legislative landfill, and \nwas covered up. Add the Patients' Bill of Rights as another bill sent \ninto the legislative landfill they have created, and covered it up.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/30/senate-section/article/S11155-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11162-S11165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              FARM CRISIS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we talk about the farm crisis and whether \nCongress will address a farm crisis that is urgent. I just want to make \nthis point. I watched this week, as did all Americans, this hurricane \nthat came roaring out of the Caribbean and threatened a fair part of \nthe southern part of this country. My heart goes out to those people, \nworrying about their State, their lives, their property, and everything \nthat they have saved and built. Then a wind comes along at 100, 125, \nand 150 miles an hour, and wipes it away.\n  There is an emergency declaration, as we always do. Whether it is \nfloods, fires, or earthquakes, or hurricanes, Congress responds with an \nemergency declaration. We say: You are a victim and the rest of the \ncountry wants to help.\n  A week ago, the President sent down an emergency request to this \nCongress dealing with the farm crisis. It wasn't a wind, it wasn't a \nfire, it wasn't a flood, it wasn't a hurricane or an earthquake. Family \nfarmers in this country have been literally devastated by the abject \ncollapse of farm prices. Grain prices have just collapsed. In my State, \nin 1 year net farm income collapsed 98 percent.\n  Ask yourself: Could anybody on your home street or block or in your \ncounty or your city survive if their net income dropped 98 percent? The \nremaining income is 2 percent. These are people who milk the cows, plow \nand put seed into the ground, and harvest in the fall. These are people \nin this country who raise America's food. They take enormous risks. \nThey turn their yard light on and with their family have hopes and \ndreams to make a living.\n  There has been a 98 percent collapse of the net farm income in North \nDakota for family farmers. Prices have collapsed. We have the worst \ncrop disease in this century. This President is right when he says we \nhave an urgent farm crisis and he sends down an emergency proposal to \ndeal with this.\n  Two nights ago, I drove home after a conference committee on the \nAppropriations Committee. In that conference meeting, on a party-line \nvote, the President was told: We don't care about your emergency \nrequest. We don't think it is quite that important. We are going to \noffer up a 4-foot rope to somebody drowning in 10 feet of water, and we \nwill suggest somehow that we have helped.\n  I was sorely disappointed. More than that I was angry when I drove \nhome that night. We meed to understand that these folks who farm \nAmerica's land out there, the family farmers, don't ask for very much. \nAll they ask is for an opportunity to make a living. When farm prices \ncollapse and when they are hit with crop disease, it is as much a \ncrisis for them as wind, flood, fire, or tornado. This Congress has a \nresponsibility to help.\n  There is a week and a half left in this Congress. If this Congress \ndoesn't help, thousands and thousands and thousands of farmers and \ntheir families living on the land will lose their livelihood.\n  I know the Senator from Nebraska has some information about exactly \nwhat the President has proposed and what the stakes are here, State by \nState, and what we are trying to do. I yield for a moment to the \nSenator from Nebraska for a question and some comments.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Senator from North \nDakota, one of the things we had hoped to do with this legislation is \nto get consideration similar to the disaster request which we all know \nwill occur as a result of this hurricane.\n  We have experienced this before. The Nation comes together as a \ncountry; suddenly we are Americans. A U.S. Senator asked to help the \npeople in Mississippi, the distinguished majority leader's State. In \nAlabama, probably Florida as well, and Louisiana, clearly there are \ndamages. Here comes a natural disaster. Here comes Hurricane Georges. \nNobody could have prepared for that hurricane. It has destroyed \npeople's lives, cost them hope. What will happen is, a disaster \ndeclaration will be made, a request will come to the Congress to put \nthe law of the country on their side, to give them opportunity and hope \nagain. That is what the law can do at its best; it can give people \nhope.\n  I know this very well, I say to my friend from North Dakota. About a \nyear and a half in a business, in 1975, a tornado hit Omaha, NE, and I \nthought we were pretty much out of business as a result of the tornado \nhaving blown us away. However, I come to find out, 2 days later, that \nMayor Zorinsky, the mayor of Omaha at the time and the man who preceded \nme in the U.S. Senate, requested from the President of the United \nStates, Republican President Gerald Ford, a disaster declaration, and \nthe law was put on our side. It gave us a chance to build our business \nback, gave us a chance to pursue our dream. That is what the law tends \nto do. That is what the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts was \ntalking about earlier. I get hundreds of calls a year, and, more than \nany other issue, people say, ``Senator, I don't have any power when I \nam dealing with an HMO; can you change the law and give me some power? \nCan you help me in dealing with this entity?'' We are trying to change \nthe law not to create a bureaucracy but to give people some hope.\n  My expectation will be, when the disaster declaration occurs for \nthese southern States, it won't be a partisan issue, it won't be \nRepublicans and Democrats, it will be U.S. Senators and U.S. Members of \nthe House of Representatives rallying to try to make certain that \npeople in the southern part of the country that have been damaged by \nthis disaster are given some hope or given some opportunity.\n  I say to my friend from North Dakota, I was surprised, as you were, \nlate Monday night when the House conference on appropriations for \nagriculture rejected the President's request for disaster assistance \nfor the Middle West that has been destroyed and damaged by a natural \ndisaster, a decline in demand that has produced losses across the board \nin agriculture. Still the most important part of our economy, creating \nmore jobs than any other sector of our economy, and farmers throughout \nthe bread belt of the United States, the bread basket of the United \nStates, have lost hope. I was very surprised that it would occur on a \nstraight party line vote that Members--who will likely say yes if the \nPresident puts down a disaster declaration request for the hurricane--\nvoted no.\n  I say to my friend from North Dakota, they say, ``We are reopening \nFreedom to Farm; that is the reason I'm to vote no.''\n  I ask my friend from North Dakota if he is aware of the kind of \nincome contribution that this disaster declaration will make to our \nStates. There are many times when I come down here and deal with a \npiece of legislation and I ask myself, Will this have an impact on \nNebraska? Will they feel it?--especially when I am talking to Nebraskan \nfarmers out harvesting right now and who might not have seen what \nhappened Monday night. Are you sure this will help? In Nebraska, the \ndifference between what the President asked for and what the House \nconference, on a straight party line vote, voted for is $257 million.\n  Rest assured, if this was a transportation grant, our entire \ndelegation would be united. There is no Republican or Democrat \ndifferential when we\n\n[[Page S11163]]\n\nare trying to get a $250 million grant for Nebraska. Yet there is a \ndecision here as a consequence of this Freedom to Farm argument--$257 \nmillion worth of income to Nebraska.\n  I have written the Midwestern Governors' Association and the \nGovernors in those associations urging them to call their delegation as \na consequence of not just what their State will lose but what their \nfarmers are going to lose. Two hundred and fifty-seven million dollars' \nworth of income on Main Street America, in Main Street Nebraska, will \nmake a lot of difference not just to farmers but to whether or not the \nbusinesses on Main Street will survive.\n  In Iowa, the amount of money is $365 million. I have written Governor \nBranstad and urged in an immediate letter: ``Governor, weigh in on \nthis, because you are about to lose $365 million''; to the Governor of \nIllinois: ``You are about to lose $341 million''; in Indiana, $182 \nmillion; in Kansas, $195 million; in Minnesota, $256 million; in North \nDakota, $115 million; in Ohio, $133 million; in South Dakota, $149 \nmillion; in Wisconsin, $80 million.\n\n  There are Senators from these Midwestern States who voted no for \nideological reasons, because they don't want to reopen the Freedom to \nFarm. I don't understand that. This would make a tremendous difference \nin our being able to get through this recession.\n  The President asked for a disaster declaration. As I said, I have \nwritten all of the Governors in these States putting out an appeal. It \nwill occur when each one of these Governors are going to come to us and \nask for considerably less, and the beauty of this is that it doesn't go \nto the Government, it goes to individual family farmers; it increases \ntheir income and makes it likely to get their operating loans extended \nfor another year.\n  I ask my friend if he is aware of the tremendous change in income \npictures that will occur as a consequence of what the President has \nasked for and what the conferees turned down. Again, I ask a second \nquestion of my friend from North Dakota. He has had plenty of town hall \nmeetings, just as I have. I am asked, ``How do we persuade those \neasterners to go along with us?'' The problem doesn't appear to be \neasterners, or people on the west coast either. Both Senators from \nCalifornia, both Senators from Connecticut, both Senators from \nMaryland, both Senators from Massachusetts, both Senators from Nevada, \nboth Senators from New Jersey--even though they are not going to \nbenefit--did precisely what the Senator from North Dakota said earlier. \nIt is not just important for us to come here and defend our region, our \nNation is in trouble. Our Nation is suffering as a consequence of the \ncrisis and the disaster occurring in the Midwest right now.\n  We are going to respond. We are going to vote aye because we know \nthat we need to pull together as a country. I am sure that it is likely \nto be 100-0 when it comes time to decide whether or not we are going to \nrespond to a disaster in the southern States that has occurred as a \nconsequence of this hurricane. I come to the floor, Mr. President, to \nask the Senator from North Dakota if he is aware of the tremendous \namount of assistance that each one of these States is going to get, and \nif he, as well, hears from his farmers when he goes home, ``How do we \npersuade the folks on the east and west coasts that we have a problem \nout there that needs to be addressed?''\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Nebraska asks an \nimportant question. I want to emphasize again that the President has \nsent down an emergency request. He sent down an emergency request and \nsaid what is needed in order to address the farm crisis is $7.9 \nbillion. Now, I will say to my friend, as I indicated when I started \nthis, when the emergency request comes--and it will--to deal with this \nhurricane that just hit, I am going to vote for it. Perhaps other \nhurricanes will hit during this season. I have voted for aid for \nearthquakes, floods, fires, and hurricanes; and I always will because \nthis country has a responsibility to do that. I won't think twice about \nit. We don't have hurricanes in North Dakota, but when a hurricane hits \nin this country, count me as someone voting for the emergency request.\n  FEMA and others will evaluate what is necessary, and the President \nwill send us a supplemental emergency request. I have always voted for \nthem and I will again. It wasn't, as I said, a fire, flood, earthquake, \ntornado, or hurricane that caused the crisis that required the \nPresident to send up this emergency request. It was the collapsed \nprices and crop disease. It was the worst crop disease of a century \ncombined with a total collapse of prices.\n  Now, why do we have some people who ought to be voting in support of \nthis emergency request reluctant to do so? As the Senator said, it is \nideology. This Congress, a couple years ago, passed something called \nthe Freedom to Farm bill. I didn't vote for it. I didn't think it was \nappropriate. I don't think you will have family farmers in this country \nwhen prices drop off the cliff and you don't have an adequate safety \nnet for them. If you don't have a price support for them to get across \nthe price valley, farmers can't make it. The big corporate farms will \nget across the valley because they have the financial strength to do \nit.\n  Some may decide that they don't care about family farmers or whether \nthey exist. They may worship at the altar of a ``free market'' that \ndoesn't exist in agriculture. They decided that we were going to cut \nfarmers loose. Even if prices collapse after we pass this Freedom to \nFarm bill, they are going to refuse to budge because they have so much \npride in the work they did a couple years ago that they don't want to \nadmit it was wrong. I am not asking anybody to admit that.\n  I am just saying that farm prices have collapsed. Wheat prices have \ndropped 57 percent since passage of the farm law. North Dakota farmers \nlost 98 percent of their net income in one year. The same is true \nthrough much of the Midwest in the farm belt. At this point, shouldn't \nCongress stop, look, and listen and say this is a crisis? Does this \ncountry want family farmers with yard lights that light up the hopes \nand dreams on the family farm out there in the country? Do they want \nfamily farmers in the future? They should for a lot of social and \neconomic reasons. Then Congress has to come forward now and address \nthis issue that the President has recommended with an emergency \nrequest.\n  The Senator from Nebraska has gone through and talked about what it \nmeans to these States. I want to describe it in slightly different \nterms. There is not a Republican or a Democratic way to go broke. \nFamily farmers don't care about party labels, tickets, or politics. \nThey care about whether they are going to be able to make it through \nthe winter?\n  I talked about a young man named Wyatt the other day. He is a \nsophomore in school right now in Stanley, ND. He wrote a letter to me \nthat brought tears to my eyes. He said, ``My dad is a family farmer.'' \nAfter he described what the family was going through, he said, ``My dad \ncan feed 180 people and he can't feed his own family.'' That describes \nbetter than almost any description we can offer how productive our \nfamily farmers are. Yet, they are being wrung dry by prices that have \ncollapsed, and they are told that even though they are all-star \nproducers, somehow they don't matter.\n  It seems to me that we must, as a Congress, address this issue, and \nthe point is this: There are those who say let's address this issue by \ndoing what is called increasing the AMTA payment by some 19 cents a \nbushel for a bushel of wheat. That is like walking up to somebody \nbleeding to death and holding out a Band-Aid and saying, ``Aren't I \nwonderful? Here is a Band-Aid.''\n  The people proposing it know better. They have told me in private \nthat it will not address this problem. It won't get those farm families \ninto the field next spring. Tens of thousands of them will be broke and \nforced out of business before they can get into the field next spring \nbecause this is a half-baked solution. It is, as I said, like offering \na 4-foot rope to somebody drowning in 10 feet of water. Let's not have \nhalf-baked solutions. Let's not pole-vault to get over the election.\n  Let's pass the emergency request of the President to solve this \nproblem. We need to help these farmers have the hope that they can get \nin the field next year, plant a crop, harvest it in the fall, and have \nsome hope that perhaps prices will rebound and they will be\n\n[[Page S11164]]\n\nable to continue farming in this country in the future. Either we are \ngoing to decide to solve this problem or we are not. That is what this \nis about.\n  First of all, I respect the fact that I come from a political party \nthat lost. I understand that. I understand winning and losing. I belong \nto a political party that doesn't control this Chamber. I understand \nthat. I am perfectly willing to lose from time to time. We do. In fact, \nit is getting habit-forming. But I am not willing to lose quietly on \nthis issue.\n  Up until the last 2 minutes of this legislative session, I intend to \nbe on the floor demanding that this country respond to the urgency of \nthis matter, just as we would if it were a natural disaster. I will be \ndemanding that we respond to the hopes and dreams of family farmers \nthat are going to lose their family farms if we don't act. They will \nlose it in the next week, the next month, or the next 4 months, and \nthey will lose it as sure as I stand here, if we come up with half-\nbaked solutions.\n  I know the Senator from Nebraska wants to add to that. Let me just \nsay again, it is the old silk-purse-out-of-a-sow's-ear thing. We have \npeople here resistant to doing what they know in their heart is the \nright thing to do because they are worried because it would look like a \n180-degree turn on Freedom to Farm. Don't worry about that. Let's \nfigure out what we can do together, all of us together. Let us do what \nwe know in our hearts will help the farmers get into the fields next \nspring and have some hope that maybe they can make a decent living. If \nwe do that, we will have done something to strengthen this country and \ninvest in this country's future.\n  Then we can then go home with pride and say to those that Thomas \nJefferson described as the ``best Americans,'' those producing our \nfoodstuffs on the family farms, that we have done something to assure \ntheir future and give them an opportunity.\n  Our economy is doing better. Inflation is down, unemployment is down, \nand the deficit is almost gone. All of those numbers are good and the \ncountry feels better about the economy. We should be able to say to \nfamily farmers that we will not, in these good times, turn a blind eye \nto their economic plight. They matter to this country.\n  I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Nebraska once again.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, just briefly, I appreciate very much the \nanswer the Senator from North Dakota has provided. I want to make it \nclear again that I put out an SOS to the Governors of the Midwestern \nregion, pointing out to them what they are about to lose.\n  To the Governor of Illinois, $341 million of additional income to the \nState of Illinois. Is that going to make every farmer in Illinois \nprosperous? No. For all of the free market, plenty of people are still \ngoing to go broke in Illinois even at that. But $341 million, I say to \nthe Governor. It is the same way in Indiana--$182 million; Iowa, $365 \nmillion; Kansas, $195 million; Michigan, $60 million; Minnesota, $250 \nmillion; Missouri, $120 million; Nebraska, $250 million; North Dakota, \n$115 million; Ohio, $133 million; South Dakota, $150 million; \nWisconsin, $80 million.\n  I have been a part of the Midwestern Governors Association. During \nthe agriculture crisis, there was the appeal that we made to Congress. \nOur income is declining; our tax revenues are going down; we are not \nable to support our schools--many of the things that happen as a \nconsequence of things beyond our control. We found a positive response \nin the Republican Congress in the 1980s. We came and made the appeal. \nThe Congress responded with the new farm bill which helped us \nenormously.\n  Mr. President, I hope this little presentation or request of the \nGovernors, as well as our correspondence to the Governors, will produce \na response. I hope and I pray that sometime in the next 10 days we can, \nas we most assuredly will--when the majority leader comes to the floor \non behalf of Mississippians, and many other people in the South who \nhave been damaged by Hurricane Georges, we are not going to walk down \nhere with a partisan hat and say, ``That is the majority leader, he is \na Republican, and for ideological reasons I am going to say no.'' We \nwill say yes.\n  I hope in the next 10 days that we can find a way on this Agriculture \nappropriations bill to send this bill back to conference and instruct \nthe conferees to do the right thing, which is to grant the President's \nrequest for the disaster assistance, which will brighten the days of \nnot just American farmers but also Americans who understand that our \nlivelihood depends upon their success and their prosperity. I hope we \nare able to take our partisan hats off and deal with this thing as U.S. \nSenators and not as Republicans or Democrat Senators.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me finish with just 1 minute. I know \nour colleagues are on the floor. They look like they want to do some \nserious business.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might just say, the business we are \ndoing is very serious. While I will not take a position one way or \nanother on the issue, I would be remiss, and all others would be \nremiss, if we did not recollect last year how Senator Dorgan stood the \nfloor on behalf of his constituents and others with regard to the \ndevastating floods, and when he spoke just now about his support about \nother areas of the country, and I think in the depths of his heart \nabout those harrowing experiences in which he so ably represented the \ncitizens of his State.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Warner. Let me just \ncontinue for 1 additional minute, and then turn the floor over to the \nSenator.\n  I don't like having to come here and ratchet away on this issue day \nafter day. I know some get tired of that, but this literally is about \nwhether people will survive out on the family farm. I have used some \nletters to try to describe their plight. I used a letter the other day \nof a woman who described the two jobs she has, the two jobs her husband \nhas, in addition to raising kids and running the farm, and all the \npart-time jobs her kids have. She wrote how they are just flat broke, \nout of money and with no capability of making it. The price of hogs is \ndown. The price of cattle is down. The price of grain has collapsed. \nShe said to her daughter, ``Let us try to buy you one pair of new jeans \nfor school.'' And her daughter said, ``No. Mom, I understand we can't \nafford that.'' They are just out of money and about to give up hope.\n  This Congress needs to intervene to do something. We need to say to \nour farmers, ``You matter to this country.'' I am not saying we should \nprop up some artificial economy for farms. I am saying that these \nfarmers face monopolies in every direction they turn. They face \nmonopolies with the grain trade. They face monopolies with the way they \ndo business with the railroad. They face them with the cattle \nslaughter. They face them with the hog and sheep slaughter, and they \nface them with the flour millers.\n  I had charts. I will not put them up again. In every area, the top \nthree or four companies control 60, 70, and in some cases 80 percent of \nall of the activity. And these farmers are told, ``You compete in the \nfree market.'' Then they have to compete with other countries that \ndeeply subsidize their products. It is not a free market. It has never \nbeen free. We are the only ones who will come up with these goofy \nstories and tell the farmers to go to the grain markets which are \nstacked against them. Then when prices collapse, we tell our farmers we \nare not going to be there to help. This is the only country that does \nthat.\n  This country ought to decide now that it made a mistake putting the \nfuture of family farmers on a free market that doesn't exist, and we \nought to correct it. This President says that we have an emergency \nneed, and he asked for a supplemental appropriations to meet that \nemergency need totaling about $8 billion.\n  I drove home the other night after the conference committee between \nthe House and the Senate. That conference, on a party-line vote, said \nno; we are not willing to do that. I hope we are going to change that \nresult in the next week and a half, Mr. President.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I have a question for the Senator.\n  One is, there has been a great deal said by the Senator from North \nDakota about changing the farm bill and reopening the farm bill \nrelative to taking the caps off the marketing loan rates. It is my \nunderstanding that the existing farm bill has marketing loan provisions \nin it; that the real discussion and\n\n[[Page S11165]]\n\nthe recommendation from the President has simply been that we raise the \ncaps of an existing program within the existing farm bill; that, in \nfact, the initiative would not involve any significant change in the \nfarm bill, certainly no more so than accelerating or increasing half \nthe payments. Will the Senator share a view on that?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from South Dakota is absolutely correct. The \nfarm bill that Congress passed said we would provide a support price \nequal to 85 percent of the five-year Olympic average of the average \nprice of this grain. Then they put an artificial budget restraint on it \neven though they promised that formula. Once again, the big print \ngiveth and the little print taketh away. Despite the promise, they put \nan artificial cap on it. That means our support prices don't work. The \npromise doesn't offer real help and it doesn't offer protection.\n  What we have proposed--and the President and others have proposed--is \nto get rid of the artificial cap and to give them what the big print \nsaid they would give them and stop this taking away with the little \nprint. That is all this proposal is about.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. If I may follow up on that, the Senator from North \nDakota has been one of this body's leaders relative to budget \nresponsibility, fiscal responsibility, and the overall effort that we \nhave gone about in bringing the annual Federal budget deficit from $292 \nbillion only 6 years ago to at least a unified budget surplus this \nyear. I think the Senator from North Dakota was deeply involved in the \ncrafting of the legislation that set up the framework that allowed us \nto bring this country to the current point of much greater fiscal \nresponsibility.\n  But it is my understanding, in the context of that debate and setting \nup the pay-as-you-go budget mechanisms that were established in the \nearly 1990s, which have been so successful, that one of the underlying \npremises and understanding of that legislation was that there would be \nfrom time to time emergency needs that would be met with the request \nfrom the President with the concurrence of the Congress, and that it is \nnot inconsistent with the underlying legislation and the progress that \nwe have made towards reducing the deficit. So long as we use care to \ndenominate emergencies as only things which are truly emergencies and \nare reasonably not foreseeable by either the White House or by the \nCongress, the funding of these emergency needs is not inconsistent with \nthe effort we have made to reduce the deficit and to maintain the \ndiscipline of the 1990 and 1993 budget agreements.\n  Is that the Senator's recollection relative to the context of this \nemergency budget request?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes. The Senator from South Dakota is, of course, \ncorrect. Emergency needs have always been anticipated and expected in \nthe budget process. When emergency needs are requested, I am someone \nwho will always vote to fund those emergency needs. It is not outside \nof the scope of what we decided to do when we decided to try to get \nthis country's fiscal house in order. The Senator is correct about \nthat.\n  I don't understand why some continue to insist that the funding \ndoesn't exist for this emergency need. Of course, it does. Of course, \nit is a need.\n  Let me say to the Senator from Virginia, when I said he is here for \nserious business, that the implication was not that this isn't. This is \nthe most serious business for me in this Congress. I know the Senator \nfrom Virginia is involved in defense and a range of other issues that \nare also very serious for this country. I very much appreciate his \nservice and the service of the Senator from Arizona.\n  The Senator from South Dakota, Senator Johnson, of course, is from a \nfarm State, just like mine, that is suffering the same kinds of \nproblems. It is devastating. This crisis is really devastating to not \njust the economy of the State but to the families who tonight will go \nto bed not knowing whether they are going to be able to hang on to \ntheir family farm. That is the dilemma here, and it is something we \nhave to face.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Record will reflect that when the \nSenator made his comment, this Senator said no, I respect him, it is \nserious business, and then reflected on how ably the Senator has \nrepresented his constituents during this crisis.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent to speak out of order for such \ntime as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/30/senate-section/article/S11162-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11165-S11168]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      1999 DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, we had a very significant meeting \nyesterday of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which was a \nculmination of months and months of work on behalf of many of us trying \nto explain to the American people the very threatened situation that \nour country is in, and I am very proud that we had a meeting that I \nwill describe to you in the next few minutes which, I think, is going \nto actually change America's approach to our defense system. I think it \nis very appropriate to talk about this now because I also would be \nspeaking in favor of the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization \nAct for fiscal year 1999.\n  I think it is important for us to understand the deplorable condition \nof our defense system. We have for 14 consecutive years, counting this \nyear, actually had a decline in defense spending. It has dropped and it \nhas dropped and it has dropped. I have to hasten to say this also \ntranscends politics. It has been in Republican administrations and \nDemocrat administrations. Of course, during the administration of \nPresident Clinton it has been worse than it has been before. We are now \nat the lowest level in procurement since 1960. This was attested to \nyesterday by General Reimer, Dennis Reimer, the commander of the Army.\n  Our military now is smaller than it was in the 1930s and is on more \nmissions than we went on during the Vietnam war. Our Army deployments \nhave tripled, the Air Force deployments have quintupled, if there is \nsuch a word, and the Navy ships in the Persian Gulf have reached one of \nthe lowest states of readiness in 5 years. We have Navy aircraft \ncrashes. They are called class A mishaps. They have doubled this year, \nthe highest in 5 years, and CNO Adm. Jay Johnson has attributed this to \na lack of spare parts.\n  As I go around to the various military installations, I see that we \ndon't have spare parts, that we are cannibalizing perfectly good \naircraft to get spare parts to keep other ones running.\n  The Navy was 7,000 short in their recruits this year--7,000. That \nmeans we don't have enough sailors to go out and man the ships \nnecessary to meet the minimum expectations of the American people. The \npilots are leaving the Air Force in droves. Right now, our pilot \nretention has dropped below 20 percent. Madam President, it costs $6 \nmillion to put a pilot in the seat of an F-16, and yet we are down now \nto a 20-percent retention.\n  What does this mean? It means that it costs almost 100 times as much \nto go out and retrain someone as to retain someone who is already \nthere. What is the reason for this?\n  I spent most of the August recess, Madam President, going around to \nthe various military installations in my plane. In fact, I was taking \njournalists with me so they would start writing about this deplorable \nsituation that we find our military in right now. I know one of the \nindividuals who went with me in my plane is Roland Evans, of Evans and \nNovak, and we made a lot of visits to various installations on very, \nvery short notice. In one of the installations, we had over 20 pilots \nin one room. I said, ``Why is it you are down to 20 percent? How many \nof you in here, after this tour of duty, are going to come back in and \ncontinue your careers flying for the Air Force or the Navy?'' About 20 \npercent are going to do it. It is actually a little below that now in \nthe Navy.\n  I said, ``What's the reason for it?'' They started out with the fact \nthat we have starved the budgets for the military to the extent that \nthey don't have\n\n[[Page S11166]]\n\nadequate spare parts, and those kids who are out there, the mechanics \nwho are putting these engines back into condition, flying condition, \nare using spare parts that were cannibalized out of another engine, \nmaybe a new engine, and the end result of that is they are not sure of \nthe work quality of these individuals since they have been up and they \nare working sometimes--we ran into some situations where they are \nworking 16, 18 hours a day. I ask you, Madam President, would you feel \nvery secure about flying an aircraft that has been maintained by \nsomeone who has been on his 18th hour that day? It is a very difficult \nthing. These young people are willing to do it.\n  Then after they talked about that, they talked about--Wait a minute, \nit is not just that; we were hired and recruited to have a career in \nflying and defending America. We want combat skills. As a result of the \ndeployments to places like Bosnia where we don't have any national \nsecurity interests, these people are not able to continue their \ntraining. Out at Nellis Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert where they \nare supposed to have the red flag exercises--these are beautiful \nexercises that allow fighter pilots to go in and train under actual \ncombat conditions, or nearly actual combat conditions, and they are not \nable to do it. They have cut down the number of training flights, \nbecause when they come back from the long deployments to places like \nBosnia and other places where we don't have any national security \ninterests, instead of being with their families, they try to get \ntraining in, and there isn't time when they are back home. \nConsequently, we are having them leave by droves.\n  Now, I used the example, of course, of pilots because there seems to \nbe more interest in them. It is easier for people to understand that if \nyou have a $6 million investment in a man or woman to fly a vehicle and \nthey go off and start working for the airlines and yet they really \nwanted to stay and defend America, you have to examine why is this. It \nis money, it is the contingency operations and it is a lack of mission. \nI have heard that so much from these people, saying, well, we no longer \nknow what the mission is of this country. We are in places where we are \nnot able to use our combat skills. The marine pilots, they are flying \nhelicopters that were used by their fathers in Vietnam.\n  We hear about the MTWs. Sometimes we stand on the Senate floor and we \nstart talking in the language that a lot of people don't understand \nbecause they don't know what an MTW is. That is a major theater war. \nThere is an expectation out around the United States that America's \nmilitary is able to defend America on two regional fronts, and this is \nnot our situation today, as came out in the hearing that we had \nyesterday. I think the people in Oklahoma are aware of this because I \ncommute, I go back every weekend, and I have town meetings. They are \nfully aware of the condition of our military. I was recently in \nChelsea, OK, the home of Will Rogers, and over at the Port of Catoosa, \nplaces where they would otherwise have to depend on what they are \nreading of something that is coming out of the Washington media market \nso they wouldn't really be in a position to understand how deplorable \nthis situation is.\n  As far as the two major theater wars, we are not able to do that \ntoday. If you ask the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and you ask \nthe various chiefs, they will say: Yes, we can do two nearly \nsimultaneous major theater wars. But then you ask them, what is the \nrisk factor? The ``risk factor'' is a term that is used in saying: Yes, \nyou are prepared to do this, but if you do this, No. 1, how long will \nit take? No. 2, how many soldiers will be wounded or killed?\n  In asking them yesterday what the risk factor is of two major theater \nwars, they said it is medium for the first one and high for the second. \nWe need to have the risk factor low, because we are now quantifying as \nto how many American lives will be affected should we find ourselves in \na situation where we have two major theater wars. It comes to something \nlike 16,000 additional Americans will be wounded because of this high-\nrisk factor.\n  One might wonder why there is a high risk factor. Right now we know, \nif you have been reading the newspapers, Madam President, that we have \nvery serious problems in places like Iraq. I don't think there is \nanyone with a background in the military who will tell you if a crisis \nexists, as it does now, if we have to go into Iraq, that it can all be \ndone from the air. It cannot all be done by air. You have to follow up \nwith ground forces.\n  If you go over to the 21st TACOM in Germany--that is where they \nhandle all the logistics in that theater, which includes Bosnia, Iraq, \nand the entire Middle East. What would we do if we had to support a \nground effort in Iraq when we are now at over 100 percent just taking \ncare of the needs of Bosnia?\n  I know that is a shock to a lot of people when they realize that \ngoing into Bosnia, taking all the stuff down there to support the \ntroops that we have there and that our NATO allies have there, and \nfulfilling the commitment we made to them--which we never should have \nmade--is using up 100 percent of the capacity of the 21st TACOM.\n  That means, in the event we had to go into the Middle East, like Iraq \nor Iran or Libya or any other place, we would have to be dependent 100 \npercent on the Guard and Reserve.\n  What has happened to the Guard and Reserve? Because of underfunding \nand deployments to all these different places like Bosnia, in Oklahoma \nwe are deploying our Guard and Reserve for up to 270 days. How many \npeople are in an occupation where they can be let go for 270 days?\n  We have our occupation specialties, our MOSs, that we don't have. We \ndon't have doctors going over there now. If we were forced to support a \nground operation in Iraq, we could not do it with our Guard and \nReserve. That is how desperate the situation is.\n  We covered something else yesterday--I wish the hearing that took \nplace yesterday had happened maybe a month before; then we would have \nbeen able to do a better job with the defense authorization bill which \nwe are, hopefully, about to pass in a short period of time--and that \nis, we brought to the surface the realization that, in addition to the \nproblems I have outlined, we have a backlog of real property \nmaintenance--these are things that have to be done to maintain our \nproperty to house our soldiers around the world--of $38 billion. This \nis $38 billion that will have to be spent sometime, and we have no \npreparation for that at all.\n  We have a shortfall of $1 billion in BASOPS. Those are things that \nhave to be paid for today. We are talking about garbage collection, \nwater bills, and this type of thing. We do not have that kind of money. \nGeneral Tilleli, who is in charge of some 37,000 troops in South Korea \nright now, said just the other day:\n\n       They will not be able to fully support sustained operations \n     due to overdue infrastructure repairs.\n\n  This is a direct quote:\n\n       Strategic airlift will be affected, regardless of one or \n     two MTWs, unless the en route infrastructure in Alaska, \n     Hawaii and Guam receive adequate funding.\n\n  Which they are not right now.\n\n       Presently these three locations require infrastructure \n     repairs on their fuel handling, fuel shortage and material \n     handling equipment.\n\n  On a recent trip to Fort Bragg, one of the most necessary of all \ninstallations, they have barracks that are leaking. The roofs are \nleaking like sieves. We were there right after a very hard rain. Not \nonly was it leaking to where our troops were in the water at the time, \nbut also it was going down into the basement where they have the \narmory, where the weapons are being stored. They are corroding and \nrusting, and our troops are spending their time in a high OPTEMPO or \nPERSTEMPO rate during the hours they have to work in order to keep them \nfor use for training purposes.\n  At Camp Lejeune--it might surprise you, Madam President, even Marines \nhave to have a decent quality of life or at least have to know \nsomething good is going to happen--they have the CH-46. That is a type \nof helicopter they have been using. These helicopters are all older \nthan the pilots flying them. We have a V-22 program that is supposed to \nreplace all the CH-46s, and it is not in place. We are not there yet. \nWe want to get there, but we are not there. That comes into this whole \nequation of having to fund the overall defense system. They say you are \nas\n\n[[Page S11167]]\n\nstrong as the weakest link in a chain. All of our links are equally \nweak and about to break.\n  Madam President, we found at Camp Lejeune in one particular \nhelicopter squadron that only 4 of the 11 helicopters were operational. \nThe rest were either down for maintenance or had been robbed of their \nparts to keep the last four working. This is something that cannot be \ncontinued.\n  I am very proud of General Bramlett. He is currently the FORSCOM \ncommander. He is just about to retire. In his memo that came a couple \nof weeks ago--I am going to quote some things because I want them in \nthe Record--he said:\n\n       We can no longer train and sustain the force, stop \n     infrastructure degradation, and provide our soldiers with the \n     quality of life programs critical to long term readiness of \n     the force.\n       Commanders at Fort Lewis, Stewart and Bragg report units \n     will drop below ALO--\n\n  That is, authorized level of organization--\n\n     in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1999. This threatens our \n     ability to mobilize, deploy, fight and win.\n\n  Further quoting General Bramlett:\n\n       Funding has fallen below the survival level in fiscal year \n     1999 . . . . Current funding levels place FORSCOM's ability \n     to accomplish its mission in an unacceptable risk.\n       Unfunded requirements can only be realized with an increase \n     in the overall funding level for the Department.\n\n  I chair the Readiness Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. Last week, we had both General Bramlett and General \nSchwartz, who will be taking his place as commander of FORSCOM. They \nbelieve the memo he wrote is true today.\n  I know I have described a very ominous situation, Madam President. \nBut the good news is that at yesterday's Armed Services Committee \nhearing, we had Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Shelton, along \nwith the chief of the Army, General Reimer, General Krulak of the \nMarines, General Shelton, Admiral Johnson of the Navy, and General Ryan \nof the Air Force. I want to say publicly how proud I am of the courage \nthat they exhibited yesterday. I do not remember a time when--and I \nhave been here for 12 years and I have read about this situation for \nlonger than that--I don't remember a time when the chiefs of the \nservices had the courage to stand up and say to the President that our \nbudget that you have been giving us for the last few years is \ninadequate to defend America. It displayed an incredible amount of \ncourage. I am very, very proud of them.\n  They identified an immediate need for $17 billion above the \nPresident's budget. They displayed a level of honesty that we should \nall appreciate and we seldom get.\n  I was very proud also--I happen to be a conservative Republican and \nhave always been prodefense--but we had several Democrats on the \ncommittee yesterday. I was surprised and so gratified to hear them come \nout and join in. Senator John Glenn questioned the fact we may have \ngone too far in our drawdown in forces. I was very proud of Senator \nLieberman and his statement when he said, ``We are asking more of our \nmilitary post-cold war than during the cold war,'' and his comments \nregarding national ballistic missile defense, which I want to touch on \nvery briefly in a minute.\n  Senator Cleland, Max Cleland from Georgia, spoke out and he actually \nmade this statement in the committee, that we are going to have to go \nback and listen to what Dr. Schlessinger said recently when he said \nthat the problem is so severe that we are going to have to, in a \nmassive way, rebuild our defense system and do it in a similar way that \nwe did in the early 1980s. He said that it does not seem that with 3 \npercent of gross domestic product we would be able to sustain an \nadequate force; it is going to have to be 4 percent.\n  So what Senator Cleland was saying is, we need an additional $70 \nbillion just to build our forces up to meet the minimum expectations of \nthe American people. What is interesting about what Senator Cleland \nsaid was that in addition to the fact that that equates to $70 billion, \nif you take what each of the chiefs says is necessary over and above \nwhat we have allocated for fiscal year 1999, it comes to about $70 \nbillion.\n  Just for a minute, let's go back to Senator Lieberman who made the \ncomment about the national missile defense system. I have found that \nwhen I go around the country and ask people what their feeling is and \nwhat we would be able to do if, for example, a missile were fired from \nsomeplace in China or someplace from the other side of the world to \nWashington, DC, knowing that it would take 35 minutes to get over here, \nand it is carrying a weapon of mass destruction, either biological, \nchemical or nuclear, what we in the United States could do--because \nmost people think we could shoot it down--fifty-four percent of the \npeople in America think that if a missile were coming over, we would be \nable to shoot it down.\n  In fact we cannot shoot it down. We are naked. We have no defense, \nMadam President, against a missile coming in from another continent. \nAnd the reason is that it is outside the atmosphere. We do not have \nanything that will knock it down. By the time it reenters the \natmosphere, it is going at a velocity that we do not have anything to \nknock it down with.\n  We have been derelict in not pursuing the course we started on in \n1983 to have a system deployed to defend ourselves against an ICBM \ncoming into the United States by fiscal year 1998. That is what we are \njust winding up right now. Yet we have noted that we were on that \ncourse since 1983, until Bill Clinton was elected President of the \nUnited States in 1992, and then started vetoing the defense \nauthorization bills and the defense appropriations bills, until we took \nout funding that would have been there to finish the job to have \ndeployed a national missile defense system by 1998. That is now. \nSomeone was pretty smart back in 1983 to realize this is the time that \nwe would have to have a system in place.\n  However, we now know that it is going to take another 3 years or so \nto do it. Several of us who have been promoting a national missile \ndefense system have concluded that one of the reasons we have not been \nable to impress upon the people of America how dangerous of a situation \nwe are in right now is that they have been confused by all the \ndifferent types of national missile defense systems.\n  So we have all kind of gotten down to one, the one that would give us \nthe best system, the cheapest in the shortest period of time just to \ntake care of a limited attack by a warhead that would be coming over on \na missile.\n  That would be the Aegis system, Madam President. We have $50 billion \ninvested in 22 ships right now. They have the potential missile defense \ncapability to knock down long range missiles outside the atmosphere. To \ndo this, to upgrade the system to be fully capable in the upper tier \nwould cost approximately $4 billion more and take about 3 more years. \nWe want to get on that road so we can get a system here as soon as \npossible, but we do not have it yet. We do not have it in this defense \nauthorization bill. And yet we have gone as far as we can go with the \nbill now.\n  I only regret that we did not have these committee hearings a month \nago so that we could have done a better job preparing for the defense \nof America than we have done in the 1999 Strom Thurmond national \ndefense authorization.\n  So with that, I just want to say that I do fully support the bill. I \nhope it comes up some time either Thursday or Friday and we can vote \nfor it, support it, pass it, and then start rebuilding our defenses so \nthat we can at least meet the minimum expectations of the American \npeople and be honest with them and defend my seven grandchildren, my \nfour children, and the rest of America.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much.\n  I want to compliment the Senator from Oklahoma.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my continued \ndisappointment at the political maneuvering which has resulted in an \nextension of the Northeast Dairy Compact--an example of legislation \ndriven by regional politics.\n  I wish to register strong protest to the extension and ask that my \ncolleagues join me and those in the Upper Midwest who must once again \nspeak out against patently unfair, anti-American, anticompetitive \npolicy.\n  This is an archaic Federal dairy policy that penalizes farmers in the \nUpper Midwest, while giving benefits to farmers in other parts of the \ncountry in the dairy industry.\n  The expected Agriculture appropriations conference report will \ninclude House language which underhandedly extends the Northeast \nInterstate Dairy Compact.\n  Under the 1996 Food and Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act, \ncommonly known as the FAIR Act, federal milk marketing order reform \nwould go into effect in April, 1999. However, the conference committee \nhas now adopted the House Agriculture Appropriations Committee bill \nlanguage which delays the implementation date for Federal milk \nmarketing order reform until October, 1999--6 months later. Not only \ndoes this delay long overdue marketing reforms, it also extends the \nNortheast Dairy Compact, which is not set to expire until the Federal \nmilk marketing orders go into effect.\n  Mr. President, USDA did not request a delay of the milk marketing \norder reforms. The real purpose of the House language is simply to \nextend the Northeast Dairy Compact.\n  That this extension is even being considered leads me to believe \nthere are some who remain unaware of the notorious history of the \nNortheast Dairy Compact's creation and its negative impact on consumers \nand all dairy farmers--with the notable exception of the largest dairy \nindustries within the compact region.\n  The 1996 FAIR Act included substantive reforms for dairy policy. It \nset the stage for greater market-orientation in dairy policy, including \nreform of the archaic Federal milk marketing orders. Yet, despite a \nstrong vote by the Senate to strip the Northeast Interstate Dairy \nCompact from its version of the FAIR Act, and the deliberate exclusion \nof any Compact language from the House version of the bill, a Northeast \nInterstate Dairy Compact provision was slipped into the conference \nreport.\n  This language, however, does call for the compact to be terminated \nupon completion of the Federal milk marketing order reform process, \nagain, set in April of 1999.\n  It is imperative that the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact sunset \nas was intended, and that no new compacts are created. Dairy farmers \nhave not seen positive benefits as a result of the compact and \nconsumers have been hurt by higher prices.\n  It is estimated that consumers in the compact region of the Northeast \nhave an increased annual cost of almost $50 million due to the compact. \nNot surprisingly, milk consumption in the compact area has dropped as a \nresult. The only real winners have been the largest industrial dairies \nof the Upper Northeast.\n  It is really no surprise. Just consider it: if the compact pays a \npremium per hundredweight of milk, and large industrial dairies are \nable to produce, let's say 15 to 20 times more than the ``typical'' \ntraditional dairy farm that the compact was supposedly going to \nprotect, who do you suppose wins? It certainly isn't the traditional \ndairy farm. They are still put at a competitive disadvantage, thanks to \nregional politics, and so are dairies outside the compact region.\n  The artificial price increase stimulates overproduction and it floods \nthe rest of the market in other parts of the country, and in other \nmarkets as well, including milk for cheese. Basically, all the \nprinciples of market forces, including pricing based on supply and \ndemand and producers effectively determining profit and loss through \nefficiency, have now been replaced by artificial pricing.\n\n  If any other industry tried to fix prices in this manner, I believe \nthey would be hauled into court. Let me show this chart. The questions \ncontained on the chart, which of these is actual Federal policy? \nLooking at the four questions:\n\n       All computers should be price-adjusted according to their \n     distance from Seattle.\n       All oranges should be price-adjusted according to their \n     distance from Florida.\n       All country music should be price-adjusted according to its \n     distance from Nashville.\n       All milk should be price-adjusted according to its distance \n     from Eau Claire.\n\n  All of these are foolish. But this is Federal policy. The last one, \n``All milk should be price-adjusted according to its distance from Eau \nClaire,'' WI, might have made sense back in the 1930s when it was \ninstituted, because of transportation and refrigeration, in order to \nencourage dairy production in other parts of the country. The Midwest, \nreally, is the heart of the dairy industry in this country. So they set \nup these laws, but these laws are now archaic, outdated. They no longer \nneed to be on the books. All they do is penalize the farmers in the \nMidwest who get the lowest prices for their milk and reward farmers \nfurther away from Madison or Eau Claire, WI, who receive more money for \ndairy products, despite the new and improved transportation and \nrefrigeration in this country. This may have served a purpose in the \n1930s, but it is outdated when we come into this century.\n  What it does is have the government picking winners and losers when \nit comes to dairy. They have their foot on the neck of dairy farmers in \nthe Midwest while granting dairy farmers in other parts of the country \nmore money.\n  All we are asking for is fairness in this policy. Should computers be \npriced according to their distance from Seattle? No. Should oranges be \npriced according to their distance from Florida? They are not. Is all \ncountry music priced according to its distance from Nashville? No, that \nis ridiculous. And the same should be true for dairy--Should all milk \nbe priced according to its distance from Eau Claire? No.\n  USDA's own data show that milk production has increased substantially \nin the Compact region of the Northeast. In fact, the increase in \nproduction has been so great that the Compact Commission has started to \nwithhold money from farmers, in anticipation of being required to \nreimburse the Commodity Credit Corporation for increased purchases of \nsurplus dairy products.\n  But the creation of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact, we have \ndone a disservice to traditional dairy farmers in the Compact region, \nconsumers within the Compact region, and all dairy producers nation-\nwide who have been forced to pay the price of this anti-competitive \nmeasure.\n  The higher milk prices in the Compact region are cause for alarm, but \nthese consequences were easily foreseeable. What is outrageous is the \nidea of another extension of this anti-competitive effort.\n  As far as I'm concerned, this is it--the last straw. There will be no \nmore extensions. The Northeast Dairy Compact has had its day. It has \nfailed. It is being kept alive for another six months by a life-support \nsystem of favors and big business.\n  I believe it's time to put fairness first and put the Senate on \nnotice. The Upper Midwest has waited long enough for substantive \nreform--basic fairness. I will continue to make this point during the \nnext Congress, no matter how long it takes to get the message across.\n  Special protection benefits and anti-competitive measures make \ncompetitors worried, and rightly so. The Northeast Interstate Dairy \nCompact has spurred a movement in the Southeast to create a similar \nCompact.\n  In fact, earlier this year the groundwork was laid for a national \npatchwork of regional compacts. Roughly half the country had either \npassed enabling compact legislation, was debating such legislation, or \nwas a part of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact.\n\n[[Page S11169]]\n\n  Can you imagine in the time when we are trying to knock down trade \nbarriers with other countries around the world to have greater access \nto markets, to help export our products, especially in agriculture, \nthat we, here in our own country, would put up trade barriers between \nportions of the country?\n  Clearly, the writing is on the wall. As far as dairy policy is \nconcerned, we're at a pivotal juncture. We must either decide to \nsupport a national system or regionalize. A national patchwork of \ncompacts would render the Federal Milk Marketing Order reforms \nmeaningless. It would essentially kill any hope for real federal \nreform. Interstate commerce in the milk industry would be a confusing \nmaze.\n  To extend the Compact ignores the mandate of the 1996 FAIR Act \nitself. Further, attempts to accomplish this regional protectionism \nthrough an annual appropriations bill is also particularly offensive.\n  Certainly, it is difficult to have the courage to bypass a quick-fix \nin favor of a long-range view. But that's where real leadership comes \ninto play. Let's be advocates for the traditional dairy farmers, not \njust the mega-dairies, and maintain the integrity of the legislative \nprocess by standing up to policy making behind closed doors.\n  An extension of the Northeast Dairy Compact does not belong in \nimportant Agriculture Appropriations legislation.\n  What is required next is a complete overhaul of this antiquated and \njust plain unfair dairy policy.\n  Again, established back in the 1930s, it has long outlived its \nusefulness. It is counterproductive, anti-American and unfair. Let's \ngive all dairy farmers in all areas of the country the ability to \ncompete on a level playing field.\n  I close with a quote from the Chicago Tribune. The quote says:\n\n       More compacts [like the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact] \n     will only mean higher milk prices for even more consumers and \n     more lost market opportunities for the Midwest. . . . How \n     could Washington approve this throw back to Depression-era \n     economics when other farm subsidies . . . are being phased \n     out? Back-room deals and pork barrel politics, that's how [it \n     is done.]\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/30/senate-section/article/S11168-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11169-S11170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TAX CUTS AND THE GOOD GOVERNMENT AMENDMENT MUST PASS\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, just briefly, today, as you know, marks the \nend of the fiscal year for Washington, the fiscal year of 1998; \ntomorrow will be the first day of fiscal year 1999. This turn of the \ncalendar, like any new year, is an appropriate time to review the \naccomplishments of the previous year and also to set goals for the next \nyear.\n  What a year it has been. Last year, we passed significant tax \nrelief--including a $500 per-child tax credit that will soon take \neffect. In addition, for the first time since 1969, we passed and \nabided by a balanced budget. It has not been easy. It has not gone \nwithout temptations. There have been spirited attempts to spend \ntaxpayer dollars and drag us into an even larger deficit, blowing one \nspending cap at a time. This remains a difficult task even today--\nCongress is pushing to complete legislative work on all 13 \nappropriations bills by this time. But to date, the President has \nsigned only one into law, and only two others are on their way to him. \nThe reason for the delay is that by habit, Washington loosely \ninterchanges the act of deciding how much to spend with that of \n``spending much.''\n  To my dismay, many colleagues and the President's Administration have \nused this end of the fiscal year and the near end of the Congressional \nsession to push for their election-year political agendas. The result? \nAgain is political blackmail: if you do not give me this, I will shut \nthe government down and blame you for being heartless and ineffective. \nThis delay has also put off important consideration of overdue tax \nrelief for hard-working American families. In fact, the entire tax bill \nrecently passed by the other legislative body is now in jeopardy \nbecause Washington cannot decide on how best to spend taxpayers' money \nfor political agendas.\n  Now, let me be clear on my position. A tax cut is not spending. Only \nin Washington's bookkeeping do we consider a cut in revenue to be \nspending.\n  Mr. President, are we going to allow another Government shutdown--a \nsituation where everybody loses? I certainly hope we don't. In the past \nfew months, I have asked both the Senate majority leader and the Senate \nminority leader several times to honor the commitment they made during \nthe consideration of last year's disaster relief legislation to support \na bill I introduced called the ``Good Government Amendment,'' which \nwould create an automatic continuing resolution to avoid a Government \nshutdown. But so far, it has been to no avail.\n  We do have a system that allows the Government to operate through \nOctober 9. But what happens if that agreement, that continuing \nresolution allowing the spending to go on, is not extended and the \nthreat of a shutdown could cost the taxpayers billions more in new \nspending in order to close this year?\n  With the end of the fiscal year upon us and just a few days left in \nthis session, don't you think we need a contingency plan, some \nmechanism to avoid the end-of-session battles that often result in more \nGovernment spending?\n  There are essential functions and services of the Federal Government \nwe must continue, regardless of our differences in budget priorities. \nOur constituents deserve assurances that the Federal services they \nexpect will not be bogged down by politics. They should also expect \nthat Washington is trying to find ways to spend their money wisely and \nnot wastefully. The rest should be returned in the form of tax relief.\n  Mr. President, despite a shrinking Federal deficit, total taxation is \nat an all-time high. The tax relief Congress enacted last year doesn't \ngo nearly far enough; it returns to the taxpayers only one cent for \nevery dollar they send to Washington. By the way, taxes on the average \nAmerican family are at the highest level in history--even higher than \nduring World War II. The average family will pay about 40 percent of \neverything they make in taxes to Federal, State and local governments.\n  I urge my colleagues to review CBO's August Economic and Budget \nOutlook, which shows precisely where revenues will come from in the \nnext ten years. The data indicates that the greatest share of the \nprojected budget surplus comes directly from income taxes paid by the \ntaxpayers, not through the FICA taxes, or Social Security.\n  In 1998, individual income, corporate, and estate taxes consist of 80 \npercent of total tax revenue growth, while the share of FICA tax is \nabout 20 percent of that growth. General tax revenues are expected to \ngrow by $723 billion, or 60 percent, over the next 10 years.\n  What I am saying is that the taxpayers generated the surplus, outside \nof the money earmarked for Social Security, and we ought to return at \nleast a portion of it to them. If we don't return at least some of the \nsurplus to the taxpayers--and soon--Washington will spend it all, \nleaving nothing for tax relief or the vitally important task of \npreserving Social Security. Such spending will only enlarge the \nGovernment, and if we enlarge the Govenment today, it will make it even \nmore expensive to support in the future.\n  The tax relief proposal now making its way through Congress will help \nfarmers and small business owners to pass their legacies to their \nchildren. It would reduce self-employed medical costs, and it would \ncorrect the injustice of the marriage penalty tax.\n  My problem with this proposal, however, is that it just doesn't go \nfar enough. I think most Americans, if given the facts, would agree, \nlooking at their own pocketbooks and their own tax statements, that tax \ncuts are needed.\n  Mr. President, some in the Senate juxtapose tax relief with Social \nSecurity reform. They suggest to the American people that they are \nmutually exclusive choices. They say you can't have one with the other. \nIf you have tax cuts, we are not going to save for Social Security and \nprotect it; or if we protect Social Security, we can't have\n\n[[Page S11170]]\n\ntax relief. That is not true. That is not the case. To be sure, \nWashington has been guilty of mishandling the Social Security system.\n  Since 1983, Washington has raided more than $700 billion from the \ntrust funds for non-Social Security programs, and Congress voted for \nthe spending. In the next 5 years, the Federal Government will raid \nanother $600 billion from the Social Security trust funds, as well.\n  Now I hear some who come to the floor and say they won't vote to use \nSocial Security trust funds to give tax relief. I ask, why their change \nof heart today? They voted for most, if not all, of the spending bills \nin the last 15 years which have used Social Security to make up the \ndifference of revenues versus outlays. In other words, they are willing \nto take Social Security surpluses and put it into higher Federal \nspending, but they are not willing to take excess income revenues and \nput it into tax relief for average Americans.\n  I just note that no one raised the issue of saving Social Security \nwhen those spending initiatives were on the table. No one juxtaposed \nspending with Social Security. That was because Washington was spending \nother people's money. But once the tables are turned and the Senate is \nasked to pass tax relief for America's hard-working taxpayers--meaning \nthat Washington gets a little less--suddenly, we face gridlock and are \nin a quandary.\n  Again, Washington says it just can't afford to let Americans have \nsome of their money back; Washington needs it to satisfy its spending \nappetite. I always ask Americans, ``Did Washington ever call you and \nask how are you going to get by with less money if we raise your taxes? \nHow are you going to continue to provide for your families?'' And they \nsay, ``No, they never call and ask that.'' They just pass it and take \nit. So American families have to then learn how to do more with less, \nor get by without.\n  Mr. President, despite the rhetoric of saving Social Security, few \nhave come up with a concrete plan to actually save it. The problem is \nthat, by law, the Social Security surplus has to be put into Treasury \nsecurities. That means Washington can legally use the money to fund its \nnon-Social Security pet programs. They take the money out of the trust \nfund, put it into the General Treasury, and then spend it. Ask anybody \nhow are they going to take any money out of the Social Security trust \nfunds? How are they going to redeem any of those notes or Treasury \nbills in the trust fund? They are going to have to go to the American \npeople and ask for more money in taxes in order to retire the debts.\n  In other words, the money Americans have already saved for their \nretirement future has been spent by the Government, and the Government \nis now going to come back to you and say you have to pay again in order \nto satisfy the needs. So these assets are essentially nothing more than \nTreasury IOUs, redeemable only by cutting spending, raising taxes, or \nborrowing from the public. Unless we change the law, Washington will \ncontinue to use Social Security until it goes broke.\n\n  Mr. President, I am going to introduce legislation next week that \nwill help shift retirement decisions back to those who know retirees' \nneeds the best, and that is the retirees themselves.\n  On the last day of the fiscal year, we can be proud of the Balanced \nBudget Act that Congress enacted and upheld over the course of the past \nyear. But we must also be prepared for the upcoming year, as well. A \nGovernment shutdown is looming again--a testament to politics in an \nelection year more than sound debate over budget policy. I truly hope \nthat this political chicanery does not make tax relief, and ultimately \nthe hard-working American taxpayers, the losers in this inside-the-\nbeltway game of politics.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Grams, for \ndealing with an issue that this Senate has to deal with, and in a very \nshort time. Somehow there is this belief here in Washington that you \ncan save Social Security, but you can't give tax relief. Well, I, like \nSenator Grams, believe we must and can do both, not only to keep the \neconomy moving and growing, but also to recognize the importance that \nwe have a surplus, thanks to our diligence over the last decade, and \nnow we can use it to strengthen and reform Social Security, and we \nprobably have the opportunity of a generation to do that. I hope that \nthe Congress can and will do both.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for no more than 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Craig pertaining to the introduction of S. 2533 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. CRAIG.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     3616) have agreed to recommend and do recommend to their \n     respective Houses this report, signed by a majority of the \n     conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of September 22, 1998.)\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, as the Senate takes up the conference \nreport on the national defense authorization bill, it brings to an end \na process that began in February with the introduction of the \nPresident's defense budget by Secretary Cohen. During the intervening \nmonths, the committee conducted more than 50 hearings which identified \nthe declining readiness status of our military. In response, the \ncommittee formulated a bill that addressed these issues and garnered \nthe support of both the civilian and military leadership of the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  The committee completed the markup of the defense bill in mid-May. \nHowever, due to the intervening debate on the tobacco bill, the Senate \ntook more than four weeks to complete action on the bill. Although the \nfloor debate was protracted, I want to thank my colleagues for their \noverwhelming 88 to 4 vote in favor of the bill, and for their \ncontributions during the floor debate.\n  The Senate's strong support of the bill was a key factor during the \ndifficult conference with the House. When we began the conference to \nresolve the differences between the House and Senate bills, we faced a \nveto threat on four provisions. I am pleased to report that we were \nable to mitigate each of these objections. At this point, I am not \naware of any remaining veto issues, and expect that the President will \nsign this bill.\n\n[[Page S11171]]\n\n  Mr. President, tomorrow prior to the vote on final passage, Senator \nLevin and I will provide specific details on the conference report. \nSuffice it to say that this is a very good bill and contains vital \nprovisions necessary for the security of our nation. However, like all \ncompromise bills it does not please everyone and, unfortunately, one \nSenator has objected to provisions in the bill and delayed action on \nthe report despite the fact that all members of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee and the House National Security Committee signed the \nconference report and despite the fact that the House passed the bill \nby a vote of 373 to 50. I am disappointed that it took until today to \nget the report to the floor, but am certain that the Senate will show \nits strong support for the bill when we vote tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I want to emphasize again that this is a sound bill. \nIt provides the best possible outcome for our national security while \ncomplying with the guidelines established in the balanced budget \nagreement. I recommend the conference report on the national defense \nauthorization bill for fiscal year 1999 to the Senate and urge its \nadoption.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I believe my friend and colleague--and I \nwish to thank him very much for his cooperation in assisting Senator \nThurmond, myself, and others to bring up this bill--has a matter of \ngreat importance to the Senator which he wishes to address, and at this \ntime I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank Senator Warner. I thank Senator Thurmond, the \nchairman of the committee, as well.\n  As the Senator knows, I have raised an issue with the tritium \nprovisions included in the fiscal year 1999 National Defense \nAuthorization Act conference report. And I would be happy to engage in \nthis colloquy with respect to that issue.\n  As the Senator knows, the conference report provision regarding \ntritium states, among other things, that ``the Secretary of Energy may \nnot obligate or expend any funds authorized to be appropriated or \notherwise available to the Department of Energy for fiscal year 1999 to \nimplement a final decision on the technology to be utilized for tritium \nproduction, made pursuant to section 3135 of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 1998.''\n  I am concerned that the administration will use this provision to \ncontinue to delay progress on this important program and build in a \none-year delay in meeting DOD requirements.\n  Can the Senator please explain the intent of this provision?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, again, I worked very closely with Chairman \nThurmond throughout the conference, and I can reply to my colleague's \nquestion. I would be pleased to explain the impact of this provision.\n  The intent of the proposed compromise is to keep the Department of \nEnergy tritium program moving forward. The proposed conference \nagreement would require the Secretary of Energy to select his preferred \ntritium technology not later than December of this year, consistent \nwith the requirements of the National Defense Authorization Act for \nfiscal year 1998. Although the Secretary would be prohibited from \nspending any money in fiscal year 1999 to implement the selected \ntechnology, he would not be prohibited from completing research, \ndevelopment, demonstration, or design activities, and, indeed, we \nstrongly encourage him to do so.\n  I would like to call on the Senator from New Hampshire, Strategic \nForces Subcommittee chairman Bob Smith, for a few comments on this.\n  Mr. SMITH. I thank the Senator. I share the concern of the Senator \nfrom Arizona about tritium. We must have a new source of tritium to \nmaintain the U.S. nuclear deterrent. As chairman of the subcommittee \nthat is responsible for this issue, I can assure all of my colleagues \nthat I am fully committed to ensuring that the Department of Energy \nmeets DOD's requirement for new tritium production.\n  I have made timely restoration of tritium production one of my \nhighest priorities as chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee. \nFor the past 3 years, the committee has taken action to accelerate \nDOE's tritium selection process. We have accelerated the Secretary's \ndecision date twice and increased the DOE tritium budget three times. \nThis year, we added $60 million to the tritium program in the \ncommittee's markup. The conference outcome reflects a $20 million \nincrease to the tritium program because that was the highest amount \nincluded in the energy and water appropriations bill.\n  The committee has taken these actions to ensure that the tritium \nprogram continues to move forward and we will continue to do so in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the committee has a long history of \nkeeping the Department of Energy focused on restoring tritium \nproduction to meet defense needs.\n  Unfortunately, we found that the Department of Energy had not \nrequested adequate budget authority nor developed sufficient plans to \neffectively implement a tritium production source decision, which the \nSecretary is required to make in December of 1998. The conference \nreport requires the Secretary of Energy to submit with the President's \nfiscal year 2000 budget request a comprehensive plan on how he would \nimplement his preferred technology. The plan would include a proposed \nimplementation schedule, annual funding requirements for the life of \nthe project, any legislation needed to implement the technology \nselected, and an assessment of the viability of purchasing tritium, if \nnecessary for national security purposes, on an interim basis.\n  By requiring the plan to be submitted with the President's budget, \nCongress can act if we find the selected technology cannot reliably \nmeet defense requirements, the implementation schedule is too lax, or \nfunding is inadequate.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator.\n  Is it the Senator's understanding that, should the Department of \nEnergy submit a deficient plan or fiscal year 2000 budget request, the \ncommittee will take action to rectify the problem?\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to my colleague, in brief, the answer is yes. \nConsistent with the committee's previous actions, we would address any \nschedule our funding shortfalls identified in the Secretary's plan and \nbudget request. We fully expect that Secretary Richardson will submit \nthe required plan on time and that the plan will include a credible \nbudget request for this important program.\n  Mr. KYL. Is it further the Senator's understanding that the \nDepartment of Energy may reprogram funds to implement its December 1998 \ntritium production decision?\n  Mr. WARNER. In response, Mr. President, the Department is not \nrestricted by this legislation from requesting permission to reprogram \nfunds to implement its December 1998 tritium production decision. We \nexpect the Secretary to take all actions necessary to restore a \npermanent and reliable tritium production source in time to meet \nestablished DOD requirements, and that includes reprogramming funds if \nnecessary.\n  The comprehensive tritium implementation plan required by this bill \nrequires the Secretary to submit a life-cycle plan to fully fund and \nimplement whichever technology is selected. We intend to review that \nplan very closely to ensure that it can be implemented and that it will \nresult in the delivery of tritium by the date required by the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator.\n  I hope the Department does submit a reprogramming request to \nimplement the December decision.\n  Is it the committee's intent to indicate in any way to the Department \nor other parts of the Federal Government that the committee expects DOE \nto defer selection of a preferred tritium source in December of this \nyear?\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to my colleague, as I stated previously, the \nlegislative provision included in this conference report requires the \nSecretary to select his preferred option not later than December 31 of \nthis year.\n  Mr. KYL. The Senator from Virginia and Chairman Thurmond have been \nstrong and consistent proponents of the tritium production program. \nWhat is the Senator's view about how we should proceed at this point?\n  Mr. WARNER. First, I would say we should ensure that the Department \nof Energy's fiscal year 2000 budget request be adequate to ensure \ndelivery of tritium on a schedule that meets the Department of Defense \nrequirements defined in the Nuclear Weapons Stockpile Memorandum.\n\n[[Page S11172]]\n\n  Second, it is the responsibility of the Armed Services Committee, \nworking with other committees of the Senate, to ensure that the program \nplan and budget laid out by the Secretary of Energy in January of 1999 \nare credible and will allow the Department to meet the requirements of \nthe Department of Defense. This means, among other things, that the \nDepartment of Energy is going to have to submit more credible budget \nrequests than it has in the past.\n  Third, we are prepared to consider reprogramming requests or other \nactions DOE believes necessary to meet tritium production requirements \non the schedule identified by DOD.\n  Mr. SMITH. I agree. As Chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, \nI wish to emphasize to the Department of Energy and the administration \nthat the President's fiscal year 2000 budget request includes \nsufficient funds for a tritium production source.\n  Mr. WARNER. I agree. As a senior member of the Armed Services \nCommittee, I fully expect Secretary Richardson to submit a budget in \nfiscal year 2000 and the outyears that includes adequate funding for \nour tritium source.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I too am concerned about the tritium \nproduction decision and its future funding. My position over the last \nseveral months focused on the debate to retain the decisionmaking \nauthority of DOE so that the Department might be free to make the most \ntechnically feasible, cost-effective decision to meet our national \ndefense needs. I share the concerns of my colleagues about the delay of \nimplementation and the need for adequate funding, and I am hopeful that \nDOE will include full funding for a tritium production source, not only \nin fiscal year 2000, but in the outyears as well.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I can say further, the Senator's colleague, the senior \nSenator from Alabama, likewise worked with the Armed Services Committee \nin the course of this very important resolution of this issue. That is \nSenator Shelby.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate the commitment that Senator \nWarner and other members of the Armed Services Committee and Senator \nSessions have expressed regarding this program. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to ensure that a new tritium source is \nimplemented on schedule meeting DOD requirements.\n  Again, I thank Senator Warner for his cooperation in helping to bring \nthis matter to the floor at this time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our colleague.\n  This is a subject that would not ordinarily attract the attention of \na great many because it is a very complex and technical one. But this \nfine Senator, Senator Kyl, has devoted much of his career to working \nwith strategic programs. For that, I express my gratitude and, indeed, \non behalf of most, if not all, of our colleagues for his very \nindustrious and thorough work for many, many years as relates to the \nNation's strategic programs.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise at this time to express my opposition \nto specific language in the defense authorization conference report \nprohibiting the use of fiscal year 1999 funds to implement the decision \nof the Department of Energy regarding a production source for tritium. \nSpecifically, the language states as follows:\n\n       The Secretary of Energy may not obligate or expend any \n     funds authorized to be appropriated or otherwise available to \n     the Department of Energy for fiscal year 1999 to implement a \n     final decision on the technology to be utilized for tritium \n     production, made pursuant to section 3135 of the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1998 . . . until \n     October 1, 1999.\n\n  Mr. President, anything that might delay implementation of a tritium \nproduction program ought to be of great concern to all of us. Tritium \nis the key to maintaining the credibility of our nuclear deterrent. \nWithout a reliable source of tritium, our nuclear forces could become \nimpotent, thereby undermining the very essence of a deterrent that has \nkept the peace for more than 40 years.\n  Mr. President, for the benefit of those who are not as familiar with \nthe program, tritium is a gas that is injected into a nuclear warhead \nto boost its yield. Once it is produced, however, tritium begins to \ndecay at a rate of approximately 5 percent per year, therefore it must \nbe replenished constantly.\n  The United States has not produced tritium since 1988 when the Bush \nadministration made the decision to shut down the K-reactor at the \nSavannah River site. Since that time, replenishment of tritium in the \nstockpile has continued only by recycling it from dismantled nuclear \nwarheads.\n  When the Bush administration made the decision to shut down the K-\nreactor, it immediately embarked on a new production reactor program \nwith the purpose of identifying and selecting a new production source \nfor tritium.\n  Mr. President, I should say at this point that I have no parochial \ninterest in what type of technology the Department of Energy selects to \nproduce tritium. I favor only the option that will provide an assured \nsource of tritium in the timeframe necessary to meet the requirements \nset by the Department of Defense. My interest in tritium dates back to \nthe 1988 decision by the Bush administration when I was the ranking \nminority member of the Defense Nuclear Facilities Panel of the House \nArmed Services Committee.\n  It is because I have no parochial interest and that I have had such a \nlongstanding interest in ensuring a reliable source for tritium in the \nUnited States that I rise in opposition to the actions taken by the \nconferees in the fiscal year 1999 defense conference report.\n  For 10 years, the Congress has been on record as encouraging DOE to \nmake a decision on a tritium production source. A report issued by \nformer Senator Sam Nunn in 1990 said:\n\n       The committee strongly supports the acquisition of a new \n     production reactor, believing an assured supply of tritium is \n     the highest nuclear material priority in support of the \n     nation's nuclear deterrent forces.\n\n  A 1992 defense authorization report from the Senate stated:\n\n       As long as the United States maintains a nuclear deterrent \n     it will need a reliable supply of tritium to retain the \n     viability of the stockpile.\n\n  A 1995 House report stated:\n\n       The Committee is deeply concerned about the lack of \n     progress by the department in establishing a long term source \n     of tritium, which is necessary to maintain the nation's \n     nuclear deterrent.\n\n  And section 3135 of the fiscal year 1998 defense authorization bill \nrequired the Secretary of Energy to select a production source for \ntritium not later than December of this year.\n  For 10 years, Congress has been on record as pushing the Department \nof Energy to select among all of the technologies once thought to be \noptimum to produce tritium. First, there was the heavy water option, \nthen the modular, high temperature gas cooled reactor, then a triple \nplay reactor. Even the heavy metal reactor came under consideration. \nThe Fast Flux reactor was next, and then the commercial lightwater \nreactor and finally the accelerator. Now DOE is selecting between the \nTVA reactor option--a civilian lightwater reactor that may include \nirradiation services only, and building a particle accelerator at the \nSavannah River site.\n  For ten years, Congress has pushed and pulled DOE along to make a \ndecision on a production source for tritium. Until now. This year, \ninexplicably, just three months before the Secretary of Energy will \nmake a decision Congress has been waiting for ten years to hear, the \nconferees decided to stop the DOE from expending or obligating any \nfunds to implement its December decision. Why?\n  I certainly do not intend to criticize any individual Senator on the \nArmed Services Committee. Certainly they have all acted with deep \nconcern for the national security of the United States. Senator Bob \nSmith, the chairman of the subcommittee with jurisdiction over DOE \nnuclear matters and a strong advocate for a new production source, \nattempted to add $60 million to the budget line for tritium. He was \nthwarted for a variety of reasons.\n  Senator Thurmond, the chairman of the full committee, has always \nfought hard to protect the interests of his state; but he has fought \nequally hard for the interests of all Americans in national defense \nmatters. And Senator Warner, with whom I just had a colloquy, attempted \nto do his best in this regard, as well.\n  So why did the Congress prohibit the Department of Energy from \nspending or obligating funds to implement the tritium production \ndecision? The answer is: politics. This conference compromise, I am sad \nto say, is all about\n\n[[Page S11173]]\n\npolitics. In the House, anti-nuclear foes teamed up with Members \npromoting one of the options under consideration by DOE, forming a \ncoalition that threatened to jeopardize the entire defense \nauthorization bill. Senate conferees had to find a ``compromise'' just \nto get the bill out of the conference committee. And the only \ncompromise the House would agree to was calculated to allow advocates \nfor the losing production option to challenge the Secretary's decision \nfor a year, in effect, without prejudice.\n  I would be remiss in my duty if I did not express my strong \nopposition to this language, because I believe it is tragic that a \nmatter of this magnitude--literally going to the viability of our \nstrategic stockpile--might be influenced by parochial interests.\n  I can assure my colleagues that one of my top priorities from this \npoint forward will be to ensure that the Department of Energy selects a \ntritium production source, that the Department requests adequate funds \nto implement its decision in fiscal year 2000 and beyond, and that the \nDepartment be allowed, indeed required, to proceed with the production \nof tritium without hometown politics or anti-nuke groups stopping it or \nslowing it down.\n  Force level requirements will dictate when the United States needs \ntritium. If START I levels are maintained, the United States may need \ntritium as early as 2005. Since it will take several years to complete \nTVA's Belefonte reactor or to build an accelerator, two of the options, \nwe are already bumping up against the deadline to begin producing \ntritium for the active stockpile. We already know that tritium will not \nbe available for the inactive stockpile. That means if there's a \ncrisis, the United States will not be able to bring the inactive \nstockpile into the inventory.\n  Many hope that the United States and Russia will reduce their \nstrategic forces to START II levels; however, there is no evidence that \nthe Duma in Russia is inclined to ratify START II. And, U.S. law \nprohibits U.S. forces from being reduced beyond START I levels until \nSTART II enters into force. The Resolution of Ratification for the \nStart II Treaty states, ``The START II Treaty shall be binding on the \nUnited States until such time as the Duma of the Russian Federation has \nacted pursuant to its constitutional responsibilities.'' At the START \nII level, the United States must make a decision on a tritium \nproduction source without delay.\n  So, I support the requirement that Secretary Richardson make that \ndecision this December, and I pledge to work as hard as I can to ensure \nthat the decision is carried through to the actual timely production of \ntritium. I urge my colleagues, including those in the House, to put the \nnation's interests first, and support a timely implementation of a \ntritium production facility decision.\n  I appreciate that the majority leader will make a strong statement \ntomorrow making clear his commitment to provide the leadership to \nensure the achievement of that goal. And, the colloquy with Senator \nWarner and Senator Smith of the Armed Services Committee and Senator \nSessions should make it clear that the Senate leaders on this issue are \nall strongly committed to seeing that the DOE follow up the Secretary's \nDecision with everything necessary to meet our tritium production \nrequirements.\n  With these assurances strongly asserted here today, I am hopeful the \ncongressional majority will hereafter present a united front, leaving \nno doubt that the administration must move with dispatch to implement \nthe tritium production decision. As a result, I will support the \nconference report.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, earlier today, my good friend, the \njunior Senator from Arizona, Senator Kyl, entered into a colloquy with \nSenator Warner and others regarding the tritium provisions included in \nthe Defense authorization conference report. Senator Kyl later made a \nstatement about the agreement we negotiated in conference on the \ntritium issue. While I appreciated the kind words he said about me, I \nwas somewhat surprised by some of his comments made about the tritium \nagreement we negotiated in conference. I'm reminded of something my old \nfriend, Will Rogers used to say, ``It's not what he don't know that \nbothers me, it's what he knows so well, that ain't so.''\n  I want to take this opportunity to clarify what the conference \nagreement actually does. The tritium provision included in this bill \nwill not cause any meaningful delay in the resumption of tritium \nproduction. Let me repeat that so all of my colleagues are clear about \nthis point--our conference provision on tritium does not cause any \nmeaningful delay in the Department of Energy's tritium production \nprogram.\n  Energy Secretary Richardson stated this fact in a letter dated \nSeptember 24, 1998, in which he said that the conference provision will \nhave a ``minimal impact'' on DOE's tritium program.\n  Just so all Senators will understand the compromise agreement we made \non the tritium issue, I want to take a few moments to explain it.\n  First and foremost, we require the Secretary of Energy to select his \npreferred technology on time, in December of this year. Second, the \nDepartment of Energy is prohibited from spending only about 5 percent \nof the overall tritium program budget in fiscal year 1999. The \nconference agreement does not, however, limit the DOE from spending \nfunds for design, research, or demonstration activities. These design, \nresearch, and demonstration activities account for approximately 95 \npercent of the program that DOE presented to Congress this year, which \nthe Congress authorized. Thus, virtually all of those activities which \nthe Department intended to conduct in fiscal year 1999 are authorized \nto be conducted by the conference agreement and the conferees expect \nthe Secretary to complete those activities in fiscal year 1999. This \nincludes much of the work to be conducted on the tritium extraction \nfacility, which would be constructed regardless of which technology \nwere selected by the Secretary. Third, and most importantly, we require \nthe Secretary of Energy to submit a comprehensive plan in January, \n1999--just 20 days after he makes his preferred technology selection--\non how tritium production will be restored. Such a plan does not exist \ncurrently, nor has one been proposed by the administration. This \ncomprehensive implementation plan goes to the very issue raised by the \nSenator from Arizona.\n  So I hope all Senators can readily see that we managed to achieve a \ncompromise on this very difficult issue, with virtually no adverse \nimpact on the tritium program, while avoiding a veto threat, and \nsatisfying most of the desires of most members.\n  This is a very strong bipartisan bill. Every member of the conference \ncommittee--both Democrats and Republicans--have indicated their strong \nsupport the conference agreement by signing the conference report, \nwhich as many of my colleagues know has not happened in many years. \nThis is a good conference report and it should be passed with unanimous \nsupport.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to address the importance of \nbringing up the defense authorization bill. I first commend my \ndistinguished friend, long-time friend, Senator Thurmond, and our \nranking member, the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, and all members \nof our committee, together with staff, for a very hard job throughout \nthe year to put together the bill and now the conference report which \nChairman Thurmond worked out with his counterparts on the House Armed \nServices Committee.\n  These are very difficult times in the history of our Nation. I look \nback over my lifetime when in World War II and the very closing days of \nthat war I served briefly in the U.S. Navy. There was absolute clarity \nin the minds of all who served in uniform, in the minds of every \ncitizen of the United States. We knew who the enemy was, what they \nstood for, what their capabilities were, and there was no doubt as to \nwhat this Nation should do to bring that conflict to an end, and, \nindeed, it was done.\n  Subsequently, in the Korean war, President Truman made a very bold \nand correct decision to draw the line in the face of communism. Again, \nit was understood, understood by all of us in uniform. I happened to \nhave served a second tour in the Marines in that conflict. All of us \nunderstood that as well as the people back home. Through his courage, \nhe did draw that line against communism.\n\n[[Page S11174]]\n\n  In subsequent conflicts, indeed in Vietnam, there was a measure of \nclarity. I wish to stress, that clarity does not exist today. Today, \nthe problems confronting the security of this Nation, as well as that \nof our allies and friends, lack clarity. It is very difficult, in many \ninstances, to determine who is the enemy, what are their capabilities, \nand, most important, Mr. President, what are their intentions to \ninflict harm on this great Nation or the nations of our allies or, \nindeed, the free peoples of the world.\n  That is why yesterday we had a historic meeting of the Armed Services \nCommittee. Before that committee appeared the chiefs of the several \nservices, the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and the Marine Corps, \ntogether with General Shelton, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. It was \na very important meeting.\n  Reports today in the press describe, and, indeed, we had strong \ndifferences of views, but the issues are so serious, they merited \nnothing less than strong expressions of opinion by Members of the \nSenate, and, indeed, the members of the Joint Chiefs, I think in a very \nsteadfast and credible manner, stated what their positions are today \nand for the future. There is no doubt in my mind that those fine \nindividuals, all of whom I know very well, have foremost in their \nhearts the interests of this Nation and the people, the men and women \nwho proudly wear the uniform of this country and the thousands of \ncivilians who dedicate their careers to work in the Department of \nDefense or other agencies directly related to our national security.\n  Yesterday was a landmark hearing. We, as a matter of practice, in the \nArmed Services Committee, whenever these men--hopefully someday women--\ncome before that committee seeking confirmation of the U.S. Senate to \nbecome a chief of staff, it is a long tradition of our committee that \nwe obtain from them their commitment, at any time the committee so \ndesires, to have them present to testify and to give their personal \nopinions regarding the state of the Armed Forces of the United States \nand the need for the President and for the future.\n  They did that yesterday in a very forthright and courageous manner. \nThey had consulted with the President, they had consulted with the \nSecretary of Defense, and they came before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee and laid down with specificity the respective needs of their \ndepartments. Those needs, in my judgment, should be addressed as \nquickly as possible by the Senate, then by the Congress, and those \ndollar needs authorized and appropriated so that we can restore the \nfull confidence of those who proudly wear the uniform today in their \nability to endure the hardships and the risks associated with military \nservice and to having nothing less than the best equipment to carry out \ntheir respective missions proudly as soldiers, sailors, airmen, and \nmarines.\n  I commend the chiefs for their testimony yesterday. I think our \ncolleagues, in the course of the hearing, elicited, by way of questions \nand other colloquy, important facts which make an irrefutable case to \nbring before this body in the very near future requests for immediate \nfunding to take care of certain needs and then, in the next fiscal \nyear, considerable sums of money, Mr. President, for each of the \nmilitary departments and, hopefully, lay down the foundation for the \noutyear budgets to be increased in amounts comparable to those in the \nyear 2000 budget so that, once again, America can avoid, in the words \nof the respective members of the chiefs, a hollow military force.\n  I remember so well that period when General Shy Meyer, then Chief of \nStaff of the U.S. Army, used the phrase ``a hollow army.'' It resonated \nnot only in the Department of Defense and in the Halls of the Congress \nand not only in the United States, it resonated all over the world, \nthat America, the superpower--at that time there was a second \nsuperpower, the Soviet Union--but the superpower acknowledges that its \narmy was hollow, that they lacked the quality and the quantity of \npersonnel, that they lacked the equipment to defend the security \ninterests of this country and to associate with our allies wherever it \nmight be in the world in the cause of freedom.\n\n  It was a real bugle call. And this Nation responded, largely through \nthe leadership of President Reagan, to build back America's military \nstrength. Well, we did not reach, in the judgment of the Chiefs--and I \nconcur in that judgment--we did not reach that bottom that would in any \nway reflect back on the hollow Army of the early 1970s, fortunately, \nbecause the Chiefs have come to the Congress and stated their case.\n  Now I am absolutely confident--and indeed I hope for the \nparticipation of the President and the Secretary of Defense--that the \nCongress will begin to do the necessary authorizations and the \nappropriations to pull, in the very words of the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, that aircraft which is nosed over in the dive, pull it \nout and to bring it back up to that level of readiness, that level of \nquality of life that the men and women of the Armed Forces deserve--\nthat level of a military that will leave in the minds of Americans and \npeople all over this world no doubt that the United States has behind \nit, the military power to support its foreign policy and to preserve \nthe cause of freedom here at home and wherever we are challenged \nthroughout the world.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I first commend the Senator from Virginia for \nhis eloquent remarks, highlighting the result of the very important \nhearing yesterday before the Senate Armed Services Committee and \ncalling all of us to the challenge of providing the adequate resources \nnecessary for our armed services to carry out their mission in the \ndefense of the security interests of the United States of America. It \nwas an eloquent statement, and I think it is something that all of us \nneed to take to heart.\n  Again, I want to thank Senator Warner for his efforts, largely I \nsuspect unappreciated, because they are behind the scenes to deal with \nall of the myriad of problems in putting together a defense conference \nreport and assisting the chairman of the committee, Senator Thurmond, \nand working with our House colleagues as well. The colloquy that we had \na moment ago was, in significant respect, to the result of his efforts. \nAnd I appreciate that.\n\n\n              juniper butte range withdrawal act colloquy\n\n       Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I would like to inquire of \n     the managers as to the intent of the conferees with respect \n     to the issuance of grazing permits for lands withdrawn and \n     reserved under Title XXIX of the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 in the event that the \n     Air Force relinquishes such withdrawn lands. As the managers \n     know, the Juniper Butte Range withdrawal under title XXIX, \n     would withdraw certain public lands for use by the Air Force \n     as a training area. The lands are withdrawn from the existing \n     Juniper draw allotment managed by the Bureau of Land \n     Management (BLM) in an area south of the Mountain Home Air \n     Force Base, Idaho. The withdrawal is from the center of the \n     allotment, leaving approximately 6,000 perimeter acres of the \n     allotment still under a grazing permit and the jurisdiction \n     of the BLM. It is my understanding that, at such time as the \n     Air Force relinquishes its use of the withdrawn lands and \n     returns jurisdiction to the Department of the Interior, the \n     holder of the grazing permit for the Juniper draw allotment \n     at that time should have an opportunity to obtain a grazing \n     permit for the relinquished lands in the center of the \n     allotment.\n       Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, would my colleague yield the \n     floor?\n       Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I would be pleased to yield to my friend.\n       Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I appreciate the leadership that \n     my friend and colleague, Senator Kempthorne, has shown on \n     this legislation. He has raised a very important point here \n     today. Anyone familiar with ranching in the West knows that \n     an economically viable ranch requires access to large blocks \n     of land to raise livestock in an environmentally sound way. \n     With the intermingling of federal, state, and private lands \n     in our state of Idaho, access to BLM land is essential for \n     ranchers. Any time 12,000 acres are withdrawn from an \n     existing BLM allotment, it will dramatically impact the \n     rancher who holds the permit for that allotment. Blocked up \n     land is more easily and economically managed. Scattered \n     parcels have the opposite effect. There may come a time, as \n     contemplated by the legislation, when the Air Force would \n     relinquish its control over these lands. While Air Force \n     relinquishment of the withdrawn lands may not occur for what \n     would be considered a long time by most people, members of \n     the ranching community measure such events by the passing\n\n[[Page S11175]]\n\n     of generations, and that end result can reasonably be \n     anticipated. And so, I seek clarification for the inquiry \n     initiated by my colleague from Idaho. The answer to his \n     question will be vitally important to whoever holds the \n     permit surrounding the withdrawn land at such time as the Air \n     Force would, in fact, relinquish it to the Department of the \n     Interior. I thank my colleague for yielding.\n       Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I would tell my able friends \n     and colleagues from Idaho that I concur with their assessment \n     of the intent of the conferees following relinquishment of \n     the Juniper Butte Range to the Department of the Interior. \n     The conferees are mindful of the impact this withdrawal will \n     have upon the surrounding BLM lands and the use of those \n     lands by current and future grazing permittees.\n       Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I thank the Chair and I thank the managers \n     of this important legislation for their response to our \n     inquiry. Mr. President, I wish to determine whether the \n     managers of the legislation agree with my understanding as to \n     one additional provision. Section 2917(b)(3) of the Juniper \n     Butte Range Withdrawal Act provides for delegated authority \n     and approvals granted by the Bureau of Land Management \n     pursuant to the decisions of the Secretary of the Interior, \n     or the Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management. \n     Section 2907(b)(1) specifically refers to the authority of \n     the Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Land and Minerals \n     Management to grant rights-of-way and approvals must be \n     granted by the Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Land \n     and Minerals Management. This is as it should be. Mr. \n     President, I ask the managers of this legislation if my \n     characterization is accurate?\n       Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the Senator from Idaho has \n     correctly interpreted the intent of the conferees as to the \n     authority of the Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Land \n     and Minerals Management. It is the intention of the conferees \n     that the Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Land and \n     Minerals Management shall grant rights-of-way and approvals \n     and take such actions as are necessary under Section \n     2907(b)(1).\n       Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have been listening to the \n     discussion of the Juniper Butte Range Withdrawal as it \n     pertains to grazing permits and the delegation of authority. \n     As to the relinquishment of withdrawn lands to the Department \n     of the Interior for grazing use, I fully agree with the \n     statements of the Senators from Idaho. I also agree with the \n     need to clarify the congressional intent regarding the \n     delegation of authority, as stated by my friend, the junior \n     Senator from Idaho.\n       Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, again, I wish to thank the \n     managers of the bill and the senior Senator from Virginia for \n     their cooperation in clarifying the congressional intent.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the fiscal year \n1999 Defense authorization conference report.\n  This bill emerges in the turmoil of a post-cold-war world--one \ndemanding a U.S. military that can face transnational developments such \nas weapons proliferation, regional tyrants such as Saddam Hussein, and \nemerging powers such as China.\n  As a result, the authorization cycle of the last few months allowed \nCongress to bring the Pentagon's budget into alignment with the \nchanging Armed Services on which the nation will rely to deter a broad \nand unpredictable spectrum of global threats to U.S. national security.\n  The conference report emphasizes a type of warfare that will loom \nlarge in future defense planning: littoral operations near coastal \nplains. Accordingly to the Navy's official definition, littoral \nengagements require forces to maneuver ``close enough to influence \nevents on shore if necessary.''\n  This post-Soviet mission connects our force structure to our security \ninterests since 80 percent of the world's population lives near the \nshorelines and waterways that open into the littorals.\n  The priorities established by the conference report demonstrate how \nlittoral concepts have started to displace more conventional ideas of \nweapons development.\n  Major research and modernization programs, for example, share the \ncommon goal of delivering increased firepower, speed, and precision at \na lower cost.\n  Ship and aircraft architectures have sacrificed the hard angles prone \nto enemy detection in favor of modular composite materials that leave \nsmaller signatures on a radar screen.\n  Smaller crews will maintain more advanced command an control systems \nconfigured for instant data transmission.\n  And self-guided missiles now assume the targeting role that \nconcentrated divisions of heavy armor had to bear in the past.\n  In addition to high technology hardware, Mr. President, efficient \ntraining programs remain critical to the evolution of the military. I \nam therefore pleased that the bill allows the Armed Services to manage \ntheir gender-integrated training policies as commanders and instructors \nhave designed them.\n  The new international security environment gives us new guidelines to \nmeasure the readiness of the Total Force. Active duty men and women \nmust subsequently continue to train as they will deploy to accomplish \nthe gender-neutral task of supporting our war fighters.\n  Common sense means that recruits destined to repair fighter-bombers, \nfrigates, submarines, and missile launch tubes should train the same \nway, under the same standards, and at the same time.\n  Common sense means that radar operators, quality assurance engineers, \nand military police should follow universal rules of engagement for \nmales and females who wear identical uniforms.\n  Yet we would suspend our common sense by pretending that the solution \nto workplace harassment means the segregation of enlistees into \nisolated training components.\n  We have to move beyond the charge that integrated training fosters \nsexual misconduct to ask how the men and women of the All-Volunteer \nForce can each play a decisive role in support of combat readiness.\n  It is for this core mission purpose, rather than the testing of \nsocial policy theories, that the armed services unite men and women to \nacquire the skills expected of all soldiers.\n  Gender-integrated training maximizes the return on the taxpayers' \ndefense investment in making all service members accountable for a \nrange of logistical, medical, and technical jobs that sharpen the \nability of the Defense Department to protect both our homeland and the \ncountry's core interests abroad.\n  Finally, Mr. President, both the House and Senate defense authorizing \ncommittees struggled this spring with the nation's incoherent \ncontingency operations policy. By the end of the coming fiscal year, \nthe taxpayers will have devoted $9.4 billion to the maintenance of our \nBosnia mission since the conclusion of the Dayton peace agreement in \nNovember 1995.\n  But the administration has requested this enormous sum of money in a \nvacuum of silence about our strategic purpose and an aura of deception \nabout the length of our commitment.\n  Officials perpetuate their failure of leadership with the assumption \nthat Congress supports the Bosnia deployments simply by funding them. \nThis assessment, however, only uncovers the cynicism of the \nadministration's foreign policy.\n  Neither the House nor the Senate, as the President knows, would \nintentionally place our overseas forces in a position of jeopardy by \ndepriving them of money for daily operations and self-protection.\n  At the same time, the Pentagon cannot continue to hold the safety of \nour troops hostage to unjustified budget requests for keeping between \n6,000 and 8,000 military personnel in a country struggling to restore \nits political institutions.\n  The confusion underpinning U.S. policies toward Bosnia led Senator \nCleland and I to draft an amendment requiring the submission of \nstatutory reports to Congress on the purpose and potential endpoint of \nmilitary contingency operations involving more than 500 people in \nuniform. The reports must accompany all budget requests made for such \noperations.\n  Our amendment, including in the Senate's version of the bill and \napproved by the authorization conferees, reflects the lessons that the \nBosnia experience teaches us about the interaction between the \nexecutive and legislative branches on the Defense Department's non-\nwartime deployments.\n  Congress must insist on a regular process under which we can match \nthe administration's own peacekeeping policy arguments with its ongoing \nbudget demands.\n  We need to determine more definitively if the Pentagon has a \ncontingency operations strategy that advances the security interests of \nthe United States rather than the false hope of relying on our military \npresence to solve the domestic political, economic, and cultural \nproblems of other nations.\n\n[[Page S11176]]\n\n  The Snowe-Cleland amendment, I believe, will equip Congress with the \ntools necessary to exercise aggressive oversight of the \nadministration's peacekeeping initiatives.\n  The fiscal year 1999 Defense authorization conference report, Mr. \nPresident, foreshadows both the challenges and the phenomenal \ncapabilities that the Armed Forces will manage in the new century. I, \ntherefore, urge the Senate to uphold its tradition of bipartisan \nsupport for the military by adopting this responsible legislation.\n\n\n        ALABAMA SPACE SCIENCE EXHIBIT COMMISSION LAND CONVEYANCE\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks concerning \na specific land conveyance provision in the DoD Authorization Bill \n(section 2837). I am pleased that the conferees were able to make these \ntechnical, but necessary changes to the conveyance terms of real \nproperty from the Army's Redstone Arsenal to the Alabama Space Science \nExhibit Commission.\n  Section 2837 of the Bill ensures that the future development of the \nU.S. Space & Rocket Center property previously conveyed by the Army to \nthe appropriate agency of the State of Alabama will remain consistent \nwith the long term master plan for the use of that property as agreed \nupon by the Center, Redstone Arsenal, and Marshall Space Flight Center, \nand that present financing arrangements and mortgages relating to new \nand existing facilities at the Space and Rocket Center are preserved, \nand appropriate coordination of further financing initiatives, \nmortgages and other debt society arrangements in accordance with the \nagreed-upon master plan is assured.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, permit me to quote from the Armed Services \nCommittee's report accompanying the Senate-passed version of the fiscal \nyear 1999 defense authorization bill:\n\n       The Committee views with concern the slow progress of the \n     C-130J program, the increased expense of developing the \n     aircraft . . . and notes the Department's failure to provide \n     a report on the remanufacture of existing C-130 airframes . . \n     . Development costs were initially estimated at $350 million \n     and introduction of the new model forecast to begin in mid-\n     1997 . . . However, it has been estimated that the program \n     has cost more than $900 million and is over two years behind \n     schedule.\n\n  To the objective observer, this language would indicate a certain \nfrustration or disenchantment with the developmental history of the C-\n130J airlifter. Indeed, cognizant as we are of the Air Force's enormous \nsurplus of C-130s and the fact that, of the 256 such planes funded by \nCongress since 1978, only five were actually requested by the Air \nForce, one could reasonably conclude that Congress would not be in a \nhurry to expend scarce financial resources for additional planes. Yet, \nthat is precisely what we continue to do, every year, to the tune of \nliterally billions of dollars.\n  Let me see if I can summarize the situation. We are concerned about \nenormous cost overruns associated with the C-130J's development and \nwith the degree to which that development has fallen behind schedule. \nThe Air Force has far more C-130s than it needs. So our response is to \nspend hundreds of millions of dollars per year to purchase more.\n  Over the last two weeks, the Senate Armed Services Committee, on \nwhich I serve, has devoted considerable time and energy to the issue of \nmilitary readiness. My office has only recently received the responses \nof the Armed Forces Chiefs of Staff to a number of questions I had \nsubmitted in an effort to ascertain to the extent possible the true \nstate of military preparedness. Indeed, I have for the past six years \nspent a great deal of time tracking preparedness trends in the military \nin order that we might prevent the resurgence of the kind of \npreparedness problems that plagued our armed forces during the 1970s. I \nwarned in the early 1990s that if we continued on our then-current \npath, the ability of our military to respond to crises and to prevail \nin the major regional contingencies for which they exist would \neventually reach crisis proportions. As the train advanced down the \ntrack, those of us who did advance such warnings were categorized as \nCold War anachronisms. As the train neared over the past two years, our \nnumbers increased somewhat, but the President and many in Congress \ncontinued to ignore the growing problem. And now the train has arrived.\n  The United States Armed Forces are the finest in the world. No one \nwould deny that basic fact. The quality of intellectual discourse on \nthe subjects of force posture and military preparedness, however, has \nbeen disappointingly shallow. How often, Mr. President, have we heard \ncritics of defense spending argue that the United States spends more on \ndefense than the sum of its potential adversaries combined? Do such \nindividuals honestly believe that the subject lends itself to such \nsimplistic equations? Has history taught them nothing?\n  The United States military, alone in the world, is tasked by this \ncountry's civilian leadership to be prepared to respond to crises \nanywhere in the world, on short notice, and with sufficient strength to \ndefeat aggression with a minimal loss of life. No other country bears \nthat burden.\n  We have serious problems afflicting our armed forces that six years \nof presidential rhetoric to the contrary could not deny, although the \nAdministration did its best to ignore it. So how do the committees with \noversight of U.S. defense policy react to the current confluence of \nbudgetary restrictions and historically high operational tempos? With \nthe aforementioned C-130s, with a $1.5 billion ship not requested by \nthe Department of Defense, with the continued acquisition of \nunrequested C-35 passenger jets, with the exasperatingly constant \ntendency to send hundreds of millions of dollars a year to National \nGuard units whether it is needed or not, and with the repeated \nacquisition of rockets and grenade launchers solely because contractors \nhave convinced, with little effort, their congressional representatives \nto continue the flow of money for unneeded weapon systems. I fully \nsupport and encourage the allocation of additional funding to address \nlegitimate readiness concerns, which we have in abundance. The \nprogrammatic and highly questionable operations and maintenance \nexpenditures that are included in the lists I am submitting, however, \ndo not qualify.\n  It has been said that a million dollars here, and a million dollars \nthere, and pretty soon we're talking real money. The list I am \nsubmitting pretty much fits that category. It is composed of hundreds \nof Member-adds. They range from half-a-million dollars to $94 million, \nnot including the ship and airlifters, which are in a category all \ntheir own. The total dollar amount of the list from the defense \nauthorization bill is $4.5 billion.\n  The continued practice in the defense appropriations bill of \nrestricting procurement of major weapon system components to United \nStates manufacturers at the expense of more cost-effective options--\nand, I should point out, at the expense of other U.S. companies that \nbenefit from the cooperative arrangements we maintain with allied \ncountries and are consequently threatened by these ``Buy America'' \nprovisions--represent a throwback to an earlier time when defense \nbudgets allowed for such congressionally-mandated inefficiencies. \nSimilarly, prohibitions and restrictions on the Department of Defense's \nability to manage itself in order to protect hometown contractors and \ncivil servants, such as are included in the appropriations bill are \nreaching ever-more multifarious levels that would make Rube Goldberg \nproud. I invite my colleagues to read Section 8071 of the bill for one \nsuch example.\n  I am also concerned about the precedent set by Section 8125 of the \nappropriations bill, which intervenes in the relationships between \nFederal agencies, prime and subcontractors. The ramifications of that \neffort to benefit specific subcontractors will redound to the Federal \ngovernment's misfortune in complicated contractual matters involving \nprimes that go out of business, leaving their subcontractors in the \nlurch. Obviously, we are all sympathetic to those subcontractors' \nplight, but intervening in bankruptcy proceedings like this provision \ndoes is not good government.\n  At a time when our declining force structure is stretched virtually \nto the breaking point; when our most skilled personnel are leaving the \nservice in droves for better paying, less stressful jobs in the private \nsector; when front-line aircraft are routinely cannibalized so that \nsquadrons may deploy and equipment and personnel are cross-decked to \nthe long-term detriment of\n\n[[Page S11177]]\n\nboth, it is disheartening in the extreme to still witness the scale of \nunnecessary and wasteful spending represented in these bills.\n  The airplane mechanic having to remove parts from one fighter in \norder to repair another can be excused for not understanding why $5 \nmillion is diverted from the defense budget to the public school system \nin the state of a senior member of the Armed Services Committee. He or \nshe can be excused for not comprehending the mind set that allocates \n$75,000 for establishment of a State Maritime Academy with no realistic \nmilitary application. Five million dollars for Agricultural Based \nBioremediation and $20 million for the National Defense Center for \nEnvironmental Excellence--the word ``defense'' being inserted in the \ntitle strictly for propagandistic purposes--and $3 million for research \ninto stainless steel double hull technology, on which private industry \nis supposed to be spending its own money per the requirements of the \nOil Pollution Prevention Act, are just the tip of a very large iceberg.\n  Try as I might, I cannot rationalize, with the scale of readiness \nproblems highlighted in yesterday's Armed Services Committee hearing, \nthe expenditure of $64 million for the National Guard Youth Challenge \nprogram. In fact, the budget authority earmarked for the Guard and \nReserve, once again solely for parochial reasons, continues to \nrepresent one of the greatest hemorrhages of defense dollars for low-\npriority programs in the defense budget. Ten million dollars, Mr. \nPresident, to convert a National Guard Armory into a Chicago Military \nAcademy in order to provide a Junior ROTC program is not consistent \nwith national security imperatives that should be driving the process. \nI have no idea--no idea--why we are earmarking a million dollars for \nLewis and Clark.\n  Earmarks for specific facilities are out of control. Whether it's the \nFrancis S. Grabeski Airport in New York, the earmark of $2,250,000 from \nthe Operations and Maintenance budget--yes, the very portion of the \nbudget most closely tied to readiness--for the White Sands Missile \nRange and Fort Bliss, Texas, or the earmarking of $4.6 million for the \nMontana National Guard Distance Learning Network, such practices \nillustrate all too well the unwillingness of Congress to translate its \nrhetoric on readiness problems into constructive action and to cast \naside once and for all the business-as-usual approach that is so \ndamaging to our national defense.\n  The appropriations bill adds $50 million for the B-2 bomber for \ncontinued upgrades. The continued expenditure of millions for upgrades \nfor that formidable fleet of 21 aircraft is particularly disturbing, as \nthe B-2's practical utility scarcely warrants the funding Congress \nlavishes upon it every year. If it could fly combat air patrols, I \nwould be inclined to be a little more sympathetic. Its' theoretical \napplication to real world contingencies, however, leaves me aghast at \nthe cost of that program.\n  Mr. President, my views on parochial-oriented spending remain very \nmuch in the minority. That is why we continue to see billions of \ndollars wasted by Congress to satisfy parochial interests. I will not, \nhowever, shy away from continuing to shine a spotlight on these \nwasteful practices.

Mr. President, I came over this evening to speak briefly \nabout H.R. 10 and where we are in our efforts to bring that important \nbill to the floor of the Senate. I want to explain to our colleagues \nthe concerns I have--those concerns are shared by Senator Shelby and by \nothers--and explain the compromise that we have proposed in the hopes \nthat those who are for this important bill will prevail upon those who \nare holding back on reaching a compromise on a key issue in the bill, \nand who by doing so are jeopardizing enactment of this important \nlegislation.\n  Let me try, as briefly as I can, to lay out where we are in terms of \nthe parliamentary situation, what the issue is that is contested in \nthis parliamentary maneuvering, why that issue is so important to me, \nand what we can do, in my opinion, to resolve it.\n  First of all, thanks to the great leadership of Senator D'Amato in \nthe Banking Committee, we have put together a comprehensive financial \nmodernization bill. While there are still parts, in my opinion, that \nneed to be changed, it is a good bill. There are many provisions of the \nbill that I support. I congratulate Senator D'Amato. I have to say that \ngetting this bill through the Banking Committee with as little time as \nis left in the legislative session and bringing together most of the \ndisparate interests that are ultimately represented, benefited or hurt, \nin a bill like this is one of the great legislative achievements that I \nhave seen. I congratulate Senator D'Amato for his effort.\n  Unfortunately, I cannot and do not support the bill in its current \nform. While there are many provisions of the bill that I do support, \nand while I would like to see the bill become law, and while if this \nproblem could be dealt with I could step aside and allow the bill to \ncome to the floor of the Senate, with this problem now pending, I am \nopposed to the bill.\n  Now, what is the problem? The problem has to do with a provision that \nsounds innocent enough. In fact, perhaps it sounds good to the ears of \nsome. That is the so-called provision for community reinvestment. These \nare provisions of law that were adopted without a whole lot of debate \nin the late 1970s. The objective of these provisions of law was to \nforce banks to lend money in the communities in which they were \noperating. The assertion was made that there were a lot of banks that \nwere simply taking deposits and using them in other areas of the \ncountry and that, therefore, there ought to be a provision of law to \nrequire banks to meet the lending needs of their local communities.\n  Now, the purpose of the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA, was to \nestablish a procedure for an evaluation of whether or not banks were \nmaking loans in the communities where they were chartered or whether \nbanks had simply become deposit takers and were taking those deposits \nand making loans somewhere else or buying government bonds or whatever \nother activities they might be involved in.\n  I personally don't think much of having the government require banks \nto use their capital in a particular way pleasing to the government or \nsome government functionary. It sort of strikes me as crony capitalism. \nIt is an unjustified intrusion into banking, in my opinion.\n  However, that is not what I have been objecting to in connection with \nthis bill, nor is this government-directed capital allocation the only \nproblem with CRA. The aspect of CRA in practice that I wish to bring to \nthe attention of my colleagues is that CRA has become a vehicle for \nfraud and extortion. In fact, as strong as it may sound, the Federal \nbanking regulators, through their delay of approval of applications, \nactually strengthen the hands of those who would use this law, the CRA \nlaw, in ways that it was never proposed to be used.\n  Let me give an example of how this works and how it is abused. Banks \nperiodically have to be evaluated for meeting the CRA requirements. \nThis is an evaluation done by the Federal banking regulators, at the \nconclusion of which they give a bank a rating. Whenever the bank wants \nto engage in some activity that requires approval of the Federal \nReserve Board, or of the Comptroller of the Currency--like opening a \nnew branch, merging with another bank--they have to make an \napplication. Any person or group of persons can file a protest to that \naction in the name of CRA. They can do it even though the bank may have \nan excellent rating in its last evaluation of its community \nreinvestment activities.\n  For example, when Senator Sarbanes, who is a strong proponent of this \nprovision of law, talked about the law, he pointed out that perhaps the \nbank that has done the ``best job'' of meeting community reinvestment \nrequirements was Bank of America, that they have gotten sterling \nratings for lending money in the communities they serve. But when Bank \nof America announced a merger with NationsBank, even though Bank of \nAmerica had the highest ratings of any bank in America in lending in \nthe communities that it served, professional protesters came in and \nopposed the merger and demanded concessions from the bank. In fact, one \nof the spokesman for the protesters, in making demands on the bank that \nhas the best CRA record of any bank in America said:\n\n       We will close down their branches and ensure they fail in \n     California. This is going to be a street fight and we are \n     prepared to engage in it.\n\n  So here is a bank, Bank of America, that has the best CRA rating of \nany bank in America, and yet when they apply to merge we have \nprofessional protesters come in and protest and threaten to delay their \nmerger and ultimately strike concessions from this bank.\n  Now, what kind of concessions are being granted? The purpose of CRA \nwas to have lending by banks in the communities they serve. But what \nCRA has turned into is a vehicle for extortion, whereby banks are \naccused of not meeting the CRA requirements, whether they have an \nexcellent CRA record or not, but the protest are withdrawn in exchange \nfor agreeing with protestors to meet a series of demands, and often \nthese agreements include cash payments, thinly disguised as donations. \nBanks are being required to make cash payments to the professional \nprotester groups. They have, in the past, under duress in my opinion, \nagreed to donate a percentage of their profits to the very institutions \nthat have filed protests against their actions with the Federal \nregulator. They have been forced, in my opinion, under duress, into \nagreeing to quotas and set-asides in hiring, in purchases, in \npromotions.\n  So what has happened all over America is that under a provision of \nlaw that was supposed to encourage banks to lend in the communities \nthat they serve, we now have banks being extorted and being forced to \nmake cash payments which are little more than bribes, being forced to \nset up quotas and set-asides, being forced to give concessions to \npeople who are selling goods and services, being forced to agree to \nhire and promote based on things other than merit. Needless to say, \nthere is a growing concern about this in America. That concern is \nreflected in the Senate where we rejected a proposal to extend this CRA \nrequirement to credit unions. We also had strong support to exempt \nsmall banks from the CRA requirement.\n  Now we have before the Senate a bill that would try to promote a more \ncompetitive financial structure in America, a goal I very much support \nand have advocated for years. So let me make it clear, I am for \nlegislation. But unfortunately, the bill has four different provisions \nthat dramatically expand CRA powers, and in essence, give\n\n[[Page S11179]]\n\nthe Federal Government, for the first time, the ability to impose \npenalties on banks, and even to impose penalties on nonbanking \nsubsidiaries and affiliates, as well as create new hoops and new \nhurdles that banks would have to jump through to get certification as \nfinancial services holding companies or to engage in certain activities \nin subsidiaries.\n  What this would do is literally set up the vehicle for billions of \ndollars to be extorted from financial institutions in America by people \nwho are professional protesters. You can hire groups to go to your \nhometown and stage a professional protest under the name of CRA, with \nthe objective of extorting banks and forcing them to contribute, \nforcing them to make cash payments, and forcing them to do things that \nare an embarrassment in an economy that has always been the freest, \nmost honest and most transparent economy in the world.\n  Now, when we set out to write this new major piece of legislation, \nparticularly since it came over to us from the House of Representatives \nvery late in the session, it appeared, for a time, that we reached an \nagreement that in this legislation we would leave the CRA battle alone, \nthat this bill would not be used as a vehicle either to expand or \nreform CRA. That is to say that people like Senator Shelby and myself \nwould not use the bill to try to repeal CRA or reform it, something we \nvery much favor; but we asked those on the other side not to use this \nbill to try to expand CRA. That effort apparently, broke down, and we \nhave in the bill now four major expansions of CRA. Senator Shelby and I \nhave said that we are going to oppose this bill as long as these \nprovisions are in the bill, as long as the bill is not neutral with \nregard to CRA.\n  Now, I want to make it clear that we are willing to work out an \nagreement. I want to go on record here today as to what we are willing \nto do. I see that my distinguished colleague, the senior Senator from \nAlabama, is here. Let me speak for both of us for a moment, and then I \nwill let him speak for himself. We are willing to do either one of two \nthings that could expedite the consideration of this bill. No. 1, we \nare willing to reach an agreement where the bill would be silent on \ncommunity reinvestment. We would not seek to repeal it, we would not \nseek to reform it or restrict it; we would leave this evil where it \nlies. But we would require that it not be expanded.\n  When I made this proposal in the Banking Committee, it reminded me of \nLincoln's position on slavery in the 1860 Presidential campaign. His \nposition was that, as much as he abhorred the institution of slavery, \nwhere this evil existed, we would leave it alone, but we would not \nallow it to be expanded.\n  Now, with regard to CRA, that is a proposal that we have made in the \npast. I wanted to go on record making that proposal today, as much as I \nam opposed to CRA and believe that it is powerfully abused. If someone \nis representing the interests of banks or security companies, or \ninsurance companies, and they are for this bill, all they have to do to \nget this bill before the Senate and in a position where it can become \nlaw is induce the people who want to expand CRA simply to agree with us \nto drop the CRA provisions from the bill. Proponents of CRA won't try \nto expand CRA, and we won't try to use this bill a vehicle to overturn \nthose provisions that already exist in law.\n  A second, alternative proposal that we have made in writing, both to \nthe minority members on the committee and to the chairman, is a \nproposal that says the following: the bill would expand CRA to include \nbeing considered at the formation of the new financial institutions \nthat will exist under this bill. In other words, just as with the \nformation of a bank holding company, CRA performance can be evaluated \nin connection with the creation of a financial services holding \ncompany. But if we are going to expand CRA in that manner, there are \ntwo reforms to CRA that we want, and I submit that neither of these \nreforms is unreasonable.\n  The first reform we want is an anti-extortion provision, which says \nthat CRA is about lending in the community you serve. Under this \nreform, we would have a strict prohibition against kickbacks, cash \npayments, quotas, and set-asides, in connection with purchases, hiring, \nand promotion.\n  The idea that professional protesters, as part of withdrawing their \nprotest and letting banks proceed with their business, would then be \nhired by the bank in an advisory capacity to advise them on various \nissues conjures up in my mind the ``protection'' racket of an earlier \nera, where the little merchant had the gangster come into his place of \nbusiness and say, ``You know, somebody could come in here and do you \nsome real harm, and I am willing to protect you.''\n  Now, some people have said--being critical of Senator Shelby and \nmyself--well, the banks aren't complaining. Well, the plain truth is \nthat many of the merchants who were being extorted by the gangsters \nwere afraid to complain. But it was wrong and we did something about \nit. You can call up the President of any bank in America, or any head \nof any Government regulatory agency and, if you have their confidence, \nask them off the record, ``Is CRA, as it now works, extortion?'' They \nare going to tell you, in all probability, that the answer is yes.\n  So what we want is a simple anti-extortion provision that says that \nCRA performance can be evaluated in connection with the formation of \nfinancial services holding companies under the bill, but these \ninstitutions can't pay under-the-table bribes or kickbacks, or they \ncan't, as part of the settlement, enter into agreements that have \nnothing to do with the purpose of CRA and have everything to do with \nextortion.\n  The second change we want is eminently reasonable, as well. It is \nthat if a bank is in compliance with CRA, if they have been examined \nfor CRA and they have been given a favorable CRA rating, then they \nshould be deemed to be in compliance with CRA on anything they want to \ndo that requires CRA compliance until their next examination. The idea \nthat a bank today can get an excellent CRA rating, and then they apply \nfor a merger and CRA protesters come in and shake them down again is \nunconscionable to me, and it is unreasonable. I can't, for the life of \nme, see how anybody could be against an anti-extortion provision, and I \ncan't see how anybody could be opposed to a provision that says if you \nhave a passing rating on CRA when you apply for a merger or an \nacquisition, you are deemed to be in compliance until you are reviewed \nagain and get another rating.\n  Senator Shelby and I have offered to do one of two things--either \ndrop all the CRA requirements and go on with this bill, or expand CRA \nas we have described, but together with a simple anti-extortion \nprovision and a simple provision that says if you are in compliance, \nyou are in compliance.\n  Now, in the absence of an agreement on these issues, Senator Shelby, \nI, and others intend to resist. We are simply a small number of \nMembers, and I understand that there are many powerful interests around \nAmerica who have interest in this bill. I say that Senator Shelby, I, \nand others have a principle in this bill. Our principle is that we are \nagainst extortion, and we are not going to be parties to expanding it. \nWe may not have the votes today to get rid of it. We may not have the \nvotes to purge this evil from the American financial system. But I \nthink under the rules of the Senate we do have the power--I hope we \ndo--to prevent it from being expanded.\n  I just want to say to those who have an interest in this bill, if you \nwant this bill passed, urge those who are on the other side of this \nissue to look at our reasonable proposal. The rules of the Senate were \nestablished to protect the rights of the minority. They were \nestablished so that if a few Members felt strongly about something and \nthey were willing to stand up for their principles and beliefs, it was \nhard to run over them.\n  It is like Washington said when Jefferson came back from France, \nwhere he had been Foreign Minister to France while the Constitution had \nbeen written. Jefferson asked Washington what the Senate was for. His \nargument was, if you have a House of Representatives and that is the \nvoice of the people, what do you need a Senate for? Washington, who, \nlike Jefferson, was a southerner, was accustomed, when he was drinking \ntea, to sometimes pouring it into the saucer and letting it cool for a \nmoment and then pouring it back into the cup and drinking it. So he \nsaid to Jefferson that the House--\n\n[[Page S11180]]\n\nwhich has passed this financial services bill, even if only by one \nvote--will be like this cup and it will catch the heat and the fire of \nthe moment; but the Senate will be the saucer in which we will allow \nthe passions of the moment to cool. That is what role Senator Shelby \nand I intend to fulfill as we exercise our rights. It may be that we \ncan be run over and this bill can be passed; maybe not. I believe that \nthose who want this bill would be well advised to urge Senator Sarbanes \nand Senator Moseley-Braun, who are so determined to expand CRA--I think \nit would be advisable to ask them whether that is worth killing this \nbill over. Can't you just take a time-out on CRA and leave it out of \nthe bill? Or, if you can't do that, why not agree to a compromise \nwhereby those who oppose CRA are willing to let you expand it, but you \nhave to give them an antifraud provision, and you have to give them \nreasonable enforcement, so that if you are complying with the law, you \nare considered to be complying with the law?\n\n  I hope people who are for this bill with their great economic \ninterest will call on those who are on the verge of killing it in the \nname of CRA to be reasonable and let us move ahead.\n  I say today that unless there be any confusion from this point on, as \none single Member of the Senate, I intend to do everything in my power \nto impede this bill unless these problems are resolved. I intend to do \neverything in my power to use all the rules of the Senate, no matter \nhow long it takes, no matter how difficult it may be. It may be that \nSenator Shelby and I, and others, can be run over, but it may be that \nthe rules of the Senate are sufficiently strong that with our \ndetermined resistance this bill will die unless some accommodation is \ngiven on this issue.\n  I urge those on the other side of this issue--I am not talking about \nthe other side of this body. I am talking about the people who have \ninvested millions, billions, trillions in banks, insurance companies, \nsecurities companies who know in their heart that we are right about \ncommunity reinvestment--I urge them to call on those who are trying to \nuse this bill as a vehicle to expand community reinvestment not to kill \nthis bill over this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SHELBY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I want to first associate myself entirely \nwith the remarks of the Senator from Texas. He was speaking very \narticulately for himself. But he was also speaking for me and a lot of \nother people, I believe, here in the Senate when he was talking about \nthe problems with H.R. 10. There are a lot of good things in H.R. 10. \nBut one of the most reprehensible things, I believe, Mr. President, is \nthe expansion of the Community Reinvestment Act. Senator Gramm has gone \nto great lengths to explain that tonight.\n  But before any of my colleagues would think about voting for the \nbill, if it comes up, H.R. 10, I think they ought to ask themselves and \nask their local bankers, small bankers, the small directors and the \nofficers if they in America support these measures that I think are \nreprehensible, such as increased administrative enforcement authority \nof the regulators to fine directors and officers of banks up to $1 \nmillion a day for CRA noncompliance. That is not the law today.\n  Two, that would make activities like insurance sales, or mutual fund \nsales, subject to CRA compliance on all depository institution \naffiliates on an ongoing basis. That is not the law today; and \nregulatory authority to shut down any affiliate within the holding \ncompany if just one subsidiary depository institution falls out of CRA \ncompliance.\n  Just think about this. These are sweeping, sweeping changes in the \nlaw as we know it today.\n  Senator Gramm talked at length about passing this banking reform \nbill--and I think it has a lot of reform in it--and keeping CRA \nneutral; not bother or try to repeal the CRA law as it exists today, \nalthough I personally would like to; leave it alone for another day, \nbut not to try to expand it, either.\n  Those are some of my concerns.\n  Senator Gramm and I have offered and we are hoping to negotiate with \nthe proponents of this legislation for a resolution to the problems \ndealing with CRA issues. I will go over them one more time.\n  Mr. President, it would apply to the formation of financial services \nholding companies the same CRA structure that applies to the formation \nof bank holding companies today. I don't see anything wrong with that. \nIt would be uniform, and it makes a lot of sense.\n  Second, Mr. President, any financial institution that has been found \nto be in compliance with CRA in its most recent exam shall be deemed to \nbe in compliance with CRA for all purposes and for any action until its \nnext regularly scheduled CRA exam.\n  And, thirdly--I think this is very important--to put forth some \nlanguage in there dealing with antifraud, antibribery provisions, and \nto say basically that it shall be illegal for any financial institution \nin connection with the CRA review evaluation or consideration to give \nanyone not employed by the bank any grant or subsidy in cash, or in \nkind, or to establish any quota, or set aside for employment, \nmanagement, sales, purchases, or other business activities other than \nactivities voluntarily undertaken by the financial institution to meet \nthe credit needs of the local communities in which the financial \ninstitution is chartered.\n  This makes a lot of sense to me. I think it makes sense that people \nwould focus in on this as we debate this bill.\n  But I just want to again say that we should go ahead if we could \nknock out and make CRA neutral in this; go ahead and work on the merits \nof H.R. 10, which are many, and try to do something.

A bill for the relief of D.W. Jacobson, Ronald Karkala, and \nPaul Bjorgen of Grand Rapids, Minnesota, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                       private relief legislation\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, today I am introducing a private \nbill addressing an inequity faced by a now dissolved Minnesota company, \nNorwood Manufacturing, Incorporated.\n  Norwood entered into contract with the United States Post Office to \nproduce mail pallets according to Postal Service specifications. After \nproducing the pallets, the Post Office canceled the contract, \nindicating the pallets did not meet the intended use, even though \nNorwood met the specifications requirement in the contract.\n  Genuine issues of material fact surround the question of whether the \nPost Office canceled the contract for cause, convenience, or possibly \nin bad faith. Surprisingly, Norwood was denied its plea to be heard in \ncourt. Summary judgment was awarded to the Post Office, and an appeal \nof this decision was denied.\n  At this point, all avenues of relief have been exhausted, including \nmy efforts in 1995 to request a Congressional Reference from the \nJudiciary Committee, back to the Claims Court for review.\n  In my view, an injustice has occurred since usual legal relief has \nbeen precluded in the history of this case. I believe compensation by \nthe United States is owed to Norwood. There is precedent for \nreimbursing companies which abide by contracts which either include \nerrors, or when specifications change after a contract is signed and \nthe company is not made aware of these changes. The Postal Service made \nan error, and it should have reimbursed this company, as is normal \npractice.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG:\n  S. 2533. A bill to amend the Federal Power Act to improve the \nhydroelectric licensing process by granting the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission statutory authority to better coordinate \nparticipation by other agencies and entities, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n        hydroelectric licensing process improvement act of 1998\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill, and I send it \nto the desk.\n  Mr. President, the bill I introduce is the Hydroelectric Licensing \nProcess Improvement Act of 1998. As its title suggests, the purpose of \nthe bill is to improve the process by which hydroelectric projects are \nlicensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Under the \nexisting law, non-federal dams that are constructed across navigable \nstreams in the United States must be licensed by the FERC. In addition, \nunder the present law, certain federal agencies, such as the United \nStates Forest Service and the Departments of Commerce and Interior, \nhave authority to mandate that FERC accept certain conditions in the \nlicense FERC ultimately issues. The Departments, for example, can \nimpose conditions that address fish passage. The federal land agencies \ncan impose conditions to protect federal land impacted by the project. \nFERC licenses, then, often contain conditions imposed by federal \nresource agencies.\n  These agencies, however, through no fault of their own, are single \nissue agencies. The law limits their considerations to a narrow \nspectrum of concerns as they decide mandatory conditions. Experience \nshows by the use of this licensing process that these decisions that \nare made by these agencies are very narrow. You could say narrow \nminded. Why? Because they are single-issue agencies. And the law now \ndictates that they operate only in that realm in their decisionmaking. \nWe do not have to settle for bad decisionmaking simply because \noftentimes the information that the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission gets, or the information they are dictated to by these \nsingle-purpose agencies, would result in bad decisionmaking. By \nadjusting this law, we can, I believe, have a better decisionmaking \nprocess. I will say that this is clearly the intent of the legislation \nthat I am introducing today.\n  Now, Mr. President, these licenses for the dams can be for as little \nas 30 years\n\n[[Page S11183]]\n\nand as much as 50 years. Decades ago, developers, both private ones \nsuch as investor owned utilities, and public ones such as municipal \nelectric utilities or public utility districts, built hydroelectric \nprojects and received original licenses for them from the FERC. Soon, \nmany of those licenses will expire and the public and private license \nholders will seek new licenses from the FERC. Indeed, Mr. President, \naccording to recent testimony of the National Hydropower Association \nbefore the House Energy and Power Subcommittee, over the next fifteen \nyears, the FERC will consider for relicense, about two-thirds of \nexisting non-federal hydroelectric projects. Nearly 300 projects, \nrepresenting about 28,917 megawatts of power, will have their present, \noriginal licenses expire before the year 2012.\n  Mr. President, many of those projects will involve the federal \nresource agencies. The FERC will consider major projects in western \nstates like California, and eastern states like New York. It will \nconsider significant projects in northern states like Michigan and \nsouthern states like Alabama. We all are, and we all will be affected \nby the process by which the FERC relicenses these dams. Mr. President, \nthis bill is extremely important in light of the foregoing.\n  Hydroelectric power is essential to the welfare of our country. It is \nclean, renewable and cheap. And, most importantly, it is very \ninexpensive compared with the other forms of energy. We need to take \nany steps necessary to ensure that this invaluable source of power \nremains available to the many consumers that depend upon it for their \nquality of life. Such steps include the process reforms contained in \nthis bill.\n  Such reform is necessary because the unfortunate point is, in the \nlast decade the licensing process was created that we now have. What \ndid it do? The process didn't help the energy peaking capability of \nmany of these projects.\n  According to a September 1997 study of the U.S. Department of Energy, \nsince 1987, of 52 peaking projects relicensing by FERC, 4 projects \nincreased capability, and 48 decreased capacity. In other words, they \nwere less productive as a result of the licensing than they were prior \nto that relicensing. Ninety-two percent of the peaking projects since \n1987 lost capacity. Hydropower is at risk, and it is important that our \ncountry understand that.\n  This is not only unfortunate, but it is bizarre. It is bizarre, Mr. \nPresident, because we live in a time when we are rightly sensitive to \nthe environment in which we live. It is difficult to find a source of \nelectric power more benign to the atmosphere than falling water. Yet, \nthis benign power source is at risk. The process reforms I propose will \nhelp reverse this trend.\n  It is critical, Mr. President, that I note what the bill does not do. \nThe bill does not--repeat, does not--eliminate the authority of federal \nresource agencies to mandate fish passages as conditions of a FERC \nlicense. Also, it does not--repeat, does not--eliminate the authority \nof federal land agencies to mandate FERC license conditions to protect \nfederal lands impact by the hydroelectric project. That is what the \nbill will not do. It is important to understand that, because there are \nmany groups that would think I would restrict the ability of some of \nthese single-purpose agencies to participate in the relicensing \nprocess. Quite the opposite: I want to spread their authority in a way \nthat makes it more responsible.\n  This is what the bill will do. The bill will reform the licensing \nprocess and improve the decisionmaking in that process in several ways.\n  1. It requires the federal resource agencies to consider a wider \nrange of factors than they presently consider, as they decide what \nmandatory conditions to impose in a FERC license. It would require the \nagencies to examine factors such as: (a) economics; (b) air quality; \n(c) irrigation; (d) navigation; (e) flood control; (f) recreation; (g) \ngeneration capacity; and (h) drinking water supply. The present law \ndoes not obligate federal resource agencies to consider such factors. \nBut, better decisions will result if they do.\n  2. The bill requires those agencies to document their consideration \nof these factors. Agencies make better decisions in the light and not \nin the dark, Mr. President.\n  3. The bill allows the license applicant to obtain expedited \nadministrative review of the conditions proposed by the federal \nresource agencies for reasonableness. Some check, no matter how \nminuscule, on the agencies' decisions to impose mandatory conditions is \nneeded.\n  4. It requires the federal resource agencies to base their conditions \non appropriate scientific review, which means a review based on \nempirical or field tested data, and subject to peer review. Good data \nhelps lead to good decisions.\n  Mr. President, who can quarrel with federal resource agencies basing \ntheir decisions on sound science? Who can quarrel with federal resource \nagencies broadening the factors they consider as they decide mandatory \nconditions? Who can quarrel with giving the license applicant, who must \nbear the burden of mandatory conditions a right to appeal \nadministratively, on an expedited basis, proposed mandatory conditions \nof the federal resource agencies? Mr. President, these reforms will \nmake for better decisionmaking by the federal resource agencies.\n  The bill has another significant facet, Mr. President. It gives the \nFERC authority, after a license application is filed, and after, \ntherefore, the federal resource agencies have documented their expanded \nand scientific review of conditions for the license, to require that \nthe federal resource agencies submit those conditions to the FERC by a \ncertain deadline. Simple, but it makes sense, because today those \nagencies don't have to comply with a deadline, but yet they have almost \nveto power by their absence from the process if they simply say they \nare considering a mandatory condition and are not yet willing to submit \nit to FERC for its inclusion in a license.\n  In this way, FERC will have before it at one time these various \nconditions of resource agencies, and, therefore, FERC should be able to \nefficiently and expeditiously bring about a license. This gives the \nlicensee the opportunity of a quickee appeal. This is what the \nlegislation does. It does not take away the authority of the agencies, \nit expands it. But it shapes it. It brings about a process that is \ndefinable and predictable. And that is exactly what does not occur \ntoday. Licensing today can take 8, 15, or 20 years when it ought take \nno more than 3 or 4 or 5 years. It is not reasonable or right that it \nshould take that long.\n  Simply what we are doing is reshaping what was a very important piece \nof legislation now that we have some field experience with it. We \ncannot afford to lose clean, renewable, abundant resources like \nhydroelectricity.\n  In my State of Idaho, we are proud of our hydro base. It brings about \ninexpensive energy to my State, and to the State of the Presiding \nOfficer. The whole Pacific Northwest is proud that it based its future \non the past insight of developing its hydroelectricity. We shouldn't be \nrequired to lose it because of misguided law.\n  That is what I hope my legislation will do, if it becomes law. In the \nensuing year, and in the new Congress, we will hold hearing across the \nWest, and certainly here in Washington, on the validity of this \napproach, to shape the process that is currently underway into a time-\npredicatble process that all can understand and that all can deal with.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, I applaud my colleagues on both \nsides of\n\n[[Page S11186]]\n\nthe aisle in forging a conference agreement which will provide funding \nfor important energy and defense related programs in this year's Energy \nand Water Appropriations bill. As we will not likely complete all of \nthe individual 13 appropriations bills, I compliment the managers for \ncompleting their respective conference bills and reports.\n  I did not object to the conference report's passage yesterday by \nunanimous consent. However, I do take exception to the continuing \npractice of overloading an important spending bill such as this one \nwith wasteful and unnecessary spending for unrequested, unauthorized or \nmember-interest projects. I examined the Senate bill and report during \nour consideration earlier this year and counted more than $920 million \nin earmarks. I am disappointed that the conferees chose not to cut back \non this wasteful spending, but rather took the opportunity to indulge \nand attach even more erroneous earmarks for projects which were not \nconsidered by either legislative body.\n  Mr. President, I will not dwell on the details, for I have compiled \nan extensive list of objectionable provisions which clearly reflects an \noutrageous spending binge by our federal government. This conference \nreport is shamefully overridden with $1.6 billion of pork-barrel \nspending. Many members will come out of this process as winners with \nspending for their own special interest projects. Unfortunately, the \nlosers are the American taxpayers who will have to shoulder this fiscal \nburden.\n  The complete list of objectionable provisions is available through my \noffice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/30/senate-section/article/S11185-6", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO FLO BRUMER ON HER 90TH BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on November 21, 1998, Mrs. \nFlorence Brumer of Utica, New York, will celebrate her 90th birthday. \nShe is fortunate to reach this milestone not only in good health and \nhigh spirits, but in the company of her husband of 64 years, Lou, and \ntheir two children and four grandchildren, all of their spouses, and \none great-grandchild.\n  A lifelong educator, Mrs. Brumer has touched many lives and been an \ninspiration to those around her. She received a bachelor's degree in \neducation from New York University and a master's degree from the \nTeacher's College at Columbia University. She went on to spend over \nforty years as a teacher and curriculum supervisor in the New York City \nschool system. When she retired in 1966, she moved upstate to Utica and \nbecame the city's most ardent promoter. An article in the local \nnewspaper several years ago highlighted the Brumers' rave reviews of \nUtica's social and cultural life, which coming from Manhattan natives \nwere particularly strong endorsements.\n  One of the most remarkable aspects of Flo Brumer's life is her vigor \nand enthusiasm for a wide variety of activities. A cancer survivor, she \nwas a pioneer in the crusade against smoking back in the days when \nthere was no such thing as a ``smoke-free environment.'' Well into \nretirement, she donned sneakers and began the sport later known as \n``mall-walking.'' She has a great passion for political discussions, \ninstilled in her, perhaps, at the table of her uncle, William I. \nSirovich, who served as a member of the U.S. Congress (D-NY) from 1927-\n39. And as a bridge fanatic, she continues to play and win regularly \nwhile trying to recruit new partners.\n  Reaching one's 90th birthday is a notable occasion in and of itself, \nbut to do so with such vitality and cheer is a truly great \naccomplishment. I offer her my heartiest congratulations and best \nwishes and close with a particularly apt Irish blessing:\n\n     May joy and peace surround you\n     Contentment latch your door,\n     And happiness be with you now,\n     And bless you evermore.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/30/senate-section/article/S11186-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO THE GATESWORTH ON ITS TEN-YEAR ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. BOND.

I seek \nclarification from the Chairman on two matters related to flood control \nmeasures along the Cowlitz River in Washington state necessary to \nmitigate impacts from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. That \neruption reduced the Cowlitz River channel capacity to one tenth of its \npre-eruption level. In 1985, Congress enacted Public Law 99-88 which \nauthorized and directed the Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps) to \nconstruct, operate, and maintain a sediment retention structure with \nsuch design features and associated downstream actions as are \nnecessary.

Mr. President, if I may join my colleague from Washington \nstate, this Decision Document became the basis for the local cost-\nsharing agreement signed by federal, state, and local officials in \nApril, 1986. This agreement was recognized by Congress in the Water \nResources Development Act of 1986. It has come to attention of Senator \nMurray and I that the Corps is uncertain whether the levels of \nprotection in the Decision Document are discretionary or required.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, it is our understanding that both \nCongressional intent and the recollections of those most intimately \ninvolved in crafting the cost-share agreement support the \ninterpretation that these levels of protection are required. Does the \ndistinguished Chairman concur?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senators from Washington are \ncorrect. I am informed that the Mount St. Helens Decision Document does \nindeed set for the levels of protection for communities along the \nCowlitz River. The Decision Document was the basis for the cost-sharing \nagreement with state and local entities and commits the Corps to \nmaintain these specified levels of protection.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Chairman. In addition, heavy rains and \nflooding during February 1996 brought to light some serious problems \nand omissions in the Mount St. Helens recovery effort that require \nimmediate attention.\n  Mr. GORTON. My colleague from Washington is correct. In several cases \nwork by the Corps or its contractors appears to have created new \nproblems. In the case of the Coweeman River, over one mile of volcanic \nsediment that backed up in this tributary. Initially ignored, this \nsediment now poses a serious threat to the community of Kelso.

Mr. President, the Senate Armed Services Committee \nheld a hearing yesterday that resulted in a bipartisan call to address \nthe readiness crisis in our armed forces. Senators charged the Joint \nChiefs with warming over the critical defense shortfalls in a previous \nhearing last February in order to defend the President's Budget.\n  Many of us in Congress have been expressing to the Administration for \nyears our concerns regarding the deep cuts in personnel, equipment, and \ntraining. Senator McCain offered these warnings in a report he \ncommissioned entitled ``Going Hollow'' as far back as 1993. I have \nwritten repeatedly on the subject of military readiness. In fact, last \nMay I wrote that ``the hollow state of readiness so many have warned \nabout has arrived.''\n  I am pleased the President and the Joint Chiefs have finally decided \nto abandon the shell game and address the serious weaknesses in our \ndefense force structure. At this stage, placing blame is far less \nimportant than solving the problem. The more candid responses from the \nJoint Chiefs in yesertday's hearing are the first step in that process. \nMr. President, I ask that two columns I have written on the subject of \nmilitary readiness be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                  Unacceptable Risk to American Lives\n\n                      (By U.S. Senator Bill Frist)\n\n       ``Unacceptable risk,'' is the blunt assessment by Army \n     four-star General David A. Bramlett describing his troops' \n     ability to accomplish its mission.\n       In a disturbing memo to the Army's Chief-of-Staff, General \n     Bramlett methodically describes the nearly insurmountable \n     challenges facing Forces Command, for which he is \n     responsible. ``Funding has fallen below a survival level in \n     FY99. The commanders are concerned that they can not meet the \n     daily challenges of the three imperatives of readiness: \n     training, quality of life and infrastructure.''\n       General Bramlett's warning is only the latest evidence the \n     Clinton Administration has failed to lead and maintain a \n     ready fighting force. Consider a few other shocking examples \n     of the damage caused by the Administration's extreme defense \n     cuts:\n       In Cecil Naval Air Station, Florida, a commander reports \n     having 43 aircraft assigned to him but only 20 operational. \n     One new aircraft had its landing gear damaged in a botched \n     landing. Three years later, that F/A18, after only 10 hours \n     use, still sits idle because of the lack of spare parts.\n       Admiral Clemins, the Commander of the Pacific Fleet, \n     reports that the Navy is 18,000 sailors short and is forced \n     to send warships out of port inadequately manned.\n       Then Major General Marvin Esmond testified that his \n     command, the Air Warfare Center at Nellis Air Force Base in \n     Nevada, has experienced a six-month delay in skill \n     improvement for airmen due to delays in specialized training. \n     This shortage of properly trained personnel has forced other \n     airmen to routinely work 70-hour weeks of 12-hour shifts.\n       Our forces are some 45 percent smaller than in 1989. We \n     have traditionally maintained the ability to execute at least \n     two major regional conflicts, each approximately the size of \n     the Gulf War. Today, most analysts agree we would have \n     difficulty executing even one Gulf War-sized conflict.\n       This weakness may well explain the Clinton Administration's \n     recent efforts to avoid confrontation with Iraq over weapons \n     inspections.\n       Our lack of vigilance has serious consequences for our \n     troops, our nation and even for our enemies. Only eight years \n     ago our nation went to war in the Persian Gulf with the most \n     ready force we have ever enjoyed. In short order we won a \n     clear and decisive victory against one of the largest \n     standing armies in the world.\n       For an armed conflict of this magnitude, there was an \n     amazingly small loss of life for allied troops--and even for \n     the Iraqis. Most surrendered rather than face our \n     overwhelming forces and certain defeat. Today, America's \n     military continues to do their duty and more, but politicians \n     have a duty as well. We must meet our responsibility to equip \n     and train our military so that they can not only survive, but \n     win on the battlefield.\n       The Clinton Administration's platitudes about ``leaner and \n     meaner'' betray this responsibility. The typical Marine, for \n     example, is no less courageous today than he was in 1989. But \n     he is less well trained, and there are far fewer Marines to \n     back him up and ensure he can accomplish his mission.\n       As the President prepares a defense budget for the \n     millennium, it's time to stop the erosion of our defenses. \n     Our enemies of today are less predictable and more likely to \n     attempt to attack at the first sign of any weakness.\n       Tennesseans are justly famous as volunteers in the defense \n     of our nation. For their sake, and for the sake of all \n     American volunteers in military service, Washington must do \n     its duty to ensure our fighting men and women are better \n     trained and better equipped than they are today. The price of \n     an ill-prepared force is measured in blood, not in dollars.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                          Our Hollow Military\n\n                      (By U.S. Senator Bill Frist)\n\n       Nearly six years of neglect and foreign-policy overreach \n     have taken their toll in the Department of Defense. Make no \n     mistake: The hollow state of readiness so many have warned \n     about has already arrived. The Commander-in-Chief has allowed \n     America's military preparedness to sink to the disgraceful \n     levels of the Carter era. This administration is more \n     concerned about the social engineering of the military's \n     culture than the training, modernization, and maintenance \n     that will keep our troops alive on the battlefield.\n       Inattention to readiness issues is reaching crisis \n     proportions. A visiting pilot at Luke Air Force Base recently \n     counted nearly forty F-16 fighters parked near the runway \n     without engines. These aircraft were literally ``hollow.'' In \n     a recent interview, even secretary of Defense Bill Cohen \n     acknowledged that ``it does trouble us.'' Yet, this \n     administration has plunged ahead with more overseas military \n     commitments, not fewer, stretching our defenses ever thinner.\n       From 1993 to the present, the Clinton Pentagon has spent an \n     average of $2 billion every year on ``Operations Other Than \n     War'' like those in Bosnia, Haiti and Somalia. Indeed \n     Congress just passed ``emergency'' funding to cover more than \n     $1.8 billion for the Iraq mobilization and continued Bosnia \n     ``peacekeeping'' operations this year. Yet, our armed forces \n     have been in Bosnia almost three years. Without this \n     injection of money, the ongoing expense of these operations \n     would endanger our ability to respond to a national crisis.\n       Today our forces are more than 40 percent smaller than at \n     the end of the Cold War, yet deployments have increased by \n     300 to 400 percent. The Pentagon counties to play a shell \n     game with defense dollars earmarked for the modernization and \n     training that will keep troops alive in future conflicts. \n     Meanwhile, the administration's feel-good foreign policies \n     attempt to turn our servicemen and women into global \n     caretakers.\n       The most important measure of military efficiency is the \n     number of American lives lost to attain a military objective. \n     This dangerous foreign policy reduces America's ability to \n     defend her interests and endangers the most valuable piece of \n     our foreign policy--our men and women in uniform. As a \n     nation, we cannot afford to continue paying lip service to \n     abstractions like ``readiness' and ``modernization'' without \n     backing them up.\n       Recent incidents show how closely peacetime training is \n     linked to life and death in times of war. Last October, \n     Defense News reported that a Russian submarine shadowed the \n     nuclear submarine USS Coronado for several days without being \n     detected. A year earlier, a Chilean submarine moved \n     undetected for several days within the perimeter of a U.S. \n     battle group during a training exercise. In both cases, the \n     foreign submarines could have fired upon our ships at any \n     time. Fortunately for those American crews, we aren't at war. \n     But as one senior Navy official observed, ``it is only in \n     training that a diminished capability is evident.''\n       More recently, I toured our operations in Bosnia. While \n     deployments to hot spots like Bosnia have clearly been made \n     with noble intentions, too often they have been undertaken \n     with questionable rationales and undefined mission goals. \n     Unrealistic deadlines have been substituted for exit \n     strategies. In Bosnia, for instance, our entanglement is now \n     well into its third year. This would not be so troubling \n     except for the administration's original promises that all \n     mission objectives were achievable in one year. When \n     Secretary Cohen pushes for further cuts in military \n     installations as a cost saving measure, it's worth reminding \n     him that the Bosnia operation alone is a moneypit that has \n     cost the American taxpayer close to $7 billion.\n       Shifting goals are questionable to begin with. But to pay \n     for them with dollars intended to maintain the nation's \n     military readiness is simply inexcusable. These ``Operations \n     Other Than War'' distract the military from its primary \n     mission: to fight and win wars where real American interests \n     are at stake. The more our forces stray from that mission, \n     the less they'll be able to accomplish it, especially with \n     minimal loss of life.\n       As we're asking a small military to do more with less, \n     Washington must be disciplined in our use of shrinking \n     defense resources. In this era of balanced budgets and \n     relative peace, we neglect national defense at our own \n     peril--and the peril of those Americans who put their lives \n     on the line to protect the national interest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/30/senate-section/article/S11187-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11187-S11188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ENERGY SAVING PERFORMANCE CONTRACTS\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to encourage my \ncolleagues to continue our efforts toward promoting energy efficiency \nand renewable energy technology. The Administration has placed a high \npriority on energy efficiency for the coming year and we must follow \ntheir lead. The problems of air and water pollution as well as the \ndangers of climate change only reinforce the need for an increased \neffort.\n\n[[Page S11188]]\n\n Improved energy efficiency can buy us the time needed to develop an \nimproved national energy policy based on renewable energy which will be \nthe foundation of the 21st century.\n  Human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels has \nincreased atmospheric CO2, methane and nitrous oxide, all of \nwhich contribute to global warming. In fact, U.S. fossil energy \ncurrently produces about one-fourth of the world's CO2 \nemissions. The U.S. accounts for 25% of world oil use, two-thirds of \nwhich is consumed by the transportation sector. Economically, U.S. oil \nimports accounts for 50% of national oil use, which amounts to $60 \nbillion, or 36% of our trade deficit. Mr. President not only is this \ndangerous for our environment, but it also poses a great threat to our \neconomic security.\n  From FY1948-FY1997 total energy R & D spending reached $108 billion. \nOf this figure $66 billion or 61% has been spent on nuclear technology, \n$26 billion or 24% for fossil fuels, while only $11 billion or 10% has \nbeen spent on renewables and $7 billion or 7% for energy efficiency. In \ncontrast, the DOE's 1995 Energy Conservation Trends report found that \nenergy conservation activities from 1973 to 1991 curbed energy use by \nabout 27%. In 1992 this savings equaled $283 billion or about half of \nthe nation's $538 billion annual energy spending. These figures show \nthe benefits energy efficiency can bring to the U.S. if managed \nproperly. We must work to reverse this discrepancy and increase funding \nfor renewable energy and energy efficiency programs.\n  One program which I believe shows great promise for the future is \nFederal use of Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPC's). \nAdministered under DOE's Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP), \nESPC's are a technique which reduces energy costs and consumption by \nthe Federal government without increasing budgetary outlays. ESPC's are \nawarded to private firms who then install and maintain energy \nefficiency improvements in Federal facilities while guaranteeing \nsavings.\n  However, the FEMP program has repeatedly gone under funded. It is for \nthis reason I introduced the Federal Energy Bank Act of 1997 (S. 1375) \nwhich sought an alternative means of providing the critical needed \nfunding for Federal energy management. I'd like to take this time now \nto thank my colleagues, Senators Feingold, Bumpers, Johnson, Bingaman, \nJeffords and Campbell in supporting my bill and efforts.\n  Mr. President, President Clinton has recently directed all Federal \nagencies to maximize their use of ESPC's before the authority to use \nESPC's expires in the year 2000. I call on all my colleagues to support \na reauthorization and expansion of the ESPC authority before this \nvaluable program expires. We should continue to work with DOE and the \nAdministration to see this important partnership between the private \nand public sectors is extended well into the future.\n  Mr. President, if anyone is skeptical as to the benefits of the \nprogram I'd like to give two examples of successful ESPC's involving a \nWisconsin company, Johnson Controls. Under one of the largest ESPC's in \nthe country Johnson Controls has agreed to replace the outdated 50-\nyear-old steam system at DOE's Hanford complex in Washington. The \nHanford complex, which includes research labs, fuel fabrication \nfacilities, industrial sites as well as numerous administrative \nbuildings are undergoing a transition from a nuclear weapons production \nsite to an energy research and development facility. This 25-year \ncontract will save the taxpayers a guaranteed $108 million while \nreducing harmful emissions.\n  Johnson also has recently signed onto another ESPC with the U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation to make improvements to the Volpe National \nTransportation Center in Massachusetts. Johnson will make and maintain \nimprovements to lighting, heating, ventilation, air conditioning as \nwell as other energy management systems. This 10-year contract will \nreduce energy expenses by $200,000 each year for the life of the \ncontract, and limit carbon dioxide emissions.\n  Mr. President, this is an important partnership which benefits many \nparts of society. It's good for the government, the private sector as \nwell as the environment and should be continued. Again, I'd like to \nthank my colleagues for their past support. I encourage them to support \nreauthorizing this program for the future and support additional \nfunding for energy efficient and renewable energy technology. Thank you \nMr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/30/senate-section/article/S11187-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            BOY SCOUT HEROES\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to share with the Senate a \nstory about some fine young Idahoans who saved a family stranded in the \nwilderness.\n  While hiking in the Idaho wilderness, Boy Scouts from Troops 44 and \n74 saved a family of seven who had become lost, were severely \ndehydrated, and disoriented. With the skills that they developed \nthrough their Boy Scout training, they successfully guided the family \nto a point where they were met by rescue workers. In order to reach the \nfamily, the Scouts were forced to descend treacherous canyon walls, \nshale slides, boulder falls, and cliff areas. During the climb out of \nthe canyon, the Scouts used ropes to physically support the exhausted \nfamily members.\n  The performance of these fine young men goes far beyond commendable. \nTheir flawless performance saved the lives of this family. In a day and \nage when we are bombarded by reports of how troubled and misguided \ntoday's youth are, it is truly refreshing to hear the story of these \nyoung men who have done something so outstanding. One can't help but \nrespect their unselfish display of courage and resourcefulness. Perhaps \ntheir act, and the acts of other outstanding youths like them across \nthe nation, will help us to restore our faith in them and in their \nfuture. It is my personal hope that by recognizing young men such as \nthese, we can begin to refocus the lens through which we view society, \nin order to see, more clearly, the typical American youth--not as a \ndelinquent or a burden, but a contributing member of society deserving \nour respect and our praise.\n  It is my pleasure to recognize Kody Haney, Brian Wanstrom, Alan \nWanstrom, Kyle Hestag, Eric Williams, Dustin Moss, Brandon Moss, Alex \nDavies, Darian King, Cayd Brunson, Dustin Hymas, Chris Mendenhal, and \nleaders Darrell Wheeler, Jeremiah Burnett, and Marie Burnett. On behalf \nof the State of Idaho and the United States Senate, allow me to thank \nyou--for your courage, unselfishness, determination, and most important \nfor being shining representatives of American youth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/30/senate-section/article/S11188-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        DODGE DEVELOPMENT CENTER\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on April 2, 1998, in a statement I \nmade on the Senate floor, I attributed the creation of the Dodge \nDevelopment Center and Veterans Assistance Office in Rutland, Vermont \nto Chapter One of the Vietnam Veterans Association, also located in \nRutland. I need to clarify for the record that, although some of the \nearly members of VVA Chapter One were part of the very early stages of \nthe idea, VVA, Chapter One was not responsible for the development, \nfounding, or creation of the center.\n  Years of hard work went into organizing community involvement, \nvolunteer labor and donations, fundraising, remodeling, and furnishing \nthat has resulted in the establishment of the only homeless shelter \njust for veterans in Vermont--the Dodge Development Center. I want to \ncongratulate the people primarily responsible for this accomplishment. \nThey are: Robert Rummel, Paul Albro, Cynthia Turrell-Burns, Peggy \nGibbud, Jeff Hatch, Clark Howland, Gene Miner, Tom Neary, Lance Warner, \nand Tim Beebe. There were also dozens of volunteers and community \nmembers who helped them make this dream come true.\n  I thank them for their persistence.

Again, I want to congratulate them and thank them \nfor their determination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/30/senate-section/article/S11188-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11188-S11189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NORTH AMERICAN WETLANDS CONSERVATION ACT\n\n Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, the North American Wetlands \nConservation Act [NAWCA] has been very\n\n[[Page S11189]]\n\nsuccessful in its stated goal of providing for long-term conservation \nof dozens of species of migratory birds and their habitats through the \ncoordinated action of governments, private organizations, and \nlandowners.\n  In Idaho, a typical NAWCA project benefits mallards, pintails, \ncinnamon teal, gadwall, long-billed curlews, peregrine falcons, bald \neagles, sandhill cranes, river otter, elk, pronghorn, mule deer, and \nmany species of native fish. But one species in particular benefits in \nIdaho from NAWCA. The Trumpeter Swan has made a real comeback because \nof conservation under NAWCA.\n  Trumpeter Swans were once widespread and abundant across North \nAmerica. But by 1900 they were reduced to near extinction by \nsubsistence and commercial hunting. In fact, outside of Alaska, only \none small remnant of fewer than 200 survived in remote sites in Eastern \nIdaho and nearby habitats in the Rocky Mountains. Most wintered in the \nhigh elevation wilderness west of Yellowstone National Park.\n  Although never officially listed as threatened or endangered, many \nagencies and private individuals have worked for decades to restore \nthis population, which today numbers about 2,500 and nests from south \neastern Idaho north to the Canadian Northwest Territories.\n  Restoration of this beautiful bird has required habitat protection \nand improvement, law enforcement to prevent illegal shooting, and years \nof research and management on Trumpeter Swans to restore a secure \ndistribution. In eastern Idaho, this effort has involved conservation \ngroups, including the Trumpeter Swan Society; irrigators, Indian \ntribes, private landowners, and businesses all working with the Federal \nAgencies, Idaho state parks and Idaho Fish and Game Department in \ncooperative efforts to ensure that the swans thrive.\n  The wintering population in the vicinity of the Harriman State Park \nand the famous Henry's Fork has risen to about 1,000 birds. These are \nnorthern birds that come south to winter in Eastern Idaho with our own \nresident birds. There is a real need to further distribute these swans \nfurther south in the winter to reduce crowding, protect the habitats, \nand to scatter the population better.\n  Juvenile Swans do not learn ancestral migratory routes to more \nsouthern wintering areas in the absence of adults that can lead them to \nnew areas. While we are steadily improving the habitat in the more \nsouthern parts of the State at sites like Bear Lake NWR, we will have \nto reestablish the migratory instinct.\n  From the Teton River Basin Wetlands and the Thousand Springs/Chilly \nSlough Projects [1-4], to the Bear Lake National Wildlife Refuge the \nNAWCA has helped the Trumpeter Swan in Idaho, and provided places to \nnest and distribute the winter population. These six projects have \nbrought a $5.5 million investment to Idaho that will help the swans and \ndozens of other species.\n  Non-profit organizations provide important assistance to NAWCA \nefforts. Ducks Unlimited [DU], in particular, has contributed more \nmoney and effort to NAWCA than any other non-government entity. In the \nlast few years they have contributed over $81 million. Bear Lake NWR \nalone has received over $1 million from DU and NAWCA.\n  The future looks bright for Rocky Mountain trumpeters if we can \nmanage their habitats and provide secure wintering areas. A century \nago, we almost lost Trumpeter Swans. The 21st century looks much \nbrighter as a result of proactive, cooperative efforts to protect the \nswans and their habitat. As Trumpeters return to the wetlands that we \nconserve through programs like the North American Wetland Conservation \nFund, they are an inspiring reminder of the progress that is \npossible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/30/senate-section/article/S11188-3", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      PRESIDENT'S RESPONSE TO INDEPENDENT COUNSEL'S INVESTIGATION\n\n Mr. JOHNSON.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nJames Francis (Jimmy) Crawford, a tireless public servant, a prominent \nbusinessman, and a man whose deep religious convictions touched the \nlives of many. Jimmy Crawford was a lifelong resident of Abbeville, \nAlabama, and was serving his third consecutive term as mayor. His \ncontributions to the city of Abbeville left an indelible mark in the \nmemories of all who knew him. Jimmy passed away on Thursday morning, \nSeptember 17, 1998 at the age of 58.\n  Throughout his life, Jimmy Crawford selflessly dedicated himself to \nthe benefit of others and stood by his principles and ideals in an \nunwavering fashion. From his early youth, Jimmy demonstrated a \nconsiderable eagerness to help others. Growing up in Abbeville, Jimmy \nwas active in the Boy Scouts of America, achieving the highest possible \nrank of Eagle Scout. After graduating from Abbeville High School in \n1957, Jimmy attended school at Howard College, now Samford University. \nAt Howard, Jimmy earned the distinction of being named in Who's Who \nAmong American Colleges and Universities. These accomplishments served \nas a hint of the dedicated life which Jimmy would eventually lead.\n  Upon his return to Abbeville, Jimmy quickly became a respected and \nadmired businessman in the community. His rental and finance firm \nprovided the vehicle for Jimmy to help to organize and assist area \nbusinesses. He was the charter president of the Abbeville Jaycees, and \nwas awarded the highest Jaycees honor by being named International \nSenator in 1975. Jimmy moved on to become the president of the \nAbbeville Chamber of Commerce in 1975 and 1976. During his tenure, the \nChamber saw unprecedented growth and one of the largest memberships in \nthe history of the organization. Jimmy was a member of the Abbeville \nLions Club and a former member of the Abbeville Kiwanis Club. He also \nserved for eight years on the Abbeville Recreation Board, two of those \nas chairman. No one would dispute the fact that he played a vital role \nin the development of these various organizations and the entire \nbusiness community of Abbeville.\n  Jimmy also achieved notoriety with his impressive political \nachievements. He was first elected Mayor of Abbeville in 1988 and was \ncurrently serving in his third term. He was vice-president of the Board \nof Directors of the Southeast Alabama Regional Landfill Authority. He \nserved dutifully on the Board of the Southeast Alabama Gas District for \nten years, taking the position of chairman in 1995. He was active in \nthe Alabama League of Municipalities as a member of the Executive \nCommittee, and achieved the high honor of being a certified municipal \nofficial. Jimmy was extremely proud of his accomplishments as Mayor, \nmost recently working with my office to secure important transportation \nand downtown revitalization grants.\n  Remarkably, Jimmy's business and political successes did not take \naway from his other devotions. Jimmy was a man with unwavering \nreligious beliefs that led to a life of teaching the word of God. He \nwas a charter member of the Calvary Baptist Church of Abbeville, where \nhe served for 36 years. During this time, Jimmy served in a variety of \ncapacities for the Church, including the post of chairman of the \ndeacons for four terms, as well as Sunday School superintendent and \nteacher. Along with these responsibilities, Jimmy was the founding \ndirector of the Abbeville Christian Academy and served on its Board of \nDirectors for many years. During his time involved with the Calvary \nBaptist Church and the Abbeville Christian Academy, Jimmy had the \nopportunity to help shape the lives of the\n\n[[Page S11190]]\n\nchildren whom he taught and provided them with a firm groundwork in \nmorality and Christianity which will help to guide them through life.\n  From his youth, Jimmy was also an avid sports fan. Having played \nfootball for Coach Bobby Bowden at Howard College, his competitive \nspirit never faltered.

Mr. President, earlier this year Nebraska was \nrecognized (along with our friends from Michigan) for being the best \ncollege football team in the land. But yesterday brought even better \nnews about a number one ranking for Nebraska.\n  As reported in the Omaha World-Herald, the Nebraska school system has \nbeen recognized in a recent national study as ranking first in the \nNation when it comes to teachers using the Internet in the classroom. \nMr. President, I ask that the article, ``Nebraska is Number One in \nClassroom Internet Use'' by Melissa Matczak and Michael O'Connor be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The World-Herald reported that a study released yesterday by \nEducation Week, a national education newspaper, says Nebraska has the \nhighest percentage of schools where at least half of the teachers use \nthe Internet for instruction.\n  I am not surprised by this ranking, and neither are Nebraska \neducators. In rural States, the Internet has become an indispensable \neducational tool for teachers and students. And for quite some time \nNebraska has been at the forefront in connecting our classrooms to the \nInternet as well as in realizing the benefits of distance learning.\n  I offer my great congratulations to Nebraska educators and \neducational service units, Governor Nelson and the many State and local \nofficials who made this possible. We should be very proud.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the World-Herald, Sept. 29, 1998]\n\n            Nebraska Is Number One in Classroom Internet Use\n\n               (By Melissa Matczak and Michael O'Connor)\n\n       In a tiny school district in western Nebraska, students use \n     the Internet to chat to children in Iceland, sharing stories \n     on rural life.\n       Across the state in Omaha, middle-school students track \n     space shuttles via the Internet.\n       In some Nebraska schools, using the Internet is becoming as \n     common as flipping open a textbook. A national study \n     recognizes that, ranking Nebraska No. 1 when it comes to \n     teachers using the Internet in the classroom.\n       A report released Tuesday by Education Week, a national \n     education newspaper, says Nebraska has the highest percentage \n     of schools where at least half of the teachers use the \n     Internet for instruction. Iowa ranks fourth in the report, \n     tied with Minnesota.\n       Nebraska education officials say the results don't surprise \n     them. In largely rural states, they say, the Internet is fast \n     becoming an important classroom tool.\n       ``It helps eat up the distance,'' said Jim Lukesh, a \n     technology administrator with the Nebraska Department of \n     Education. ``We've got a lot of small schools that are going \n     to be able to get things over the Internet that they wouldn't \n     be able to get otherwise.''\n       The report is based on a survey of predominantly public \n     schools that rates each state on schoolchildren's access to \n     computers and computer training available to teachers.\n       In 64 percent on Nebraska's schools, at least half of the \n     teachers use the Internet for instruction, the highest \n     percentage in the country.\n       In Iowa and Minnesota, the figure is 46 percent.\n       Nevada had the lowest ranking, 13 percent. Other states \n     near the bottom were Alabama at 21 percent, Georgia at 22 and \n     Louisiana and Florida at 23 percent.\n       Wayne Fisher, the Internet program specialist for the \n     Nebraska Department of Education, said policy-makers have \n     pushed for Internet access in the state's schools.\n       Lack of Internet training for teachers also had been a \n     concern, but state education officials say gains have been \n     made in that area.\n       Five years ago, about $500,000 was spent to train teachers \n     from across the state on how to integrate the Internet into \n     classroom lessons. The money came from a portion of a half-\n     cent tax levied by educational service units.\n       About two years later, the Legislature passed a law \n     requiring every school district to be hooked up to the \n     Internet by the year 2000.\n       To help the districts pay for the technology, about $13 \n     million was shifted from a school loan program to a school \n     technology program. Schools used the money to pay for wiring \n     their buildings for Internet use.\n       An $89 million bond issue approved last year is helping the \n     Millard School District continue its push to increase \n     Internet access.\n       The district plans to spend at least $4 million in bond \n     money over the next five to six years to add Internet \n     connections and purchase new computers. Classrooms now have \n     at least one connection. The goal is to have four.\n       It's not just large districts such as the 18,800-student \n     Millard school system that have made the Internet a priority.\n       The 1,400-student Seward School District west of Lincoln \n     started increasing Internet access a few years ago. Now all \n     but several classrooms are connected.\n       ``We have a community that thinks it's very important,'' \n     Superintendent Marshall Adams said. It's a tremendous \n     teaching tool.''\n       Fisher said the Internet allows students--especially those \n     in rural isolated areas of the state-to branch out.\n       ``Students and schools always struggle to learn beyond the \n     walls of the classroom,'' he said.\n       Iowa's Internet push received a boost two years ago when \n     the Legislature approved an education measure providing $30 \n     million a year for five years for technology.\n       School districts receive funding based on enrollment. the \n     money also can be used to train teachers in using the \n     Internet and other technology.\n       ``It's been a priority,'' said Klark Jessen, an Iowa \n     Department of Education spokesman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/30/senate-section/article/S11190-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO REVEREND SYLVESTER LAUDERMILL, JR.\n\n Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, I am pleased to have an opportunity to \ntalk about S. 1677, the Wetlands and Wildlife Enhancement Act of 1998. \nThis bill will reauthorize the North American Wetlands Conservation Act \n(NAWCA)--a law that has played a central role in the conservation of \nwetlands habitat across the continent.\n  I am joined by 58 of my colleagues from 42 states in sponsoring S. \n1677. There are 35 Republican cosponsors and 23 Democrat cosponsors. \nThis tremendous showing of bipartisan support is a tribute to one of \nthe great success stories in wildlife conservation. NAWCA has helped to \nbring about the recovery of more than 30 species of ducks, geese, and \nother waterfowl and migratory birds from their lowest population \nnumbers just 12 years ago to some of their highest population numbers \nthis year.\n  Why was NAWCA originally enacted? In the early 1980's, we were \nalarmed to discover that populations of duck and other waterfowl had \nplummeted precipitously. The numbers were stark: in only ten years, \nbreeding populations of ducks fell an average of 31 percent, with some \nspecies declining by as much as 61 percent. This decline was due to \nseveral factors, including loss of habitat and an extended drought in \nmany parts of the U.S.\n  In 1986, the U.S. and Canada worked cooperatively to develop the \nNorth American Waterfowl Management Plan. Mexico joined the plan in \n1994, so that the entire continent now participates in this effort. The \nPlan established ambitious goals and innovative strategies for \nconserving waterfowl habitat.\n  Under the leadership of Senator George Mitchell, Congress approved \nNAWCA in 1989, primarily as a vehicle to implement the Plan. The law \nprovides a permanent funding source for wetlands conservation projects, \nmany of which fall under the auspices of the plan.\n  These sources include Federal appropriations, interest generated from \nshort-term investments on the Pitman-Robertson Fund, money from the \nWallop-Breaux Fund, and fines collected under the Migratory Bird Treaty \nAct. All told, NAWCA received $43 million this past year, of which \n$11.7 million was appropriated.\n  Since NAWCA's inception, 575 projects involving more than 800 \npartners have received $240 million in Federal funds under NAWCA, \nmatched by more than $360 million in non-Federal funds. These projects \nhave covered about 3.8 million acres throughout the continent.\n  These numbers are impressive, but in the scheme of things, NAWCA is a \nrelatively modest law. Even so, it enjoys broad support. This is \nbecause, quite simply, NAWCA works. In fact, it works so well that it \nshould serve as a model for other environmental laws. I would like to \noutline what I believe are the four components of its success--and \nthus, it popularity.\n  1. NAWCA focuses on habitat conservation as the key to saving \nspecies.\n  Ducks and other waterfowl are extraordinarily dependent on climate. \nThey need wet weather to thrive. During years of drought, waterfowl \npopulations dwindle. If their habitat vanishes as well, waterfowl \npopulations do not stand a chance of rebounding when the rains return.\n  The beauty of NAWCA is that it seeks to protect the habitat itself, \nwhether the waterfowl are there or not. That way, when the rains come \nand the waterfowl return, the habitat is waiting for them. Thus, \nhabitat conservation is the means to achieve the end of waterfowl \nprotection. If waterfowl--or any other creatures threatened with \npopulation decline or extinction--are going to survive, they must have \navailable habitat capable of sustaining them.\n  In focusing on wetlands habitat, NAWCA reaches far beyond waterfowl \nspecies. Also sharing the same habitat are migratory birds, raptors, \nsongbirds, shorebirds, and even black bears, otters, and other mammals. \nAmong these\n\n[[Page S11192]]\n\nspecies, the habitat is the common currency--protect the habitat and \nyou protect all of them.\n\n  Professor E.O. Wilson has said,\n\n       When a natural ecosystem, say a forest remnant or a \n     freshwater stream, is protected to save a particular species, \n     an umbrella is thrown over hundreds or thousands of other \n     species . . . [and,] the great panoply of lesser known, often \n     unknown, and frequently invisible organisms are what sustain \n     natural environments.\n\n  This is a basic principle of biology. However, NAWCA has transformed \nthis principle into design. Let me read from the 1989 Senate Committee \nReport on the original NAWCA:\n\n       One of the purposes of this legislation . . . is to broaden \n     the focus of [the North American Waterfowl Management] Plan \n     with respect to conservation of wetland ecosystems and the \n     other migratory birds and other fish and wildlife dependent \n     thereon.\n\n  This purpose was further reinforced in 1994, when the plan was \namended to explicitly consider the needs of migratory birds when \ndeveloping projects.\n  2. NAWCA makes use of coordinated, comprehensive, continent-wide \nplanning to achieve its wetlands conservation goals.\n  It is important to protect habitat, but the key is knowing which land \nto protect. This is where the North American Waterfowl Management Plan \ncomes in. Without the Plan, NAWCA would be just another grants program, \ngiving money to worthy projects for a worthy cause, but without any \nsense of the whole picture. The Plan identifies broad goals and \nstrategies for recovering waterfowl populations across North America. \nTen joint ventures across all four flyways have been formed to refine \nthe goals and strategies for their specific regions. The joint ventures \nalso coordinate projects to conserve wetlands.\n  Partnerships among Federal, State, conservation groups, and \nlandowners--big or small--form to develop projects and submit proposals \nfor Federal matching money under NAWCA. The proposals are then reviewed \nby the North American Wetlands Conservation Council, which makes \nrecommendations to the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission, which \nthen approves the funding. The Council consists of nine members, as \nfollows: the Director of the Service; the Secretary of the Board for \nthe National Fish and Wildlife Foundation; four directors of State and \nwildlife agencies, one from each of the four flyways; and three \nrepresentatives of charitable and nonprofit organizations actively \nparticipating in wetlands conservation projects. The State agency \ndirectors and the representatives of charitable and nonprofit \norganizations are appointed by the Secretary for three-year terms.\n  Thus, the plan and act work in concert with one another, beginning \nwith broad planning guidelines for the entire continent, and ending \nwith individual projects for protecting and managing specific acres in \nour very communities.\n  A perfect example of this holistic approach is an initiative in the \nMississippi Alluvial Valley, which stretches from the mouth of the \nMississippi River up into Tennessee. This is where the cutting edge of \nconservation planning is taking place. Through modern satellite imagery \nand GIS technology, habitat types can be identified and mapped. This \necological mapping is then compared with land ownership, giving \nFederal, State, and local governments, as well as private owners, an \nidea of the most important lands to conserve. The result? Areas of \nhabitat fragmentation can be pinpointed, and reforestation and wetlands \nrestoration can be targeted to meet the needs of sensitive and \ndeclining species.\n  3. NAWCA relies on public-private partnerships to achieve its \nwetlands conservation goals.\n  The partners are a big reason for NAWCA's success. Instead of the \nheavy hand of government regulation, NAWCA's wetlands conservation \ngoals are achieved by voluntary cooperative partnerships involving very \ndiverse people and organizations--businesses, nonprofit environmental \ngroups, hunters, farmers, state, tribal, and local governments, and of \ncourse the federal government. Under the auspices of NAWCA, people and \ngroups with widely divergent, often opposing points of view have found \ncommon ground in wetlands. The kind of cooperation that NAWCA has \nengendered is heartening indeed. Through this work to achieve the goals \nof the plan, a broad array of people have had the opportunity to \ndevelop a deep and abiding appreciation of wetlands and the need to \nprotect them.\n  None has contributed to the program more than Ducks Unlimited, nor \nhas anyone been more vital to its success. That organization alone has \ncontributed in total about $20 million to the projects in the U.S., and \nabout another $60 million to projects in Canada and Mexico. The Nature \nConservancy has also been a tremendous supporter of the program, \ncontributing $17 million to projects in the U.S. and another $4 million \nto projects in Canada. However, these groups do more than raise money. \nThey educate landowners, coordinate partnerships, and give the program \nthe exposure it deserves. Because DU plays such an important role, we \nare amending S. 1677 to place them on the Council for one additional \nterm of 3 years, while at the same time requiring the Service to \ndevelop a policy, subject to notice and comment rulemaking procedures, \nto develop a fair and formal process for making future appointments to \nthe Council. I expect the Service to balance the policy between groups \nsuch as DU and TNC, whose support is invaluable, and between other \ngroups that might be smaller but who bring new ideas and new forms of \nparticipation to the program.\n  NAWCA has also reached out to private landowners across the \ncontinent--small, family owned farms, large developers, and private \nindividuals. In my own State of Rhode Island, it is private individuals \nwho have made the difference for some of the best remaining waterfowl \nhabitat in the state, in conjunction with The Nature Conservancy and \nState and Federal government agencies. We have a phased restoration in \nprogress to rectify years of damage as a result of dredge spoil \ndeposited along a tidal channel, poorly planned road construction, and \na recent oil spill. In Phase I of the South Shore Habitat Protection \nproject, Mr. Oliver Hazard donated an 80 acre tract of land to The \nNature Conservancy valued at $900,000. In Phase II, William Viall \ndonated 110 acres valued at $640,000 to the town of North Kingston.\n  On the opposite side of the continent, it was a partnership among two \nState agencies, the Metropolitan Services District of Portland, several \nnational and local conservation groups, and a local dairy farmer, E.F. \nSteinborn, who collaborated to restore 500 acress within the Tualatin \nRiver Floodplain near Portland, Oregon. The project converted a large \ndairy farm to seasonal and permanent wetlands providing habitat for \nthousands of waterfowl, shorebirds, and songbirds, complementing \nwetlands on the adjacent refuge. The project--located on the outskirts \nof Portland--is a wonderful example of how we can reclaim lands for \nconservation before they get swallowed up by urban expansion.\n  Another example is an area in Swan Lake basin, located in a wildlife \nrefuge in the San Joaquin valley of California. Swan Lake basin was a \ndry channeled area, but with NAWCA funds and four months of restoration \nwork it has been transformed into a lake with free-flowing drainage. \nThe area now provides nesting and resting groups for hundreds of white \npelicans, as well as double-crested comorants, grebes, 8,000 canvasback \nducks, 6,000 northern shovelers, and 40,000 gadwalls.\n  The benefits of these partnerships go far beyond specific projects, \nhowever. They facilitate the flow of ideas and innovations across \nborders. Only in the last decade, for example, has Canada begun to use \nconservation easements and servitudes to protect land from development. \nLegislation within the provinces has been enacted to broaden the use of \nthis valuable tool for conservation. It is without doubt that the \npartnerships under NAWCA have stimulated this awareness and can take \npart of the credit for these new developments in Canada.\n\n  Here is a case where the United States, Canada and Mexico have come \ntogether to identify a common need. Consider just one NAWCA site in \nQuill Lake, Canada. Banding data reveal that waterfowl using that site \nhave visited other NAWCA sites, represented by the blue circles, all \nacross the continent. Imagine the synergies of all NAWCA projects \nhelping each other. And, by enacting NAWCA, the United\n\n[[Page S11193]]\n\nStates has lead the way in providing a reliable funding structure to \naddress it. We have been able to turn good international intentions \ninto superlative international action.\n  4. NAWCA leverages federal dollars with private funds for wetlands \nconservation.\n  We all know how tight the federal budget is. Innovative funding \nmechanisms are the best hope for ensuring the viability of important \nenvironmental programs. The North American Wetlands Conservation Fund, \nwhich was established by NAWCA, provides grant money with a matching \nrequirement to leverage each federal dollar. In fact, the ratio of \nNAWCA funds to contributions from other partners usually approaches \n1:2.\n  Now let me inject a word of caution. We cannot afford complacency. \nNAWCA has been a success, but part of the credit for the recovery of \nwaterfowl species has to go to the heavy rains we've had in the past \nfew years. This year is drier than it has been in the past. Already, \nduck counts are leveling off. In drier conditions, the need to conserve \nduck habitat is ever more urgent.\n  And this urgent need to conserve wetlands is in direct competition \nwith severe development pressures on wetlands. By the year 2020, more \nthan half of the U.S. population will live in coastal plains. Laws like \nNAWCA will become ever more important in protecting these fragile \nareas.\n  The proper tribute to the success of NAWCA is to let it inspire us to \ndo more. Let us reauthorize this fine bill. Let us ensure it is \nadequately funded. Let us support the other important laws that protect \nwetlands--such as Swampbuster and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. \nAnd most of all, let us build on the strengths of NAWCA in all our \nenvironmental protection endeavors. Again, those strengths are:\n  1. Focus on conserving habitat.\n  2. Use a comprehensive plan--continent-wide, if possible.\n  3. Rely on public-private partnerships--both national and \ninternational.\n  4. Leverage federal dollars with private funds.\n  I exhort my colleagues to support S. 1677, and reauthorize the very \nworthy North American Wetlands Conservation Act. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to, that all time be yielded and the bill be read a third \ntime, and passed, with the motion to reconsider laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to enter into a colloquy \nwith Senators Harkin, Cochran, and Thompson concerning the treatment of \naudiological services under the Federal Employee health Benefits \nProgram, or FEHBP.\n  According to the American Academy of Audiology, hearing loss affects \napproximately 28 million people in the United States today (about 1 out \nof every 10 people), and this number is growing as our population ages.\n  This is a matter on which Senator Harkin and I, and also Senator \nCochran, have worked for a number of years. It raises significant \nissues concerning the quality and cost-effectiveness of our hearing \ncare and rehabilitation system, and indeed our entire health care \nsystem, and I hope this body soon will consider these issues fully.\n  Section 8 of H.R. 1836 is intended to make clear that FEHBP plans can \nauthorize direct services by, and direct reimbursement to audiologists \nand other licensed health professionals. I believe the Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM) should make it clear in their next call \nletter that audiology services provided directly by an audiologist can \nbe covered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from South \nDakota. This an important issue. Audiologic services are critical in \nthe diagnosis and management of hearing loss. I am concerned that under \nFEHBP, an efficient and effective avenue to appropriate care is \nunavailable because FEHBP law does not explicitly identify the option \nof direct access to audiologists.\n  Senator Cochran introduced, and I supported, along with Senator Frist \nand Pryor, legislation in the 104th Congress to ensure that FEHBP \nbeneficiaries who require audiological services would have the option \nof direct access to them.\n  Earlier this year, I received a letter from Kenneth W. Kizer, M.D., \nUnder Secretary for Health with the Department of Veterans Affairs. In \n1992, the VA instituted a policy allowing veterans who suspect a \nhearing loss to make appointments directly with an audiologist. \nAccording to Dr. Kizer, ``The VA experience suggests that providing \ndirect access to audiologists for civilian\n\n[[Page S11196]]\n\nfederal employees will result in high quality hearing care and reduce \nthe cost of services.''\n  We are not talking about mandating additional benefits. In addition, \nI believe it would be advisable to add provider non-discrimination \nassurances to FEHBP plans.\n  Of course, these matters involve a number of complicated issues, and \nto this point, the Governmental Affairs Committee has been unable to \nhold hearings to consider those issues. I would appreciate hearing \nSenator Cochran's and Senator Thompson's sense of what can be done, in \nthis Congress or the next, to ensure that those issues are fully \nconsidered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, as noted by the Senator from Iowa, I \nsupported legislation in the last Congress to address this problem, and \nI remain committed to ensuring that FEHBP beneficiaries receive \nquality, cost-effective, hearing care coverage.\n  As he also noted, there are a number of medical, insurance and public \npolicy issues involved, All these issues need to be considered, as well \nas the concerns of all members of the hearing health care team, \nincluding the Audiologists, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head \nand Neck Surgery and the International Hearing Society.\n  Whether in this Congress, or the next, I am committed to doing what \nis necessary to enable this body to understand these issues, and to \ndetermine the best way to address them, for the benefit of children and \nothers, who need hearing health services.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Cochran's comments. \nI am confident my colleagues will agree that any changes to the FEHBP \nneed to be considered carefully through the legislative process in \norder to ensure the integrity of the program, preservation of choice \nfor enrollees, and competition among plans. Toward that end, I look \nforward to Senator Daschle and Senator Harkin joining Senator Cochran \nand me in supporting passage of H.R. 1836.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleagues for \nthis colloquy.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I ask unanimous consent that the committee amendment be \nagreed to, the bill be considered read a third time and passed, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statement \nrelating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 3412, the \nYear 2000 Readiness and Small Business Programs Restructuring and \nReform Act of 1998. On September 15, 1998, the Committee on Small \nBusiness conducted a mark-up of H.R. 3412, a bill making technical \namendments to the SBIC Program which passed the House of \nRepresentatives on March 24, 1998, and was referred to the Committee on \nSmall Business.\n  The Committee approved 18-0 my amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute to H.R. 3412, which included the Year 2000 Readiness Act (S. \n2372), the Small Business Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 (S. \n2407) and portions of Senator Kerry's bill, the Small Business Loan \nEnhancement Act (S. 2448). Prior to approving my substitute amendment, \nthe Committee approved seven amendments by unanimous voice votes.\n\n\n                                title i\n\n  Title I addresses the Committee's concerns about the impact the Year \n2000 computer problem will have on small businesses. Earlier this year, \nthe Committee held a hearing on this problem, and the witnesses' \ntestimony was alarming. The majority of small businesses that are \nlikely to have Y2K computer failures are unprepared. In a study \nconducted by Wells Fargo Bank and the NFIB, there are an estimated \n4,750,000 small employers who will encounter Y2K problems. However, \nonly 15 percent of all businesses with under 200 employees have begun \nto inventory the automated systems that may be affected by this \ncomputer glitch, much less commenced fixing such systems.\n  Given the impact that a substantial number of small business failures \nwould have on our Nation's economy, the Committee determined that it \nwas not only important for small businesses to be aware of the Y2K \nproblem, but that they also had to have access to capital to fix such \nproblems. H.R. 3412 directs SBA to establish a limited-term loan \nprogram under the FA$TRAK pilot program that would guarantee 50 percent \nof the principal amount of a loan made by a private lender to assist \nsmall businesses in correcting Y2K computer problems. The Committee \nadopted an amendment sponsored by Senator Kerry that states that all \nSBA-approved lenders under the 7(a) loan program may also make loans \nfor Y2K corrections under the 7(a) loan program.\n  Since I became Chairman of the Committee in 1995, the Committee has \nmaintained an active role overseeing credit programs at the Small \nBusiness Administration. To assist the Committee in conducting its \noversight of these credit programs, H.R. 3412 includes a new provision \nthat requires SBA to provide notification to the Senate and House \nCommittees on Small Business whenever it initiates or changes a pilot \nprogram under the 7(a) loan program. Further, SBA is required to report \nannually to the Committees on the status of each pilot program. Such \nreport will include the number and amount of\n\n[[Page S11204]]\n\nloans, the number of lenders participating, and the default rate, \ndelinquency rate, and recovery rate for loans made under each pilot \nprogram.\n\n\n                                title ii\n\n  Title II of the Year 2000 Readiness and Small Business Programs \nRestructuring and Reform Act of 1998 includes improvements in Federal \nPrograms that are in great demand by small firms. Just last year, the \nCommittee approved a significant increase in the Women's Business \nCenter Program. Demands being placed on this program are exceeding last \nyear's estimates, and H.R. 3412 increases the annual authorization \nlevel for grants from $8 million to $12 million. To assist the \nCommittee in its oversight role, the bill directs the Comptroller \nGeneral to conduct a baseline study and a follow-up study on the \nmanagement of the Women's Business Center Program by SBA's Office of \nWomen's Business Ownership.\n  Last year, the Committee approved an increase from 20 percent to 23 \npercent in the amount of Federal prime contract dollars that will be \nset aside each year for small businesses. This goal is extremely \nimportant to the viability of thousands of small firms. Importantly, \nthe Federal government is also a big winner, since small businesses \ndelivery high quality, competitively priced goods and services.\n  The managers' amendment that Senator Kerry and I have offered amends \na provision in H.R. 3412 that requires SBA to report annually to the \nSenate and House Committees on Small Business on the success of each \nFederal agency in meeting the 23 percent goal. The provision in the \nbill was crafted after the Committee received a report issued in April \n1998 by the Department of Energy's Office of Inspector General that \nindicates that the Department of Energy exploited a change in its \nstatistical methodology to inflate its small business contracting \nachievements.\n  The managers' amendment refines the provision contained in H.R. 3412 \nthat was approved unanimously by the Committee on September 15. These \nchanges reflect clarifications requested by the Small Business \nAdministration, while retaining the bill's key provisions intended to \ndiscourage the reporting of erroneous or misleading statistics. At \nSBA's request, the managers' amendment provides for use of data from \nthe Federal Procurement Data System in preparing reports to the \nCongress on Federal procurement activities.\n  The managers' amendment also reduces the burden placed on the Chief \nCounsel for Advocacy for commenting on SBA letters authorizing changes \nin statistical methodology by the reporting agencies. As reported by \nthe Committee on Small Business, H.R. 3412 would have allowed such \nletters to take effect 45 days after copies had been transmitted to the \nSenate and House Committee on Small Business. During this time, the \nChief Counsel would have had 30 days to comment on such letters. The \nChief Counsel expressed concern to us about being able to meet this \ndeadline due to limited staff resources, so the managers' amendment \nchanges these deadlines. The Chief Counsel's comments will now be \nincluded with the initial transmission from SBA notifying the \nCommittees and will not be subject to a separate statutory deadline. \nThe managers anticipate that this approach will encourage SBA to make \nthe Chief Counsel a part of any negotiations leading to the preparation \nof such a letter in the first place.\n\n  The managers' amendment retains three key facets of the Committee-\nreported bill, with some simpler language. The Committee continues to \nbelieve it is appropriate, and consistent with the Chief Counsel's \nother reporting responsibilities, for the Chief Counsel to comment on \nletters authorizing changes in statistical methodology. Second, \nwhenever an agency seeks to reclassify contracts so they are not \nincluded in statistics issued in previous years, or are included as \npart of the calculation of a different statistic, the Committee wants \nthis information disclosed. Disclosure is vital so that recipients of \nthese statistics will know that they attempt to measure the same thing \nfrom year to year--and if they do not, how they differ. Finally, the \nCommittee continues to require a separate calculation of what the \nreporting year's statistics would have been in the absence of such \nchanges. This is intended to remove any incentive for an agency to \nmassage its statistics to inflate its small business contracting \nachievements.\n  The managers' amendment also makes an adjustment to the HUBZone \nprogram that was approved last year as part of the Small Business \nReauthorization Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-135). At the request of SBA, the \nDepartment of Labor would be added to the list of Federal agencies that \nmay participate under the HUBZone Program within the provision limiting \nparticipation to selected agencies prior to September 30, 2000.\n  Title II of H.R. 3412 has other significant provisions to improve \nFederal programs to help small business owners. The following \nhighlights the changes:\n  The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program is made \npermanent. Since this program was last re-authorized in 1992, its \nsuccess has exceeded our expectations. The bill requires Federal \nagencies to utilize its outreach activities to encourage greater \nparticipation of small research firms from states that receive few SBIR \nawards.\n  The program authorization level for participating securities under \nthe Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) Program is increased from \n$800 million to $1 billion in FY 1999; from $900 million to $1.2 \nbillion in FY 2000. Following the statutory changes in the SBIC Program \napproved by the Committee in 1996, the growth in the program has \nexceeded most estimates.\n  The Pilot Liquidation Program under the 504 Certified Development \nCompany Program is made permanent.\n  A new Office of Veterans Business Development is established at SBA, \nwhich is directed to provide comprehensive help to veteran-owned small \nbusinesses. An Advisory Committee on Veterans' Business Affairs \ncomposed of 15 members is established, and a new position of National \nVeterans' Business Coordinator is created within SCORE.\n  Title II also includes amendments that were offered by members of the \nCommittee on Small Business. It includes two amendments offered by \nSenator Kerry. The first restructures the loan loss reserve \nrequirements under SBA's Microloan Program. His second amendment \nchanges SBA's appraisal standards under the 504 and 7(a) loan programs \nto require appraisals of real estate collateral by state-licensed or \nstate-certified appraisers only when more than $250,000 of the loan \nproceeds are to be used to acquire, construct or improve real property.\n  The Committee approved an amendment included in Title II sponsored by \nSenator Bumpers to strike the cap on the amount of loan funds that a \nsingle state can receive under the Microloan Program, while ensuring \nequitable funding to Microloan Lender Intermediaries. An amendment \nsponsored by Senator Cleland to establish a pilot disaster mitigation \nloan program at SBA was accepted. And lastly, the Committee approved an \namendment offered by Senator Wellstone which authorizes a total of $20 \nmillion over four years to create the Community Development Venture \nCapital Demonstration Program at SBA.\n\n\n                               Title III\n\n  Title III of the Year 2000 Readiness and Small Business Programs \nRestructuring and Reform Act of 1998 incorporates an amendment offered \nby Senator Burns to create the Small Business Environmental Assistance \nPilot Program at SBA. The purpose of this pilot program is to provide \ntechnical assistance to small businesses to help them comply with \nenvironmental regulations. Witnesses have testified before the \nCommittee on Small Business about the complexity of environmental \nregulations and the importance of environmental compliance tools \ndesigned to help small businesses comply with the law and regulations \nadministered by the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  The Small Business Environmental Assistance Pilot Program has two \nprincipal sections. The first establishes an Advisory Committee on \nSmall Business Environmental Assistance Programs that will review \nexisting programs that provide environmental assistance to small \nbusinesses and chart the course for small business environmental \ncompliance assistance. The second section authorizes SBA to establish a \ndemonstration grant program based on the\n\n[[Page S11205]]\n\nrecommendations and strategy developed by the Advisory Committee. Under \nthis program, SBA will make 4-year grants to certain Small Business \nDevelopment Centers to provide environmental compliance assistance to \nsmall businesses in partnership with existing programs.\n  Mr. President, when the Committee on Small Business filed its report \non S. 3412, the Congressional Budget Office had not completed its \nestimate of the costs associated with the bill. I am now in receipt of \nthe CBO analysis of H.R. 3412 and ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 28, 1998.\n     Hon. Christopher S. Bond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Small Business,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     prepared the enclosed cost estimate for the H.R. 3412, the \n     Year 2000 Readiness and Small Business Programs Restructuring \n     and Reform Act of 1998.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contacts are Mark \n     Hadley and Kristen Layman (for federal costs), and Marc \n     Nicole (for the state and local impact).\n           Sincerely,\n                                        June E. O'Neill, Director.\n       Enclosure.\n\n\n               congressional budget office cost estimate\n\n     H.R. 3412--Year 2000 Readiness and Small Business Programs \n         Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998\n       Summary: H.R. 3412 would establish three new pilot programs \n     for the Small Business Administration (SBA) and would make a \n     number of changes to existing SBA loan and grant programs. \n     Assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts, CBO \n     estimates that this legislation would result in new \n     discretionary spending of $99 million over the 1999-2003 \n     period. Of this total, $66 million is from amounts \n     specifically authorized in the bill for SBA programs--\n     primarily for grants and administrative expenses. The \n     remaining $33 million would be primarily for the subsidy \n     costs of the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) \n     Participating Securities program and the proposed disaster \n     mitigation pilot program.\n       H.R. 3412 would also modify the terms of SBA guarantees for \n     existing general business loans. CBO estimates that provision \n     would increase direct spending by $4 million in fiscal year \n     1999. The act also could affect governmental receipts, but \n     CBO estimates that any such changes would be less than \n     $500,000 a year. Because the act would affect direct spending \n     and could affect receipts, pay-as-you-go procedures would \n     apply.\n       H.R. 3412 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector \n     mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \n     (UMRA). Any costs to state, local or tribal governments \n     resulting from enactment of the bill would be the result of \n     complying with grant conditions.\n       Description of the bill's major provisions: Title I would \n     establish a pilot loan program under the SBA general business \n     program to address the year 2000 computer problems of small \n     businesses. It would require that SBA provide annual reports \n     on the pilot program and a detailed annual report on all \n     pilot programs.\n       Title II contains a number of changes in small business \n     programs. Provisions with expected budgetary effects are \n     outlined below:\n       Section 201 would increase the amount authorized for grants \n     to women's business centers from $8 million a year to $12 \n     million a year. It would also clarify certain provisions of \n     the Small Business Innovation Research Program.\n       Section 203 would increase the authorized level of the \n     SBIC-Participating Securities program in 1999 and 2000.\n       Section 205 would allow qualified community development \n     companies (CDCs) to liquidate loans in their portfolio that \n     SBA has purchased. This section also would eliminate a pilot \n     program that allowed CDCs to liquidate loans and would allow \n     the CDCs to litigate in place of SBA.\n       Section 206 would authorize the appropriation of $2.5 \n     million each fiscal year to establish an office of veterans \n     business development and an advisory committee on veterans \n     business affairs.\n       Section 207 would eliminate a provision of law that allows \n     SBA to pay interest on guaranteed general business loans that \n     have defaulted at a rate 1 percent less than the borrower's \n     interest rate between the time of default and the time SBA \n     purchases the loan.\n       Section 208 would establish a disaster mitigation pilot \n     loan program and authorize a program level of $15 million for \n     each year during the 1999-2003 period.\n       Section 211 would establish a demonstration program for \n     venture capital in distressed communities.\n       Other provisions in title II would not have any significant \n     budgetary impact.\n       Title III would establish a pilot program to improve the \n     environmental performance of small businesses and would also \n     establish an advisory committee on small business \n     environmental assistance programs. Finally, title III would \n     authorize the appropriation of $500,000 for 1999 and $4 \n     million for each year over the 2000-2003 period.\n       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: CBO's estimate of \n     the budgetary impact of implementing H.R. 3412 is shown in \n     Table 1. The table does not include any estimated effects for \n     section 205 because CBO cannot determine whether that section \n     would have any budgetary impact, or what the direction or \n     magnitude of any such impact might be. The costs of this \n     legislation fall within budget functions 370 (commerce and \n     housing credit) and 450 (community and regional development).\n\n TABLE 1.--ESTIMATED FEDERAL COSTS FOR THE YEAR 2000 READINESS AND SMALL\n         BUSINESS PROGRAMS RESTRUCTURING AND REFORM ACT OF 1998\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                         By fiscal years in millions of\n                                                   dollars--\n                                      ----------------------------------\n                                        1999   2000   2001   2002   2003\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n              CHANGES IN SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION\n \nSpecified Authorization Level........      7     11     31     11     11\nEstimated Authorization Level........      9     11      5      5      4\n                                      ----------------------------------\n      Total Authorization Level......     16     22     36     16     15\nEstimated Outlays....................     12     20     31     20     16\n \n                       CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING\n \nEstimated Budget Authority...........      4      0      0      0      0\nEstimated Outlays....................      4      0      0      0      0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Basis of estimate: For the purposes of this estimate, CBO \n     assumes that the bill will be enacted in October 1998 (the \n     beginning of fiscal year 1999) and that the necessary amounts \n     will be appropriated for each fiscal year. Outlay estimates \n     are based on historical spending rates for existing or \n     similar programs.\n     Spending subject to appropriation\n       Specified Authorizations. H.R. 3412 would increase the \n     authorization for grants to women's business centers from $8 \n     million to $12 million each year. The act would also \n     establish an Office of Veterans Business Development, a \n     demonstration program for venture capital in distressed \n     communities, and a pilot program to improve the environmental \n     performance of small businesses. Assuming appropriation of \n     the specified amounts, CBO estimates that additional outlays \n     for these programs would total $66 million over the 1999-2003 \n     period.\n       Estimated Authorization for Loan Programs. H.R. 3412 would \n     make numerous changes to loan programs administered by SBA. \n     The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 requires appropriation \n     of the subsidy costs and administrative costs for credit \n     programs. The subsidy cost is the estimated long-term cost to \n     the government of a direct loan or loan guarantee, calculated \n     on a net present value basis and excluding administrative \n     costs.\n       Section 203 would increase the authorized program level of \n     the SBIC Participating Securities program from $800 million \n     to $1 billion in 1999 and from $900 million to $1.2 billion \n     in 2000. Based on information from the SBA and on historical \n     data for this program, CBO estimates that the subsidy costs \n     of guarantees for the authorized levels would increase by $11 \n     million over the 1999-2003 period. CBO estimates that this \n     provision would not significantly increase the administrative \n     costs of the agency.\n       Section 207 would eliminate a provision of law that allows \n     SBA, on defaulted general business loans guaranteed by the \n     agency, to pay 1 percent less than the borrower's interest \n     rate between the time of default and the time SBA purchases \n     the loan. Based on information from SBA and the Office of \n     Management and Budget (OMB), CBO estimates that this \n     provision would increase the subsidy rate by 0.01 percent. \n     That change would slightly increase the cost of guaranteeing \n     each new loan. CBO estimates that H.R. 3412 would increase \n     the cost of guaranteeing the authorized level of $14 billion \n     in loans in fiscal year 1999 from $195 million to $196 \n     million, subject to the availability of appropriations. This \n     provision would also affect direct spending by increasing the \n     costs of loans that SBA has already guaranteed (see below).\n       Section 208 would authorize a disaster mitigation pilot \n     program to make direct and guaranteed loans to small \n     businesses for preventive measures that would reduce the \n     long-run costs of disasters. To be eligible for a pre-\n     disaster mitigation loan, the small business must be unable \n     to obtain loans elsewhere for mitigation purposes. This \n     section would authorize a program level of $15 million each \n     year over fiscal years 1999 through 2003. Based on the 1998 \n     subsidy rate for SBA disaster loans, CBO estimates that the \n     subsidy appropriations for these loans and guarantees would \n     total $17 million over the 1999-2003 period. We estimate \n     that the costs of administering the pre-disaster \n     mitigation loan program would total less than $500,000 \n     each year.\n       Section 205 would authorize qualified community development \n     companies to liquidate loans in their portfolio that SBA has \n     purchased, and would allow CDCs to litigate in place of SBA. \n     CDC loans, also known a section 503 and 504 loans, provide \n     small businesses with long-term, fixed-rate financing for the \n     purchase of land, buildings, and equipment. H.R. 3412 would \n     make permanent the pilot program that allowed CDCs to \n     liquidate such loans. The pilot program has not produced \n     enough information to date to allow CBO to make any \n     determination about the amount the government would recover \n     on defaulted loans if those loans are liquidated by CDCs \n     instead of by SBA\n       In addition, it is not clear how expenses associated with \n     liquidation would be paid. The\n\n[[Page S11206]]\n\n     Federal Credit Reform Act stipulates that administrative \n     expenses cannot be paid out of the subsidy for loan programs. \n     but expenses to foreclose, maintain, or liquidate an asset \n     can. Many of the expenses CDCs would incur would be to \n     foreclose, maintain, or liquidate assets. It is not clear \n     whether SBA would have the authority to reimburse CDCs for \n     administrative expenses, including litigation costs.\n       Enacting section 205 could change the subsidy rate for \n     previous cohorts of CDC loans or the administrative costs of \n     SBA. However, CBO has no basis for estimating the direction, \n     magnitude, or timing of any such changes. The bill would not \n     affect the subsidy rate for future CDC loans. By law, the \n     Administrator of SBA must adjust an annual fee on 504 loans \n     to produce an estimated subsidy rate of zero at the time \n     loans are guaranteed. If enacting H.R. 3412 changed the costs \n     of future loans, that change would be reflected in fees paid \n     by borrowers, rather than in the appropriation required to \n     fund the authorized loan level.\n       H.R. 3412 also would make other technical changes to SBA's \n     loan programs, but CBO estimates that those changes would not \n     have any significant budgetary effect.\n       Table 2 summarizes estimated changes in loan levels and \n     subsidy costs assuming appropriation action consistent with \n     H.R. 3412. The increased discretionary spending associated \n     with SBA's loan programs would represent about $25 million of \n     the total cost of implementing H.R. 3412.\n       Reports. H.R. 3412 would require SBA and the General \n     Accounting Office to produce numerous reports. Based on \n     historical costs for similar reports and information from the \n     two agencies, CBO estimates that these provisions would \n     increase discretionary spending by less than $500,000 in each \n     year over the 1999-2003 period.\n\n TABLE 2.--CHANGES IN SBA LOAN LEVELS AND SUBSIDY COSTS UNDER H.R. 3412\n                                   \\1\\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        By fiscal years, in millions of\n                                                   dollars--\n                                      ----------------------------------\n                                        1999   2000   2001   2002   2003\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                    CHANGES IN AUTHORIZED LOAN LEVELS\n \nSBIC Participating Securities Loans..    200    300      0      0      0\nDisaster Mitigation Pilot Loans......     15     15     15     15     15\n \n                           LOAN SUBSIDY COSTS\n \nSBIC Participating Securities Loans..  .....  .....  .....  .....  .....\n  Estimated Authorization Level......      4      7      0      0      0\n  Estimated Outlays..................      3      6      2      0      0\nDisaster Mitigation Pilot Loans......  .....  .....  .....  .....  .....\n  Estimated Authorization Level......      3      3      3      3      3\n  Estimated Outlays..................      2      3      3      3      3\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Implementing H.R. 3412 also would increase SBA's costs for\n  administering loans, but CBO estimates that the changes in\n  administrative expenses would be less than $500,000 a year.\n\n     Direct spending\n       Loan Programs. Section 207, which would increase the \n     subsidy rate on future general business loans, would also \n     modify the expected cost of the guarantees SBA has provided \n     for existing loans. According to OMB's Circular A-11 \n     Preparation and Submission of Budget Estimates: ``If the \n     modification is mandated in legislation, the legislation \n     itself provides the budget authority to incur the subsidy \n     cost obligation (whether explicitly stated or not).''

Section 206 would establish an advisory committee on \n     veternas business affairs, and section 301 would establish an \n     advisory committee on small business environmental assistance \n     programs. H.R. 3412 would authorize the two advisory \n     committees to accept and use gifts and donations to assist in \n     their work. Donations of money are recorded in the budget as \n     governmental receipts (revenues) and the use of any such \n     amounts under the act would be direct spending, but CBO \n     estimates that any such donations would be less than $500,000 \n     a year.\n       Pay-as-you-go considerations: The Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act sets up pay-as-you-go \n     procedures for legislation affecting direct spending or \n     receipts. CBO estimates that enacting the bill would increase \n     direct spending by $4 million in 1999. The bill could also \n     increase governmental receipts, but any such changes would be \n     less than $500,000 a year.\n       Estimated impact on State, local, and tribal governments: \n     H.R. 3412 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined \n     in UMRA. The bill would establish new programs or modify \n     existing programs that provide grants or contracts to various \n     organizations, including state, local and tribal governments. \n     Any costs to these governments from the requirements of the \n     programs would be incurred voluntarily.\n       Estimated impact on the private sector: This act would \n     impose no new private-sector mandates as defined in UMRA.\n       Previous CBO estimate: On March 16, 1998, CBO transmitted \n     an estimate for H.R. 3412 as ordered reported by the House \n     Committee on Small Business on March 12, 1998. The House \n     version of H.R. 3412 would make only technical corrections to \n     existing law, and as a result, CBO estimated that it would \n     not have a significant impact on the federal budget.\n       Estimate prepared by: Federal Costs: Mark Hadley and \n     Kristen Layman.

Mr. President, this is an important bill that will benefit \nthousands of small businesses throughout the United States. I urge my \ncolleagues strong support for its final passage.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we have an opportunity today in the Senate \nto vote for legislation that will help our nation's 23 million small \nbusinesses.\n  On September 15, the Senate Committee on Small Business, made up of \nten Republicans and eight Democrats, passed a comprehensive small \nbusiness bill, H.R. 3412, that includes all the provisions of my Small \nBusiness Loan Enhancement Act of 1998. It also includes Senator Bond's \ntwo bills, the Small Business Programs Restructuring and Reform Act of \n1998 and the Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act, bills introduced \nby Senators Cleland and Wellstone, and four other amendments.\n  This bi-partisan vote was a big step towards final passage of \nlegislation that augments the opportunities available to every small \nbusiness owner and helps these entrepreneurs contribute to their \ncommunities and the economy. In Massachusetts and across the country, \nthese are the programs that are working; assisting individuals with the \ntools to successfully manage their own business.\n  If enacted, these changes would make a number of improvements to the \nSmall Business Administration's lending programs which reduce small \nbusinesses' costs and paperwork, increase access to capital for women-\nowned businesses, and promote small business lending, particularly to \nthose small businesses needing loans to meet the challenges of Year \n2000 computer problem. They also build upon successful programs such as \nthe Small Business Innovation Research program and the Women's Business \nCenters.\n  One of the most important provisions passed revises the loan loss \nreserve requirement (a cash reserve to guarantee that the government is \npaid back if a loan defaults) for microlenders by setting a 15-percent \nceiling and a 10-percent floor. After a microloan intermediary has \nparticipated in the SBA Microloan program for five years and \ndemonstrated its ability to maintain a healthy loan fund, it can \nrequest that SBA review and, when appropriate, reduce its loan loss \nreserve from 15 percent to a percentage based on its average loan loss \nrate for the five-year period. The proposed change would continue to \nprotect the government's interest in microloans as well as enhance the \nprogram by freeing up cash which microlenders could reprogram for more \nmicroloans or technical assistance to small business owners. Based on \nthe program's success since it was started six years ago, 36 out of 42 \nmicrolenders would qualify to maintain a loan loss reserve of ten \npercent, rather than 15 percent.\n  To reduce unnecessary regulatory burden and costs to small business \nlenders, this legislation raises the requisite appraisal threshold from \n$100,000 to $250,000 for 7(a) guaranteed loans and 504 development \nloans. This is consistent with federal bank regulatory policy in place \nsince 1994. After reviewing the legislation, SBA Administrator Aida \nAlvarez sent a statement of Administration Policy, approved by the \nOffice of Management and Budget, to Chairman Bond on September 15 \nsaying it had no objection to making the requisite appraisal threshold \namount consistent with existing policy. This change is estimated to \nsave borrowers on average from $1,000 to $3,000.\n  To help small businesses meet the escalating challenges of the Year \n2000 (Y2K) computer problem, this bill specifies that small businesses \ncan use 7(a) loans to finance the cost of making their systems and \ncomputers Y2K-compliant. The Committee complemented this change by also \napproving a loan guarantee pilot program introduced by Senator Bond \nwhich would allow 7(a) preferred and certified lenders to use their \npaperwork to expedite loans capped at $50,000 to help small businesses \nwith Y2K expenses.\n  The bill expands SBA's 504 Development Company program to make women-\nowned businesses eligible for loans up to $1 million to acquire \nequipment and expand facilities. Currently, 504 loans to women-owned \nbusinesses are capped at $750,000. The Committee also endorsed a \nprovision, based on the Kerry-Cleland Women's Business Centers bill \nintroduced earlier this year, which increases annual funding from $8 \nmillion to $12 million for Women's Business Centers.\n\n[[Page S11207]]\n\n  The Committee passed several other important provisions to improve \nthe business climate for small business. For the sector of small, high-\ntech companies that participate in federal research and development, \nthe Committee voted to make the Small Business Innovation Research \n(SBIR) program permanent after 16 years of success. The SBIR program is \na great example of how government and business can work together to \nadvance the cause of both science and our economy. The results have \nbeen dramatic for small, high-technology companies participating in the \nprogram. From 1983 to the end of 1996, some 8,000 small, high-\ntechnology firms have received more than 40,000 SBIR research awards, \ntotaling $6 billion.\n  Massachusetts is the second largest recipient of SBIR awards in the \nnation, receiving $148 million in SBIR research dollars in 1996. \nKnowing the benefits of the SBIR program, I believe we need to find \nways to make sure the SBIR awards are more equitably distributed \nthroughout the country without changing the program's reliance on \ncompetition. The highly competitive nature of SBIR awards is one of the \nmain reasons the program has been so popular and successful.\n  A recent SBA study showed that one-third of the states received 85 \npercent of all SBIR awards. I joined my colleagues to support Senator \nCarl Levin's amendment to promote the SBIR program in states that \nreceive the fewest awards. This amendment directs the ten federal \nagencies that participate in the SBIR program to use their existing \nprocurement outreach efforts for SBIR outreach.\n  Responding to requests from Veterans Service Organizations to assist \nveterans with entrepreneurial endeavors, I joined my colleagues and \nsupported Chairman Bond's bill that, among other things, would increase \noutreach and assessment of opportunities and services for veterans by \nestablishing the Office of Veterans Business Development within SBA. I \nam proud that the Committee adopted a version that included my \nsuggestion to authorize $2.5 million for this important effort.\n  The microloan community has more than just the loan loss reserve \nimprovements to applaud in this legislation. Senator Bumpers \nsuccessfully eliminated the cap on the amount of microloan funds a \nsingle state can receive. The cap has penalized several rural states \nwith small populations that have a high demand for microloans. And \nSenator Wellstone won unanimous support for an innovative four-year \ndemonstration program to spawn community development venture capital \norganizations nationwide. The purpose of Senator Wellstone's initiative \nis to stimulate and promote small business development and \nentrepreneurship in economically distressed communities.\n  The Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program is vital to our \nfastest growing small companies that have capital needs exceeding the \ncaps on SBA's loan program, but are not large enough to be attractive \nto traditional venture capital investors. The demand is clear: Last \nyear, participating securities in the SBIC program invested $360 \nmillion in 495 financings. In my state, where we have an impressive \ncommunity of fast-growing companies, particularly in the hi-tech \nindustry, there were 140 SBIC financings, worth $145.4 million.\n  The Participating Securities component of the SBIC program invests \nprincipally in the equities of new or expanding businesses. To leverage \nthe private capital of participating securities and better serve these \nfast-growing businesses, I supported Senator Lieberman's amendment \nwhich raises the authorization level for participating securities from \n$800 million to $1 billion in fiscal year 1999 and from $900 million to \n$1.2 billion in fiscal year 2000.\n  In response to the increasing costs, loss of businesses and personal \ndevastation caused by disasters, the Committee passed Senator Cleland's \nfive-year disaster mitigation pilot program. The program, recommended \nby the Administration as part of its Fiscal Year 1999 Budget, would \nallow SBA to make direct loans to small business owners, who can't get \ncredit elsewhere and who live in disaster-prone areas, for financing \npreventive measures to protect their businesses against future disaster \ndamage. Disaster mitigation is expected to reduce the costs of disaster \nrepair by 50 percent for small businesses.\n  To help small businesses maneuver the maze of environmental \nregulations, the Committee passed a small business environmental \nassistance pilot program introduced by Senator Burns. Administered \nthrough existing Small Business Development Centers in ten states, the \nprogram is designed to help small businesses comply with often complex \nenvironmental regulations.\n  Lastly, in addition to the Committee-reported bill, the Senate today \nwill adopt a Bond-Kerry amendment. First, it adds the Department of \nLabor to the SBA's HUBZone program, which Congress enacted last year. \nAnd second, it amends Section 205 of this bill, H.R. 3412, to improve \nthe reporting tools concerning small business set-asides of federal \ncontracts.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their support of small \nbusinesses and ask unanimous consent that this statement be entered in \nthe Record.\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, H.R. 3412, as amended by the Senate \nSmall Business Committee, has broad bipartisan support. I am \nparticularly pleased that H.R. 3412 makes permanent the Small Business \nInnovation Research Program SBIR, which was originally established in \n1982 and reauthorized and expanded in 1992. This competitive program \nhas a well deserved reputation for success and it is fitting that it be \nmade permanent.\n  H.R. 3412 also addresses a problem pointed out by GAO in its April, \n1998 SBIR report regarding the lack of uniformity in defining the term \n``extramural budget''. GAO found that participating agencies had \ndifferent interpretations of what should be included in their \nextramural research budgets. This is a problem because a participating \nagency's extramural budget is the base from which that agency's SBIR \nfunding is calculated. To resolve any discrepancies, H.R. 3412, as \namended by the Senate Small Business Committee, directs OMB to define \nthe term ``extramural budget'' and ensure that it is applied uniformly \nthroughout the government.\n  Finally, this bill includes a provision I authored which authorizes \nexisting procurement outreach programs of the Department of Defense and \nother federal agencies to conduct program outreach efforts for the SBIR \nprogram out of funds that are already available to them.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleagues, \nChairman of the Small Business Committee, Senator Kit Bond, and Ranking \nMember, Senator John Kerry, for their work in moving H.R. 3412 through \nCommittee. I would also like to thank Senators Bond and Kerry for \nagreeing to my language requesting a report from the Small Business \nAdministration (SBA) on the 7(A) loan program's reporting requirements \non the subsidy rate. I have heard from a number of community bankers in \nIowa who have expressed concerns with the monthly reporting \nrequirement. Previously, these reports were submitted quarterly. I am \nconcerned that small banks, especially small rural banks, lack the loan \nvolume or personnel to meet this requirment in a cost effective manner. \nI look forward to reviewing this report and working with my colleagues \nand the SBA in addressing this concern.\n  In addition to improvements in popular SBA programs, H.R. 3412 also \ncontains a Committee passed amendment, sponsored by Senator Max Cleland \nand cosponsored by myself, which will allow the SBA to conduct a \ndisaster mitigation pilot program. It is my hope that this program will \nafford small business owners, particularly in rural areas, the ability \nto invest in their property to help prevent against natural disasters. \nBy providing small businesses with the tools to invest in their \nbusiness before disasters strike, property destruction can be avoided \nand insurance claims can be reduced.\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I support H.R. 3412, the ``Year \n2000 Readiness and Small Business Programs Restructuring and Reform Act \nof 1998.'' The bill makes useful reforms to existing Small Business \nAdministration (SBA) programs and authorizes certain new initiatives, \nincluding a community development venture capital demonstration program \nwhich I proposed during markup in the Small Business Committee. I \ncommend Chairman Bond\n\n[[Page S11208]]\n\nfor his leadership on the bill, and I thank him for including my \nproposal in it.\n  The bill makes permanent SBA's 504 liquidation pilot program, a step \nI strongly support. Minnesota certified development companies with \nproven liquidation and foreclosure capabilities have made use of the \npilot program, which can help bring costs down and save borrowers from \nhigher fees. The bill's adjustments to the loan loss reserve \nrequirements in the Microloan program also are appropriate. Requiring a \nloss reserve based on past performance makes sense. This provision will \ncontinue to protect the government's interest in these loans but will \nallow the majority of microlenders to make more loans or provide more \ntechnical assistance to borrowers.\n  I am especially pleased that my proposal to create a new $20-million, \nfour-year demonstration program at the SBA to develop the capacity of \ncommunity development venture capital (CDVC) organizations is part of \nH.R. 3412. I thank Senator Bond again for his support and for working \nwith me to get this amendment accepted. I also thank the SBA for \nworking with my staff and for providing valuable technical assistance \nin drafting the amendment.\n  The CDVC Program is about directing venture capital--equity and \ninvestment capital--to small businesses with the aim of promoting \nbusiness growth and economic development in poor communities. That's \nwhat we mean by community development venture capital or CDVC. The \nmoney the bill authorizes would not be directly invested into small \nbusinesses; instead, it would go to provide technical assistance to \norganizations that invest in businesses in low-income communities.\n  CDVC organizations have been highly successful at producing a \n``double bottom line'' of strong financial returns and significant \nsocial benefits. CDVC funds create social and financial payoffs because \nthey consider the community impact of their investments to be just as \nimportant as the financial returns to investors. Community development \nventure capitalists target investments to companies that generate good \njobs--jobs that pay decent wages, jobs with benefits, jobs with \nopportunity to advance. They influence and shape the culture of young \ncompanies with respect to sustainable development and environmental \npolicies. They look to create local entrepreneurial capacity, local \nownership, local wealth. The ``double bottom line'' philosophy is what \nmakes these venture capitalists so unique and their work so promising. \nThe goal of the CDVC program is to expand and multiply this very \nmeritorious work.\n  There are about 30 CDVC funds currently operating in urban and rural \ncommunities around the country. Northeast Ventures Corporation in \nDuluth, Minnesota, is a good example of a successful and experienced \nCDVC company. Northeast Ventures serves a seven county rural area and \nfocuses on creating good jobs in high value-added industries. Northeast \nVentures targets 50% of the jobs created through its investments to \nwomen, low-income and structurally unemployed persons. They also \nrequire portfolio companies to offer employees an opportunity to \nparticipate in a health care plan in which the employer makes some \ncontribution. Partridge River is an example of one of Northeast \nVentures successful investments. Northeast made an initial investment \nin Partridge River, a locally owned specialized manufacturer of \nprecision and wood component parts for furniture and cabinets, in late \n1990. Partridge River uses readily available light-colored woods such \nas aspen, basswood, birch and maples, and has manufacturing customers \nthroughout the United States. When the company needed significant \nfinancing for an upgrade of equipment in 1994, another investor \npurchased Northeast's stake at a significant premium and allowed the \nentrepreneur to maintain majority ownership. Over the course of \nNortheast's involvement, the company added 17 net new employees from \nnortheast Minnesota.\n  Kentucky Highlands Investment Corporation (KHIC), founded in 1968 in \nLondon, Kentucky, is one of the oldest and most successful of the CDVC \norganizations. They focus on developing profitable businesses that \nprovide job opportunities to residents of Southeast Kentucky. For \nexample, KHIC provided over $600,000 in equity financing to a startup \ncompany that manufactures casements for the retail store industry. That \ncompany now employs over 125 people who had few prospects for \nemployment in their home county. This company would not be located in \nrural Clay County if not for the type of equity investment that KHIC \nmade available. Altogether, KHIC has infused about $40 million in \nventure capital in their region, invested in more than 100 companies \nand created over 5,200 jobs.\n  The organizations operating CDVC funds have been fortunate in \nattracting talented and dedicated people, but the skills and expertise \nto produce a double bottom line are still relatively scarce. The CDVC \nDemonstration Program allows the most experienced and successful in \nthis growing field to teach, advise, and mentor the less experienced, \nthe new and emerging community development venture capitalists.\n  The CDVC Demonstration Program authorizes $20 million over four \nyears. Seventy-five percent or $15 million will be used as grants to \nintermediary organizations--the private, nonprofit organizations with \nthe most experience and skill in making venture capital investments in \npoor communities--to provide hands-on technical assistance to the new \nand emerging venture funds springing up in low-income communities \naround the country. In addition to providing technical assistance, \nintermediaries will be able to use the grants to fund the start up and \noperating costs of new CDVC organizations. Grants to intermediaries \nwill be matched $1 for $1 with funds raised from non-Federal sources. \nTwenty-five percent or $5 million will be used as grants to \ndevelopmental organizations--public or private firms--to create and \noperate training programs, intern programs, a national conference, and \nacademic research and study of community development venture capital.\n  I hope that my colleagues in the Senate will support these reforms \nand new initiatives in the name of good jobs, entrepreneurship and \nresponsibility to community.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts, \nSenator Kerry and the Senator from Missouri, Mr. Bond, for their \ncontinuing leadership on behalf of small businesses. The legislation \nbefore the Senate, S. 3412, contains many important programs that will \nenable small businesses to continue to be a vital part of the nation's \neconomy. This omnibus small business legislation is the result of \nbipartisan commitment to a number of worthy goals.\n  Today I wish to address specifically two important initiatives that I \nproposed earlier in this session: the disaster mitigation pilot program \nand the Small Business Administration Women's Business Center \nauthorization. I am extremely pleased that both are included in this \nbill.\n  On June 11, 1998, Senator Kerry and I introduced the S. 2157, the \nWomen's Business Center Authorization bill. There was broad bipartisan \nsupport for this initiative, with seventeen cosponsors. I was \nespecially pleased when Senator Bond included an increased \nauthorization for women's business centers in the pending bill. Funding \nfor these important centers is increased from $8 million to $12 million \nin fiscal year 1999 and thereafter.\n  The women's business center legislation, simply stated, recognizes \nthe outstanding contributions that women's business centers have made \nto women entrepreneurs across the Nation. These centers are the only \norganization, nationally, which focus exclusively on entrepreneurial \ntraining for women. Increased funding will allow for new centers and \nsubcenters to be established and for continued funding for existing \ncenters, including the on-line women's business center. Increased \nfunding would achieve the goal of expanding centers to all 50 States.\n  On March 26, 1998, I introduced a disaster mitigation pilot program, \nS. 1869. This legislation would permit SBA to establish a pilot program \n(using up to $15 million of existing disaster funds) to provide small \nbusinesses with low interest, long-term disaster loans to finance \npreventive measures before a disaster hits. In response to the \nincreasing costs and personal devastation caused by disasters, the \nAdministration has launched an approach to emergency management that \nmoves away\n\n[[Page S11209]]\n\nfrom the current reliance on response and recovery to one that \nemphasizes preparedness. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) \nhas already established administratively a program to assist disaster-\nprone communities, one in every state, in developing strategies to \navoid the crippling effects of natural disasters. My proposal would \nallow the SBA to begin a pilot program that would be limited to small \nbusinesses within those communities which are eligible to receive \ndisaster loans after a disaster has been declared. Currently, SBA \ndisaster loans may only be used to repair or replace existing \nprotective devices that are destroyed or damaged by a disaster. In \nconnection with repairs, funds may also be used to install new \nmitigation devices that will prevent future damage. My legislation is \nnecessary to authorize SBA to establish this pilot program to provide \nmitigation loans prior to the occurrence of a disaster.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this disaster mitigation program will \naddress two areas of need for our small businesses--reducing the cost \nof recovery from a disaster and reducing future disaster costs for \nsmall businesses. It also addresses the opportunity for small \nbusinesses to contract work during a period when market forces haven't \ndriven up the prices for these services, thereby ultimately reducing \nthe cost of disaster assistance to the taxpayers.\n  I thank my colleagues on the Small Business Committee for including \nboth of these initiatives, which I think will serve the needs of so \nmany, in this bipartisan legislation. I look forward to its prompt \nenactment. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. SHELBY.

Mr. President, I have heard many of the statements made \nhere today and yesterday regarding the defense authorization conference \nreport and, indeed, I had hoped to come to the floor earlier, but I was \ninvolved in a meeting in my office with the Foreign Minister of the \nRepublic of Yugoslavia in a very serious and protracted discussion \nabout the possible military options that Mr. Milosevic's Government and \nour Government were considering with respect to the situation in \nKosovo, and the readiness of the military forces as well as the ability \nof those forces to respond to various contingencies was a significant \npart of our discussion.\n  Many of our colleagues have expressed their concern over the degraded \nstate of readiness of our armed services. Mr. President, I share those \nconcerns, especially as they relate to our fundamental ability to fight \nand win two major wars as is called for by our national military \nstrategy.\n  Admittedly, the need to fight two such wars has been challenged by \nmany, but until the tense situations in the Middle East and the Korean \npeninsula are behind us, we do not have the luxury of cutting force \nstructure anymore. Indeed, in the words of the well-known Broadway \nmusical, ``we've gone about as `fer' as we can go.''\n  Yesterday, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the four \nservice chiefs confirmed that the risk we now associate with fighting \nin a second theater is high. By ``high risk,'' we mean that the level \nof troop losses in such a conflict could be unacceptably high. This, \nMr. President, is a serious development and one which merits our \nimmediate attention. Many of our colleagues have also expressed \nfrustration that we were made aware of this and other readiness \nproblems only recently.\n  While I share some of these frustrations, I also appreciate the \ncomplexity of predicting problems even a few months out. Pilot \nretention, for example, can be a function of the strength of the \neconomy. Moreover, I appreciate the comments by our service chiefs in a \nhearing yesterday that reinforced the immense complexity of managing \nour readiness, especially like a major downsizing unlike anything we \nhave been through since the end of World War II.\n  This having been said, we have a serious readiness problem that \nthreatens to nosedive very quickly. We are already eating our seed \ncorn, and the threat of a hollow force, according to our witnesses \nyesterday, looms only 5 or perhaps a few more years out.\n  Some fixes can be made in short order; others, such as fielding new \nequipment that won't consume so much of our resources to maintain, may \ntake years.\n  The obvious solution and one quoted by many of those participating in \nthe hearing and certainly by our service chiefs is more money.\n  While I will support supplemental funding for the Department of \nDefense, I do so with considerable frustration over this Congress' \ninability to have the courage to cut wasteful defense spending. While \nwe rail on and on about the administration for underfunded readiness, \nwe refuse to cut bases. One more base closure round should realize \naround $3 billion a year in steady-state savings, enough to pay for a \nhost of readiness problems.\n  While some attack our service leaders for not being forthcoming, we \nadd hundreds of millions of dollars in military construction projects \nthat, although requested by the military for future years, we rush to \nbuild today so we can score points back in our States and districts \njust before an election. While some claim we have had no indications of \na looming readiness problem, the fact is that we have. But despite \nthis, we added over $2 billion in this bill for procurement and \nresearch and development projects that were simply not requested by the \nmilitary. I am not suggesting they are not necessary in the long term, \nbut they were not requested by the military in this bill.\n  Mr. President, I support this conference report. I will support the \nsupplemental funding package. But I hope each and every Member will \nfind the will next year to support substantial infrastructure \nreductions and stop pushing so many Member interests\n\n[[Page S11210]]\n\nonto the defense authorization bill so that we can put those limited \ntax dollars that we do have available for our Nation's defense to work \ndirectly and exclusively for the soldiers, airmen, sailors, and marines \nwho are willing to risk their lives for this Nation.\n  With that, Mr. President, there will be more to say tomorrow when the \ndefense authorization report is formally considered by the Chamber.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the previous unanimous consent order be \nmodified to accommodate the distinguished Senator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia for making that request. I will be very brief.\n  First, I compliment the Senator from Virginia. I came here to speak \non another subject, but his remarks on what is the current topic about \nmilitary readiness were very topical and timely. He made one very \nsalient point that needs to be reinforced, and I would just like to \nlend my support because, as you know, I will not be here next year, and \nI regret it for a number of reasons, but one of the reasons is because \nI won't be here for the debate about just how bad off our Defense \nDepartment is on readiness, No. 1. No. 2, the question keeps coming \nback to me on why, if $270 billion, which is this year's defense \nbudget--or maybe that is the amount we appropriated for next year, $270 \nbillion--if that isn't enough when you consider the fact that that is \nmore than all the defense expenditures of the rest of the world and \ntwice as much as China and Russia and the so-called seven or eight \nrogue nations, you have to ask yourself, what are we doing with that \n$270 billion?\n  When you add NATO to it, NATO and the United States combined spend \nwell over twice as much as the rest of the world combined.\n  I wish I was going to be here for this so-called readiness debate. I \nhave watched this thing happen about five times since I have been here, \nwhere we go along and all of a sudden the Defense Department comes over \nand says, ``Our readiness is declining; our ability to meet the \ncontingencies that we see are something we are not going to be able to \nmeet with our existing manpower.''\n  It makes me wonder, because then Senators begin to hear from their \nconstituents back home that the Joint Chiefs have said we are woefully \ninadequate in this department, woefully inadequate in that department. \nAnd among other things, General Shelton pointed out yesterday in the \nArmed Services Committee that one of the reasons they feel like their \nreadiness is slipping is because they have things imposed on them to \nthe tune of about $4 billion or $5 billion this year they didn't ask \nfor.\n  When you consider the fact that our retention rate of pilots is 27 \npercent, and we are in the process of building about 700 new F-18s and \n339 F-22s, you have to ask yourself, Who is going to fly those planes? \nIf we can't compete with commercial airlines, then we ought to raise \nthe salaries of our pilots.\n  It is absolutely unconscionable that we spend the amount of money \nthat we do--hundreds of thousands of dollars--training pilots only to \nwatch the commercial airlines take them away from us once they have \nbeen trained. The only way you are going to overcome that is to change \nthe salaries of pilots so you can retain them.\n  I am like Senator Robb, I will have more to say on this subject \nlater.\n  I really came over to give another brief statement.\n  This is the eighth year I have been trying to kill the space station. \nEverybody knows that. I only have about 6 more days to speak my mind in \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  I know that everybody is going to be extremely rhapsodic and excited \nto hear the good news, and that is, since I stood on the floor about 6 \nmonths ago and tried to kill the space station once again, the cost of \nit has only gone up $8.3 billion. We are now headed into the second \n$100 billion for the space station. You have to bear in mind that that \nis only if the Russians are ready, for example, with a service module \nby April of 1999, and even NASA itself says they are not likely to be \nready until the fall of 1999.\n  When I tell you that we are soaring past the $25 billion mark right \nnow, and we will probably be at $30 billion by April of next year as \nbest we can project, and you understand that the Russians are not going \nto be ready with a service module by next April as anticipated, and if \nit is next fall, just keep adding a billion here and a billion there.\n  Mr. President, all I can do is to tell my children and grandchildren \nI did my best to stop this thing before it got completely out of \ncontrol, and I failed miserably. I never received more than 35 votes, \nmaybe 40 at one time.\n  I have to admit, it is extremely gratifying to come over here and \ntell you, ``I told you so.'' There is just nothing politicians like \nbetter than to be proven right.\n  I will be down in Arkansas watching C-SPAN occasionally. Senator \nPryor tells me he is so happy now he doesn't even watch C-SPAN anymore. \nHe says sometimes it just ruins his whole day. I will be down there and \nprobably watching C-SPAN as I watch the cost of the space station soar \nfrom $100 billion--it is about $104 billion right now--right on up to \n$150 billion and watch the U.S. Senate put their imprimatur on it and \nsay, ``Sic 'em, tiger; go at it, and we'll just keep spending the \nmoney.''\n  It doesn't make any difference. I can tell you right now it does not \nmatter what the space station winds up costing; we are going to build \nit. Nobody can tell you why, but we are going to.\n  I will have a little more to say on this the first opportunity \ntomorrow or Friday.\n  I yield the floor, and I assume we will stand in recess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/30/senate-section/article/S11209-4", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECESS UNTIL 9 A.M.
