Mr. President, this morning, the Senate will immediately \nresume consideration of S. 1301, the Consumer Bankruptcy Protection \nAct. At long last, I think we are going to be able to complete action \non this legislation and get it into conference and give us a good \nopportunity then to get this work completed by the session's end.\n  It is expected that several amendments will be offered and debated \nthis morning, with a stacked series of rollcall votes occurring at \napproximately 11:45 a.m. It looks like there will be two votes, \nprobably, in that sequence, at 11:45.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume consideration of S. 1301, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1301) to amend title 11, United States Code, to \n     provide for consumer bankruptcy protection, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Pending:\n\n       Lott (for Grassley/Hatch) Amendment No. 3559, in the nature \n     of a substitute.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for announcing \nthe schedule this morning. Those who have followed the last few days of \nSenate debate know we are considering a reform of the bankruptcy code. \nWe will be joined shortly by the Senator from Connecticut, Senator \nDodd, who will offer an amendment.\n  For those who have not paid attention to this debate, I hope that \nthey have followed at least the outline of it and understand that what \nwe are about is to try to change the bankruptcy code in a way that will \nreduce abusive filings--in other words, people who may be going into \nbankruptcy court to file for bankruptcy in a situation where they can, \nin fact, pay back either their debts or a sizable portion of those \ndebts. We have tried to address this at several different levels. We \nhave had a spirited debate about how to do it.\n  We understand the complexity of this. Historically, there has been a \nnational commission which has taken a look at this rather complicated \narea of the law. I find myself in an unusual position here, having \nworked with my staff and studied this issue for a year, because I come \nto this with an interesting experience when it comes to bankruptcy law. \nThirty years ago, I took a course in bankruptcy in law school. Twenty \nyears ago, I was appointed trustee of a bankruptcy in my hometown of \nSpringfield, IL, in one case. Now I bring that wealth of experience to \nthis debate in an attempt to try to find our way through a very \ncomplicated area of the law. It was interesting.\n  Yesterday, when I spoke to a colleague of mine about bankruptcy, she\n\n[[Page S10740]]\n\nhad said that she was surprised to learn how few people file bankruptcy \nwith incomes over $50,000 a year. I told her that the average income of \na person filing for bankruptcy in the United States of America is less \nthan $18,000. So folks who are going into bankruptcy court, by and \nlarge, are people of very limited means. The average debt of the person \ngoing into bankruptcy court is about $28,000.\n  So if we are out to stop the high rollers and the abusers of the \nsystem, I hope that we take care in this bill, as well as in \nconference, to protect the vast majority of people petitioning the \nbankruptcy court for relief of their debts, who are, in fact, in lower-\nincome categories, with a debt that is beyond their comprehension or at \nleast their control.\n  As we go about these changes, I am glad to see that we have included \namendments that not only try to tighten up the procedures in the \nbankruptcy court, but also say to the people in the credit industry \nthat they have an equal obligation here. We want you to continue to \nextend credit across America so that American families and businesses \ncan use credit cards and second mortgages and other things to finance \ntheir lives and businesses; but we want you to be certain that you \nfollow some rules, too.\n  We have talked a lot about personal responsibility here when it comes \nto consumers. I think that is a valid observation. We also want to \nspeak to corporate responsibility, so that those who are peddling these \ncredit cards around the country, in fact, give full disclosure to the \nwould-be consumers about the terms. Many of us will go home tonight and \nlook through the mail, and you know what you are going to find--a stack \nof preapproved credit card applications. It is luring. People say: This \ncan be easy. I will take all my debts and put them on one card. Look at \nthis low interest rate; this is terrific. Let's do this right away.\n  Yet, they find that it is a teaser rate and only applies for a few \nmonths. If they decide in some instances to pay off their credit card \nat the end of each month, they may face a penalty. Yes, a penalty for \npaying off the balance on your card because, of course, the company \nmakes money if you continue to really roll over the debt month after \nmonth and pay interest.\n  Senator Reed of Rhode Island successfully offered an amendment that \nsaid that you have to have full disclosure if that is going to occur, \nand other amendments in this bill try to say to the consumers that you \nhave a right to know, too. For example, if you pay the minimum monthly \nbalance on your credit card, we have a provision in this bill that says \nyou should state right under it how long it will take to pay off the \ncredit card debt and how much you will pay in interest if you pay the \nminimum monthly amount.\n  So we are trying to strike a balance here--a balance that says those \nwho come into court have to be, in fact, deserving of bankruptcy \nprocedure, and that those who extend credit in this country have to be \nmore open and honest in the way that they deal with consumers. I think \nthat is the right balance. It still puts the burden on each of us to \nmake the right decisions for ourselves and our families. It gives us \nthe information about the credit card companies to make that decision \nmore knowledgeably and with an understanding of what we are getting \ninto.\n  At this time, I see my colleague from the State of Connecticut is \nhere to offer his amendment under the unanimous consent agreement.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nConnecticut is recognized to offer an amendment regarding student loans \non which there will be 15 minutes: 10 minutes under the control of the \nSenator from Connecticut, and 5 minutes under the control of the \nSenator from Iowa.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first of all, we want to wrap this bill up, \nI gather, fairly quickly. I want to extend my congratulations to \nSenator Grassley of Iowa, Senator Hatch, my colleague from Utah, and \nSenator Durbin, the manager for this side of the aisle on this \nlegislation. It has been a long journey for them, I know, in committee \nin trying to deal with this legislation. I am particularly grateful for \nthe courtesies which they have extended to me, and for the various \nideas we have had for inclusion in this legislation.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3614 to Amendment No. 3559\n\n    (Purpose: To improve certain bankruptcy procedures relating to \n                          dependent children)\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, with that in mind, I send an amendment to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3614 to amendment No. 3559.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec.   . Protection of Savings Earmarked for the \n     Postsecondary Education of Children.--Section 541(b) of title \n     11, United States Code, as amended by section 403 of this Act \n     is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (6), by striking the period at the end and \n     inserting a semicolon; and\n       (2) by inserting after paragraph (6) the following:\n       ``(7) except as otherwise provided under applicable State \n     law, any funds placed in a qualified State tuition program \n     (as described in section 529(b) of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986) at least 180 days before the date of entry of the \n     order for relief; or\n       ``(8) any funds placed in an education individual \n     retirement account (as defined in section 530(b)(1) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986) at least 180 days before the \n     date of entry of the order for relief.''.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this amendment is a third amendment to two \nothers that have been offered and have actually been included in the \nmanagers' amendment.\n  I thank, again, Senator Hatch, Senator Durbin, Senator Grassley, and \nothers for their consideration.\n  This amendment, the third, is designed to protect children who \nthrough no fault of their own are involved in bankruptcy. It provides \nlegal and legitimate college savings accounts established for the \nbenefit of children which will be beyond the reach of creditors.\n  This amendment parallels Senator Hatch's provisions to protect \nretirement savings accounts, and particularly contains measures to \nprevent fraudulent transfers of assets intended solely to avoid the \nrightful reach of creditors. So we have written into this the exact \nsame kind of parallel provisions that the seniors' retirement accounts \ninclude.\n  The amendment complements other provisions that are included in the \nmanagers' amendment. Those provisions ensure that the lawful funds for \nthe benefit of children--such as child support, disability payments, \nand foster care payments--would also be preserved for children and not \ncreditors.\n  Again, that goes back almost 100 years in trying to see to it that \ninnocent children are not going to be harmed and hurt as a result of \nthis process.\n  In addition, we agreed that household goods exclusively and primarily \nfor children, such as toys, children's furnishings, and items used by \nparents provided for their children, would also be protected.\n  Again, it was a consensus. I commend my colleagues for recognizing \nthat these issues are important as well.\n  Taken together, the provisions of this amendment and the managers' \namendment will continue the 95-year-old principle of the bankruptcy \ncode that women and children must be first in bankrupt credit \nalliances.\n  I believe that these important improvements in the bill reinforce the \nhistoric protections that are given families in bankruptcy proceedings. \nThose who are innocent and most vulnerable deserve the most protection.\n  I am very grateful, as I said a moment ago, to the chairman of the \nfull committee and the subcommittee and the ranking member, Senator \nDurbin, who has worked hard to ensure these protections for children \nand families were not weakened in the pending legislation.\n  In the rush that was going on around here a number of weeks ago, we \nalmost blew by these historic protections which we provide for \nfamilies. As a result of their leadership, these protections have been \nincluded in legislation. I am confident that in conference they will \npreserve them.\n\n[[Page S10741]]\n\n  This amendment would strengthen the principle that children ought to \ncome before credit card companies. Legal proceedings, including \nbankruptcy proceedings, should be designed to protect against the \nimpoverishment of children and innocent adults. Otherwise, \nimpoverishment will produce dependency, in which case no one wins--\nneither the individual impoverished, nor the credit card company.\n  I also would like to express for the record my concern that my \ncolleagues in conference firmly support the Senate legislation. I think \nit is critically important that we hold these provisions.\n  Again, we all recognize the importance of this legislation. There has \nbeen a flood of people taking advantage of the Bankruptcy Act. Too many \nhave been doing that. This legislation is going to tighten that up \nconsiderably. But I think as we call for a higher degree of \nresponsibility on the part of our citizenry when it comes to their \nfiscal and financial responsibility, it is also incumbent that we ask \nthe credit card companies to exercise responsibility as well.\n  This legislation, I think, strikes a good balance between stopping \nthe incredible amount of people taking advantage of the Bankruptcy Act \nwith little or no repercussions, it would appear, and also seeing to it \nthat the innocents--particularly children--are not going to be \nadversely affected by this process.\n  As has been noted by some of our colleagues over the last week or so, \nas you consider this bill, just last year alone 3 billion credit card \nsolicitations were sent out across this country, many with already \npreapproved proposals.\n  I hope that credit card companies will exercise some restraint and \nresponsibility in trying to slow down what is an exploding amount of \nconsumer debt in this country. During good times, no one talks about it \nmuch. But when you get a downturn in the economy, it becomes a major \nproblem. There is corporate debt, and consumer debt. We have to try to \nget a better handle on it.\n  I am very grateful to the managers of the legislation--I see my \ncolleague from Iowa has arrived on the floor as well as the Senator \nfrom Utah--and for their consideration of this amendment.\n  As I said, it tracks Senator Hatch's very good amendment on seniors' \nretirement accounts to see to it that education is going to be \nsomething that we continue to support as strongly as we have for the \n21st century because of rising college costs, to see to it that these \neducational accounts are going to be for the children that need them. I \nthink it is a very wise decision. Indeed, I am grateful for their \nsupport.\n\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to commend my colleague, the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut, for his initiative on this \nparticular amendment, as well as his contributions to this legislation \nas a whole.\n  We have worked closely on several issues on this bankruptcy \nlegislation, including providing for enhanced protection of domestic \nand child support payments in bankruptcy. And I have appreciated both \nhis and his staff's dedication, sincerity, and cooperation on this \nimportant bankruptcy legislation.\n  I am sure my colleague, the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator \nGrassley, feels the same way.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is well intentioned. I fully support \nthe policy of providing enhanced protections for educational savings \naccounts in bankruptcy. That is why we have agreed to this amendment. \nHowever, Senator Dodd is aware that I have some concerns with the \namendment as currently drafted, because it may have the unintended \nconsequence of encouraging and rewarding fraud and abuse in bankruptcy.\n  I thank the Senator from Connecticut for agreeing to work with us on \nthis amendment as this legislation progresses to ensure that it will do \njust what it is intended to do; that is, protect funds that have been \nset aside for the education of the child of the debtor.\n  Some of my specific concerns include the fact that under the \namendment as currently drafted the debtor will not have to disclose the \nexistence of these accounts in any way in the bankruptcy case, or the \nschedules filed with the court because they are deemed ``not the \nproperty of the estate.'' The trustees will not even know these \naccounts exist, and they cannot be audited.\n  I would like to see these accounts to be created exempt properties of \nthe estate of the bankrupt similar to the treatment we have given \npension plans and retirement savings accounts in this legislation.\n  Moreover, we need to place some limits on these accounts to prevent \nthem from becoming bankruptcy shelters for those seeking to abuse the \nbankruptcy system as a financial planning tool.\n  Again, this could be done by placing limits similar to those we have \nimposed on individual retirement accounts and the way we have done \nthat.\n  Finally, we need to ensure that the funds protected in such accounts \nwill actually be spent on the education of the bankrupt's child, not \nsimply withdrawn after bankruptcy to be used as the bankruptcy wishes, \nleaving the future education of the child in jeopardy.\n  I know that the Senator from Connecticut shares my concerns that this \namendment not provide a new means for fraud and abuse.\n  Again, I thank him and his staff for their willingness to work with \nus to address these concerns.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, before we accept this amendment--I \nunderstand that we will do that, and I prefer that we do--I commend the \nSenator from Connecticut for his hard work on this issue. I have to say \nthat I think the Senator is on to something here. We ought to encourage \nparents, obviously, to save for education and to protect these savings \nin bankruptcies. So philosophically we are all on the same page.\n  The problem in a situation like this is the devil is in the details, \nespecially when it comes to making changes to the bankruptcy code.\n  I want to express my concern that the amendment of the Senator from \nConnecticut could unintentionally open a loophole for abuse. I \nunderstand that the Senator from Connecticut is also concerned about \nthis and that he does not want any unintended consequences of his \namendment which would allow for more bankruptcy abuse.\n  Accordingly, I intend to continue working to improve this amendment \nso that it accomplishes its goal without giving crooks an opportunity \nto hide and shield their assets during bankruptcy proceedings.\n  I had similar concerns about the amendment that Senator Hatch offered \nto protect retirement savings. I think we worked hard and good and \naccomplished a lot with Senator Hatch to tighten up that amendment.\n  As a result, the amendment that we passed to protect the retirement \naccounts is better and less subject to abuse. I am sure that we can \nimprove the amendment by Senator Dodd in the same way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask my colleague to yield for a minute on \nthat point, if I could. Let me again thank him for his courtesies and \nhis staff's courtesies over the last number of days in working this \nout. He has made a very good point. What we will certainly try to do \nhere--and I agree with him--is to see to it that this amendment, the \nsafeguard aspects of it, conform in many ways--exactly, if it is not \nthe case--with the retirement savings accounts since both are parallel \nideas. I have instructed my staff to work with the Senator's staff to \niron out those details, to check this out thoroughly. Obviously, I \nthink we all agree this is needed to protect the long-term education \nneeds of families, but obviously--and I want to state it very clearly--\nit certainly also is our intention to see to it that people are not \ngiven an opportunity to avoid their responsibilities when it comes to \ntheir financial matters. So we think we can do that pretty effectively.\n  My intention and that of the Senator from Iowa is to see that it is \ndone before this bill goes to the President for his signature. I thank \nhim again for his support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We will yield back the time, if there is any on this \nside, on this Dodd amendment.\n\n[[Page S10742]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. I yield back the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Dodd amendment \nNo. 3614 is agreed to and the motion to reconsider the vote is laid \nupon the table.\n  The amendment (No. 3614) was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3599 to Amendment No. 3559\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding misuse of the \n              homestead exemption to the bankruptcy laws)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWisconsin, Mr. Kohl, is recognized to offer an amendment under a time \nlimit of 10 minutes under his control and 5 minutes under the control \nof the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Chair.\n  Today I rise to offer an amendment to reaffirm the Senate's \ncommitment to cap the homestead exemption. The Kohl-Sessions homestead \ncap is already in the bill, but a sense of the Senate on this issue is \nimportant. It sends a message to the House, which does not have a \nhomestead cap in its bill, that this provision is essential to \nmeaningful bankruptcy reform. The $100,000 cap in the homestead \nexemption is a bipartisan measure I offered with Senator Sessions which \nwas endorsed by Senator Grassley and was approved unanimously in \nsubcommittee. It also has the endorsement of the congressionally \nappointed National Bankruptcy Review Commission.\n  Our bipartisan measure closes a loophole that allows too many debtors \nto keep their luxury homes while their legitimate creditors, such as \nchildren, ex-spousal alimony, State governments, universities, \nretailers, and banks, get left out in the cold. Currently, five \nStates--Florida, Texas, Kansas, Iowa, and South Dakota--allow debtors \nto protect their homes no matter how high their value. And time after \ntime, millionaire debtors take advantage of this loophole by moving to \nexpensive homes in these States, especially Florida and Texas, and then \ndeclare bankruptcy, yet continue to live in a style which is not \nappropriate to their circumstances. Let me give you just a few \nexamples.\n  A failed Ohio savings and loan owner, who was convicted of securities \nfraud, wrote off almost $300 million in bankruptcy claims but still \nheld onto the multimillion-dollar ranch that he bought in Florida. A \nconvicted Wall Street financier filed bankruptcy while owing at least \n$50 million in debts and fines but still kept his $5 million mansion \nwith 11 bedrooms and 21 bathrooms. After his law firm went bankrupt and \ncreditors were already in the process of seizing his two homes in the \nNew York area, former Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn fled to a new $1 \nmillion home in Florida although he and his partners were on the line \nfor $100 million. This may not be the most common abuse of the \nbankruptcy system but it is the most egregious. And given this record, \nit is not surprising to hear complaints that bankruptcy is no longer \nused as a tool of last resort and that it has become just another kind \nof financial planning. If we really want to restore the stigma attached \nto bankruptcy, these high-profile abuses are the best places to start.\n  Mr. President, our $100,000 homestead cap will stop these abuses, and \nunless we keep it in the bill in conference we will not really have \nbankruptcy reform at all, in my opinion. So I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this resolution.\n  At this point I send my amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3599 to Amendment No. 3559.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE HOMESTEAD \n                   EXEMPTION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) one of the most flagrant abuses of the bankruptcy \n     system involves misuse of the homestead exemption, which \n     allows a debtor to exempt his or her home, up to a certain \n     value, as established by State law, from being sold off to \n     satisfy debts;\n       (2) while the vast majority of States responsibly cap the \n     exemption at not more than $40,000, 5 States exempt homes \n     regardless of their value;\n       (3) in the few States with unlimited homestead exemptions, \n     debtors can shield their assets in luxury homes while \n     legitimate creditors get little or nothing;\n       (4) beneficiaries of the homestead exemption include \n     convicted insider traders and savings and loan criminals, \n     while shortchanged creditors include children, spouses, \n     governments, and banks; and\n       (5) the homestead exemption should be capped at $100,000 to \n     prevent such high-profile abuses.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) meaningful bankruptcy reform cannot be achieved without \n     capping the homestead exemption; and\n       (2) bankruptcy reform legislation should include a cap of \n     $100,000 on the homestead exemption to the bankruptcy laws.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. I believe that Senator Sessions is prepared to come down to \nthe floor to talk on behalf of this amendment, and while he is on his \nway I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, before that happens, could I have the \nfloor, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his request?\n  Mr. KOHL. I will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. First of all, before I speak on this amendment, I want \nto make clear that everybody in this body ought to know that this issue \nis before us both as part of the bill and now on a motion to instruct \nbecause of the hard work of the Senator from Wisconsin. He is to be \ncommended for that because there is abuse in this area and our bill \nreflects that.\n  So I say to the other 99 Members of this body--and also it would \ninclude people who are helping Senator Kohl on this amendment--Senator \nKohl should be recognized as a leader in this area to bring some \nuniformity to our bankruptcy code among the 50 States to stop a very \nserious abuse. I have been trying to work with the Senator from \nWisconsin, supporting his amendment to cap homesteads since he offered \nthat amendment in the subcommittee markup. In fact, he was the very \nfirst Senator to be recognized in our subcommittee when we had the \nmarkup of this bill. He was successful there.\n  In the last Congress, I accepted Senator Kohl's amendment to cap \nhomesteads at $500,000. This principle actually passed the Senate \nunanimously at the end of the 104th Congress, but the House failed to \nact on the technical corrections bill to which the homestead matter was \nattached.\n  In this Congress, the idea of capping homesteads is a genuine \nbipartisan one, and I know both the Senator from Wisconsin and the \njunior Senator from Alabama are strong supporters of the $100,000 cap \ncurrently in this bill. But the fact is that the other body has passed \na bill which does not have homestead caps. In other words, we have a \nkey difference between House and Senate bills on this point.\n  Obviously, I support the Senate bill, which I have worked on so hard \nwith Senator Durbin, but I don't want to go into the conference \nsituation with my hands tied in any way. Some have tried to get me to \ndo this on other provisions in this legislation, and to do so prior to \nconference. I have resisted all efforts in this area. I am compelled to \nresist this effort of instructing conferees. However, I am not going to \nobject to this sense of the Senate going into my bill since it restates \nwhat is already in the legislation, and I think that restatement is a \nperfectly legitimate thing for us to do this way. And so from that \nstandpoint, I compliment Senator Kohl for his continued hard work and \nhis efforts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. I yield to Senator Durbin.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  I thank the Senator from Wisconsin and I rise in strong support of \nhis resolution.\n  Let's understand what we are talking about. We decided long ago that \nif a person filed bankruptcy, we would allow them to protect certain \nthings that we considered essential, and one of those things was a \nhome. Now, of course, that is understandable; 50 percent of the people \nfiling for bankruptcy are homeowners; but we left it to the States to \ncome up with the amount of money that your home could be worth, and you \ncould exempt it.\n\n[[Page S10743]]\n\n  As a consequence, with 50 different States, we have basically 50 \ndifferent approaches. Some of these approaches, unfortunately, have led \nto abuse. The Senator from Wisconsin described two or three cases where \npeople literally owed millions of dollars and quickly raced out to buy \na multimillion-dollar home to put everything they could into it and to \nbasically guard it away from any creditor in bankruptcy. I do not think \nthat is what we had in mind when we put the homestead exemption in \nplace. It was a legitimate effort to protect someone's home.\n  I see the Senator from Alabama has taken the floor. I congratulate \nhim, Senator Sessions, as well as Senator Kohl for their leadership \nhere.\n  Let me tell you why I think this is important. The idea behind this \nbill was to stop the abuses in bankruptcy. Professor Elizabeth Warren \nof Harvard Law School, whom I have really come to respect for her \nknowledge of this subject, calls the disparity among State homestead \nexemptions ``the biggest single scandal in the consumer bankruptcy \nsystem.''\n  To think, in the instance of a doctor in Miami who refused to carry \nmalpractice insurance, who was sued by four different people, one of \nthem a person who lost a leg, and then when they went to collect \nagainst the doctor personally, because he had no insurance, he \nbasically hid behind the homestead exemption and said, ``Everything I \nown is in my home and you cannot touch it''--that really is an abuse of \nthe system. I am glad Senator Sessions and Senator Kohl have shown \nleadership on this and I am happy to support their efforts.\n  Mr. KOHL. Does Senator Sessions wish to speak?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kohl and Senator Durbin \nfor their leadership and commitment on this issue and others. This is \nsimply a matter of fairness. The Constitution of the United States \nauthorizes the bankruptcy system and provides for Congress to establish \nuniform bankruptcy laws. That is a matter that is without dispute. All \nbankruptcy cases are held in Federal court. It is not too much to ask, \nsince we set every other rule involving bankruptcy, that this body \nwould consider the abuses that arise from the disparity in treatment of \nhomesteads throughout the country. It is really a shocking matter.\n  The New York Times has written about this on a number of occasions \nand has given some of the examples that are afoot.\n\n       The First American Bank and Trust Company in Lake Worth, \n     FL, closed in 1989, and its chief executive, Roy Talmo, filed \n     for personal bankruptcy in 1993. Despite owing $6.8 million, \n     Mr. Talmo was able to exempt a bounty of assets. During the \n     proceedings, he drove around Miami in a Rolls-Royce and \n     tended the grounds of his $800,000 tree farm in Boynton \n     Beach. Never one to slum it, Mr. Talmo had a 7,000 square-\n     foot mansion with five fireplaces, 16th century European \n     doors and a Spanish-style courtyard, all on a 30-acre lot. \n     Yet in Mr. Talmo's estimation, this was chintzy. He also \n     owned an adjacent 112 acres and he tried to add those acres \n     to his homestead.\n\n  The court finally refused to allow this 112 acres, but he was able to \nkeep his homestead, live in this huge house, and keep all this money \nthat ought to have been shared with his creditors. Bankruptcy is to \nhelp people start over again. It is not to help them defeat their \ncreditors and remain millionaires.\n  There is example after example in this New York Times article. \nTalmadge Wayne Tinsley maintained his house during bankruptcy and then \nhe sold his house for $3.5 million, using the proceeds to write a check \nto the Internal Revenue Service and another one to pay off the \nmortgage. That left him $700,000 after closing costs and other expenses \nwere deducted from the proceeds.\n  In other words, if you have a multimillion-dollar mansion and go into \nbankruptcy, you put all your money--except what is in your house--into \nthe bankruptcy pot that trickles out to the people to whom you owe \nmoney. You keep the house. As soon as your bankruptcy is over, you can \nturn around and sell this multimillion-dollar house and live like a \nking. That is why people are moving to Florida and Texas on the eve of \nfiling bankruptcy.\n  I live in Alabama. We have a very low homestead exemption, but it is \nonly 50 miles from my home of Mobile to Pensacola, FL. Somebody from \nMobile could easily move to Pensacola, buy a huge beach home, and then \ndefraud his Alabama creditors.\n  Some think this is a State matter. Senator Kohl talked about this. \nThey say it is an advantage to the State. But the truth is, 90 percent \nof the people who abuse this system on the homestead--90 percent of \ntheir debts are going to be debts in their own State. So really it is a \nsituation in which we have some Senators who are supposedly protecting \nState interests, but really they are not. I encourage these Senators to \nthink about it. They are not protecting State interests because what \nthis does is allow a scandal to take place. The people who most \nfrequent lose in this process will be the lenders in their own States. \nThat is just not fair. I believe the Bankruptcy Commission has listed \nthis as one of their top priorities for reform.\n  I can see how some Senators may not really be familiar with the \nbankruptcy process and might think they want to preserve their State \nsystems. But bankruptcy is a classical Federal matter. It is set forth \nin the Constitution as a Federal matter. All bankruptcy cases are \nhandled in Federal court, not State courts, and the bankruptcy court \nsets all the rules in almost every category. This is just one that we \nhave, by tradition, allowed to be nonuniform. As a matter of fact, it \nhas been challenged in the Supreme Court, on the basis that the \nnonuniformity violates the Constitution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kohl for his leadership.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I end by suggesting this is a very important \npiece of legislation. I am concerned, if we do not have it in the final \npiece of legislation, that the administration will veto the Bankruptcy \nReform Act. So I stress, we need to see to it that the conference \nreport contains this homestead cap of $100,000.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 1 minute 30 seconds.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. Under the previous \norder, the Kohl amendment, No. 3599, is agreed to. The motion to \nreconsider the vote is laid upon the table.\n  The amendment (No. 3599) was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3615 to Amendment No. 3559\n\n (Purpose: To provide for a study and report by the Board of Governors \n   of the Federal Reserve System regarding credit industry practices)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The hour of 10 a.m. having arrived, under the \nprevious order, the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, is \nrecognized to speak for up to 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Durbin, Senator \nJeffords, and myself, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to considering this \namendment at this time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for herself, \n     Mr. Durbin and Mr. Jeffords, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3615 to amendment no. 3559.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title VII, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC.     . ENCOURAGING CREDITWORTHINESS.\n\n       (a) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that--\n       (1) certain lenders may sometimes offer credit to consumers \n     indiscriminately, without taking steps to ensure that \n     consumers are capable of repaying the resulting debt, and in \n     a manner which may encourage certain consumers to accumulate \n     additional debt; and\n       (2) resulting consumer debt may increasingly be a major \n     contributing factor to consumer insolvency.\n\n[[Page S10744]]\n\n       (b) Study Required.--The Board of Governors of the Federal \n     Reserve System (hereafter in this section referred to as the \n     ``Board'') shall conduct a study of--\n       (1) consumer credit industry practices of soliciting and \n     extending credit--\n       (A) indiscriminately;\n       (B) without taking steps to ensure that consumers are \n     capable of repaying the resulting debt; and\n       (C) in a manner that encourages consumers to accumulate \n     additional debt; and\n       (2) the effects of such practices on consumer debt and \n     insolvency.\n       (c) Report and Regulations.--Not later than 24 months after \n     the date of enactment of this Act, the Board--\n       (1) shall make public a report on its findings with respect \n     to the credit industry's indiscriminate solicitation and \n     extension of credit;\n       (2) may issue regulations that would require additional \n     disclosures to consumers; and\n       (3) may take any other actions, consistent with its \n     existing statutory authority, that the Board finds necessary \n     to ensure responsible industrywide practices and to prevent \n     resulting consumer debt and insolvency.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I support S. 1301, and intend to vote \nfor its passage. It gives bankruptcy judges the tools they need to \nrequire that capable debtors take responsibility for their debts. \nFurthermore, it does so in a manner that empowers bankruptcy judges to \nseek solutions to consumer insolvency, rather than straitjacketing them \nwith a strict formula. Finally, S. 1301 contains strengthened \nprovisions to protect the priority of child support and spousal \nsupport, which I supported in the Judiciary Committee.\n  Responsibility cannot be a one-way street, however. The blame for the \ncurrent record number of consumer bankruptcies lies not only with \nunsound consumer spending habits, but often with unwise and \nirresponsible lending practices that facilitate and even foster such \nrecklessness. This amendment aims to deter such recklessness in credit \npractices.\n  It authorizes the Federal Reserve Board to conduct a study of \nindustry practices of soliciting and extending credit indiscriminately, \nwithout taking steps to ensure that consumers are capable of repaying \ntheir debt, or in a manner that encourages consumers to accumulate \nadditional debt. The Federal Reserve Board is further authorized to \nstudy the effects of such practices on consumer debt and insolvency.\n  Within two years of enactment, the Federal Reserve Board will make \npublic a report on its findings, regarding the credit industry's \nindiscriminate solicitation and extension of credit.\n  The amendment allows the Federal Reserve Board to issue regulations \nthat would require additional disclosures to consumers, and to take any \nother actions, consistent with its statutory authority, that the board \nfinds necessary to ensure responsible industrywide practices and to \nprevent resulting consumer debt and insolvency.\n  This amendment directly addresses one of the major causes of personal \nbankruptcies: bad consumer debt.\n  It's a simple matter of arithmetic. The typical family filing \nbankruptcy in 1997 owed more than one-and-a-half times its annual \nincome in short-term, high interest debt. This means that the average \nfamily in bankruptcy, with a median income of just over $17,500, had \n$26,500 in credit card and other short-term, high interest debt.\n  Studies by the Congressional Budget Office, the FDIC, and independent \neconomists all link the rise in personal bankruptcies directly to the \nrise in consumer debt.\n  Last year, the credit card industry sent out a record 3.1 billion \nunsolicited offers. That's 30 solicitations to every household in \nAmerica. The number of solicitations jumped 20% last year alone. Based \non industry estimates, between 1992 and 1996, credit card companies \noffered about a million dollars of credit to every household in the \nUnited States.\n  There are well over a billion cards in circulation--a dozen credit \ncards for every household in the country. Three-quarters of all \nhouseholds have a least one credit card, and three out of four of them \nalso carry credit card debt from month to month.\n  Not surprisingly, credit card debt has increased accordingly. Credit \ncard debt doubled between 1993 and 1997: The amount of credit card debt \noutstanding at the end of 1997 was $422 billion, twice as much as the \namount in 1993.\n  Credit card usage has grown fastest in recent years among debtors \nwith the lowest incomes. Since the early 1990's, Americans with incomes \nbelow the poverty level nearly doubled their credit card usage, and \nthose in the $10,000-25,000 income bracket came in a close second in \nthe rise in debt. The result is not surprising: 27% of the under-\n$10,000 families have consumer debt that is more than 40% of their \nincome. Nearly one in ten has at least one debt that is more than sixty \ndays past due. These are the families for whom real income has actually \ndeclined since 1989.\n  Credit card issuers earn about 75% of their revenues from the \ninterest paid by borrowers who do not pay in full each month. Several \ncompanies have instituted charges or even canceled credit cards for \ncustomers who pay in full each month, preferring customers with large \ncredit balances who pay minimum monthly payments.\n  As bankruptcy levels have risen, total credit card profitability has \ngrown--credit card lending is now twice as profitable as all other \nlending activities. In the third quarter of 1997, credit card banks \nshowed a 2.59% return on assets, compared to a 1.22% return on assets \nreported by all commercial banks.\n  This amendment most likely would not affect the vast majority of the \ncredit card industry, who responsibly check consumer credit history \nbefore issuing or ``pre-approving'' credit cards. Representatives of \nlarge credit card issuers such as Bank of America have assured me and \nmy staff that they do not provide credit cards to consumers without a \nthorough credit history check.\n  However, I should note that every credit card issuer that I and my \nstaff spoke with said that one thing they do not check is income. In \nother words, credit card issuers have no idea whether persons to whom \nthey issue credit cards have the means to pay their bills each month.\n  Furthermore, major credit cards such as Visa and Mastercard do not \nrequire banks who issue their cards to check credit history.\n  This bill would affect lenders who fail to even inquire into a \nconsumer's ability to pay, or those who specifically target consumers \nwho can't or won't repay balances.\n  A growing segment of the credit industry known as ``sub-prime'' \nlenders increasingly searches for risky borrowers, who they know will \nmake inappropriately low minimum monthly payments, carry large monthly \nbalances from month to month, and pay high interest rates. Such lending \nhas become the fastest growing, most-profitable subset of consumer \nlending. Although losses are substantial, interest rates of 18 to 40% \non credit card debt make this lending profitable.\n  Many of these often relatively unsophisticated borrowers don't \nrealize that minimum monthly payments just put them deeper in a hole, \nwhich in many cases leads to bankruptcy. For example, industry analysts \nestimate that, using a typical minimum monthly payment rate on a credit \ncard, in order to pay off a $2,500 balance--assuming the consumer never \nused the card to charge anything else ever again--it would take 34 \nyears to pay off the balance, and total payments would exceed 300% of \nthe original principal.\n  The FDIC observes that by marketing high-risk debt to customers who \nare at substantial risk for non-payment, credit card issuers have \ncontributed to the rise in consumer bankruptcies.\n  On May 2, 1997, the FDIC issued warnings to banks about the risks \nposed by increased subprime lending. Some industry analysts predict \nthat overall loan default rates will double by the year 2001 and thus \nwarn that ``by lowering their credit standards and saturating the \nmarket with loans, many banks will be unable to avoid potentially \nenormous delinquencies and write-offs.''\n  Subprime lending is growing even among reputable lenders. Senator \nLauch Faircloth, who notes that he ``abhors . . . constraints on the \nprivate sector,'' recently stated about the subprime market: ``We have \nvery reputable, very fine institutions, spinning off subsidiaries to \nget into what I would consider very precarious, reckless, bordering on \nsleazebag lending.''\n  Since the Senate Judiciary Committee considered this bill in June, I \nhave received examples from constituents of credit card companies who \noffer credit\n\n[[Page S10745]]\n\ncards to persons who are wholly unable to afford them. I have also had \nmy staff review solicitations they have received.\n  I want to give you some examples of the sort of inappropriate credit \ncard solicitations my constituents and my staff have received.\n  A constituent from San Ramon, CA, wrote that her 7-year old son \nreceived a ``charter membership offer'' for a Visa Signature Card. The \nconstituent writes:\n\n       If banks are offering bankcards to small children, who else \n     (or what else) are they offering them to. This kind of \n     unsolicited mail is ridiculous.\n\n  This is not an isolated occurrence. Both sons of a staff member who \nworks in my San Francisco office received credit card offers--and \nthey're 12 and 15 years old. The 12-year-old is an eighth grader, with \nno income other than a $25 a month allowance and gifts from his \ngrandmother and holiday and birthday gifts. He is a Star Trek fan, and \nhe was offered a ``Star Trek Platinum Plus MasterCard,'' with up to \n$100,000 in credit. The card features discounts on Star Trek \nmerchandise and entertainment events. The solicitation noted an \nintroductory 3.9 percent annual percentage rate in large, bold print. \nThe small print on the back explains that the rate applies only to \ninitial balance transfers and cash advance checks. The actual annual \npercentage rate is 14.99 percent.\n  The 12-year-old's 15-year-old brother was also offered a credit line \nof up to $100,000 on the ``First USA Platinum MasterCard for Science \nFiction Enthusiasts.'' This card offered a free space pen and a 9.99 \npercent ``fixed'' annual percentage rate. The small print explained \nthat if payment is received ``late'' twice in any 6-month period, the \nannual percentage rate balloons to 19.99 percent. If payment is not \nreceived for 2 consecutive months, the rate balloons further to 22.99 \npercent.\n  It's not just children. A constituent from Lakewood, CA, wrote to me \nlast month:\n\n       I am sending to you [a solicitation] which I received in \n     the mail yesterday. It was addressed to my mother and was \n     offering her a platinum credit card with a $100,000 credit \n     line. What's wrong with this? My mother's been dead for seven \n     years!\n\n  The constituent continues:\n\n       What really bugs me about this is that credit card \n     companies send out these solicitations for their plastic \n     cards and then when they get burned, they start crying foul. \n     They want all kinds of laws passed to protect them from \n     taking hits when it's their own practices that caused the \n     problem.\n\n  A 22-year-old constituent from Pacifica, CA, who makes $25,000 a \nyear, was offered 3 platinum cards with a credit limit of up to \n$100,000 on each card. Two of the cards advertised in large, bold \nprint, ``introductory'' annual percentage rates of 3.9 percent for cash \nadvance checks and balance transfers. The fine print on both cards \ndisclosed the actual annual percentage rates on purchases of 14.99 \npercent. The other card offered free mileage on US Airways. The fine \nprint disclosed its annual percentage rate as 18.4 percent; 21.9 \npercent if the account is in default.\n  Another constituent, also from Pacifica, CA, who is unemployed, was \noffered a platinum card with an up to $50,000 credit line. As with a \nnumber of these offers, the solicitation boldly advertised an \n``introductory'' annual percentage rate of 3.9 percent for cash advance \nchecks and balance transfers, but the fine print on both cards \ndisclosed the actual annual percentage rate on purchases of 14.99 \npercent. The other card offered free mileage on US Airways.\n  Besides low introductory interest rates, which inevitably balloon, \nand frequent flier miles, the range of gifts offered to induce people \nto take on new credit cards is incredible. In the past couple of months \nthat I have been asking my staff to save solicitations, ``free'' gifts \noffered to them--and to me--to take on new credit cards, have included \neverything from: free telephone calling cards, to transistor radios, \nattache cases, Godiva chocolates, Waterford crystal, and electronic \norganizers.\n  And the credit card companies are anything if not persistent. Over \nthe past couple months, one of my staff members has received 4 offers \nfor second mortgages, totaling $75,000 in credit, one of which was sent \ntwice; $230,000 in credit, with free gifts as incentives; and a \n``college alumni'' card, offering a ``third opportunity'' to apply.\n  These sort of come-on's, targeting people who oftentimes are simply \nincapable of affording the credit card, are by no means unique to \nCalifornians.\n  Bankruptcy Judge John Akard of the Northern District of Texas wrote \nthat the attorneys for one couple who filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy asked \nthem to record solicitations received after filing for bankruptcy. The \nreceived over 50 solicitations over the next 24 months, offering \ncumulatively over $2 million in credit; 25 of these were ``pre-\napproved.''\n  Consumer bankruptcy attorneys tell my staff that some companies send \ncredit cards to bankruptcy filers courtesy of their bankruptcy \nattorneys.\n  In fact, a staff member informed me that when he did pro bono work \nfor indigent people filing bankruptcy, the pro bono attorneys had to \nconstantly tell the bankruptcy filers not to take on new credit cards, \nwhich credit card companies targeted to them, knowing that they could \nnot disavow their debt for a period of six years following bankruptcy.\n  In many cases, credit cards offered to consumers who have no ability \nto repay them and no reason having them is a direct cause of personal \nbankruptcy. The U.S. Bankruptcy Trustee for the Southern District of \nCalifornia provided my office with some examples, taken directly from \nthe rolls of recent bankruptcy filers in San Diego: One bankruptcy \nfiler had $41,989 in debt, run up on 25 retail and credit cards--but \nonly $17,520 in yearly income; another bankruptcy filer, had $23,826 in \ndebt, run up on 6 credit cards and 7 retail cards--and only $4,320 in \nyearly income; still another bankruptcy filer had $28,054 in debt, run \nup on 6 credit cards and 9 retail cards, but only $11,520 in yearly \nincome; and in the most egregious case, one filer had $97,372 in debt, \nrun up on a total of 26 cards--13 credit cards and 13 retail cards--and \nhad no yearly income. Another filer had over $50,000 in debt run up on \n7 credit cards--and no yearly income.\n  Similarly, the United States Trustee for the Northern District of \nCalifornia provided my office with a case study of some of the recent \nbankruptcy cases filed in San Francisco; a ``naturopath'' with an \nannual income of $8,100, accumulated $44,690 in credit card debt, on 13 \ncredit cards before declaring bankruptcy; a truck driver with $22,368 \nin annual income, accumulated $102,645 in credit card debt on 14 credit \ncards before declaring bankruptcy; an unemployed person with no annual \nincome, accumulated $50,927 in debt on 14 different credit cards before \ndeclaring bankruptcy; and the list goes on.\n  U.S. bankruptcy trustees have also provided my office with letter \nafter letter, originally sent by U.S. bankruptcy panel trustees to \ncreditors, alleging ``bad faith'' on behalf of consumers, because the \ndebtor accumulated credit card debts they could have had no realistic \nexpectation of repaying. For example, one letter notes that the debtor \naccumulated over $110,635 in credit card debt, but had $500 in monthly \nincome, and had incurred a net loss in income in 1996 and 1997.\n  If the consumer acted in bad faith, one wonders about the faith of \nthe credit card companies that issued the credit cards in the first \nplace and allowed the consumer to continue to accumulate debt.\n  Obviously, in each of these cases, banks kept on issuing credit \ncards, and kept on allowing consumers to rack up still more debt on the \ncards, despite clear evidence that the consumer would never be able to \nrepay the debt.\n  During the debate on this bill, we have heard much about the \nfinancial burden that consumer bankruptcies levy on each of us as \nconsumers. Clearly, part of the responsibility for that financial \nburden rests with the credit card companies and retailers who \nirresponsibly continue to issue credit in such cases. Indeed, industry \nconsultants have estimated that credit card companies could cut their \nbankruptcy losses by more than 50% if they would institute minimal \ncredit screening.\n  As I mentioned at the outset, I support S. 1301, which gives \nbankruptcy judges effective tools to require responsible behavior from \ndebtors once bankruptcies occur. This amendment is necessary to promote \nthe responsible behavior needed to prevent such bankruptcies from \noccurring in the first\n\n[[Page S10746]]\n\nplace, by preventing the runaway consumer debt that is one of the \nprincipal causes of the rise in personal bankruptcies.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the adoption of this amendment.\n  I end my comments with one statement: Responsibility is a two-way \nstreet. And what is sauce for the gander is also sauce for the credit \ncard company.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that the amendment has been \naccepted by both sides.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this amendment will be accepted. And I \nwould like to say, after listening to Senator Feinstein's statement, as \nwell as studying the legislation in great detail, we can \nenthusiastically back this and fight for its retention in conference as \nwell. I was not that certain when I visited with the Senator privately, \nbut I would like to state publicly that we think she has a very good \nidea here and that we can work to keep it in conference. I cannot \nguarantee anything, but at least I feel very strongly about it.\n  It kind of backs up some of the things that we have done on \ndisclosure in the managers' amendment as well. Those things will \nprobably be much more controversial in conference than what the Senator \nfrom California is trying to do. She, from my standpoint, through the \nyear that we have worked on this legislation, and being prodded also by \nthe Senator from Illinois about the problems that we have or the \npotential problems we have with credit card companies, and they not \nbeing too careful in their anticipation of who they take on to give \ncredit to, does back up the study that the Senator from California has \ncalled for.\n  She does not give new statutory authority to the Federal Reserve. She \ndoes give the Federal Reserve authority, after the study, if the \nFederal Reserve wants to do it, to issue regulations that would require \nadditional disclosure to consumers, then, within their existing \nstatutory authority, if the board finds necessary, ``to ensure \nresponsible industrywide practices and to prevent resulting consumer \ndebt and insolvency.''\n  This is all based upon a study which we believe, based upon our \nyear's consideration of this legislation, probably is a very worthwhile \nthing for us to have and to promote. So with those ideas in mind, we \naccept the amendment and congratulate the Senator from California. Most \nimportantly, we thank her for her cooperative attitude toward our \nresolving a lot of differences we have had with her original \nlegislation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any further debate on Feinstein \namendment No. 3615?\n  Hearing none, the question is on agreeing to the amendment No. 3615.\n  The amendment (No. 3615) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I move to reconsider the vote and to lay that motion on \nthe table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks on the \nConsumer Bankruptcy Reform Act, which is the pending business at this \npoint in time.\n  I commend the hard work of Senator Grassley and the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee for crafting this much-needed reform of our bankruptcy laws. \nBankruptcy filings rose to almost 1.4 million last year. That is up \nfrom 172,000 in just 1978--enormous growth in bankruptcy filings. More \nthan 70 percent of those who filed for bankruptcy last year did so \nunder chapter 7 of the U.S. bankruptcy code, which erases most debt \nincurred.\n  The cost of these bankruptcies to the U.S. economy last year has been \nestimated at more than $44 billion--enormous cost. And these losses are \npassed on to consumers, costing every household that pays its bills \n$400 in hidden taxes. That is not fair to the millions of families who \npay their bills--mortgages, car loans, student loans, and credit card \ntabs--every month.\n  This legislation goes a long way in addressing the fraud and abuse of \nour bankruptcy system while ensuring that people who are in \nconsiderable economic pain will be protected.\n  However, I am extremely concerned about a provision in this bill \nwhich places a cap on the homestead exemption. My State of Kansas has a \nhomestead law in our State constitution dating back to 1859. Many \nfarmers have used this law during times of economic hardship to protect \ntheir farms, their homes and their 160 acres. While the Consumer \nBankruptcy Reform Act exempts family farmers from the homestead \nprovision, many small farmers would not qualify under the bankruptcy \ncode as a family farm because they or their spouse earn off-farm \ntaxable income.\n  I might note for my fellow Members that over half of the people \ninvolved in agriculture today in my State and in many States across the \ncountry have considerable off-farm income from either themselves or \ntheir spouses and yet are full-time involved in agriculture. They have \nthe outside income for various numbers of reasons, but this provision \nwill not allow them to qualify for that agricultural exemption, the \nfamily farm exemption, if it remains as we have it in this particular \nact.\n  Many farming States have similar homestead laws dating back \nfrequently to the time of statehood and of the settling of many places \nin the Midwest, where people could keep their home and 160 acres if \nthey would just settle this land for a period of 5 years. That is the \nbasis of this homestead law. This provision that is in the bankruptcy \ncode and the changes that we have before us today could have a \nsignificant impact on farmers who are already faced with cash flow \nproblems caused by low commodity prices.\n  This bill also does not take into consideration the vastly different \nproperty values in various States that will be affected by this \nparticular homestead provision.\n  While I believe we should prevent fraud and abuse of our bankruptcy \nsystem, preempting State homestead laws and imposing a one-size-fits-\nall approach is not the answer. I hope that my colleagues will consider \nthis as we look forward in dealing with this provision and working \ntogether with the House to get a fine Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act \nput together. We should not penalize, we should not usurp, the States \nthat have put forward a particular homestead exemption.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I understand debate on the Harkin \namendment was to begin at 11 a.m.?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that the full 45 minutes allowed \nfor debate on the Harkin amendment begin now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, Senator Harkin is on his way. He spoke \nbriefly on this amendment yesterday afternoon, and I would like to make \na couple comments on it. This amendment is very simple. It is an \namendment that expresses the sense of Congress that the Federal Reserve \nBoard, through the Federal Open Market Committee, should reduce its \nFederal funds rate. The Federal Reserve Board will meet soon and \nconsider once again what it wishes to do with monetary policy, and \nespecially with short-term interest rates.\n  I would like to show a couple of charts just to describe where we are \nat this point with the American economy.\n  ``Consumer Price Index.'' As we know, the Federal Reserve Board has\n\n[[Page S10747]]\n\nbeen chasing inflation now for, oh, 4 years or so. Every quarter they \nhave another discussion and wring their hands and gnash their teeth and \nfret and worry and sweat about what is happening to inflation and when \nthe next wave of inflation is going to hit. Of course, inflation has \ngone down, down, way down.\n  The Federal Reserve Board told us, by the way, at the start of this, \nthat the inflation rate would jump up almost certainly if the \nunemployment rate went below 6 percent. Of course, the unemployment \nrate has been below 6 percent for over 4 years and the inflation rate \nkeeps coming down. The Federal Reserve Board was dead wrong on that \nissue.\n  But the Federal Reserve Board sits in that house of theirs on a hill \nimpenetrable by the American public, closes its doors, makes its \ndecisions in secret about interest rates. Only, and then tells us after \nthe decisions are made what the interest rates in this country will be.\n  The Federal funds rate set by the Federal Reserve's Open Market \nCommittee is much higher than it ought to be. Prior to Mr. Greenspan \nbecoming Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, from 1950 to 1987, the \naverage real Federal funds rate was 1.8 percent; for 37 years on \naverage. The real Federal funds rate, the economic rent for money, \nadjusted for inflation, that was set by the Federal Reserve Board, was \n1.8 percent. Today that short-term interest rate, after inflation, is \n3.9 percent--the highest level since just before the last recession in \n1990.\n  One must ask the question, Why, why are the American people in effect \nbeing taxed with higher interest rates? Why is the Federal Reserve \nBoard punishing the American people with interest rates that are higher \nthan they should be? The answer: Because they have served their \nconstituent interests, which are the large money center banks; they \nwant the higher interest rates. But that moves against the interests of \nthe American people, of the people who produce and work and borrow.\n  I have brought to the floor from time to time pictures of the Federal \nReserve Board of Governors and the presidents of the regional Fed \nbanks, and the reason I have done that is because they control monetary \npolicy and nobody knows who they are. So I thought we should probably \nhave pictures of all of them, when they were appointed, where they were \neducated, what their background is, and how much money they make. And \nso here, once again, is a picture of the Federal Reserve Board of \nGovernors and the regional Fed bank presidents. On a rotating basis, \nthese regional Fed bank presidents join the board of governors, they go \ninto a room, shut the door, and in secret determine what our interest \nrates are going to be in this country. Here is who they are. You could \nput them all in a barrel, shake it up, roll it downhill, and you would \nalways have somebody with a gray suit on top. They are economists. They \nall come from the same background. They all pretty much look the same, \nand they all pretty much think the same. There is not a person among \nthem who represents somebody who manufactures something or fixes \nsomething or sells something, but that is the way the Fed is.\n\n  When I was a kid in a town of 300 people in southwestern North \nDakota, we had a circus come to town. That circus--it was a very small \ncircus because you do not get a big top in a town of 300 people--but \nthat circus had an elephant. It was the first elephant I had ever seen, \nand the first elephant, I think, that had ever come to my hometown. The \nthing that interested me as a little boy is that that big old elephant \nwould stand out there by the tent and he had a steel cuff around his \nfoot and a chain of about 6 or 8 feet attached to a stake that was \npounded into the ground. I thought to myself, how on Earth can that \nlittle stake hold that big elephant? How can that work?\n  Then I was told later, when I grew up, about that elephant and that \nchain and that stake. They say that when they capture wild elephants in \nThailand, they get a wild elephant and they put a big metal cuff around \nthe elephant's leg, put a chain on that cuff, and then they tie the \nother end of that chain to a big banyan tree. And for 6 days, 10 days, \n12 days, maybe 2 weeks that elephant will pull and struggle and grunt \nand groan and try to pull that chain away from that big banyan tree. Of \ncourse the banyan tree doesn't budge an inch. After a certain period of \ntime, the elephant understands that the elephant cannot move. Then they \ntake the chain off the banyan tree and just put a stake in the ground \nand the elephant stands there with a cuff around his leg and a chain \nand a small stake. The elephant is chained to his habit. His habit is \nhe knows he cannot move.\n  I was thinking about that the other day and I was thinking about the \nFederal Reserve Board. What a wonderful analogy, chained to his habit. \nYou talk about a board chained to their habits, the Federal Reserve \nBoard has been, for 4 or 5 years--despite all the evidence to the \ncontrary in this country that the global economy is putting downward \npressure on wages, that there are no new fires of inflation out there \nin the country, that the inflation rate is coming down even as the \nunemployment rate has come down. These gray-suited folks, chained to \ntheir old habits, have continued to insist, no, they must keep interest \nrates higher than they ought to be because they are worried about some \nfuture specter of inflation despite the fact that inflation is running \nin the opposite direction.\n  What does that mean? What does it mean when these folks lock their \ndoors and in secret say, ``We are going to keep interest rates higher \nthan what it ought to be''? What it means is everybody who owns a \nhouse, everybody who is paying off a credit card, anybody who has any \ndebt at all of any type is paying higher interest rates than they ought \nto pay. In a number of cases it means some homeowners might be paying \n$100 or $200 a month more in interest than they ought to pay. Somebody \nis just taking it out of their pocket. In effect, they have taxed \nthem--to the detriment of the individual, to the reward of the lender. \nThat is why I asked the question earlier: Whose interest does this Fed \nserve?\n  Some say its constituent's interest is that of the big money center \nbanks. It looks that way. How else would they justify interest rates \nthat are more than 2 full percentage points above the real rate of \ninflation, when in fact for nearly 40 years prior to Mr. Greenspan \njoining the Federal Reserve Board the real interest rates above \ninflation set by the Board were 1.8 percent? How else would you justify \nthat kind of massive overcharge of the American people through higher \ninterest rates?\n  The Federal funds rate is not charged to everybody. It happens to set \nthe fee, set the charge. The prime rate comes off the Federal funds \nrate. Other rates come off the prime rate. The fact is, when the \nFederal Reserve Board decides in secret to set interest rates that are \nhigher than they ought to be, then everybody else ends up paying more \nthan they should pay. And who benefits? The big money center banks.\n\n  It is interesting, these folks who will be in that room making the \ndecision when the door is closed--the last dinosaur in America that \nmakes decisions in secret, the last dinosaur that exists in our \nGovernment--when they go into a room and close that door and make \ndecisions in secret, they will be representing--who? Who hired them? \nTheir boards of directors. Who hires the regional Fed bank president? \nThe regional board of directors. And who is that? The regional bankers. \nWhose interests are they going to look after in that room when the door \nis locked? They are not accountable. Their names did not come here for \nthe Senate to say, yes, we would like to sanction you to go into a room \nand make decisions about monetary policy. They are not accountable to \nanybody. They were not confirmed by anybody. They are not accountable. \nYet they go into a room with a locked door and make a secret decision \nwith others and tell the American people what they are going to pay in \ninterest rates.\n  We have people come here and talk about taxes forever--that is a tax. \nA higher interest rate than ought to be paid is a tax; it is a big tax \non almost all working families in this country. So who are these people \ngoing to represent? Are they going to be sent to the Open Market \nCommittee to make decisions that contradict the interests of their \nboards of directors? I don't think so. Would it be logical to assume \nthat\n\n[[Page S10748]]\n\nthey would come to this decisionmaking point representing the interests \nof those who gave them their jobs? I think so.\n  The amendment to be offered by Senator Harkin and myself and a couple \nof others is an amendment that asks the Congress to express itself to \nthe Federal Reserve Board. I know we have people who say, ``Oh Lord, \nthe last thing Congress ought to be involved in is monetary policy.'' \nWhy should we not be involved in making our views known to the Federal \nReserve Board? Anybody who comes out here opposing this, I would like \nto ask them this: If for 40 years the real economic rent for money set \nby the Fed through Federal funds rate is 1.8 percent, if that is the \nrate for 40 years, how do you justify having a rate that is nearly 2 \npoints higher, on average during the Greenspan years? How do you \njustify it? Do you think it is fine? If so, how do you justify taxing \nyour constituents with the higher interest rate because the Fed decides \nit is going to represent their interests, not ours?\n  I am not here arguing for easy money, easy credit. I am here arguing \nfor fairness. I am here asking the Federal Reserve Board to represent \nthe entire public interest here, not just their interest.\n  Our economy, from most recent evidence, looks to be slowing down \nsome. Our economy faces a number of international threats. We have an \nAsian economy that is in shreds--Korea, Japan, China, Indonesia. The \ndifficulty in the Asian economy, a very significant difficulty, is \nbeginning to be felt in this economy. It seems to me, when we have a \nFederal Reserve Board that imposes higher interest rates than are \njustified, much higher interest rates than we have historically had \nwith respect to real economic rent for money, it seems to me when they \ndo that at a time when we begin to face what appears to be some \nsignificant difficulty from external economic forces, the Fed ought to \ntake a look at doing what it should have done long ago, and that is \nreduce real short-term interest rates to where they ought to be.\n  I know this discussion causes a lot of people just to fog out and \nglaze over and go to sleep because, frankly, it is in the interests of \nthose who make monetary policy to keep the monetary policy questions \noutside of the purview of public discussion. A century ago you could go \nto a barber shop or a bar in this country and get into an aggressive, \ninteresting, lively discussion about interest rates. All over the \ncountry they talked about interest rates. Mr. President, 35 years ago \nthere was going to be a one-quarter percent increase in the Federal \nfunds rate. And the fellow who was heading the Federal Reserve Board \nwas thinking about the one-quarter of 1 percent increase. There were \nfront page headlines all across the country. Lyndon Johnson invited \nthis fellow, the head of the Federal Reserve Board, McChesney Martin, \ninvited him down to the ranch at Perdinales, in Texas, and they say \nalmost squeezed the barbecue sauce out of that guy, he was so upset the \nFederal Reserve was going to increase interest rates by one-quarter of \n1 percent.\n  Interest rates used to be part of substantial discussion and lively \ninterest in this country, but we now have a Federal Reserve Board, as I \nsaid, that is the last dinosaur. It wants to keep monetary policy \noutside the purview of normal public debate. It wants to do what it \nwants to do in a locked room behind a closed door, and decide to keep \ninterest rates about 2 full percentage points above where they ought to \nbe given the real rate of inflation in this country today.\n  The Senator from Iowa will offer an amendment. The sense of the \nCongress at the end is very simple. It is one short sentence:\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that the Federal Open \n     Market Committee should promptly reduce the Federal funds \n     rate.\n\n  It is very simple. That is preceded by a series of pieces of \ninformation that make the case.\n  Let me finish, Mr. President. I know Senator Harkin is on his way. I \nknow Senator Domenici is also scheduled to speak. We have a vacancy on \nthe Federal Reserve Board. There is one seat vacant. The Federal \nReserve Board of Governors has seven people, all appointed by the \nPresident, confirmed by the Congress. The confirmation process requires \nthere be accountability, so that is what we have, a Presidential \nappointment with confirmation.\n  That is not the case with regional Federal bank presidents. They \nserve on the Open Market Committee and make decisions, but they are not \nconfirmed by anybody.\n  We have one vacancy. I have come to the floor to say I would like my \nUncle Joe to be considered. My Uncle Joe is retired. My Uncle Joe used \nto fix generators and alternators in his shop behind his house. He is \npretty good with his hands. He knows how to fix things. My theory is, \nthere is nobody on the Fed who has ever fixed anything or ever \nmanufactured anything or ever been in a part of the business where one \nis actually involved in a consumptive use of credit to make a business \nwork.\n  For a couple of centuries, we had tensions in this country between \nthose who produced and those who financed production, and in some \ndecades those who produced have had an upper hand, and in some decades \nthose who financed production have had an upper hand. With the help of \nthe Federal Reserve Board, in most recent years those who finance \nproduction have had the upper hand. That ought not be the case.\n  There is a clear and compelling case, made by Senator Harkin \nyesterday, and I hope by myself, that the current Federal funds rate \nestablished by the Federal Reserve Board responds to a threat that does \nnot exist and, as a result, keeps interest rates substantially higher \nthan they should be on a real basis. As a result of that, the Federal \nReserve overtaxes every American family that pays a higher cost for \ncredit than can now be justified.\n  The Congress has every right to send a message to the Federal Reserve \nBoard that: ``When next you meet and close that door and begin deciding \nin secret the fate of this country's monetary policy and interest \nrates, we encourage you, given all the evidence, to decide to reduce \ninterest rates.''\n  Mr. President, I notice Senator Harkin has not yet arrived on the \nfloor. Let me go down the findings briefly while we are awaiting \nSenator Harkin to come to the floor.\n  While interest rates, we hear on the news, continue to decline, long-\nterm mortgage rates, and so on, the inflation rate, of course, is way, \nway, way down. The question is the real interest rates, the economic \nrent for money. And also the question is, What is happening to our \neconomy? Is it slowing down? And if so, would paying higher interest \nrates, as imposed by the Federal funds rate, be beneficial to this \neconomy?\n  Real interest rates are at historically high levels, the highest in 9 \nyears--real interest rates. The Federal funds rate is 5.5 percent. It \nhas been there since March of 1997, despite an inflation rate of 1.7 \npercent. Between 1992 and 1994, the Federal funds rate averaged 3.6 \npercent, while inflation was at 2.8 percent.\n  The Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Mr. Greenspan, said during \nhis testimony before the House Banking and Financial Services Committee \non February 24 of this year:\n\n       Statistically, it is a fact that real interest rates are \n     higher now than they have been on the average of post-World \n     War II periods.\n\n  Actually, real interest rates are higher now than they have been \nprior to Mr. Greenspan becoming Chairman of the Fed. Inflation over the \nlast 2 years, preceding the date of enactment of this act, was at its \nlowest level since the 1960s. Corporate earnings are down 1.3 percent \nfrom a year earlier, and, as I mentioned, farm debt is at its highest \nlevel since 1985. Broad commodity price indexes are extremely low. \nThere are signs of global depression or at least severe recession and \nthe potential of depression in parts of the economies of Asia, and \nthere are signs that that will negatively impact this country through \nfewer purchases of U.S. exports and through a greater influx of cheap \nimports to the United States.\n  We, as a result of this resolution, want to put the Senate on record \nas saying to the Federal Reserve Board: ``You ought to do what the \nevidence requires you to do; you ought to do what the American people \nknow you should do; you ought to do what most good economists would \nadvise you do now, even though you have not done it for sometime now; \nyou ought to reduce the Federal funds rate to a level that is\n\n[[Page S10749]]\n\nfair and fairly reflects the economic rent for money relative to the \nreal rate of inflation.''\n  The Federal Reserve Board has kept the Federal funds rate \nartificially high because it has worried about inflation. As I \nindicated in the chart, the rate of inflation has come down, down, way \ndown, even as unemployment has come down. The Federal Reserve Board, \npredicting new waves of inflation at every step along the way, has been \nconsistently wrong about this. Some say the Federal Reserve Board \nshould be given credit for the fact it is down. The Federal Reserve \nBoard did nothing but predict this was going to be different. It \nrequires no credit to be wrong.\n  So I ask, and I think Senator Harkin would ask, the Federal Reserve \nBoard to do the right thing when it meets in the Federal Open Market \nCommittee, and make the reduction in interest rates that is justifiable \nand is important to this country.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of the time, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I as unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, may I discuss with Senator Dorgan the \ncurrent situation? We have a unanimous-consent agreement that says at \n11:45 a.m. I am to be recognized to move to table the amendment. I am \nhere. I only have 5 minutes to speak, and I don't choose to use that at \nthis moment.\n  What is the Senator's understanding about how we are going to handle \nthis unanimous-consent agreement that sets 11:45 a.m. as a vote time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the 11:45 a.m. time has been extended, I \nthink, by about 8 minutes by unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By 5 minutes; the Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. By 5 minutes. That would be 11:50 a.m. I am waiting for \nSenator Harkin to arrive on the floor. He is the principal sponsor, \nalong with myself, on the legislation. He wants to speak on it. I just \nfinished speaking. I am waiting for Senator Harkin. I suspect he will \nwant to provide some remarks, after which the Senator from New Mexico \ncan proceed.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I appreciate that. I guess while we are in a quorum \ncall, time is not running. I ask unanimous consent that up to 5 minutes \nof the quorum call not be charged and, thus, we will have 5 additional \nminutes before the time the Senator from New Mexico makes a motion to \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Parliamentary inquiry. What is the floor situation right \nnow in terms of time under the unanimous-consent agreement agreed to \nyesterday?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the right to offer an \namendment and the Senator has 15 minutes remaining on his time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I did not hear that. How much time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. On our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Fifteen minutes left on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota, Senator Wellstone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. Has the \namendment been called up?\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3616 To Amendment No. 3559\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Congress regarding the reduction \n    of the Federal Funds rate by the Federal Open Market Committee)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, before I yield to the Senator, I ask that \nthe amendment be called up at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] for himself, Mr. Dorgan, \n     Mr. Conrad, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Bryan and Mr. Kerrey, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 3616 to amendment No. 3559.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING INTEREST RATES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds, as of the date of \n     enactment of this Act, that--\n       (1) real interest rates are at historically high levels, \n     the highest in 9 years;\n       (2) the Federal Funds rate is 5.5 percent, where it has \n     been since March 1997, despite an inflation rate of 1.6 \n     percent;\n       (3) between 1992 and 1994, the Federal Funds rate averaged \n     3.6 percent, while inflation was at 2.8 percent;\n       (4) to confirm that real interest rates are historically \n     high, the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal \n     Reserve System, Alan Greenspan, said during his Humphrey-\n     Hawkins testimony before the Committee on Banking and \n     Financial Services of the House of Representatives on \n     February 24, 1998, ``Statistically, it is a fact that real \n     interest rates are higher now than they have been on the \n     average of the post-World War II period.'';\n       (5) inflation over the 2 years preceding the date of \n     enactment of this Act was at its lowest level since the \n     1960's;\n       (6) interest rates on 30-year Treasury bonds have sunk to \n     record lows and are below the Federal Funds rate, a signal \n     that the United States economy could be headed for a \n     recession;\n       (7) United States corporate earnings in the second quarter \n     of 1998 were down 1.3 percent from a year earlier;\n       (8) a reduction in interest rates would increase resources \n     for business growth;\n       (9) the farm debt is at its highest level since 1985, and \n     broad commodity price indexes are extremely low;\n       (10) there are significant, widespread signs of global \n     deflation, to which the United States has not been exposed \n     since the Great Depression;\n       (11) there has been a deterioration in a number of \n     economies around the world, which will negatively impact the \n     United States through fewer purchases of United States \n     exports and a greater influx of cheap imports to the United \n     States;\n       (12) the United States economy is a large, healthy economic \n     engine, and if the United States economy does slow, it would \n     be exceedingly difficult for the worldwide economy to \n     recover;\n       (13) a decline in equity values could dampen confidence and \n     slow consumer and business spending, which together \n     represents four-fifths of the United States economy;\n       (14) a decline in United States interest rates would help \n     bolster the currencies of countries throughout the world \n     suffering from economic hardships; and\n       (15) a reduction in interest rates would strengthen the \n     United States economy over the next year while the world's \n     weakened economies recover.\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that the Federal Open Market Committee should promptly reduce \n     the Federal Funds rate.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield to the Senator from Minnesota 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  I thank my colleague from Iowa.\n  I do not think I am going to be able to do justice to the question \nthat is before us. There was a bit of confusion. We were over hearing \nPresident Nelson Mandela and lost some valuable time on the floor, \nalthough I must say I would have never traded that experience to hear \nPresident Mandela.\n  Mr. President, for the last few months, we have been so absorbed with \nthe crisis at the White House I am afraid we have neglected another \ncrisis that might end up having a far greater impact on ordinary \nworking Americans. I am talking about a global economic crisis whose \neffects are already being felt on our shores.\n  The situation in the global economy today is much more than \ntroubling; it is dangerous. I believe we must act now to stop the world \nfrom slipping into a deflationary spiral. And by the way, I would like \nto give Bill Greider, and his book ``One World: Ready or Not,'' just a \nlittle bit of mention. I think Bill Greider deserves a tremendous \namount of credit. That book, written about two\n\n[[Page S10750]]\n\nyears ago, was really prophetic about where the international economy \nmight go.\n  As I said, I believe we must act now to stop the world from slipping \ninto a deflationary spiral. Surely part of the solution--not the whole \nsolution--is for the Federal Reserve to cut short-term interest rates \nsignificantly.\n  I hope that Alan Greenspan, Chairman Greenspan, today in his \ntestimony will, indeed, signal that he is ready to do that. This may be \nonly one part of the solution, but it is an important part, and that is \nwhat this Sense-of-the-Congress resolution is all about.\n  Mr. President, this global economic crisis is unlike anything many of \nus have ever experienced in our lifetimes. For the first time since the \n1930s, we see the GDP falling in over one-quarter of the world economy. \nLast week, President Clinton called this ``the greatest financial \nchallenge in the last half-century.'' And he was right.\n  If we choose to do nothing, we will have little hope of escaping from \nthis crisis unscathed. As Chairman Greenspan recently testified, we \ncannot forever be an oasis of growth when so much of the world's \neconomy is contracting.\n  Lowering interest rates will address the global crisis in several \nways. It will supply some much needed liquidity to a world economy \nstarved by massive currency devaluations. It should help restart \ncapital flows to crisis countries. Lower rates should also weaken the \ndollar, making it easier for foreign borrowers to repay their dollar-\ndominated debt. Boosting the yen against the dollar should make other \nAsian countries more competitive and help stabilize their economies. \nThe end result should be higher world economic growth and less \ninstability in the financial markets.\n  Mr. President, I cannot emphasize enough how important this Sense-of-\nthe-Congress amendment is, because we are attempting to send a signal \nhere. I come from the Midwest. We see a contraction in the farm \neconomy. We see farmers driven off the land because of record-low \nprices. But what I also see is an absolutely impossible situation right \nnow where what is happening in this world economy is surely going to \naffect us. And there is no question that, by lowering interest rates in \ncoordination with other countries--like Germany and the G-7 countries--\nwe can at least increase demand.\n  If there is one thing we must do, it is increase demand in all of our \neconomies so that people will be able to consume, so we will have \nmarkets to sell to. Bill Greider was right. The major threat right now, \nnot only to the international economy but to our own economy, is not \ninflation. It is deflation.\n  All the arguments about the NAIRU--the Non-Accelerating Inflation \nRate of Unemployment--don't stand up. It is not true that when you have \nlow levels of unemployment you automatically set into gear an \ninflationary spiral in your economy. That has not happened. There is no \nevidence that it will happen.\n  The No. 1 enemy right now is not inflation, but the whole question of \ndeflation, the whole question of a depression in a good part of the \ninternational economy which is going to dramatically, crucially, affect \nthe quality of our lives, our children's lives and our grandchildren's \nlives.\n  The Federal Reserve Board, led by Mr. Greenspan, must lower short-\nterm interest rates. They are too high. It makes no sense whatever--\nfrom the point of view of the best macroeconomic management, from the \npoint of view of economic performance, from the point of view of \nstimulating demand in these economies, from the point of view of \ncoordinating with other countries like Germany--for the Federal Reserve \nBoard not to lower the federal funds rate. That is what this resolution \ncalls for. That is why I am pleased to join my colleague from Iowa.\n  This is why a rising chorus of voices is now calling for lower rates. \nMany of them are conservatives. They include the Wall Street Journal, \nJack Kemp, the National Association of Manufacturers, the Business \nRoundtable, Stephen Roache, C. Fred Bergsten, Roger Altman, Steve \nForbes, and many others.\n  But there are also many who don't share my sense of alarm. A few may \nsimply be afraid to say anything that could trigger a panic. Others may \nnot see any need to take precautions against a forecasted hurricane--\nespecially when the skies directly above us are sunny and clear. Well, \nmaybe they are right. Maybe this storm will veer off course. But what \nif they're wrong?\n  Some of my colleagues may well say, ``We already have low interest \nrates. The Fed hasn't raised short-term rates for a year and a half.'' \nTrue enough. But if you adjust those rates for inflation, they've \nactually been rising for some time. Chairman Greenspan himself \ntestified earlier this year that ``Statistically, it is a fact that \nreal interest rates are higher now than they have been on the average \nof the post World War II period.'' In fact, the inflation-adjusted \nfederal funds rate hasn't been this high since 1989.\n  Unfortunately, there has been a strong bias, at the Federal Reserve \nand elsewhere, against lowering rates, though this may be changing as \nwe speak. The reason for this is simple: an inordinate fear of \ninflation. But inflation today stands at 1.6 percent, down from 3 \npercent in 1996. Where is the evidence of any inflationary pressure on \nthe horizon? This downward trend cannot be attributed solely to the \nAsian crisis, either: the producer price index fell for the first seven \nmonths of 1997, before the crisis even began. To quote Bruce Steinberg, \nchief economist at Merrill Lynch, ``People who cry about inflation are \nin some other universe of reality right now.''\n  Moreover, an expected slowdown in economic growth should douse any \npossible inflationary pressures. Corporate earnings in the second \nquarter were down 1.3 percent from the previous year. Economic growth \nslowed from 5.5 percent in the first quarter to 1.6 percent in the \nsecond. The OECD predicts lower U.S. growth next year. Chairman \nGreenspan himself has acknowledged that ``there are the first signs of \nerosion at the edges, especially in manufacturing.'' Manufacturing \ncapacity utilization is at a six year low, commodity prices are \nfalling, and farm debt is the highest it's been since 1985. And the Fed \nsays its monetary policy must be based on forecasts of economic \nconditions 6 to 9 months in the future!\n  In his speech last week, President Clinton recognized that these new \ncircumstances call for a reexamination of some of our most basic \neconomic assumptions. ``For most of the last 30 years, the United \nStates and the rest of the world has been preoccupied by inflation,'' \nhe said. ``But clearly the balance of risks has now shifted, with a \nfull quarter of the world's population living in countries with \ndeclining economic growth or negative economic growth. Therefore, I \nbelieve the industrial world's chief priority today, plainly, is to \nspur growth.''\n  The Federal Reserve's obsession with inflation-fighting can be traced \nback to the so-called NAIRU [Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of \nUnemployment] theory. What NAIRU boils down to is this: it's a belief \nthat lowering unemployment too much will cause inflation to spiral out \nof control. Tragically, this theory has too often stood in the way of \npolicies that would reduce unemployment.\n  Yet it seems to have little, if any, correlation to our actual \neconomic experience. For four years now we've had unemployment rates \nbelow 6 percent. They've been under 5 percent for well over a year. \nDuring that time, inflation has been falling, not rising. The fact is, \nthere's little reason to believe low unemployment causes inflation to \ncome unhinged. It seems to me that this NAIRU theory is about as out-\nmoded as the Nehru jacket. And frankly, I have serious doubts whether \neither of these fads was ever really defensible.\n  In the past, the Fed has focused on fighting inflation over all other \nconsiderations, which puts it at odds with its own statutory mandate. \nLet me remind my colleagues, once again, that the Federal Reserve is a \ncreature of Congress. The 1946 Employment Act directs the Fed to pursue \npolicies of ``maximum employment, production, and purchasing power.'' \nThe 1978 Humphrey-Hawkins Act amendments call for policies of ``full \nemployment,'' ``balanced growth,'' and ``reasonable price stability.'' \nInstead, it seems the Fed sees its mandate as stifling real wage \ngrowth.\n  Sometimes Washington seems like a different world than the one where \nmost Americans live, and never more\n\n[[Page S10751]]\n\nso than when it's engulfed in scandal. But it can seem like a pretty \nodd place even in more normal times. In testimony before Congress, Fed \nChairman Greenspan has seemed to express satisfaction that job \ninsecurity keeps workers from demanding higher wages. More recently he \nhas voiced concern that wages are rising, despite the fact that wage \ngrowth has not kept up with productivity. I'm not sure which is more \noutrageous: that anybody in a position of power in this country would \nsay such things, or that so few people would be bothered by them.\n  In all fairness, the Fed has resisted the temptation to raise short-\nterm rates for some time now. That's probably because falling \nunemployment has not led to higher wages until very recently, and \ninflation has continued on its downward path. But now, in the seventh \nyear of this economic recovery, we are finally starting to see signs of \nwage growth. Real wages have risen 2.6 percent annually for the typical \nAmerican worker since 1996, though they have still not regained their \n1989 levels. And the trend toward income inequality has also begun to \nslow.\n  This is good news, and it is a tremendous breakthrough. The mystery \nof falling wages and rising inequality over the past three decades \nturns out to be not so mysterious after all. The fact is, we know how \nto raise wages and reduce inequality. We do not have to reinvent the \nwheel. Among other things, we need to maintain low unemployment over a \nsustained period. We've done this before and we can do it again. \nSurveying the U.S. economy since World War II, economist James \nGalbraith finds that income inequality has generally risen when \nunemployment was above 5 percent and fallen when unemployment was below \n5 percent.\n  Simply put, we need to pursue a policy of full employment. The 1998 \nReport of the Council of Economic Advisers hails recent trends in \nincome inequality and concludes, ``Maintaining a full employment \neconomy is essential if this progress is to continue.'' The experience \nof the last two years should drive that lesson home. It would be a \ntragedy if an unjustified fear of rising wages or an economic downturn \nkept us from continuing that progress. With economic growth falling \noverseas and the growing danger of deflationary aftershocks here at \nhome, I believe the Fed needs to cut interest rates now.\n\n  There are few things, I think, that would improve the lives of \nordinary working Americans more than full employment. As the 1998 \nReport of the Council of Economic Advisers says:\n\n       A high employment economy brings enormous economic and \n     social benefits. Essential to personal economic security is \n     the knowledge that work is available to those who seek it, at \n     wages sufficient to keep them and their families out of \n     poverty. A tight labor market encourages the confidence of \n     job losers that they will be able to return to work, lures \n     discouraged workers back into the labor force, enhances the \n     prospects of those already at work to get ahead, enables \n     those who want or need to switch jobs to do so without a long \n     period of joblessness, and lowers the duration of a typical \n     unemployment spell. . . . Wasted resources from not producing \n     at potential, together with the human cost of unemployment, \n     are intolerable; the elimination of this waste is the \n     principal benefit of a sustained return to full employment.\n\n  As James Galbraith argues in his powerful new book, Created Unequal, \nlower interest rates and full employment help sustain not only a \nhealthy economy, but also a healthy society. Lower rates make it easier \nto balance the budget. They help reduce inequality by lowering \nunemployment and reducing poverty, by preserving a competitive dollar \nthat doesn't destabilize wages, and by checking the unearned income of \ntop earners. They ease social strains by pushing up wages and lifting \nthe burden of private debt. For all these reasons, in a full employment \neconomy, citizens are more able and willing to make necessary \ninvestments in education, training, infrastructure, research, and other \npublic goods.\n  But the flip side of this picture is not so rosy. Inequality has been \nrising since about 1970, and today is the highest it's been since the \nGreat Depression. Growing inequality brings out the worst in us. It \neats away at middle class solidarity. It encourages those who feel \nsecure about their life chances to disavow any connection to their \nbrethren in need. Growing inequality finds expression in bitter \nstruggles over issues such as affirmative action, welfare, crime, \nentitlements, and even intelligence. And if income inequality had not \nso undermined middle class solidarity, I don't think the campaign to \nprivatize Social Security would have ever gotten off the ground.\n  There are specific responses to each of these challenges, but the \nlarger issue is the erosion of solidarity among Americans of different \neconomic circumstances. The answer, it seems to me, is clear. We must \nrebuild that solidarity with higher wages and lower inequality. These \nlessons have a direct bearing on one of the paramount issues before \nCongress today: an America with rising wages and declining inequality \nis an America that need not worry about the future of Social Security.\n  What is true for the American economy is equally true for the world \neconomy. The best global citizens are countries that generate their own \ndomestic demand, and healthy demand depends on rising wages and lower \ninequality. There's been a lot of talk about virtuous cycles lately. \nWell, when income gains are broadly shared, it creates a virtuous cycle \nof mass purchasing power, growth, savings, and new investment. We can \npromote this kind of good citizenship by helping other countries raise \ntheir wages from the bottom up--through higher minimum wages, \nrecognition of labor rights, and fiscal and monetary stimulus.\n  This kind of policy would be good not only for them, but for us too. \nAnd it would be good for the global system as a whole. We cannot \nforever be the buyer of last resort. We cannot forever help other \ncountries develop economically by absorbing all their manufacturing \nexports. They need to create their own domestic demand. Trade should be \na complement to healthy demand at home, not a substitute for weak \ndemand. Otherwise we cannot escape the trap of excess production and \novercapacity, with too many goods being produced and not enough \nprosperous consumers to buy them. As the AFL-CIO urged back in January, \n``The United States, Europe, and Japan must work together to stimulate \ndomestic demand in the developing economies and avert a dangerous \ntendency toward global deflation.''\n  Needless to say, we haven't been doing that. It certainly hasn't \nhelped that, working through the IMF and other multilateral \ninstitutions, we have imposed deflation on countries in Asia and the \nrest of the world. We have depressed foreign demand by insisting that \nother governments cut spending, close banks, weaken labor laws, and \nraise interest rates. And we've insisted that they deregulate financial \nmarkets to remove any checks on often destabilizing flows of foreign \ncapital. As the AFL-CIO said back in February, ``These terms may solve \nsome short-term credibility problems with foreign investors, but will \nnecessarily exacerbate the tensions, inequality, and instability of the \nglobal economy.'' That, I believe, is exactly the problem facing us \ntoday.\n  This is a time for bold new thinking. In his speech last Monday, \nPresident Clinton called on Chairman Greenspan and Secretary Rubin to \nconvene a meeting of their counterparts in the G-7 and key developing \ncountries within the next 30 days to strengthen the international \nfinancial architecture for the 21st Century. Fifty years ago, he said, \nwe learned to tame the cycle of booms and busts that had plagued \nnational economies, and we must now do the same for the international \neconomy.\n  But what does that entail, exactly? Countries must be able to reap \nthe benefits of free-flowing capital in a way that is safe and \nsustainable, the President said. The IMF should emphasize pro-growth \nbudget, tax, and monetary policies. The World Bank should embark on a \nnew ``social compact'' initiative focusing on job assistance and basic \nneeds of children and the elderly. The World Bank and the Asian \nDevelopment Bank should both double their support for the social safety \nnet in Asia.\n  Meanwhile, it was reported yesterday that British Prime Minister Tony \nBlair has joined the call to restructure the institutions and rules \ngoverning the global financial system. And the IMF just released a \nreport endorsing the kind of capital controls Chile has maintained for \nyears to discourage destabilizing short-term capital inflows.\n\n[[Page S10752]]\n\n This appears to represent a 180 degree about-face from its previous \ndogged insistence on liberalizing capital markets.\n  These are extraordinary developments. I believe they are a sign of \nthe seriousness of the crisis we face. They also indicate that deeply \nentrenched assumptions are now being reexamined. That's something we \nshould welcome and encourage.\n  I believe we can prevent the worst from happening, but we must act \nnow. These are times that cry out for American leadership. The most \npressing need, and our most immediate priority, must be to deliver a \npreemptive strike against deflation. At the next meeting of the FOMC, \nFederal Open Market Committee, on September 29, the Fed should lower \ninterest rates significantly.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes 38 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield whatever time I consume.\n  Mr. President, this amendment that we have offered is cosponsored by \nSenators Dorgan, Conrad, Wellstone, Robert Kerrey, and Senator Bryan.\n  Because of the actions of the Federal Open Market Committee, real \ninterest rates are rising. In fact, real interest rates are at \nhistorically high levels, the highest in 9 years, because inflation has \nfallen while the Federal Reserve failed to lower the Federal funds \nrate.\n  This chart points it out. The Federal funds rate continues to go up \nat about 3.9 percent. Fed Chairman Greenspan said in February of this \nyear:\n\n       Statistically, it is a fact that real interest rates are \n     higher now than they have been on the average of the post-\n     World War II period.\n\n  I have said time and again that the high interest rate policy being \nimposed by the Federal Reserve is a stealth tax on hard-working \nAmerican families, and I believe it is a contributing factor to the \nnear collapse of several economies worldwide.\n  Again, interest rates have a significant impact on virtually every \nfamily in America, every producer, business, and family farmer in this \ncountry. Lower rates have been needed for some time, but now quick \naction is truly crucial for our country's well-being. The economic \nsigns not only in the U.S. economy but in economies worldwide demand \nswift and appropriate action.\n  I note in the front page of the Washington Post this morning it says, \n``Signs Point to Interest Rate Cut,'' and:\n\n       Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan will testify \n     before Congress today amid growing signs that he may propose \n     cutting interest rates when Fed policymakers meet next \n     Tuesday.\n\n  And it goes on to say how many executives and economists have called \nfor that.\n  Now, the amendment that I have at the desk reads that we ask the \nFederal Open Market Committee to promptly reduce interest rates. Now, \nthe Senator from New Mexico had suggested that perhaps we might want to \nalter that a little bit to just say that perhaps we should advise them \nor urge them to do something like that.\n  I refer back to a congressional resolution passed by the Senate on \nDecember 18, 1982. It passed by 93-0. I believe the Senator from New \nMexico may have been here at that time. I didn't check that, but I \nthink he may have been here at that time. It passed 93-0. That \nresolution also called on the Fed to reduce interest rates. I will just \nread one sentence of it:\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that they should continue \n     to take such actions as are necessary to achieve and maintain \n     a level of interest rates low enough to generate significant \n     economic growth, and thereby reduce the current intolerable \n     level of unemployment.\n\n  At that time, December 18, 1982, the Senate saw fit by a vote of 93-0 \nto tell the Federal Open Market Committee that they should do \nsomething. That is what we are saying here in this resolution. They \nshould promptly reduce interest rates because every sign points to the \nneed to do so. Again, we could say that they should consider doing it, \nbut I am just saying in 1982 we didn't say they should consider taking \nsuch actions. The resolution said, ``They should continue to take such \nactions.''\n  So there was a direction from the Senate at that time to the Fed. To \nthose who say we shouldn't interfere with the Fed, I say where in the \nConstitution of the United States is the Federal Reserve system given \nsuch a standing? It is nowhere to be found in the Constitution. Article \nI, section 8 of the Constitution gives the power to coin and regulate \nthe power of money to Congress. We have, of course, delegated that \npower to the Federal Reserve System under the Federal Reserve Act, as \namended, many times. Obviously, I don't believe Congress should coin \nmoney or regulate the value it. We couldn't do it. That is why we have \nthe Federal Reserve.\n  However, as policymakers, because the Federal Reserve is a creature \nof Congress, it exists only because of an amended law, passed by \nCongress. We have the right, and I believe the obligation, to tell the \nFederal Reserve what we feel, what we hear, what we see, what we think \nis happening in the economy. We are the policymakers and we should give \nthem that guidance and direction when and if we believe that we should \ndo so.\n  Again, if there are those who don't believe that we should reduce \ninterest rates, that we shouldn't tell the Federal Reserve that they \nshould reduce interest rates, that I can understand. That is a clear \npolicy difference. But to say that we shouldn't tell the Fed what to do \nflies in the face, I believe, of our responsibilities and our \nobligations as policymakers here in the U.S. Senate.\n  Policy wise, I believe they should lower interest rates. So does the \nhead of the National Association of Manufacturers, the president of \nGeneral Motors, and a number of other economists both on the \nconservative side and on the liberal side. They are saying that we \nshould lower interest rates.\n  I think the purpose of this resolution and why I am offering it is to \nback up what I understand Chairman Greenspan is attempting to do. I \nunderstand there are still some members of the Federal Open Market \nCommittee who don't believe we should lower interest rates. I think we \nshould send them a very strong signal. We should back up what I \nunderstand Chairman Greenspan is now saying that they probably ought to \ndo, and that is lower interest rates. That is the purpose of this \namendment.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, although I agree with the economic case \nfor lower interest rates made by the Senator from Iowa, I must vote to \ntable this amendment. While Members of Congress and Senators certainly \nhave the right to express their opinions about the conduct of monetary \npolicy, it is highly inappropriate for the Congress as an institution \nto take formal legislative action designed to influence decisions made \nby the Federal Reserve board members. To do so would undermine the \npolitical independence of the Fed and thus the stability of our \nfinancial and monetary system.\n  Having said this, Mr. President, I am concerned about the volatility \nand uncertainty enveloping worldwide financial markets and the role \nthat U.S. monetary policy is playing in our global financial system. \nThere are proliferating signs of deflation that many economists suggest \nare at least partially responsible for the recent market turmoil.\n  Gold prices have fallen by more than 30% since early 1996, commodity \nprices have fallen to 21-year lows, the yield curve has now inverted \nand real interest rates remain very high. Chairman Greenspan himself \nhas said in the past that these indicators were important signals of \nthe direction of inflationary pressures.\n  Nonetheless, rather than focusing on these market indicators, some \nmembers of the Fed appear to have placed more focus on the unemployment \nrate, rising stock prices and wage growth. In the meantime, corporate \nprofits have declined on a year-over-year basis for the first time in a \ndecade, farm prices are plummeting, bankruptcies have accelerated and \nnow the stock market is reflecting slower growth ahead.\n  Mr. President, in my judgment, the best environment for business is \nan environment of price stability. Price stability should be the \nFederal Reserve's number one priority. And this means avoiding both \ninflation and deflation. Today, it appears that the risks of deflation \nhave risen excessively.\n\n[[Page S10753]]\n\n  History clearly shows that when monetary policy is focused on \nmanaging stock markets, wages or unemployment, mistakes can be made. I \ndo not believe that higher rates of economic growth creates inflation. \nIn my view, rising stock prices, rising wages, and falling unemployment \nreflect the incredible wealth creating capacity of a free market \nsystem, not the artificial result of an easy monetary policy. In \ntoday's high-tech world of higher productivity, using discredited \nmodels of the economy, based in the Phillips Curve, seems archaic.\n  The recent currency devaluations in emerging economies has also \nincreased deflationary pressures. As these currencies decline in value, \nthe worldwide demand for U.S. dollars has dramatically increased. \nHowever, because there has been no matching increase in the supply of \ndollars, the global economy faces a severe liquidity squeeze. And as \nMr. Greenspan said during his recent remarks at the University of \nCalifornia, Berkeley, `` it is just not credible that the United States \ncan remain an oasis of prosperity unaffected by a world that is \nexperiencing greatly increased stress.''\n  Given the mounting evidence of deflation and the growing global \nfinancial difficulties, I believe the Federal Reserve should seriously \nconsider reducing short-term interest rates at this juncture. The \n``real'' federal funds rate has steadily increased as inflation has \ndeclined, implying a continued tightening of monetary policy. A rate \ncut would provide much needed liquidity to global economy, stabilize \nworld-wide financial markets, and ensure continued non-inflationary \neconomic growth.\n  Mr. President, in summary, while I personally believe that the \neconomic case for lower interest rates is strong, I do not believe it \nis the proper role of the Congress to dictate that the Fed implement a \nspecific monetary policy action through formal legislative action.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I will vote to table this amendment to \nS. 1301, the Bankruptcy Reform bill, which expresses the sense of the \nCongress ``that the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee should \npromptly reduce the Federal Funds rate.'' My vote to table this \namendment should not be construed as opposition to lower interest \nrates. Rather, I do not believe it is the duty of this body, nor do I \nbelieve that it is appropriate for this body, to tell the Federal \nReserve Open Market Committee what to do.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 50 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I reserve my 50 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the question before the U.S. Senate is \nnot whether the Federal Reserve Board should reduce interest rates; it \nis whether or not the U.S. Senate should say that the Federal Open \nMarket Committee should promptly reduce the Federal funds rate.\n  Any Senators who have traveled the world, including Europe, and are \nasked what institution that the United States has in place that is the \nbest thing going for global success, American capitalism and \nprosperity, guess what they will say? They won't say the Senate, they \nwon't say the House, they won't say the President; they will say the \nFederal Reserve Board and its Chairman, who have been permitted, by act \nof Congress, to act independently of political pressures.\n\n  Now, frankly, there is a very serious problem with global economic \nfaltering. Nobody has an answer to it. There are many suggestions as to \nwhat we didn't do that we should do. But I submit, for the world to \nfind out, after Alan Greenspan and this Federal Reserve Board have done \na most marvelous job in controlling interest rates and monetary policy \nthat the whole world is looking at and saying they did it perfect, \nabsolutely right--for us to come along now and say, ``Well, look, that \nis really so, but we would like to tell them right now''--in a way \ntaking away some of their independence because we want to put political \npressure on them--``that they should promptly reduce interest rates,'' \nfrankly, I believe we will send the wrong signal, because I think the \nsignal we need is the stability of the Federal Reserve Board making \ndecisions on behalf of America, and America in a global market. That is \nthe kind of stability that the world is looking for.\n  You know, I don't think anybody believes--and I am not saying Senator \nHarkin does--that we should regularly on the floor of the Senate be \ncritiquing the Federal Reserve Board and then telling them what they \nought to do. I don't think anybody thinks that. But I think we are \nfalling right into that trap here.\n  I have suggested--and I give it again to the sponsor--why don't we do \nwhat we ought to do and say the Federal Open Market Committee should \nseriously consider reducing the Federal funds rate? That way, we would \nbe chiming in by whatever vote occurs with many people who think that, \nbut we would not take this time in economic history to say that we are \nopting to say that the U.S. Senate says you should do it promptly. That \nis my argument. The Senate can do what it would like. I believe we \nought not adopt it. If we want to state our case in this regard, we \nought to state it another way, so that we are just joining in with \ncomments and observations, but not drawing a conclusion that says if we \nwere doing it, we would change it right now and we urge that you do \nthat and do it promptly.\n  That is essentially the issue.\n  Mr. President, we are in the most complicated quasi-world recession \nthat we have been in perhaps in modern times because capitalism is \nfaltering around the world--not because capitalism and entrepreneurship \ndoesn't work, but there are institutions that have fallen apart in \nother countries that are affecting us. I have no doubt that the Federal \nReserve Board is going to do the right thing. There is no doubt in my \nmind that they are. I also suggest that if they reduce interest rates, \neverybody should not expect that the world economy is going to get \nfixed. There are many serious problems that it won't fix.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this amendment does not set monetary \npolicy. It is a nonbinding sense of the Congress. William Gaston from \nthe Congressional Research Service writes in a CRS report that, \n``Congress has enacted nonbinding language to express its monetary \npolicy preferences to the Fed.''\n  The last time this Senate debated a sense-of-the-Senate resolution to \nask the Fed to lower interest rates was December 18, 1982. Again, I \nwill read--it did not say it should seriously consider, it said, ``It \nis declared that it is the sense of the Congress that they should \ncontinue to take such actions as are necessary.'' That is what it said \nin 1982. It didn't say they should ``seriously consider,'' but they \nshould ``take such actions.''\n\n  That is what this amendment says. It says they should reduce interest \nrates. The Business Roundtable said, ``The President and Congress \nshould encourage the Federal Reserve to lower U.S. interest rates. . \n.'' not to seriously consider it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is not that I am worried about \narguments, but we have been changing to accommodate. But I will not \noppose the Senator having 1 more minute.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for another minute.\n  Mr. HARKIN. This says, ``The President and Congress should encourage \nthe Federal Reserve to lower interest rates.'' It didn't say we should \nhave them consider it. That time has passed. I might have agreed with \nthe Senator from New Mexico a year ago, that they should consider it. \nNow the time is critical. If the Federal Open Market Committee doesn't \nact next week, they don't meet again until November. That is why it is \nso crucial that we, as policymakers, send a strong signal, not that \nthey should consider reducing interest rates, but they ought to do it. \nWe ought to back up what we know is right, back up what the Business \nRoundtable and almost every economist is saying that we have to do. Is \nthat interfering with the Fed? Not at all. But it is telling them what \nwe, as\n\n[[Page S10754]]\n\npolicymakers, believe and feel they should do at their next meeting, \nand that is to promptly reduce interest rates.\n  I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have been here a long time and I voted \non that resolution that the Senator is talking about. I didn't think I \never voted on a resolution that told the Federal Reserve Board what to \ndo in precise terms like, ``Lower the interest rates.'' The resolution \nthat we adopted overwhelmingly was much more in the tone and tenor and \nwords of what I recommended. It says: ``They should continue to take \nsuch actions as are necessary to achieve and maintain interest rates \nlow enough to generate significant economic growth.''\n  Frankly, that is precisely what we ought to be doing. We ought to be \nsaying take whatever action is necessary; we should not say to them \nthat we are saying, as a matter of policy, you should lower the \ninterest rates. We ought not do that to the Federal Reserve. It will \nnot do anything but discredit them over the long run and add \ninstability where stability is needed.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Maybe we could reach an agreement on language here.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I gave the Senator the language. I believe I am \nentitled to make a motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator is \nrecognized to move to table the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would like to do this, because there is a desire to \ntalk for a minute. Without losing my right to move to table this when \nwe come out of a quorum call, I ask unanimous consent that we can have \na quorum call and that I may reserve the right to move to table. Is \nthat language precise enough?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, pursuant to the order, I have a right to \nmove to table at this point.\n  I move to table the amendment, and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from New Mexico to lay on the table the amendment of the \nSenator from Iowa. On this question, the yeas and nays have been \nordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Glenn) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 71, nays 27, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 283 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--71\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kempthorne\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--27\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Boxer\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dorgan\n     Feingold\n     Ford\n     Gorton\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Lautenberg\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Sarbanes\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Glenn\n     Warner\n       \n  The motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 3616) was agreed \nto.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico. Will the Senator \nfrom New Mexico withhold? May we have order in the Chamber, please? All \nconversations should be moved to the cloakrooms. The Senator from New \nMexico deserves to be heard.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, a number of Senators who voted on the \nmotion to table which I proposed indicated that they would like to see \nan expression regarding the interest rates, but not a mandate. I ask \nunanimous consent--I am not sure I will get it --but I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be in order that I offer a similar resolution, but the \nresolve clause would state:\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that the Federal Open \n     Market Committee should consider reducing the Federal funds \n     rate.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to Senators, I will speak to the \nleader and maybe we can offer it somewhere else. We cannot offer it on \nthis bill. I regret we cannot vote on it. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa. Will the Senator \nsuspend? May we have order in the Chamber, please? All conversations in \nthe aisle should be moved to the cloakrooms.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, usually when votes are cast, I don't like \nto revisit them. People have their reasons; we vote and we move on \naround here. But I heard so much in the well from people voting on this \nlast sense-of-the-Senate resolution that I felt I should take a little \nbit of time to perhaps clarify a couple of things and to make an \nadditional point.\n  First of all, this was a sense-of-the-Congress amendment. It was \nnonbinding. Someone said, ``We shouldn't be legislating what the \nFederal Reserve should do.'' With that I wholeheartedly agree. We were \nnot legislating a law to tell the Federal Reserve what to do, No. 1. \nThat is my first point. This was a nonbinding sense of the Congress--we \nadopt those all the time around here--basically to say, ``Here is what \nI, a policymaker, think should be done.''\n  Secondly, this is not without precedent. This body has in the past \nvoted on sense-of-the Congress amendments and resolutions that have \ntold the Fed what we believe they should do.\n  Third, I heard it said that we should not be politicizing the Fed. \nWith that I wholeheartedly agree. But article I, section 8 of the \nConstitution gives the power to coin money and regulate the value \nthereof to the Congress of the United States. It did not give it to the \nFederal Reserve System.\n  The Congress, in its wisdom, in the past set up the Federal Reserve \nSystem to do that. We delegated our powers to the Fed to do that. Over \nthe intervening years, we have amended the Federal Reserve Act. It is \nnot carved in stone. It has been amended and changed several times \nsince 1913. But the Federal Reserve System remains a creature of \nCongress. It exists only by the laws passed by the Congress. It is not \na separate branch of Government.\n  It is not some kind of supreme being, some kind of item of sanctity \nthat we can never touch. I believe it is not only our right but our \nresponsibility as policymakers at certain times, if we feel a certain \nway, to be able to tell the Federal Reserve System what we believe they \nshould do.\n  So on this past vote I have no quarrel with anyone who believes the \nFederal Reserve should not lower interest rates. I may debate that \npoint with\n\n[[Page S10755]]\n\nthem, because I believe they should lower interest rates. That is a \ngood debating point. But if someone voted on this and said no, the \nFederal Reserve should not lower interest rates, that I believe is a \nvalid position that someone might hold, of which I disagree.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator from Iowa yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Let me finish this, and I will.\n  But to say we cannot vote to tell the Fed what to do because it would \nbe politicizing it or we cannot interfere I believe somehow is an \nabdication of our responsibilities, not only our rights but our \nresponsibilities as policymakers to tell a creature of the Congress \nwhat we believe they should do. We do not do it very often in terms of \nthe Fed. In fact, I pointed out the last time we had a Sense of the \nCongress calling on the Fed to lower interest rates was in 1982. So \nthis is not something we take lightly.\n  But I believe at this point in time, with the world economy being \nwhat it is, with the tremendous drop in commodities and commodity \nprices here and around the world, with the specter of depression and \ndeflation facing us--almost every economist, conservative, liberal, \nhead of the Business Roundtable, head of General Motors, head of the \nNational Association of Manufacturers, all say the Fed should lower \ninterest rates.\n  I offered this amendment, along with others, in good faith, to back \nthem up to say, yes, you should lower interest rates. And that is what \nthis was meant to do, to send that sense of the Congress that that is \nwhat we believe they should do. Obviously, we did not prevail. So I can \nonly assume that most people do not believe they should lower interest \nrates.\n  I would be delighted to yield to my friend from Nevada for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. REID. Does the Senator from Iowa realize that Senator Dorgan and \nI have offered legislation on several occasions to have the Federal \nReserve System audited on a yearly basis? Is the Senator aware we have \ndone that?\n  Mr. HARKIN. This Senator is not aware of that specific legislation, \nno.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator acknowledge that the Federal Reserve \nBoard--it would be a good idea to see how they spend their money?\n  Mr. HARKIN. We don't know that?\n  Mr. REID. The Federal Reserve System is not audited.\n  Mr. HARKIN. No. I ask the Senator--I am not being facetious. Is the \nSenator from Nevada telling me that the General Accounting Office, the \nGAO, does not audit----\n  Mr. REID. Absolutely not.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Can the Senator tell me why the GAO does not audit the \nFederal Reserve?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from North Dakota and I have been wondering for \na couple of years. We have offered legislation time and time again to \nhave the Federal Reserve System audited, like every other Government \nentity in this country. But no. In fact, we asked for a General \nAccounting Office study to find out a little bit about the inner \nworkings of the Federal Reserve System, and we found, among other \nthings, they have what we refer to as a ``slush fund,'' what they refer \nto as a ``rainy day fund'' that they have kept there for 80 years, or \nthereabouts, 70-some-odd years. It is billions of dollars that they \njust keep there.\n  That money, we believe, should be taken out of the Federal Reserve \nSystem and applied toward the deficit to take down the debt that we \nowe. But no, they keep hanging on to that money year after year.\n  I appreciate, very much, this amendment having been offered by the \nSenator from Iowa, because, if nothing else, it allows me the \nopportunity to ask the Senator from Iowa a question: Shouldn't we audit \nthe Federal Reserve System? The American public thinks so, but here the \nmessage is without response. We cannot get people to support us on \nthat.\n  Mr. HARKIN. This Senator was not aware of that.\n  Is the Senator telling me that the Federal Reserve, which I have just \nstated is a creature of Congress, and exists by law, that the General \nAccounting Office, our accountant, cannot audit the Federal Reserve?\n  Mr. REID. Cannot, does not, and will not.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would respond to the Senator by again asking the \nSenator a question. Have we ever tried to pass something here to have \nan audit done for the Federal Reserve?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator would yield for a question.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield to the Senator from North Dakota for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Nevada talked about this audit that was \ndone of the Fed by the GAO. What the audit showed was a $3.7 billion \nfund accumulated at the Federal Reserve Board--$3.7 billion. And they \npointed out that the Fed has not had a loss for nearly 80 years--will \nnever have a loss. You can't lose money when you create money. So there \nwas no reason to have a rainy day fund or some sort of provisional fund \nof $3.7 billion. And the GAO recommended that it be returned to the \nTreasury. It belongs to the American people.\n  Not only has it not been returned, the $3.7 billion has now been \nincreased to $5.2 billion. So you have to say to somebody, if you think \nthere is reason to get some of these resources to do something with \nit--pay down the Federal debt or to do some of the other issues--there \nis $5.2 billion down at the Fed that they have for a rainy day fund, \nand they never have rain down there. They create money. They make their \nown money. And they have never had an annual loss, and will never have \na loss; and yet they have squirreled away $5.2 billion of resources. \nAnd we have raised this issue.\n  The GAO--not us--the GAO says that ought to be returned. But it will \nnot be, I assume because this Senate--Congress says, ``Gee, we don't \nwant to touch that house on the Hill that's got those big gates around \nit, the big fence. And it's an American dinosaur. We can't crawl in \nthere and see what's going on.'' But the GAO did a 2-year study. I \nwould commend my colleagues to take a look at what they found in that \nstudy.\n  There is plenty wrong down there. There is not good accounting. There \nis not good contracting. There is a rainy day fund of billions of \ndollars. So there is plenty of work to do with the Fed.\n  I ask the Senator from Iowa, isn't it the case that all we were doing \ntoday was to say, ``Gee, we think it's time for you to reduce interest \nrates the next time you meet, given all the evidence that exists''?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield to my friend from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Iowa, I do not think the Senator \nfrom Iowa realizes, in the GAO report we also found that the governors \nof the Federal Reserve System, some of them fly first class, some of \nthem fly whatever class they want. We found the most interesting things \nthere, how they have no rules or guidance, how they travel, how their \nexpenses are determined.\n  I recommend to my friend from Iowa, and everyone within the sound of \nour voices, that we need to take a better look at the Federal Reserve \nSystem. I commend and applaud the Senator from Iowa for bringing this \namendment here today because it gives us a chance to focus, as you have \nsaid, on a creature we created. Congress created this. And we have \nstatements here: ``Hey, we can't suggest to the Federal Reserve System \nbecause it might hurt us internationally.'' Congress created the \nFederal Reserve System. Can't we do a little bit about it, for example, \nto see how they spend their money? The answer to this point is no.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I hope that the Senator, then, would try again to bring \nup some legislation to provide for an audit of the Federal Reserve. I \nhonestly cannot believe we are not doing that. I appreciate the Senator \nfor his enlightenment on that issue.\n  I yield to the Senator from Utah for a question.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I cannot let this exchange go without giving a word or \ntwo of explanation. The Federal Reserve Board, as the Senator from Iowa \nhas accurately stated, was created by the Congress, and presents to the \nCongress an audited statement of its financials every year. It is \naddressed to the Speaker of the House.\n  It is true that it was not done by the General Accounting Office, but \nthey are audited by a legitimate outside auditor, and their activities, \ndown to the penny, are reported to the Speaker\n\n[[Page S10756]]\n\nof the House in a written document every year. I will be happy to \nsupply it to any Member of this body that may wish it.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for this enlightenment.\n  I am responding to what the Senator from Nevada said, that they were \nnot audited.\n  Mr. BENNETT. The Senator from Nevada is correct; they are not audited \nregularly by the General Accounting Office, but it is audited. A copy \nof the audited and exact financial activities of the Federal Reserve \nBoard are submitted in writing to the Speaker of the House every year.\n  I have constituents who are constantly saying to me that the Federal \nReserve Board is owned by a group of Swiss bankers or foreign interests \nsomewhere and that it has never been audited. I always send them a copy \nof the audited report of the Federal Reserve Board that is submitted to \nthe Speaker so that they can know that this creation of the Congress \ndoes not go unexamined by an appropriate auditing firm.\n  It is true to say that it is not audited regularly by the General \nAccounting Office. I think that is the point the Senator from Nevada \nwas making. However, I think we should not let people be under the \nassumption that the Federal Reserve Board goes without anybody paying \nany attention to how they handle their money.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Without losing my right to the floor, I yield for a \nfurther answer from the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Utah through the Senator from Iowa \nthat I think this is something that really deserves a debate. I hope \nthat when our bill is offered on a subsequent occasion that the Banking \nCommittee will at least give us a hearing on this.\n  I say to my friend from Utah, yes, there is a document that they call \nan audit, but it is a self-audit. You cannot audit yourself. That is, \nin effect, what has happened. We think there should be oversight by the \nCongress of the United States which created the Federal Reserve System. \nThey shouldn't be able to hire whoever they want to look at their \nbooks. They may do a great job, but from a perception standpoint it \ndoesn't look great.\n  When the General Accounting Office tried to get the information \nrequested by the Senator from Nevada and the Senator from North Dakota, \nit was extremely difficult to get. The Federal Reserve System is an \nisland to itself. They don't like to be messed with, bothered, or give \ninformation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If I might yield further without losing my right to the \nfloor, I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am happy to have a debate about this \nwith the Senator from Nevada or anyone else. I think it is a legitimate \nissue to be aired, but I did not want to let the opportunity go by with \nthe misimpression that some might have gathered. I know it was not \nintended for the Senator from Nevada to grant that misimpression, but \nsome might have the misimpression that the Federal Reserve Board does \nnot respond to the Congress that created it in an orderly fashion.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If I might say to my friend from Utah and Nevada, is it \nproscribed by law that the GAO cannot audit the Federal Reserve? Is \nthat proscribed or is it just that they don't do it until we tell them \nto do it?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Iowa, I can't answer that question. \nI just know they don't do it. They have never done it.\n  When we asked for the review by the General Accounting Office of the \nFederal Reserve System, they fought us every step of the way. It took 2 \nyears to get information that should have been obtained in a matter of \na couple of months.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask the Senator from Utah if they do this audit that \nthe Senator says is done what would be wrong with having the GAO do \ntheir own separate audit? What is wrong with that?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I don't know, either, I say to the Senator from Iowa. I \nhave not looked into that.\n  Frankly, I have examined the annual report that the Fed submits to \nthe Congress, addressed, as I say, to the Speaker of the House every \nyear. They do it in accordance with law. They respond to the law that \ncreated them in that fashion. At least to my satisfaction, after \nexamining that document, I haven't felt the need for any additional \ninformation.\n\n  As to whether there is a legal proscription against GAO, I have no \nknowledge one way or the other.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Utah.\n  Again, this raises another issue that was not in the sense-of-the-\nCongress amendment that I sent to the desk on which we just expressed \nourselves.\n  I wanted to get back to the point, again, that it is a creature of \nCongress. I am somewhat disturbed, not so much by the outcome of the \nvote. I have lost votes around this place before. That is not the \npoint. But the issue is the kind of talk that I heard among Senators \nafter voting on this that, (a) we shouldn't politicize the Fed; (b) we \nshouldn't tell the Fed what to do; (c) the Fed is a separate entity and \nwe shouldn't have anything to do with them.\n  I just don't understand where this comes from. I don't understand why \nthis is the perception of so many people. I don't know why the Federal \nReserve System has become so sacrosanct that we simply cannot deal with \nit. It is like the ``Holy of Holies.''\n  I find it strange that, as policymakers, we can't stand up and tell \nthe Fed what we think they should do. That is not politicizing it. To \npoliticize it would be for us to pass a law mandating that interest \nrates be at a certain level, or a law mandating that the Federal \nReserve should vote this way or that. That is politicizing. That is \nwhat this Senator would even vote against.\n  But for the Senate to say to the Federal Reserve, a creature of the \nCongress, we have looked at the landscape, we see what is happening in \nour economy, we see what is happening worldwide, we don't like what we \nsee. We believe that the time has come to lower interest rates. We \nbelieve something should be done.\n  Now, again, I see nothing wrong with this debate. I think that is \npart not only of our rights, but our responsibility.\n  I want to take a couple more minutes to say why I believe so deeply \nand so strongly that we should be saying to the Fed that they should \nlower interest rates. Sometimes you would think this is a liberal \nproposition. I don't define it in terms of left, right, liberal, \nconservative. I really don't define it in that way. I define it in \nterms of whether or not we believe interest rates should be lower or \nwhether we think they shouldn't be lower; whether we think the economy \nis going into a recession, or whether we think the economy may be \nverging on inflation. If you think the economy is experiencing an \nacceleration of inflation, you would not want to cut interest rates; if \nyou think the economy is verging on recession, you would want to lower \ninterest rates.\n  That is where I believe we are. Don't take my word for it. I will \npoint out what the Business Roundtable said on September 16, last week:\n\n       The President and Congress should encourage the Federal \n     Reserve to lower U.S. interest rates. In addition, the \n     President, Congress and the Federal Reserve should work with \n     our international trading partners to stimulate their \n     domestic economies.\n       . . .. should encourage the Federal Reserve to lower U.S. \n     interest rates.\n\n  It doesn't say we should ask the Fed to ``consider.'' It doesn't say \nthat. It says they should ``lower'' the rates, not ``consider.''\n  There is talk that the Senator from New Mexico wants an amendment to \nsay that we would just consider, that we should tell the Fed they \nshould consider lowering interest rates. I don't believe that language \nis strong enough. Again, it is as if for some reason we almost have to \nask the Fed for their permission to tell them what we think they should \ndo.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield for a question to my friend from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, for some reason I don't understand, as \nwell, why Senators are unwilling to speak to this issue and provide our \njudgment about what should be done. We don't talk about monetary policy \nmuch.\n  The Business Roundtable says, ``The President and Congress should \nencourage the Federal Reserve to lower U.S.\n\n[[Page S10757]]\n\ninterest rates.'' The Business Roundtable doesn't fit into the label \n``liberal,'' although I think that label is irrelevant. Why has the \nBusiness Roundtable taken that position? What is it about real interest \nrates that is so important to the people you represent in Iowa and the \npeople I represent in Minnesota? Can we talk for a moment about that?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Sure. I thank the Senator. That is really the point. I \nhave a chart to show that the real Federal funds rate is at its highest \nlevel in nine years. What does that mean? What that means is that real \nrates of interest are at a very high point. For example, even Chairman \nGreenspan said earlier this year that real interest rates are at a \nhistorically high level, compared to all the years from World War II \nuntil now.\n  What does that mean? Well, that means that the farmers in America \nwhose commodity prices are going down all the time, our livestock \nproducers and our farmers have to pay exorbitantly high interest \nrates--real interest rates--when they are already squeezed with low \nprices. It means that our business sector, small businesses, and others \nwho are creating jobs, who need to borrow money for expansion or even \nfor job training or retraining, find that they are squeezed because of \nhigh interest rates. So they don't do it. So what happens then is our \neconomy starts to slow down.\n  I will point out that in the first quarter of this year, our growth \nwas 5.5 percent; it was 1.6 percent in the last quarter. Many economic \nsigns point to a possible recession, possibly a downward spiral in \nprices. Then we see what is happening in foreign economies and in \nforeign currencies. Because of our high interest rates, we find that \ntheir economies are going down and they, in turn, can't buy any of our \nproducts because of the excessively strong dollar that we have. So when \nyou add it all up, because of the insistence of the Fed to keep a tight \nmoney policy, high interest rate policy, they have moved us to the \nbrink of recession.\n  In further responding to the Senator's question, from 1994 to 1995 \nthe Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 100 percent, from three \npercent to six percent. They raised interest rates because they were \nbeholden--most of them, or at least the voting majority--to an economic \ntheory called NAIRU, Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment. \nThat is a fancy term. What some economists have believed in the past is \nif unemployment fell to a certain level, inflation would take off and \nit would spiral upward and accelerate--it would not just rise, it would \naccelerate, if unemployment got to a certain level.\n  Well, a couple years ago, economists said they thought that rate was \n6 percent. They thought that if unemployment went below 6 percent, we \nwould be in deep trouble. Then unemployment went below 6 percent and \nthe Fed said, ``Oh, my gosh, we have to tighten monetary policy,'' and \nthey started raising interest rates. Inflation never went up. Then \nunemployment went down. And, they said, ``Well, we changed our minds. \nThe natural rate of unemployment is actually 5.5 percent.'' Well, then \nunemployment went below 5.5 percent. Now we are at 4.5 percent \nunemployment, and still no inflation. Yet, the Federal Reserve has \ncontinued to keep a tight money, high interest rate policy in effect, \nbecause they were afraid; they felt that because of this economic \ntheory, inflation was going to take off.\n  What happened is, because of that high interest rate policy, our \nfarmers are squeezed, our consumers are squeezed, homeowners have to \npay more monthly interest on mortgages on their homes, small businesses \npay more money when they borrow to expand, or they just don't do it. A \nlarger business, whether it is General Motors or Ford, would have to \npay higher interest rates. The economy starts to slow down. That is \nexactly what happened.\n  I submit further to my friend from Minnesota that because of their \npolicies over the last couple years, because they would not move, it \nhas helped generate the kind of economic collapse we have seen in other \nparts of the world. The high interest rate policy at the Fed is a \ncontributing factor to the continual decline of the Asian economy.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If the Senator will yield, I will not take much more \ntime. I have two quick questions, I say to my colleague from Florida, \nbecause I know he is waiting. I will ask the question to the Senator \nfrom Iowa who gives the lengthy answers. I think it is just incredible, \nI say to my colleague from Iowa, it is just incredible how this whole \nissue of real interest rates and monetary policy--which has such a \ncritical impact on small business, on farmers, and on industry and \nhousing --is taken off the table. We are even unwilling to give our \nbest judgment as to what the Federal Reserve ought to do. It is amazing \nto me.\n  Let me ask you this question: Would you agree----\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will keep it short.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I want to hear the Senator's answer, because this is a \ncritical issue. Would you agree that our taking the lead in lowering \nshort-term interest rates also would be critical to what the Germans \nmight do, what the other G-7 countries might do? Shouldn't this be put \nin the context of a coordinated response at an international level, \ndealing with this contraction of the international economy, dealing \nwith this problem of deflation? Maybe you could spell out a little bit \nwhat you mean.\n  In other words, the Senator talked about the effects of high real \ninterests rates within our country, but could we not also say another \npart of the argument is the effect on exchange rates? That a strong \ndollar ultimately means other countries will try and export their way \nout of crisis? That they will dump a lot of products on our market and \nend up competing with workers in our country?\n  Aren't you really saying that, in the absence of something being done \nthrough monetary policy, we are not going to be able to get enough \ndemand going in these countries? That we are not going to have enough \neconomic stimulus? That people are not going to have money to buy \nproducts, which would help create jobs? And that the major problem is \nnot going to be what you were talking about--inflation, which the Fed \nseems to be excessively focused on--but deflation? Am I not correct \nthat that is part of what is going on?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Bill Greider, who wrote, ``One World: Ready or Not,'' \nhas been talking about this for some time. In part, you are talking \nabout the effects of monetary policy within our country. But you are \nalso talking about our taking the lead in trying to fashion a \ncoordinated response at an international level to deal with what has \nhappened. We have a depression in part of the international economy.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator is right. I wish the Fed would pay more \nattention to Bill Greider's writings. Monetary policy has to work for \nall of our people, not just a few. It has to be cognizant of what is \nhappening to ordinary people in this country.\n  As the Senator spoke about what is happening internationally, I was \nlooking through the papers. The Wall Street Journal pointed this out in \nan editorial on August 31, calling for the Fed to lower interest rates. \nThey said, ``Since last year, currencies in emerging markets, from \nThailand to Russia, have been collapsing like popped bubble wrap.'' \nThis is a significant threat to us and people in those countries. Our \ndollar is much too strong right now. Because of that, they can't get \nthe kinds of foodstuffs and things they need for their own people.\n  (Ms. COLLINS assumed the Chair.)\n  If we want to help the Japanese economy and the Asian economy, what \nwe should do is lower interest rates. Many economists have noted that \nthe value of currencies in several countries will not only reduce the \nrate of inflation but also sharply increase our trade deficit, \neliminating many jobs and slowing growth in the process.\n  Again, if we don't address this because of their slowdown, because \nthey are not buying our products, we are going to lose jobs in this \ncountry. We are going to have a drastic slowdown.\n  The fear I have, I say to my friend from Minnesota, is that we may \nhave waited too long. The Fed was so frozen by this outdated, outmoded \neconomic concept called NAIRU that they couldn't see what was really \nhappening because they only focused on the rate of unemployment, and \nthat caused them to be blind to everything else that was going on.\n\n[[Page S10758]]\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask my colleague, this concept that he is talking \nabout--NAIRU--is the idea that if you reduce employment too much, you \nautomatically set off an inflationary spiral?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Inflation would not only start but accelerate.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. My last question, I say to my colleague--and I look \nforward to coming to the floor and having a further discussion about \nthis. I hope we are wrong. But I think this discussion of political \neconomy, both in terms of what is happening to the global economy and \nalso what is happening in our own economy, is going to become a very, \nvery critical issue. We are seeing it already in agriculture. But this \nis just the beginning.\n  But this is my last question. Is it not also true that, when they \ntalk about the alleged danger of unemployment continuing to go down, \nthat this would also bring up the bargaining power of wage earners? It \nwouldn't be just a matter of unemployment going down. This would also \nmean that people in a tight labor market would see their wages go up \nand would have a better chance of working at living-wage jobs? I think \nthe Federal Reserve Board tends to be more responsive to bond holders, \nfinancial people, and the creditors, and they want to keep interest \nrates up.\n  Isn't it also true that having real interest rates so high is one of \nthe reasons we have a maldistribution of wealth and income today in \nthis country? We have this paradox of some people being able to \npurchase all the goods that make life richer in possibility. But then \nwe also have so many families--maybe the majority of families in our \ncountry--who cannot. Maybe this is one of these hidden issues that we \ndon't talk about, with everything swirling around in Washington, that \nso many families are still struggling to make ends meet and do well by \ntheir kids.\n  What would be the harm in moving toward full employment? What would \nbe the harm in making sure that wage earners make better wages? What \nwould be the harm in having more people have access to living-wage \njobs? Isn't the whole question of real interest rates one piece of it?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to the Senator from Minnesota that he is absolutely \ncorrect.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I agree.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is bigger by a tremendous magnitude.\n  We deal here in budgets in terms of billions of dollars. I know it \nsounds like a lot of money. But what the Fed does affects the entire $7 \ntrillion economy.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is absolutely right, what the Federal \nReserve System does has a more profound effect on the daily lives of \nour citizens--how they live, how they are able to take care of their \nfamilies, what kind of jobs they have, and what they have paid--than \nanything that we ever vote on around here in terms of budget matters.\n  I thank the Senator for his inquiries and enlightenment on this \nissue. He has been a long-time fighter for the average working families \nand making sure that working people get a fair deal. I know the Senator \nfrom Minnesota understands that if you have lower interest rates, that \nhelps working families. It helps families.\n  The Senator from Minnesota also knows, as most of us know, that in \nthe last couple of years, with this tight money policy, this high \ninterest rate policy at the Federal Reserve, some people have said, \n``Well, gee, whatever they have done has been good. Our economy is \ngreat. Whatever the Fed has done is good. Look at what is happening in \nour economy. Look what is happening in our economy. Unemployment is \ndown.''\n  That is true. But if unemployment is so low, I ask you, why is it \nthat when I went to Sioux City last Friday and visited the food bank, \nor earlier on when I visited the food bank in Des Moines, I was told by \nthe directors of those two food banks that their demand for commodity \nfoods--that the USDA commodities plus the food they get contributed \nfrom businesses, churches, and schools--is skyrocketing higher than \never?\n  I did some checking. It is not only in Iowa, but in almost every \nState, the demand for food at our food banks has gone up in the last \nyear or so. Why? If everyone is working, unemployment is so low, and \nthe Fed has done such a great job, it is because, as I have been told \nand as I have found out, many of these people are working--usually \nsingle parents, usually single mothers with one or more children. They \ngo to work every day. They work every day. They make a paycheck. They \nqualify for food stamps. They get food stamps. And then the food stamps \nrun out before the end of the month. The only place they have to go is \nto the food bank to get free food.\n  Don't take my word for it. Ask your staffs. Go out and ask your food \nbanks. In any State, go out and ask those food banks. Find out what is \nhappening. You will find that it is true. The demand for food from \nthose food banks has gone up and continues to go up, and they are \nconcerned about what is going to happen this winter.\n  What has that to do with the Federal Reserve System? I am just \nsaying, if they have done such a good job in this economy, why are they \nfalling below the safety net? Because the high interest rate policy has \nignored what is happening to the working families of America. A lower \ninterest rate policy, everyone agrees, might mean that wages might go \nup and that businesses might be able to pay more in wages. I don't see \nanything drastically wrong with that. I think it would be a good thing \nfor this country if wages went up. It would give people a little bit \nmore buying power.\n  Again, what we are seeing happen in our country happened in the \n1920s. Fewer and fewer people are making more and more money. More and \nmore people are making less and less and having less of a stake in our \neconomy. It is true. It is happening in the agriculture sector, too.\n  Neil Harroly, the distinguished agricultural economist at Iowa State, \nsaid what we are seeing in agriculture is not like the 1980s, it is \nlike the 1920s. I think that is also what we are seeing happening in \nour country, too. So that is why I make the strong case that we have an \nobligation.\n  I see my friend from Florida is ready to speak. I am going to wrap up \nvery shortly, but I just want to make a couple of points.\n  The Federal Open Market Committee may or may not be in a mode to \nlower interest rates. I quote the September 18 issue of the Christian \nScience Monitor, which noted that some Fed policymakers ``remain in a \nhawkish anti-inflation mode rather than worrying about the impact of \ndeflation.''\n  These include William Poole, president of the St. Louis Regional Fed; \nFed Governor Edward Gramlich; and an analyst, Jerry Gordon, president \nof the Cleveland Fed.\n  I don't say that. I am just quoting from the Christian Science \nMonitor.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From Christian Science Monitor, September 18, 1998]\n\nNew Signs of Weakness In U.S. Economic `Fortress' Forecast For Slowdown\n\n                         (By David R. Francis)\n\n       Concern is growing in the top echelons of Wall Street and \n     Washington that cheap exports from overseas--everything from \n     shovels to chopsticks--may drive down the American economy. \n     The ``R'' word--recession--is now being heard more often.\n       As troubles persist in East Asia, Russia, and Latin \n     America, US companies are finding fewer buyers for their \n     goods overseas while foreign products are filling US shelves \n     and showrooms. The concern was reflected on Wall Street \n     Thursday, as stock prices plunged in early trading.\n       It was a ``double whammy,'' says Joel Prakken, chief \n     economist of Macroeconomic Advisers in St. Louis. Investors \n     were disturbed by new statistics on the American economy and \n     by unsettling testimony to Congress by Federal Reserve \n     Chairman Alan Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin \n     Wednesday.\n       Though terming the United States economy strong, Mr. \n     Greenspan noted, ``There are the first signs of erosion at \n     the edges, especially in manufacturing.''\n       A plunge in prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange to a 12-year \n     low didn't help. In New York Thursday, the Dow Jones \n     Industrial Average dropped more than 200 points in early \n     trading.\n       Economists still are forecasting moderate economic growth \n     in the US this year and in 1999. ``The slowdown is a little \n     worse than we thought,'' says David Wyss, chief economist of \n     Standard & Poor's DRI, an economic consulting firm in \n     Lexington, Mass. ``And the risks of a recession are \n     rising.''\n\n[[Page S10759]]\n\n       Nonetheless, DRI sees growth in the national output of \n     goods and services at about a 2.5 percent annual rate the \n     rest of this year, helped by a rebound from the General \n     Motors strike. Mr. Wyss predicts 1.5 percent growth next \n     year.\n       He would like to see the Federal Reserve cut interest \n     rates. Wall Street would, too. It wants interest rates \n     lowered by other industrial nations as well. One reason for \n     the less-than-happy face of many investors yesterday was Mr. \n     Greenspan's testimony that, ``at the moment, there is no \n     endeavor to coordinate interest-rate cuts'' among the major \n     powers.\n       Wyss hopes for and expects lower U.S. rates by the end of \n     the year, though not necessarily at the Fed's next gathering \n     Sept. 29.\n       Some of those policymakers remain in a hawkish anti-\n     inflation mode, rather than worrying about the impact of \n     falling prices (deflation). These include William Poole, \n     president of the St. Louis regional Fed, Fed Governor Edward \n     Gramlich, and, analysts say, Jerry Jordan, president of the \n     Cleveland Fed. ``They have got to come around,'' says Wyss. \n     ``I'm not sure what it will take.''\n       Some, though, oppose a Fed rate cut at this time. They \n     don't see the economy slowing that much. Prakken, for one, \n     expects a 2 percent growth in gross domestic product next \n     year.\n       One concern of economists is that the decline in stock \n     prices itself will hurt growth. Wyss figures $2 trillion in \n     paper household wealth disappeared between the July 17 peak \n     in the stock market and the end of August. If the downturn \n     lasts, it could trim consumer spending by as much as $50 \n     billion.\n       The Asian crisis has hit U.S. exports hard, too. ``The \n     trade data were terrible,'' says Wyss.\n       The U.S. trade deficit widened to $13.9 billion in July. \n     Currency devaluations and depressed economies in Asia \n     resulted in exports hitting a 17-month low.\n       So far this year, the trade deficit in goods and services \n     is running at a record annual rate of $185 billion, 68 \n     percent higher than last year's record deficit of $110 \n     billion. America's deficit with Pacific Rim countries hit \n     $87.8 billion in the first seven months--42 percent above the \n     imbalance for the period in 1997.\n       ``The trade balance could get a lot worse if there is \n     another round of devaluations,'' warns C. Fred Bergsten, \n     director of the Institute of International Economics in \n     Washington.\n       The inflation news was not so bad. In August, the Consumer \n     Price Index was up a seasonally adjusted 0.2 percent, same as \n     in July. For the year, inflation is running at a 1.6 percent \n     annual rate, compared with 1.7 percent for all of last year.\n       Prakken expresses concern that the ``core'' inflation \n     rate--a measure that removes volatile energy and food \n     prices--is up 2.5 percent for the past year. His partial \n     explanation of the stock market decline is that Wall Street \n     is finally recognizing that corporate shares have been \n     overpriced, and that earnings will not rise nearly as much as \n     analysts had anticipated.\n       He expects a ``virtual stall'' in earnings. The reasons: \n     reduced profits from overseas operation as well as rising \n     wages at home and difficulties in cost cutting.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the President.\n  As David Wisk, chief economist of Standard & Poor's DRI, has \ncomplained, ``They have got to come around. I'm not sure what it will \ntake.''\n  Let me repeat that. As David Wisk, chief economist of Standard & \nPoor's DRI, said, ``They''--the Federal Reserve--``have got to come \naround. I'm not sure what it will take.''\n  I thought one of the things it might take is for the Senate of the \nUnited States to clearly express itself to the members of the Federal \nOpen Market Committee to lower interest rates now.\n  There are increasing signs of a possible recession. Thirty-year \nTreasury bond rates have sunk to record lows and are now below the \nshort-term Federal funds rate. This is a drastic warning signal.\n  Again, I would point to the chart here ``30-year Bonds'' now lower \nthan the Federal funds rate. That should scare us all. That should \npoint to what we have to do in terms of lowering our short-term \ninterest rates. Wholesale prices slid a steep 0.4 percent in August. In \nfact, for the first 8 months of this year producer prices have fallen \nat a 1.4-percent annual rate, compared with a 1.2-percent rise in 1997.\n  Again, I have talked about our farmers at great length and about what \nis happening to them and what is happening to our commodity prices.\n  I would start to wrap up my comments again just by saying that if \nsomeone voted because they don't want to lower interest rates, that is \nfine. While I think they are wrong, I will be glad to debate that, if \nwe could ever get a debate on this issue in the Senate; no one seems to \nwant to debate that issue.\n  Do we say somehow we can't express ourselves in telling the Federal \nOpen Market Committee that they should lower interest rates--our \nlanguage said promptly reduce interest rates--that somehow we can't say \nthat because the Fed is independent, because the Fed is so sacrosanct \nthat we can't touch it, that somehow we have to couch it in weak terms \nsuch as the Fed should only ``consider'' lowering interest rates? Why \ndo we have to beg the Federal Open Market Committee to do something? \nDoes the Congress of the United States work for the Federal Reserve \nSystem? Are they our bosses? Are they the ones who pull the strings and \ntell us what we can and cannot do?\n  We seem very reluctant in even expressing our views, because somehow \nit would politicize the Fed. We were not politicizing the Fed; that \nwould take legislation. This was a sense-of-the-Congress, a non-binding \nresolution.\n  I hope that the members of the Federal Open Market Committee will \npromptly reduce interest rates six days from today. Unfortunately, as \nthe Christian Science Monitor recently reported, there are members of \nthe Fed Open Market Committee who still believe we should worry about \nan acceleration in inflation. I am just hopeful that Mr. Greenspan and \nothers do not take this vote as a vote that they should not reduce \ninterest rates.\n  A number of Senators said to me, ``Well, that's what they are going \nto do anyway.'' Well, I am not so certain. I hope they will. They \nshould have reduced interest rates two years ago when I took to the \nfloor at that time and started calling on the Fed to do that because \nthere were drastic signs in our economy, that there was little \ninflation in the economy, that there was no reason for them not to \nreduce interest rates at that time to help our farmers and our working \nfamilies out there. I just hope it is not too late. I just hope that \nthe Federal Reserve does not misinterpret this vote.\n  One of the reasons that I objected to the Senator from New Mexico \nbringing up this other sense of the Senate that would just ask them to \nconsider lowering interest rates is that I personally believe it is \nbeneath our dignity and our responsibility and rights as Senators to go \nhat in hand to the Federal Reserve and sort of beg them to do something \nwhen we ought to be able to stand on our own two feet and tell them \nwhat we believe they should do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, before proceeding with my remarks, I ask \nunanimous consent that Ms. Allison Morgan, of my staff, be granted \nfloor privileges during the remaining consideration of the bankruptcy \nreform bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT JUDGES\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I rise to discuss the issue of the \ncongressional response, or in this case, the lack of response to the \nneed for additional Federal district court judges. We are facing an \nincreasing disparity between the judicial resources available at many \nof our Federal district courts and the workload imposed upon those \njudges.\n  The question might be asked, ``Why are you offering this amendment to \na bankruptcy reform bill?'' It is interesting to note that the \nunderlying legislation would create 18 new Federal bankruptcy \njudgeships. The basis of those 18 new Federal bankruptcy judgeships is \nthat this legislation is created in response to additional workloads \nrequiring that additional number of judges in order to discharge their \nresponsibilities.\n  I suggest that, similarly, we should apply the same rationale to our \nFederal district court judges, and that is--that as their workload \nincreases, either because of demographic or economic or social \ncircumstances, or because we add to their workload by expanding their \njurisdiction, it is our commensurate responsibility to increase the \nnumber of Federal district judge positions. These judge positions are \nresponsible for handling some of the most complex civil and criminal \ncases in our judiciary.\n  In recognition of that, in March of 1997, the Judicial Conference of \nthe\n\n[[Page S10760]]\n\nUnited States, chaired by the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, \nrecommended the creation of 24 additional permanent and 12 additional \ntemporary Federal district court positions. The Judicial Conference \nalso recommended the establishment of 12 additional judges to the \ncircuit courts of appeals. However, my remarks this afternoon are \nconfined to the needs that exist with the U.S. district court judges.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Will the Senator from Florida yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I will yield to my friend and colleague from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I appreciate the courtesy of the senior Senator from \nFlorida.\n  I note from the chart the Senator has brought to the floor that the \nState of Nevada is included. The Judicial Conference has recommended, \nas I understand, two additional district court judges for Nevada. Would \nit be the Senator's intention to include in the amendment that he is \nabout to discuss with greater particularity the two additional judges \nthat were recommended by the Conference for Nevada?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Absolutely, I say to my friend. I am not proposing that \nthis Congress insert its greater wisdom for that of the Judicial \nConference. I am proposing that we accede to the wisdom of the Judicial \nConference and where it, for instance, has recommended two additional \npermanent Federal judgeships in Nevada, that the Congress should \nsanction them. The reason for the recommendation of two additional \njudges in Nevada is that, of the 93 districts, including those in the \n50 States plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, of that \nnumber, the Nevada district ranks eighth in terms of caseload. Its \ncaseload of 736 cases per judge is 171 percent of the stated standard \nthat is used by the Judicial Conference to indicate that new judges are \nneeded.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I appreciate the statesmanship my friend has provided and \nthe information that is made available with respect to the situation in \nNevada. I might just add to the comments of the Senator that, having \nlived in Nevada for more than 57 years and knowing each of our four \ndistrict court judges personally, I do not know of a harder working \nbench at either the State or Federal level anywhere in America. \nFrankly, it required considerable statesmanship of the former chief \njudge in Nevada in electing to take senior status, which the Senator \nfrom Florida fully understands, that allowed a new district court judge \nto come on board. That senior judge, together with another colleague of \nhis who is a senior judge, maintains an extraordinarily active \ncaseload. So that has helped but has not eliminated the backlog to \nwhich the Senator has addressed his comments.\n  I must say, ``justice delayed is justice denied.'' The State of \nNevada has the fastest growing population in the country over the past \ndecade. That is reflected in the litigation in the Federal court \nsystem, based not only in the demographics but other situations which I \nam sure the Senator will allude to. So I want to join with the Senator \nfrom Florida in calling this very important issue to the attention of \nour colleagues and the American people. This is not an issue about \nlawyers or judges per se. What we are talking about are the needs of \npeople who have their issues brought to the Federal court system and \nwho are entitled to have those issues resolved in a prompt manner. With \nrespect to those who violate Federal law, they need to have those \nmatters addressed promptly in the interests of justice for all \nAmericans. I think the proposal the Senator is about to unveil and \nexplain in greater detail is entitled to the support of our colleagues. \nI wish him well and pledge my support in his efforts.\n  I thank him again for his leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I appreciate those very generous comments of the Senator. \nAs my colleague knows, his State is not alone. This map indicates in \nblue those States that have been determined by the Judicial Conference, \nchaired by our chief justice, to require one or more additional Federal \njudges in order to keep pace with that particular judicial district's \nworkload.\n  The States of Alabama, California, Florida, New Mexico, North \nCarolina, Texas, Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New York, Oregon and \nVirginia would all receive permanent additional judges under the \nJudicial Conference's report.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Senator for his comments.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. As an example--I see we are joined by the Senator from \nAlabama. The middle district of his State happens to be the seventh \nbusiest district in the country with a workload that is 176 percent of \nthe standard which the Judicial Conference utilizes in assessing \nwhether an additional Federal district judge is appropriate.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator from Florida yield?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I yield to the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I do respect the concern of the Senator \nfrom Florida. As a Federal prosecutor for almost 15 years in Alabama, \nwhich is part of the 11th circuit, of which Florida is a part--the 11th \ncircuit, I have come to admire and be extremely impressed with the \nworkload and work ethic of the Florida Federal judges, as well as the \nAlabama Federal judges. Both groups have very high caseloads, higher \nthan the national average. I think probably the middle district of \nFlorida, and maybe the southern district of Florida, are two of the top \ndistricts in the country in so needing additional judges. The middle \ndistrict of Alabama, as you noted, has one of the very highest \ncaseloads.\n  I would share, this bankruptcy bill actually reduces the workload for \nFederal district judges a bit by not having them handle appeals from \nbankruptcy. That is the only thing it really affects for Federal \ndistrict judges, because bankruptcy judges are separate.\n  I would just want to advise the Senator from Florida, I share his \nconcern, but I have been working with Senator Grassley, who chairs this \nsubcommittee involving courts and administrative matters. He has been \nstudying this. We have been having some hearings from judges, \nparticularly courts of appeals. But we have not, in depth, analyzed \nthis problem yet. I know Senator Grassley intends to.\n  I would like to share some things. If a business had a court like the \nmiddle district of Florida that not only has a heavy caseload--it has \ncomplicated, big drug cases, international cases--they would probably \nlook at the D.C. circuit that has 15 judges and they average 259 cases \nper judge instead of 855 in Florida and they might decide the \ntaxpayers--or their business--would be better served if we shifted some \nfrom places that are not so busy to those that are more busy. I hope we \nwill be able to analyze that, because a Federal judgeship, once you \napprove it, is a lifetime appointment. They get it for life and it \ncosts $1 million a year for each Federal judge. What we need to begin \nto look at is some of those circuits that need to shift some judges to \nhigh-work districts. We could do that over the years. I think Senator \nGrassley is committed to this. I am on that subcommittee so I am \nconcerned about it. If we do it right, we can improve justice with a \nminimal cost to the taxpayer. I think that is what we are called to do \nand I thank the Senator from Florida for raising the problem.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom Alabama who, from his long experience in a variety of significant \nlegal positions, is very familiar with the basic principle of my \nremarks, which is the relationship between changing workload and demand \non judicial resources.\n  The Judicial Conference has proposed as a method of balancing that \nworkload of judicial resources--a formula. That formula essentially \ntakes the number of cases filed within a particular Federal district, \nweights those cases based on their complexity, and then divides that \nnumber by the number of judges currently assigned to the district. The \nstandard for each Federal district judge is 430 weighted cases per \nyear. When the caseload exceeds 430, that district is entitled to be \nreviewed for purposes of an additional judge. These judgeships are \nneeded to help the Federal judiciary, a co-equal branch of our \nGovernment, to fulfill its constitutional obligations. It should be \nunderstood that Congress has not granted the Federal judiciary any \nadditional Article III judges since 1990.\n  During the previous three occasions on which Congress has authorized \nnew Federal judgeships under the standards of the Judicial Conference, \nthe cycle\n\n[[Page S10761]]\n\nfor such authorization has been six years. For instance, in September \nof 1976, the Judicial Conference recommended 106 permanent and 1 \ntemporary Federal district judge. Congress considered that \nrecommendation and, on October 20, 1978, approved 113 permanent and 4 \ntemporary judges. That was done under a Senate which was in Democratic \ncontrol.\n  Mr. President, 6 years later, in September of 1982, the Judicial \nConference recommended 43 permanent, 8 temporary, and 2 conversions \nfrom temporary to permanent. On July 10, 1984, a Republican Senate \nauthorized 53 permanent, 8 temporary, and 2 temporary to permanent \nconversions.\n  In 1990, June, the Judicial Conference recommended 47 permanent, 29 \ntemporary, and various conversions. Then on December 1, 1990, a \nDemocratic Senate approved 61 permanent and 13 temporary and various \nconversions.\n\n  The point of this is that on a bipartisan basis, whether it was a \nRepublican Senate or a Democratic Senate, every 6 years since 1978, the \nCongress has responded to the Judicial Conference's recommendation. It \nis also significant that in each one of those cases, the Congress \nactually approved more judges than the Judicial Conference had \nrecommended.\n  However, the last recommendation that was made was in March of 1997, \nfollowing recommendations that were unheeded in September of 1992 and \nin September of 1994. There were recommendations made in March of 1996 \nto convert a temporary judge to a permanent judge and to convert a \ntemporary extended to a permanent status. But there have been no new \njudgeships created since December 1, 1990. So we are now 2 years past \nthe point which has been the standard for the creation of new Federal \njudgeships as recommended by the Judicial Conference.\n  Mr. President, I submit that it is high time for us to respond to the \nneed for more U.S. district court judges in accordance with the \nJudicial Conference's recommendation. Today, many of our district court \njudges are strained beyond capacity in trying to meet the increasing \ncaseloads which they face.\n  For example, in 1997, the Federal judiciary saw increases in both \ncriminal and civil cases.\n  The number of cases filed in the district courts increased by 24 \npercent.\n  The most significant increases occurred in drug and immigration \ncases, particularly, as this chart will indicate, in many of our border \nStates which are the front lines for drug and immigration litigation.\n  This growth in Federal caseloads has been coupled with a growing \ntrend by the Congress to federalize an increasing number of laws that \nhave traditionally been considered State responsibilities. These new \nlaws have opened our courts to more cases without the requisite judges \nto meet the demand. For that reason, it is essential that we take this \nopportunity to eliminate the disparity between resources and workload \nin the Federal judiciary by an expansion in the number of judges at the \nearliest possible time.\n  I do not submit my word as being final in this matter. Let me quote \nthe December of 1997 statement by the Chief Justice of the United \nStates Supreme Court and the Chair of the Judicial Conference, The \nhonorable William Rehnquist. This is what the Chief Justice had to say \nabout the current status of our Federal judiciary:\n\n       Fiscal year 1997 saw courts of appeals and bankruptcy \n     filings at the highest rates in history. District courts also \n     were very busy. In addition to a small increase in civil \n     filings, there was a five percent increase in criminal cases \n     in 1997, producing the largest federal criminal caseload in \n     sixty years.\n\n  The Chief Justice went on to say:\n\n       Many factors have produced this upward spiral, including \n     laws enacted by Congress that expand federal jurisdiction \n     over crimes involving drugs and firearms, Supreme Court \n     decisions, large class-action litigation, and changes in \n     executive prosecution policies.\n\n  I think our Chief Justice's statement is a strong message to the \nCongress, Mr. President.\n  If I can illustrate what is happening on a national basis by \nreference to what is happening in my home State of Florida, I have seen \nthe strain placed on the judiciary due to lack of adequate judicial \nresources needed to fulfill its constitutional obligations.\n  Two of Florida's three districts are feeling the crushing pressure of \nthis strain. These two districts have one of the highest caseloads per \njudge in the Nation. Under the Judicial Conference recommendation, \nFlorida should receive six additional judgeships that include two \nadditional judges in the southern district of Florida, three permanent \njudges in the middle district of Florida, and one temporary position in \nthe middle district.\n  In the southern district of Florida, the court's weighted filings \nstand at 590 per judgeship. This is in contrast to the average used by \nthe Judicial Conference of 430.\n  In the middle district, the story is even worse. This court's \nweighted filing is 809 filings per judgeship, which is 88 percent above \nthe acceptable levels the Judicial Conference has established, and is \nthe third highest number in the Nation.\n  Mr. President, if I can make reference to this chart which indicates \nthat as recently as 1990, the number of weighted cases in the middle \ndistrict of Florida were 509 as against a national average of 448. At \nthat time, the middle district was overburdened but not in a crisis \nsituation.\n  By 1993, the number had increased to 729, while the national average \nhad dropped to 417. It is significant that there were additional judges \nadded as a result of that December 1990 act of Congress, but it took a \nfull 3 years before the effect of those additional judges had the \nconsequence of reducing the average in the middle district of Florida \nto 575. No new judges have been added since that period, and currently, \nat the time of the preparation of this chart, the number was 812 \nweighted cases per judge in the middle district. I have heard that this \nfigure may have now grown to 855.\n  As a result of this, a significant case backlog has developed. \nCurrently, the middle district has 1,200 criminal cases pending and \nover 6,000 cases pending on the civil side.\n  In response to this growing backlog of civil cases, Florida's middle \ndistrict chief judge, Elizabeth Kovachevich, was forced this summer to \ndeclare a state of emergency. She closed the Federal courthouses in \nJacksonville and Orlando and reassigned these district judges to work \nwith the Tampa district judges in an aggressive targeting and disposing \nof the oldest pending civil cases. While such innovative measures may \nbe effective in the short term, Congress will need to find the long-\nterm solution of providing adequate judicial resources.\n  This increase in caseload is not only a problem for the Florida \ncourts, but nationally. This chart, again, illustrates the number of \nStates which the Judicial Conference has found additional judicial \nresources are required.\n  The southern district of California is 100 percent above acceptable \nlevels of the Judicial Conference; the district of Arizona, 83 percent \nabove acceptable levels. As our friend and colleague from Alabama has \nalready spoken, the middle district of Alabama is 76 percent over \nacceptable levels. The western district of North Carolina, 70 percent \nover acceptable levels.\n  The caseload in all of these districts, and all the other districts \nthe Judicial Conference has recommended for additional judgeships, only \nstand to get worse until Congress acts and acts with a sense of \nurgency.\n  The U.S. Federal district courts are the first line of defense for \nmost of our citizens involved in the Federal judicial system. Most \nFederal cases are disposed of at the district court level. But by not \nacting soon, we make it harder for thousands of crime victims and civil \nlitigants in our district courts to receive the justice which they \ndeserve.\n  Mr. President, as I have indicated, I am prepared to offer my \namendment to the bankruptcy bill to authorize additional Federal \njudgeships. Before proceeding, however, I would like to inquire as to \nthe plans for consideration of this issue by the Judiciary Committee \nnext year.\n  I wonder if my distinguished colleague from the State of Utah, \nchairman of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, which has oversight \non these matters, could engage me in a discussion regarding this \nmatter.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to engage in a discussion with \nthe distinguished Senator from Florida on the substance of this matter.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his time.\n\n[[Page S10762]]\n\n  I ask the chairman, is it his assessment that a number of Federal \ndistrict court jurisdictions face a growing disparity between resources \nand workload?\n  Mr. HATCH. I agree with the view that there appears to be a workload \nproblem facing a number of district courts in Florida and some other \nareas. The Senate Judiciary Committee intends to act to review the \nmatter and where necessary provide the additional judicial resources to \nthose jurisdictions in need, if warranted and appropriate.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. In my home State of Florida, I have seen the strain \nplaced on the Judiciary due to the lack of judicial resources needed to \nfulfill its constitutional obligations.\n  Will the Senator from Utah agree to review the Judicial Conference \nrecommendations and the need for additional judges early next year?\n  Mr. HATCH. As I have indicated to my colleague, I will, as the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, review this matter early next year \nand work with my colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley, in a good-faith \neffort to consider this issue early next year.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank Senator Hatch for his support and for his work in \nthis area critical to the State of Florida and the Nation.\n  I also thank the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts for their \nassistance during this process.\n  I look forward to working with all my Senate colleagues in \nconsidering this important issue in future.\n  Mr. President, in our colloquy, Senator Hatch recognizes, as he has \ndone on many previous occasions, the importance of a strong judiciary \nin order to meet our Government's responsibility of equal justice to \nall of its citizens, and indicates that it is his intention that the \nJudiciary Committee consider this urgent need for additional judicial \nresources early in the next Congress. So I will desist from offering an \namendment at this time on this legislation to that effect, and look \nforward to working with Senator Hatch and the other members of the \nJudiciary Committee to see that this important responsibility of the \nCongress is discharged as quickly as possible.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I come before the Senate in support of \ntoday's colloquy regarding Federal judgeship needs in Florida. Although \nI was unable to participate in the colloquy between my esteemed \ncolleagues, Senators Hatch and Graham, I wish to express my support for \ntheir position. It is my hope that the Judiciary Committee will lend \nserious consideration to Florida's unique and acute judgeship needs.\n  The pressures currently upon Florida's court system, particularly in \nthe Middle District, are some of the most severe in the nation. The \nJudicial Conference of the United States has recommended three \npermanent district judgeships and one temporary judgeship for the \nMiddle District. This is the most judgeships recommended for any \nfederal district in the nation.\n  Statistics kept by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts \nunderscore the need for additional judgeships in this district. Recent \nstatistics place Florida's Middle District second in the nation in \nweighted case filings per judge, with an average of 855. This is far \nabove the national average of 519 weighted case filings per judge. It \nis expected that these numbers will continue to climb, given this \narea's explosive population growth. Although fifty-five percent of \nFlorida's population currently resides in the Middle District, the \ndistrict is home to only one-third of the state's federal judges. \nAccording to projected population growth figures, the Middle District \nwill comprise two-thirds of the state's population by the year 2005.\n  The Middle District contains some of the world's most frequently \nvisited cities, beaches and tourist attractions, including Disney World \nin Orlando and Busch Gardens in Tampa. The heavy flow of both tourists \nand the ``snowbird'' population serve to make the needs of this \njudicial district unique.\n  Adding to this problem, what will be the nation's largest federal \nprison, the Coleman Prison Complex, is scheduled to be completed in \n1999 in the Middle District. This will place an additional strain on \nthe already overburdened courts of this district due to increased \nprisoner petitions. Further complicating the problem, a portion of the \nMiddle District has recently been designated a High Intensity Drug \nTrafficking Area. An increase in drug cases will result as criminals \nare apprehended and prosecuted, placing additional demands upon this \ndistrict.\n  It is not possible to provide Floridians with a safe environment and \naccess to justice unless there is a court system in place which can \nhandle the demands of this dynamic and growing part of our country. \nIncreased judicial resources are integral in providing such a court \nsystem.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The distinguished Senator from \nIowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I listened to everything that the Senator from Florida \nhas said and of course, have had to be considering the points of view \nthat he makes, as well as a lot of my colleagues, and will be happy to \ncontinue working with him.\n  Mr. President, my subcommittee has been looking at the need for \nincreased or decreased numbers of judges across the country.\n  I've been looking at the middle district of Florida for some time, \nand have corresponded and met with the chief judge.\n  At this time, I am still not clear on what the needs of the district \nare or how its caseload is being managed. For instance, how are the \nmany senior judges in the district helping with the caseload? I asked \nthe chief judge this, and all I got were the judges certification \npapers that didn't say much of anything about caseload. It mostly \nmentioned what conferences they attended. I would ask the proponents to \nexplain to us how the senior judges and magistrates help in reducing \nthe caseload? Do the proponents realize that the senior judges in the \nmiddle district don't even take full cases?\n  Nevertheless, I will continue working with my colleagues regarding \njudgeship needs. I will soon be releasing a subcommittee report on our \nefforts to review the circuit courts.\n  The bottom line I've been advocating is that if we increase judges, \nwe need to also decrease judges where they're not needed. I know this \nis a new concept, and one that has been met with some resistance. But, \nI intend to continue this effort in the next Congress.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3617 To Amendment No. 3559\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I send to the desk the manager's \namendment and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3617 to amendment No. 3559.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . TREASURY DEPARTMENT STUDY REGARDING SECURITY \n                   INTERESTS UNDER AN OPEN END CREDIT PLAN.\n\n       (a) Within 180 days of the enactment of this Act, the \n     Federal Reserve Board in consultation with the Treasury \n     Department, the general credit industry, and consumer groups, \n     shall prepare a study regarding the adequacy of information \n     received by consumers regarding the creation of security \n     interests under open end credit plans.\n       (b) Findings.--This study shall include the Board's \n     findings regarding:\n       (1) whether consumers understand at the time of purchase of \n     property under an open end credit plan that such property may \n     serve as collateral under that credit plan;\n       (2) whether consumers understand at the time of purchase \n     the legal consequences of disposing of property that is \n     purchased under an open credit plan and is subject to a \n     security interest under that plan; and\n       (3) whether creditors holding security interests in \n     property purchased under an open end credit plan use such \n     security interests to coerce reaffirmations of existing debts \n     under section 524 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.\n\n     In formulating these findings, the Board shall consider, \n     among other factors it deems relevant, prevailing industry \n     practices in this area.\n       (c) Disclosure Recommendations.--This study shall also \n     include the Board's recommendations regarding the utility and \n     practicality of additional disclosures by credit card issuers \n     at the time of purchase regarding security interests under \n     open end credit plans, including, but not limited to:\n\n[[Page S10763]]\n\n       (1) disclosures of the specific property in which the \n     creditor will receive a security interest;\n       (2) disclosures of the consequences of nonpayment of the \n     card balance, including how the security interest may be \n     enforced; and\n       (3) disclosures of the process by which payments made on \n     the card will be credited with respect to the lien created by \n     the security contract and other debts on the card.\n       (d) The Board shall submit this report to the Senate \n     Committee on the Judiciary, the Senate Committee on Banking, \n     Housing, and Urban Affairs, the House Committee on the \n     Judiciary, and the House Committee on Banking and Financial \n     Services within the time allotted by this section.\n       Insert at an appropriate place:\n       Section 546 of title 11, United States Code, is amended by \n     inserting at the end thereof--\n       ``(I) Notwithstanding section 545(2) and (3) of this title, \n     the trustee may not avoid a warehouseman's lien for storage, \n     transportation or other costs incidental to the storage and \n     handling of goods, as provided by Section 7-209 of the \n     Uniform Commercial Code.''\n       Insert at an appropriate place:\n       Section 330(a) of Title 11 is amended:\n       (1) in subsection (3)(A) after the word ``awarded'', by \n     inserting ``to an examiner, Chapter 11 trustee, or \n     professional person'', and\n       (2) by adding at the end of subsection (3)(A) the \n     following:\n       ``(3)(B) In determining the amount of reasonable \n     compensation to be awarded a trustee, the court shall treat \n     such compensation as a commission based on the results \n     achieved.''\n       On page 59 of amendment 3595, after clause ``(v)'', insert:\n        ``(vi) not unfair because excessive in amount based upon \n     the value of the collateral.''\n       On page 60 of amendment 3595, after clause ``(iii)'' \n     insert:\n        ``(iv) the following statement: If your current rate is a \n     temporary introductory rate, your total costs may be \n     higher.''\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on the \namendment, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3617) was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Definition of Household Goods\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, a provision of this bill that the Senator \nfrom Illinois and I drafted and had put into the Managers' Package \nwould require the Federal Trade Commission to promulgate regulations to \ndefine household goods ``in a manner suitable and appropriate for cases \nunder Title 11 of the U.S. Code.'' What would be ``suitable and \nappropriate'' in the bankruptcy context?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Federal Trade Commission should keep in mind that the \ndefinition will define the household goods that a debtor may keep after \nthe bankruptcy, as part of the debtor's fresh start. The defining \nregulations should specify any tangible personal property reasonably \nnecessary for the support of the debtor and the debtor's dependents.\n  Mr. DODD. May I add something?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Certainly.\n  Mr. DODD. My concern with the definition is particularly for \nchildren, and is about personal property of little value to creditors. \nWould you agree that the Federal Trade Commission should promulgate \nregulations that will allow debtors to keep property that is commonly \nused by children or commonly used for the upbringing of children?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Are you talking about items like bicycles or toys or \nwashing machines?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes. A debtor's child and parent should be allowed to keep \nthese items. Children's property generally has no resale value, but \nreplacement costs can be substantial.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would agree. Similarly, I believe the Federal Trade \nCommission should keep in mind that when we talk about a dependent of \nthe debtor we are referring to people like an elderly parent or \nrelative, or a disabled person. Property belonging to a dependent \nelderly or disabled person should also figure into the definition.\n  Moreover, I would note that although some members of the Judiciary \nCommittee have tried to tell the FTC what to do, this provision \nultimately leaves the decision in the hands of the FTC. We have never \nhad hearings or conducted any inquiry whatsoever into what household \ngoods are necessary or appropriate in bankruptcy. The point of this \nprovision is to ask the FTC to make the necessary inquiries and provide \na suitable definition. As the lead Democratic co-sponsor of this bill, \nas the author of this provision--which I proposed during the Committee \ndebate--and as the ranking member on the Subcommittee with jurisdiction \nover the bankruptcy code, I believe the FTC is much better suited to do \nthis than we. In addition, I would note that the definition of \ndependent must be drawn from the bankruptcy code itself in order for \nany FTC definition to be at all meaningful or useful.\n  Mr. DODD. As the co-author of this provision, I concur.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me take this opportunity to compliment the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut for all of his hard work on this \nissue. He identified the unique problems of children in bankruptcy \nbefore anyone else, and no one has worked harder on this problem than \nhe. We both had different approaches to the household goods issue, and \nthe provision in this bill blends our two approaches.\n  Mr. DODD. And I think we have achieved a sensible result. In light of \nthe fact that we have taken no testimony on this issue and have no real \nexpertise in this area, it only makes sense to have the FTC attempt to \ncraft a definition. I compliment the Senator from Illinois for his \nefforts. It has been a pleasure working with him.\n\n\n                  patent reform legislation amendment\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me take a moment to speak about an \namendment that has not been discussed in the last several days. Under \nthe unanimous-consent agreement, I am permitted and had planned to \noffer a scaled-down version of broadly supported and bipartisan patent \nreform legislation, which was favorably reported to the Senate by the \nJudiciary Committee more than a year ago. Nevertheless, having spoken \nwith the majority leader, and in the interest of expediting activity on \npending Senate business, I have agreed to withhold my amendment.\n  But I want to take a moment to clarify why I believe this amendment \nis so important. In short, the provisions of this amendment represent \nthe most important and most comprehensive reforms to our nation's \npatent system in nearly half a century. In the last 50 years, our \nnation has witnessed an explosion of technology growth and a tremendous \nexpansion of the global market for American intellectual property. Yet \nour patent laws have remained largely unchanged. My bill would effect \nthose changes that are necessary to bring our patent system up to speed \nwith the growing demands of the global economy, to preserve American \ncompetitiveness into the 21st century, and to ensure adequate \nprotection for American innovators, both at home and abroad.\n  In all, there have been nine days of hearings and 78 witnesses who \nhave testified in the House and Senate on the provisions of this \nlegislation. Seventeen of those witnesses appeared before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. In addition, I have engaged in endless \nnegotiations to address concerns regarding the effect of the bill on \nsmall businesses and independent inventors. The result of that process \nwas a comprehensive package of amendments that was endorsed by the \nJudiciary Committee, including several outspoken opponents of the \noriginal bill, in an overwhelming bipartisan 17-1 vote last year. Since \nthen, I have sought a vote on the Senate floor for this legislation, \nthus far without success.\n  The failure to bring this bill to a vote in the Senate has largely \nbeen the result of the opposition of a very few Senators who have \nobjected to even its consideration by the full Senate. Over the past \nyear, I have made numerous additional changes to the bill in an attempt \nto address their concerns. As a result of those changes, the bill now \nenjoys even broader support, ranging from the smallest of American \nentrepreneurs and innovators to Fortune 100 companies. It is endorsed \nby the small business community, as well as by the experts on the \nsubject, including 5 of the past 6 commissioners of the Patent and \nTrademark Office and thousands of patent practitioners and patent \nowners. Unfortunately, despite my efforts, and despite this broad \nsupport, a vocal minority, which apparently opposes any patent reform, \ncontinues to object this bill. Repeated invitations to sit\n\n[[Page S10764]]\n\ndown with them to fashion a reasonable accommodation have been \nrejected.\n  Mr. President, at some point, the interests of inventors, the \ncontinued strength of our intellectual property base, consumers, and an \noverwhelming majority of the Senate must prevail over the interests of \nthe few who would oppose any patent reform. I believe that this \nlegislation must be debated and real patent reforms enacted if America \nis to retain its competitive edge into the next century.\n  In acceding to the majority leader's request to refrain from \nexercising my rights in offering this bill as an amendment to the \nbankruptcy bill, I am relying on his assurance that this patent reform \nlegislation will be brought up for floor consideration and a vote early \nnext year, with the expectation being that we complete action on the \nmeasure prior to March 1999. I would reiterate my willingness and \ndesire to work with my colleagues to resolve any outstanding concerns, \nand I hope any Senator who still has genuine concerns with this bill \nwill take me up on my offer.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues and to seeing reasonable \npatent reforms enacted by the Senate next year.\n\n\n                         Drunk-Driving Victims\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to commend the authors of \nthis legislation, Senators Durbin and Grassley, for their efforts on \nthis legislation and their acceptance of my amendment which will help \nprevent drunk drivers from escaping the debts they owe to their victims \nby filing for bankruptcy.\n  As my colleagues know, Congress has always worked in a bipartisan way \nwhen working to protect the victims of drunk-drivers under the \nBankruptcy Code. In 1984, Congress passed the Bankruptcy Amendments and \nFederal Judgeship Act of 1984 which contained provisions to prevent \ndrunk drivers from avoiding their debts to victims by filing for \nbankruptcy under Chapter 7. Although that Act closed a loophole in \nChapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, drunk drivers began to file for \nbankruptcy under Chapter 13. Consequently, in 1990, Congress passed \nanother measure to protect drunk-driving victims under Chapter 13.\n  As originally drafted, S. 1301 contained a number of provisions that \nwould have diluted the ability of drunk-driving victims to receive \ndamages. Consequently, I drafted an amendment designed to ensure that \nvictims would be paid for their injuries when the drunk driver filed \nfor bankruptcy. Additionally, the amendment extended protections to \nvictims of drunk boaters. The Coast Guard reports that drunk boating \ncontinues to be a problem with more than 200 fatalities in some years, \nand I thought it was important that irresponsible boaters not be able \nto escape liability by filing for bankruptcy.\n  I am pleased that Senators Durbin and Grassley have incorporated my \namendment into the managers' amendment. I appreciate their efforts and \ncooperation. We must ensure that the victims of drunk drivers and drunk \nboaters are protected in bankruptcy and I urge the conferees to make \nthis issue a priority when working out differences with the House bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the \nConsumer Bankruptcy Reform Act, S. 1301. Senator Durbin and Senator \nGrassley have worked together to mold a bipartisan bill that seeks to \ncorrect abuses in the bankruptcy system while preserving access to it \nfor honest debtors. Every American agrees with the basic principle that \ndebts should be repaid. The vast majority of Americans are able to meet \ntheir obligations. But, for those who fall on financial hard times, \nbankruptcy should be available in a fair and balanced way.\n  Unfortunately, more and more Vermonters and more and more Americans \nare filing for bankruptcy. The numbers are disturbing. While the \nunemployment rate keeps going down and inflation remains low, the \nnation's personal bankruptcies keep going up. Thus, this rise in \nbankruptcy filings has occurred at the same time that we enjoy a robust \neconomy. If fact, Vermont's unemployment rate hit a 10-year low just \nthe other day. Vermont's personal bankruptcy rate increased by about 40 \npercent for each of the last two years.\n  Still, Vermont was ranked next to last among the 50 states in \npersonal bankruptcy filings last year. In most other states, personal \nbankruptcy rates increased even more dramatically while unemployment \nrates declined. I do not know all the answers why more and more \nAmericans are filing for bankruptcy. I think some may be abusing the \nsystem. I think most are not. My guess is that stagnant wages and more \nconsumer credit card debt are the primary reasons.\n  Where there are abuses in the bankruptcy law, we should move to \ncorrect them. I believe that this bill does that by establishing \nstandards for bankruptcy judges to consider with respect to Chapter 7 \nand 13 filings and by discouraging bad-faith repeat filings. This bill \nalso includes better bankruptcy data collection procedures so that we \ncan learn more about the root causes of the recent rise in bankruptcy \nfilings. Accurate data will also allow us to better evaluate the impact \nof this reform legislation.\n  But we must also remember that bankruptcy serves as a safety net for \nmany of our constituents. Those who use bankruptcy are the most \nvulnerable of the American middle class. They are older Americans who \nhave lost their jobs or are unable to pay their medical debts. They are \nwomen attempting to raise their families or secure alimony and child \nsupport after a divorce. They are individuals struggling to recover \nfrom unemployment. This bankruptcy reform bill protects them.\n  As we move forward with reforms that are appropriate to eliminate \nabuses in the system, we need to remember the people who use the \nsystem, both the debtor and the creditor. We need to balance the \ninterests of creditors with those of middle class Americans who need \nthe opportunity to resolve overwhelming financial burdens.\n  Unfortunately, the House-passed consumer bankruptcy reform bill \nrequires an arbitrary means testing of debtors to be eligible for \nChapter 7 filings. Many bankruptcy practitioners and bankruptcy judges \npredict that the radical means-testing requirements in the House bill \nwould swamp the bankruptcy process with a flood of new litigation over \na debtor's filing status. Indeed, the Congressional Budge Office \nestimates that H.R. 3150 would cost taxpayers up to $16 million a year \nfor new bankruptcy judges and other court administrative expenses. \nMoreover, CBO estimates that the House bill would impose new private \nsector mandates, as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, of at \nleast $100 million on our economy. We need balanced bankruptcy reform, \nnot more unfunded mandates and costs to taxpayers.\n  The House bankruptcy reform bill also fails to adequately protect our \nmost vulnerable citizens--our children. More than one-third of the one \nmillion annual bankruptcies involve spouse and child support orders. \nBut the House bill proposes profound changes to the bankruptcy code for \nspouse and child support obligations by placing them on a equal footing \nwith some consumer debt. As a result, custodial parents and ex-spouses \nmay have to fight in court against the deep pockets of corporate \nlenders with little chance of success. This is unacceptable for \nAmerica's children.\n  I believe that the Senate version of the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform \nAct, S. 1301, carefully balances the competing interests of debtors and \ncreditors. The bankruptcy reform bill passed by the House of \nRepresentatives, H.R. 3150 is not a balanced piece of legislation. The \nAdministration has promised a veto if the House bill were to be adopted \nby Congress.\n  I have already spoken to the other Senators who will serve on a \nHouse-Senate bankruptcy reform conference about holding firm to the \nSenate bill in conference. If we want to enact balanced bankruptcy \nreforms into law this year, the Senate bill is that measure. If this \nCongress wants to enact consumer bankruptcy reforms into law, then the \nconference report must be along the lines of S. 1301. I am glad to \nreport that a majority of the Republicans who will serve on the \nconference with Senator Durbin and me agree. I expect that we will \nstrongly support the Senate position and prevail in conference.\n  I hope that the Senate will adopt this bipartisan bill that corrects \nthe abuses in the bankruptcy system without unfairly penalizing women \nand children\n\n[[Page S10765]]\n\nwho depend on child support and alimony, as well as older Americans and \nsmall business owners.\n  I want to take a moment to commend Senator Durbin for his leadership \nand for working to reform our bankruptcy system in a fair and balanced \nmanner. Senator Durbin has served as a most effective manager of this \nimportant measure. He has been informed and exercised good judgment at \nevery turn. He has met every challenge and maintained the \nbipartisanship that made this possible. Without his extraordinary \nefforts, there would be no bankruptcy reform legislation being \nconsidered for final passage by the Senate.\n  I also commend Senator Grassley. I know that is has not always been \neasy for him to keep this legislation on course. I know that some in \nhis caucus have criticized his efforts to be fair and to continue to \nwork in a bipartisan fashion. I am glad that he did not succumb to that \nbad advice. Senator Grassley and I have worked together for many years. \nWe agree on many things and we have disagreed on some. I congratulate \nhim for his outstanding efforts as the principal author, subcommittee \nchairman and floor manager of this bill. He has done a fine job and \ncreated a measure for which he deserves our thanks. In this effort I \nhave tried to be constructive--even foregoing offering an important \namendment to this particular bill, at Senator Hatch's request.\n  I also want to applaud the work of the staff on the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee principally responsible for this bill: Victoria Bassetti and \nAnne McCormick with Senator Durbin, and Kolan Davis and John McMickle \nwith Senator Grassley. Each worked hard on this very complex issue and \nhelped craft a fine piece of bipartisan legislation. They were here \nlate into many nights and worked ceaselessly for the public interest.\n  I urge my colleagues to support S. 1301, the Consumer Bankruptcy \nReform Act. It is a bill that the Senate should pass.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, although I object to numerous provisions \nin the underlying bill, S. 1301, the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act, I \nwas pleased to work with the Chairman and Ranking Member to include \nprovisions important to the farmers of this country.\n  Mr. President, everyone knows that family farming is a high risk \nbusiness. One that's effected more by outside, unanticipated forces--\nfor example, unstable markets, weather, and disease--than any other \nindustry. To survive in such a volatile vocation, farmers are often \ngiven a bit of flexibility. This flexibility is the key to the survival \nof most family farms.\n  Unfortunately, some farmers become overburdened by the financial \nhazards associated with the business and seek assistance in dealing \nwith their creditors. In 1986, Senator Grassley added Chapter 12 to the \nbankruptcy code to satisfy the unique risks and needs of family \nfarmers. Prior to that, farmers were forced to file for bankruptcy \nunder Chapter 11, the Small Business specific Chapter.\n  Although Chapter 12 has provided much needed relief for hundreds of \nfamily farmers, through the years, Chapter 12 has become outdated; its \ndefinitions, eligibility requirements and other provisions have not \nkept pace with changes in agriculture or in the nation's economy. Most \ndisturbingly, the out of date eligibility requirements of this \nprovision have excluded many who need it most and forced many farmers \ninto Chapter 11.\n  I was pleased that three amendments I authored with Senators Conrad \nand Bob Kerrey were accepted by Senators Grassley and Durbin and \nincluded in the manager's amendment. Two of these provision change the \neligibility requirements of Chapter 12 to include those originally \nintended under the 1986 statute.\n  One provision indexes the Chapter 12 debt limit. The current maximum \ndebt limit on Chapter 12 is $1,500,000. This limit has not been changed \nsince the 1986 law took effect, while most other Code dollar figures \nhave been increased for inflation and will have automatic adjustments \nin the future. At this point, the debt limits exclude many farmers for \nwhom Chapter 12 was originally intended.\n  A second eligibility problem had been the requirement that more than \n50% of a farm family's taxable income for the prior year came from a \nfarming operation. Farm families, expecting low return on their \ncommodities, usually seek off-farm employment for one of the household \nadults. A few years of low prices and negligible farm income would make \nmany farmers ineligible under this provision. Current law assumes that \nfarmers throw in the towel after just one bad year. I cannot think of \none Wisconsin farmer that gives up that easily. They keep working and \nhope for better markets next year. My provision changes this \nrequirement so that farmers have a bit more flexibility. More \nspecifically, my amendment will allow the 50% income requirement can be \nsatisfied in any of the past three years.\n  The last provision simply prohibits retroactive assessment of \ndisposable income by the courts. To have a payback schedule confirmed \nby the bankruptcy courts, a debtor in Chapter 12 must commit projected \ndisposable income--over and above living expenses, operating expenses \nand secured debt payments--to pay unsecured debtors. Some courts have \nstarted ``adjusting'' these payments upward in hindsight, if the \ndebtor's income was greater than projected. My amendment will make \nChapter 12 consistent with Chapter 13 and prohibit the retroactive \nassessment and instead modifies the coming year's payment schedule to \nreflect the additional income.\n  Again, Mr. President, I wish to thank Senators Kerrey, Conrad, \nGrassley and Durbin for their work on these amendments. It will give \nfamily farmers across the country the flexibility they need to make \ngood on their debts.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, there is no doubt that more and more \nAmericans are turning to the consumer bankruptcy system and the \nfinancial protection it offers. More than 1.3 million families filed \nfor bankruptcy last year. Where there is fraud and abuse we must take \nsteps to reduce and eliminate it. But this bill will not help reduce \nfraud. It will encourage riskier lending habits by credit companies. It \nwill lead to more credit being extended to poor families. It will \nensure that those families will file more bankruptcies. It will force \nthese families to file different types of bankruptcies, the kind of \nbankruptcy that ensures that they will never be free of their debt and \nable to restart their lives.\n  This is a complex issue and I must provide some background in order \nto explain my stance. There are two types of bankruptcies that \nindividuals can file: Chapter 7 and Chapter 13. Under current law, \nindividuals can choose either type. Chapter 7 bankruptcy allows debtors \nto discharge all their debt (besides child support, taxes, home loans, \nand student loans). Chapter 13 bankruptcies discharge no debt, but \nallow debtors to bargain directly with their creditors on reduced debt \nand payment schedules. Under the bill we passed today, Chapter 7 \nbankruptcies, which have provided a new start to millions of families \nover the years, will become a thing of the past. First of all, a judge \nnow will have discretion to reject a debtor's Chapter 7 claim, and \nrequire her to file under Chapter 13, if it can be proven that the \ndebtor has the ability to pay off 30% of her debt over the next five \nyears. Secondly, any of the debtor's creditors can enter the court--\nwithout legal counsel--and require the court to make a judgement as to \nwhether the debtor can afford this 30%. Thirdly, if the judge believes \nthat the debtor can pay off this 30%, the debtor's attorney--and this \nis unheard of in the law to date--will be forced to pay the cost of the \nChapter 13 Trustee. This is a hugely expensive tax on bankruptcy \nattorneys and they will certainly avoid taking on new Chapter 7 \nbankruptcies.\n  The truth is that this bill treats all debtors as likely criminals. \nYes, bankruptcies in this country are up. But debtors now wait longer \nto file bankruptcy and are deeper in debt than those who filed \nbankruptcy a decade ago. Furthermore, increased filings can be \nattributed to job loss, divorce, increasing health care costs, \ndeclining real wages--and most importantly--an entire industry of easy \ncredit which ten years ago did not exist in any where near today's \nscale.\n  Harvard Business School researchers David Moss and Gibbs Johnson \nstate ``the evidence suggests that shifts in\n\n[[Page S10766]]\n\nthe volume of and distribution of consumer credit--rather than \ndeclining stigma [of bankruptcies]--are the most likely sources of the \nrecent surge in consumer filings.'' They add that the surge of filings \nthat began in the late 1980s can be attributed to ``consumer creditors \n[which] began reaching substantially further down into the income \ndistribution beginning in the mid 1980s.'' It should also be noted that \ncredit-card mail solicitations have skyrocketed, from 3.1 million mail \nsolicitations in 1996 to over 881 million mail solicitations in 1997. \nYet it is this consumer credit industry that benefits most from this \nbill; because it is this industry that will use this bill to prevent \nindividuals from discharging their credit card debt. Simply put, this \nbill will increase the amount of money that credit card companies would \nreceive from low-income bankrupt debtors. Meanwhile, opponents argue \nthat sophisticated individuals with good legal advice will be able to \nget around the bill's new changes (as is often the case with financial \nlaws).\n  Who will benefit from this bill? I will quote Senator Metzenbaum, \nPublic Citizen, and Consumers Union: ``The only reason we're having \nthis debate is because the credit industry, primarily the credit card \nindustry, has spent well-orchestrated millions on ads and lobbyists \ndemonizing American families in crisis.'' Even the title of a Wall \nStreet Journal article says it all: ``As Bankruptcies Surge, Creditors \nLobby Hard to Get Tougher Laws; But Whether Many People Shirk Bills \nThey Can Pay Remains Open To Debate; Changing the Lender's Image.'' I \nquote from that article: ``As the legislation moves quickly through \nCongress, many academics, lawyers, and judges who specialize in \nbankruptcy question why. A government-appointed commission spent two \nyears studying the matter and was deeply divided. Five of its nine \nmembers found no major abuse of the system or need for a crackdown: \nonly two endorsed anything like the bills Congress is embracing. More \nthan 100 jurists wrote lawmakers to urge them to slow down.* * * A \nmajor reason [for the bill]? A multi-million public-relations and \nlobbying blitz run largely by companies with the most to gain: credit \ncard issuers and other lenders.''\n  Who will suffer under this bill? When job loss, divorce, or medical \nemergency strike, some families have no choice but to file for \nbankruptcy in order to stabilize themselves. Divorced women file for \nbankruptcy in greater proportions than divorced men. Victims of abuse \nfile for bankruptcy, often from debt incurred entirely by those who \nabused them. Single parents are forced into bankruptcy after any \nsubstantial period of unemployment. African Americans and Hispanics are \ndramatically over-represented in bankruptcy. With health insurance in \nits current state, families that suffer even one major medical \nemergency often find themselves in need of bankruptcy protection. But \nthis bill responds to the need of these families by basically re-\ninstituting life-long debtor's prison. All to the benefit of easy-\ncredit companies. I could not in good conscience support this bill.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, the dramatic rise in bankruptcies is very \ntroubling, regardless of whether the blame lies with credit card \ncompanies, a culture that disparages personal responsibility, the \nbankruptcy code or, most probably, with all of the above. While none of \nus wants to return to the era of ``debtors' prison,'' we need to do \nsomething to reverse this trend.\n  But true ``reform'' will only occur if we prevent the most egregious \nabuse of the bankruptcy laws--misuse of the homestead exemption. And we \nwill only have true reform if we target other abuses without \noverburdening the vast majority of debtors who truly need--and \ndeserve--relief. And, true reform also requires a balanced approach \nthat targets abusive practices by creditors as well as by debtors.\n  That is why I intend to vote for this bill. It does all three: \nprevents the most egregious abuses by capping the homestead exemption, \nuses ``means testing'' to deter other serious abuses without placing \nunfair burdens on honest debtors, and requires credit card companies to \ndisclose the information consumers need to make intelligent choices.\n  In particular, let me focus on the cap on the homestead exemption \nthat Senator Sessions and I introduced in subcommittee. This proposal, \nwhich was adopted by a unanimous 7-0 vote in subcommittee and was \nunanimously reaffirmed on the floor through a Sense of the Senate \nresolution, closes a loophole that allows too many debtors to shield \ntheir assets in luxury homes, while their creditors get left out in the \ncold. Currently, a handful of states allow debtors to protect their \nhomes no matter how high their value. And time after time, millionaire \ndebtors move to states with unlimited exemptions, like Florida and \nTexas, declare bankruptcy--yet continue to live like kings while their \ncreditors get little or nothing. If we want to restore the stigma \nattached to bankruptcy, these high profile abuses are the best place to \nstart.\n  Our proposal is simple and effective. It caps at $100,000 the maximum \nhomestead exemption that an individual filing bankruptcy can claim. \nWith the cap in place, bankrupt debtors will retain their right to a \nroof over their heads, but not to luxury accommodations.\n  I am concerned, however, that if this homestead cap is dropped in \nConference, the President will veto the bill. That is, if it reaches \nhim, because if the cap is removed, I'll filibuster the Conference \nReport myself.\n  But since all of the conferees support the homestead cap provision, \nand since the Senate has now gone on record as saying that the ``cap'' \nis ``essential to meaningful bankruptcy reform,'' I am confident that \nwe won't have to go that route.\n  Mr. President, when people talk about bankruptcy abuse, the notion of \nstashing cash in a lavish Florida home is the first thing they think \nabout. And that's not surprising. To borrow a phrase from Bill Bennett, \nCongress needs to act responsibly to put ``a death to this outrage.''\n  Overall, I commend Senators Grassley and Durbin for their hard work \nand close collaboration. I look forward to a final product that \ncontinues tackling the worst abuses, while still helping honest \ndebtors.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I voted in favor of S. 1301, the Consumer \nBankruptcy Reform Act of 1998, to address certain abuses regarding \nconsumer bankruptcy laws, while providing bankruptcy protection to \nthose who genuinely need it. Indeed, in recent years, there have been \nrecord increases in bankruptcy filings. In 1997 alone there were 1.3 \nmillion bankruptcy filings--an all-time high. While I think this \nincrease is in part a result of the significant rise in outstanding \nconsumer credit, I believe it is also attributable to the reduced \nstigma associated with filing for bankruptcy. As such, I believe that \nS. 1301 will be an important tool in curtailing irresponsible debtor \npractices.\n  The version of S. 1301 passed by the Senate is the product of \nsignificant compromise by both Democrats and Republicans and is much-\nimproved over the Judiciary Committee-passed bill. I am pleased that my \namendments prohibiting certain credit card terminations, limiting \nconsumer debit card liability, and providing greater disclosure for \n``high LTV'' loans were adopted by the Senate. Nonetheless, I am \nconcerned about the means-testing provisions in the bill and would be \ninclined to oppose the Conference Report if the means-testing \nprovisions are made mandatory or if consumer credit protections are \ndeleted.\n  S. 1301 signifies a fundamental change in bankruptcy policy by \nestablishing a system of means testing for determining eligibility for \nChapter 7 relief. Heretofore, debtors have had the power to determine \nthe type of bankruptcy relief to be sought, regardless of their ability \nto repay. S. 1301, however, gives a bankruptcy judge the discretion to \nconvert a Chapter 7 case to Chapter 13 upon a motion by the creditor, \nif the debtor can afford to repay 30 percent of his or her debts.\n  My concern with the provision is that it does not contemplate whether \nthe creditor acted responsibly and in good faith in extending credit to \nthe debtor. Statistics showing that household debt has increased to 104 \npercent of household income, as compared to 24 percent in 1975, \nsuggests that some creditors may be irresponsibly extending credit. In \nresponse to my concerns, I offered an amendment to the bill that would \nhave required creditors to act in\n\n[[Page S10767]]\n\ngood faith in their dealings with debtors. Unfortunately, this \namendment did not pass.\n  Despite my concerns with the means testing provision, I was able to \nsupport the bill because the means testing provision does not require \nthe judge to convert a case to Chapter 13, but instead gives the judge \ndiscretion. If the Conference Report eliminates this judicial \ndiscretion and incorporates the House-passed means testing provision \nthat requires conversion, I would have a difficult time supporting the \nConference Report.\n  Lastly, my support for S. 1301 was in part predicated on the \nsignificant consumer credit protections incorporated in the bill. For \nexample, the bill includes an amendment that I offered that would \nprohibit credit card companies from terminating a consumer's account \nsimply because the consumer paid his or her bill in full each month. \nThis is a detestable practice which flies in the face of the goals \nbeing promoted in S. 1301. If this provision, or other such provisions \nare not included in the Conference Report, I would seriously consider \nopposing the Conference Report.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, on July 6th, the Federal Financial \nInstitutions Examination Council (FFIEC), published for public comment \nin the Federal Register, its proposed changes to its Uniform Policy for \nClassification of Consumer Installment Credit Based on Delinquency \nStatus. FFEIC is on the verge of adopting the changes in the proposals, \nwith or without modifications based on the public input they received. \nI would like to ask my distinguished colleague, the Senator from Iowa \nwhether the bankruptcy reform legislation currently before the Senate \nwould significantly affect the agency's policy guidelines? My concern \nis that shortly after the FFIEC's new guidelines are adopted, it will \nhave to rewrite them, according to the new bankruptcy reform \nlegislation.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That is correct. If the bill before us is enacted this \nfall, it will have a substantial impact upon creditors' recovery in \nmany consumer bankruptcy cases. It will take some time to evaluate the \nfull impact of the new law.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Accordingly then, it is my view that the FFIEC should \ndelay implementing any changes to its Uniform Policy for Classification \nof Consumer Installment Credit Based on Delinquency Status until it is \nclear whether and in what final form the bankruptcy reform is enacted.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I would agree with my colleague from Minnesota and urge \nFFIEC to delay implementing changes to its Uniform Policy for \nClassification of Consumer Installment Credit Based on Delinquency \nStatus, in light of the pending bankruptcy reform legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there further amendments?\n  If there are no further amendments, the question is on agreeing to \nthe substitute amendment, as amended.\n  The substitute amendment (No. 3559), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the reported \ncommittee substitute amendment, as amended.\n  Without objection, the committee substitute amendment, as amended, is \nagreed to.\n  The committee substitute amendment, as amended, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator would withhold for a moment.\n  Under the previous order, the Senate will now proceed to the House \ncompanion bill, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3150) to amend title 11 of the United States \n     Code, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, all after the \nenacting clause of H.R. 3150 is stricken and the text of S. 1301, as \namended, is inserted in lieu thereof.\n  The question is on the engrossment of the amendment and third reading \nof the bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill, as amended, pass? The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate insists\n\n[[Page S10787]]\n\non its amendments and requests a conference with the House, and the \nChair appoints conferees.\n  Thereupon, the Presiding Officer (Mr. THOMAS) appointed Mr. Hatch, \nMr. Grassley, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Durbin conferees on the \npart of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, first of all I want to thank everyone in \nthis body for the overwhelming vote of confidence on the work that \nSenator Durbin and I have done on this bankruptcy bill. Getting to this \npoint has been a very tough process involving a lot of compromise and a \nlot of refinement.\n  You heard me say on the first day of debate that for the entire time \nthat I have been in the Senate and on this subcommittee on the subject \nof bankruptcy--maybe not on every subject, but the subject of \nbankruptcy--there has been a great deal of bipartisan cooperation, \nfirst of all between Senator Heflin of Alabama, now retired, and \nmyself. Sometimes I was chairman when Republicans were in the majority. \nWhen we were in the minority, I was ranking member and he was chairman. \nBut this legislation has always passed with that sort of tradition.\n  So I want to say to all of my colleagues that I not only thank them \nfor their support but, more importantly, thank Senator Durbin, who \nworked so closely with me on this legislation, and that tradition has \ncontinued. I thank him for carrying on that tradition, because I don't \nthink we would have had the vote that we had today if it had not been \nfor the bipartisanship that has been expressed since he first took over \nleadership for his party on our subcommittee.\n  I also want to give commendation to his staff, Victoria Bassetti and \nAnn McCormick; and also to Senator Hatch's staff, Maken Delrahim and \nRene Augustine; and also my staff, John McMickle and Kolan Davis, \nbecause without the long hours of staff work that went into this bill, \nwe would not have had the great compromise that we had to make this \nvote possible.\n  Mr. President, I'm pleased that we've come to the point where the \nSenate has passed the Grassley-Durbin consumer bankruptcy bill. Getting \nto this point has been a tough process involving a lot of compromise \nand refinement. Of course, I thank Senator Durbin for his help and \nsuggestions for improving the bill. I think that Chairman Hatch also \ndeserves a great deal of credit as well.\n  The bill we voted is a very fair and balanced piece of legislation \nwith broad support. The administration, in its ``statement of \nadministration policy,'' encourages the Senate to pass this bill. The \nJudiciary Committee was almost unanimous in passing the bill, and many \nchanges have been made to the version of the bill reported by the \ncommittee to accommodate the concerns of the minority. So, this is a \nbill I think we can all support regardless of party. Again, Senator \nDurbin has been instrumental in making this bill truly bi-partisan.\n  As I've said numerous times on the floor during the debate on \nbankruptcy reform, the American people are four-square in support of \nmeaningful bankruptcy reform. The fact is that some people use \nbankruptcy as a convenient financial planning tool to skip out on debts \nthey could repay. This has to stop.\n  Mr. President, there's no such thing as a free lunch. Bankruptcies of \nconvenience are like shoplifting. Honest consumers have to pick up the \ntab for losses due to bankruptcy just as they pick up the tab for \nshoplifting. Bankruptcies of convenience impose a hidden bankruptcy tax \nof $400 per family of four. My bill will cut that tax.\n  Mr. President, it's not just consumers paying higher prices who stand \nto lose from bankruptcy abuse. Small businesses, a vital component of \nour healthy economy, can be crippled by bankruptcy losses. That's why \nthe National Federation of Independent Business supports bankruptcy \nreform.\n  Let's cut the bankruptcy tax. Let's restore personal responsibility \nto the bankruptcy system. Let's help protect American consumers and \nsmall businesses.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank the people from the administration, \nbecause they have followed the course of this legislation. They have \nissued a statement of administrative policy in support of this \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                               Washington, DC, September 17, 1998.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n            S. 1301--Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1998\n\n              (Grassley (R) Iowa and Durbin (D) Illinois)\n\n       The Administration encourages Senate passage of S. 1301 as \n     an important step toward balanced bankruptcy reform; however, \n     the Administration ultimately would support enactment of \n     bankruptcy legislation only if the essential reforms \n     incorporated by the Senate managers' amendment are preserved \n     and strengthened and the unbalanced and arbitrary elements of \n     the current House bill are omitted.\n       The Administration supports bankruptcy reform that asks \n     both debtors and creditors to act more responsibly. Debtors \n     who genuinely have the ability to repay a portion of their \n     debts should remain responsible for those debts. But \n     creditors must also be responsible for treating debtors \n     fairly, recognizing creditors' superior information and \n     bargaining power.\n       As reported from Committee, S. 1301 focused heavily on \n     perceived debtor abuse, with little to curtail abuses by \n     creditors. However, if changes incorporated in the manager's \n     amendment are adopted, the Senate bill will take significant \n     steps to address abusive practices by both debtors and \n     creditors. Essential changes included in the managers' \n     amendments include: (1) new disclosure requirements to ensure \n     that credit card companies provide consumers with the \n     information about their accounts that they need to manage \n     their budgets; (2) procedural protections to avoid \n     inappropriate and unwise reaffirmations of unsecured and \n     certain secured consumer debts; and (3) modifications made to \n     the nondischargeability provisions in the bill so that the \n     bill no longer inappropriately puts credit card debt in \n     competition with child support, alimony, and other societal \n     priorities like education loans and taxes.\n       The Administration also strongly prefers the discretionary \n     approach to limiting access to Chapter 7 used in S. 1301 over \n     the rigid and arbitrary approach in the House bill. We \n     support changes made by the Senate bill to ensure that those \n     debtors denied access to Chapter 7 under Section 707(b) of \n     the Bankruptcy Code are those that have a strong likelihood \n     of successfully completing a Chapter 13 plan.\n       More can and should be done to produce a truly balanced \n     bill. The bill must address the potentially coercive effect \n     of allowing creditors to bring 707(b) motions based on any \n     allegation of abuse and strengthen the protections against \n     coercive reaffirmations.\n       The Administration also supports financial contract netting \n     provisions in the bill, which are important to reducing \n     systemic risk in our financial markets and are based on a \n     proposal from the President's Working Group on Financial \n     Markets.\n       The Administration supports Senate passage of the ``Omnibus \n     Patent Act of 1998'' as an amendment to S. 1301 because that \n     bill supports American innovation through needed patent law \n     reforms. While the Administration is disappointed that the \n     bill does not include all of the performance based \n     organization reforms it proposed, the provision's inclusion \n     of the annual performance agreement is welcome.\n       Finally, the Senate is expected to vote on an amendment to \n     raise wages of 12 million Americans and help ensure that \n     parents who work hard and play by the rules do not have to \n     raise their children in poverty. Two years ago, the President \n     signed into law a moderate increase in the minimum wage. The \n     results of that action are clear: it raised the wages of the \n     lowest paid workers and did not cost jobs. Now we must \n     continue to take actions to ensure that all Americans are \n     benefitting from our prospering economy. That is why the \n     Administration strongly supports raising the minimum wage by \n     $1 over two years.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I thank Senator Durbin very much for his \ncooperation.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I would like to echo the comments of Senator Grassley. I really \nbelieve this vote of 97 to 1 is a tribute to his patience, endurance, \nand hard work. It has been a joy to be with him as part of this \nprocess. We have serious differences on many aspects of this bill. I am \nsure we will continue to debate them. But the core bill is a bill which \nI was happy to support because I think it is a more reasonable approach \nto reforming bankruptcy. We attempt to reform it in the responsible \nway, trying to stop the abuses in filing in the bankruptcy court and at \nthe same time calling on the credit industry to accept\n\n[[Page S10788]]\n\nsome responsibility for those risky credit practices which lure \nunwitting consumers into a trap from which they cannot escape.\n  I want to give acknowledgment as well to staff who have made this \nbill possible. Seated to my left is Victoria Bassetti, my staff \nattorney on the Judiciary Committee, who has spent more time looking at \nthe bankruptcy code than almost anything else in the past year; Anne \nMcCormick, who is with us as a detailee from the Department of Justice, \nwho has done an extraordinary job; on the majority side, John McMickle \nand Kolan Davis have become friends during the course of this debate \nand have added greatly to the work product; Makan Delrahim and Rene \nAugustine of Senator Hatch's staff; Kara Stein and Brooke Byers of \nSenator Dodd's staff; Ed Pagano of Senator Leahy's staff; Kristi Lee of \nSenator Sessions' staff; and Brian Lee of Senator Kohl's staff; as well \nas Joel Wiginton, who once worked on my staff and now serves Senator \nFeingold. They all have added to the value of this bill. I thank each \nand every one of them.\n  I would like to just note four or five things that I am particularly \nproud of in this legislation.\n  We have worked back and forth in the banking industry, as well as \nwith experts in the law, to come to a good conclusion about the ways to \nreduce abuse when it comes to bankruptcy filings.\n  We have added some provisions here which I think many consumers will \nappreciate because it really does bring more balance to this endeavor.\n  With the help of Senator Dodd, who is in the Chamber today, as well \nas Senator Sarbanes of Maryland, we have added some disclosure \nprovisions to this bill which will make credit card statements clearer \nand make it more understandable when credit card companies solicit your \nbusiness as to what you are going to have to do, how much you will have \nto pay in interest rates and what other conditions might be important \nto your relationship.\n  We have an amendment here I am particularly proud of on predatory \nhome lending. These are those unscrupulous credit practices where \nlenders prey particularly on senior citizens, forcing them into a \nsituation where they sign second mortgages on their home without any \nreal understanding of what they are getting into. They lose the most \nimportant asset in their life because of these unscrupulous practices. \nThis bill comes down hard on that kind of conduct.\n  We also have increased court supervision on reaffirmation. A person \nfiles for bankruptcy and says, Here is a debt which I will keep; I will \ncontinue to pay on it. For instance, a car loan because you need an \nautomobile, or with a company that your family has done business with \nfor generations. You reaffirm the debt. That is perfectly acceptable. \nIt is something which should be encouraged where it works. But we say \nthe court should look at it to make certain it is fair.\n  I salute Senator Sessions and Senator Kohl for the homestead \nexemption cap. The unlimited homestead exemption in a few states is the \nsingle worst abuse in the bankruptcy system. Our friends in the House \nsaw it differently on a floor vote. It is up to us in conference to \nconvince them that ours is a better way. We protect retirement income \nin bankruptcy, a concept which I pushed for and was happy to join with \nSenator Hatch in finally passing in this Chamber.\n  I thank Senator Feingold for his efforts to protect the poorest of \nthe poor who file in bankruptcy. I also salute Senator Feinstein and \nothers who have asked for studies which we think will improve credit \npractices in this country. And, finally, this bill provides for the \ncreation of 18 new bankruptcy judgeships sorely needed in the States \nwhich will receive them.\n  This is the first major legislation I have had in the Chamber. I \ndon't expect every one of them to pass 97 to 1, but it really is a good \nfeeling to know that all of this work over this time has resulted in a \ntruly bipartisan response to this important issue.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, S. 1301, the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act \nof 1998, was reported out of the Judiciary Committee with strong \nbipartisan support and is one of the most important legislative efforts \nto reform the bankruptcy laws in 20 years.\n  I would like to begin by commending my colleagues, Senators Grassley \nand Durbin, respectively, the chairman and ranking minority member of \nthe Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, for their \ntireless efforts in crafting this much needed legislation. I also want \nto thank them for conducting numerous important hearings at the \nsubcommittee level on the complex issue of bankruptcy reform. I \nparticularly appreciate the dedication they have shown to making the \npassage of this bill an inclusive and bipartisan process.\n  The compelling need for reform is underscored by the dramatic rise in \nbankruptcy filings each year. The Bankruptcy Code was liberalized back \nin 1978, and ever since that time, consumer bankruptcy filings have \ngone up at an unprecedented rate. Even during the economic boom years \nof 1994 to 1997, consumer bankruptcy filings almost doubled.\n  Mr. President, the bankruptcy system was intended to provide a \n``fresh start'' for those who need it. We need to preserve the \nbankruptcy system within limits to allow individuals to emerge from \nfinancial ruin, which may have been precipitated by unforeseen events \nsuch as medical problems or unemployment. What we don't need is to \npreserve those elements of the system that allow it to be abused, and \nthat allow some debtors to use bankruptcy as a financial planning tool \nrather than as a last resort. I firmly believe that by allowing people \nto escape from their financial obligations, we are doing them a great \ndisservice by not encouraging them to manage their finances and control \ntheir debt.\n  It always has been my view that individuals should take personal \nresponsibility for their debts, and repay them to the extent possible. \nUnder the present system, it is too easy for debtors who have the \nability to repay some of what they owe to file for Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy. Under Chapter 7, debtors can liquidate their assets and \ndischarge all debt, while protecting certain assets from liquidation, \nirrespective of their income. Mr. President, I believe that the \ncomplete extinguishing of debt should be reserved for debtors who truly \ncannot repay their debts.\n  According to the Wall Street Journal (Nov. 8, 1996) bankruptcy \nprotection laws give an alarming number of ``obscure, but perfectly \nlegal places for anyone to hide assets.'' For instance, one Virginia \nmultimillionaire incurred massive debt, but under State law was \nentitled to keep certain household goods, farm equipment, and ``one \nhorse.'' This particular individual opted to keep a $640,000 race \nhorse, noting that the law only limits the number of horses, but not \nthe individual value of a horse.\n  While this is a particularly egregious example, these kinds of \nloopholes exist in the Bankruptcy Code, and people are using them to \navoid paying their debts. As a result, the rest of us end up footing \nthe bill through higher prices and higher interest rates.\n  S. 1301 provides a remedy for these abuses by adopting a needs-based \napproach to bankruptcy reform.\n  It is important to note that the administration has urged that \nbankruptcy law should ``discourage bad faith repeat filings and other \nattempts to abuse the privilege accorded by access to bankruptcy.''\n  This bipartisan legislation, created by Senators Grassley and Durbin, \nis carefully structured to achieve an appropriate balance between \ndebtor and creditor rights. The legislation maintains the aspects of \nthe bankruptcy system that serve those in need of a ``fresh start.'' At \nthe same time, S. 1301 reforms current bankruptcy laws to prevent the \nsystem from being abused at the expense of all Americans.\n  The impact of this important legislation will not only be to curb the \nrampant number of frivolous bankruptcy filings, but also to give a \nboost to our economy.\n  Mr. President, again I would like to applaud the bipartisan efforts \nof my colleagues who have made S. 1301 a broadly supported bill.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \ncongratulate Senator Durbin, the Ranking Member of the Courts \nSubcommittee, on passage of S.1301, the\n\n[[Page S10789]]\n\nConsumer Bankruptcy Reform Bill of 1998.\n  I especially want to thank him for insisting that S.1301 address not \nonly the need for greater responsibility on the part of debtors, but \nalso the need for greater responsibility on the part of creditors. In \nparticular, this bill takes notice of the fact that credit card \ncompanies often act as enablers to individuals who end up in bankruptcy \nafter falling prey to one too many promises of easy credit from these \ncompanies. S.1301 requires that credit card companies provide consumers \nwith the information they need to behave in a responsible manner, \nrather than luring them into tighter financial straits with false \npromises of easy credit.\n  The bill that passed out of the Judiciary Committee did not take such \nan evenhanded approach, and I, among others both on and off the \nJudiciary Committee, noted the need to bring greater balance to this \nissue on the floor. Thanks to Senator Durbin's leadership, the efforts \nof several other Democratic Senators, and the cooperation of Senator \nGrassley and other Republicans, the bill we will soon pass is a product \nthat, as amended, acknowledges the shared responsibility for the rise \nin bankruptcies between creditors and debtors, and strives to \ndiscourage reckless behavior on both sides of credit transactions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague from Maryland for his kind words, \nand for his assistance in making S.1301 a bill that the Senate can be \nproud of.\n  As Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and \nUrban Affairs, Senator Sarbanes has long been interested in the issue \nof consumer lending practices, and his efforts were invaluable in \ndrawing the necessary connection between increased bankruptcy filings \nand the lending practices of credit card companies.\n  Due to the efforts of a number of Democratic Senators, including \nSenator Sarbanes, we were able to have inserted into the managers \namendment to this bill a number of important provisions dealing with \nconsumer credit information. These provisions require credit card \ncompanies to provide in their monthly statements and initial \nsolicitation materials information that will help consumers manage \ntheir finances in a way that will, I believe, obviate the need for \nbankruptcy in many cases. The bill also now provides for studies \nregarding (1) the extension of credit to individuals with a high debt-\nto-income ratio and (2) the use of credit card security interests to \ncoerce reaffirmations of debt in bankruptcy.\n  In short, we now have before us a bill that is balanced and that is \nnot simply the wish list of the credit card companies. I thank Senator \nSarbanes for helping to make this possible.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank Senator Durbin for his kind words. I also note, \nhowever, that we still have much work to do in this area. None of the \nconsumer-oriented provisions that we have succeeded in adding to S.1301 \nare in the House-passed bankruptcy bill, and I daresay that the credit \ncard companies are less than thrilled with even the modest steps we \nhave taken on behalf of consumers here in the Senate. I ask my \ncolleague from Illinois, is it not safe to expect that there will be \nefforts during the bankruptcy conference to strip out some of these \nprovisions from the conference report, and to bring to the Senate a \nbankruptcy bill that is, once again, merely a wish list of the credit \ncard companies?\n  I further ask my colleague, will we not need to be vigilant in our \nefforts to preserve these consumer-oriented provisions during the \nconference?\n  Mr. DURBIN. My colleague from Maryland sadly may be correct. Neither \nour Republican colleagues in the House nor the credit card companies \nare likely to be as enthusiastic as he or I about the efforts at \ncooperation and compromise that went into crafting the Senate bill.\n  We will, indeed, have to be vigilant in regard to the consumer-\noriented provisions in S.1301, and I hope that we will be joined in \nthis effort both by our Senate Republican colleagues, who have agreed \nto accept most of these provisions without any debate, as well as by \nthe White House, which has indicated the importance of preserving the \nSenate managers' amendment to its own consideration of bankruptcy \nreform legislation. We have our work cut for us, but I commit to my \ncolleague from Maryland that I will do my utmost to ensure that the \nbankruptcy conference report contains the vital consumer protections we \nworked so hard to add to the Senate bill.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank my distinguished colleague from Illinois, and \npledge my support for his efforts in this regard. Only if we are able \nto preserve our hard-fought gains in the Senate in conference will we \nbe able to pass bankruptcy reform legislation that will stand the tests \nof time and fairness.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/23/senate-section/article/S10739-5", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10789-S10790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 442\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be in order for the majority leader, after consultation \nwith the Democratic leader, to proceed to the consideration of Calendar \nNo. 509, S. 442, and it be considered under the following limitations:\n  The Commerce Committee amendment be agreed to, and the Finance \nsubstitute then be agreed to, and the substitute then be considered as \noriginal text for the purpose of further amendment. I further ask \nunanimous consent that the only other amendments in order to the bill \nbe the following:\n  A managers' amendment; McCain-Wyden amendment extending length of \nmoratorium; Coats, Internet porn, 1 hour equally divided; Bennett \namendment, relevant; Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison amendment, relevant; \nBond amendment, relevant; Bumpers amendment, mail order; three Enzi \nrelevant amendments; Domenici, an amendment on interest rates; Graham, \nrelevant; Abraham, Government paperwork; and Bumpers, a commission \namendment.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that relevant second-degree \namendments be in order to all amendments other than the Coats \namendment.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that there be 2 hours of general \ndebate equally divided on the bill. I finally ask that following the \ndisposition of the above-listed amendments and the expiration of time, \nthe bill be read a third time and the Senate proceed to a vote on \npassage of the bill with no other intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I object on behalf of a number of colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me just explain.\n  I support this legislation, and I hope we can come to some resolution \nhere. Obviously, this is an important bill that ought to be passed. The \nproblem is that, once again, we are presented with an untenable \ncircumstance. Colleagues on this side of the aisle, certainly through \nno fault of the distinguished Senator from Arizona, have been \nprecluded, to date, from offering our Patients' Bill of Rights. We are \nrunning out of time. We are running out of vehicles. We are running out \nof opportunities for us to have the kind of debate that we all have \nasked for and expected to have by this day.\n  Because we are again put into a difficult position of not knowing how \nwe are going to resolve that outstanding question, recognizing that it \nis at least as important as this issue, in spite of the fact that I do \nsupport S. 442, we are compelled to object today.\n  My hope is that at some point in the not-too-distant future we can \nresolve the issue of how we will debate the Patients' Bill of Rights, \nand we will then resolve our ability to bring up the request made by \nthe Senator from Arizona. So I object at this time with the hope that \nwe can find some resolution at some point soon.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate turn to the \nimmediate consideration of S. 442 and that only amendments in order to \nthe bill be relevant amendments.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n[[Page S10790]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, let me just point out that I think the \nDemocratic leader makes a very legitimate point. Obviously, he believes \nthere are very important issues that need to be addressed. The \nPatients' Bill of Rights is a very important issue. But let me also \npoint out, Mr. President, that we have been working on this legislation \nfor 2 years. All of Silicon Valley, especially the State of \nMassachusetts as well as other places where high tech is a very \nimportant part of the economy of the various States and the Nation, \nwant this bill done.\n  Senator Wyden, who is the originator of this bill, and I, along with \nmany others, have worked very hard for a long period of time. We have \nmade concession after concession; we have made compromise after \ncompromise on this bill, including having the Finance Committee play a \nmajor role in it. All I hope is that on the Democrat side we can get \nsome agreement to address the Patients' Bill of Rights, and I also ask \nthat we make every effort to get this bill up and passed. We have \napproximately 11, 12 remaining legislative days, as I understand it.\n  I respect and understand the objection of the Democratic leader. I \nhope we can get this issue resolved, up and passed so that we can \nensure the future of perhaps one of the most important and vital parts \nof America's economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/23/senate-section/article/S10789-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 2279\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I know others will want to be recognized \nfor comments, including maybe the Senator from Massachusetts, before we \nmove forward with the FAA bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator from Arizona.\n  I just wanted to join in expressing support for our leader's position \nin raising this extremely important issue, the Patients' Bill of \nRights. Our leader, Senator Daschle, has indicated a willingness to \nenter into agreements that would be reasonable and which would permit \ndebate and discussion of these important matters that are at the heart \nof concerns of millions of American families, and to do it in a way we \nwould not interrupt the important legislation that the Senator from \nArizona has identified. We have been frustrated in having that \nopportunity.\n  We had similar difficulty earlier in terms of the minimum wage. We \nwere able to address that, not with the outcome that some of us might \nhave hoped but nonetheless we were able to at least get a judgment on \nthat. And we wanted to try to also get a judgment on this matter which \nis of central concern to families all across this country.\n  I want to just add my support to the objections of Senator Daschle \nand also to express appreciation to the Senator from Arizona. We know \nthat this is not his decision at this time to be making, but it is a \nleadership decision.\n  I thank him for his courtesy and recognize it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me briefly say as well, I support what \nthe Democratic leader is doing on this HMO issue. Hopefully, that \nmatter can be resolved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nspeak as in morning business. It is not on this subject matter.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object unless I know how long it is.\n  Mr. DODD. About 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/23/senate-section/article/S10790-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10790-S10795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        Y2K AND MEDICAL DEVICES\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, most of us are aware that there is a very \nserious computer problem, the year 2000 computer problem or Y2K \nproblem, which has the potential to dramatically disrupt our energy, \ntransportation, banking and health sectors, just to name a few.\n  As most of you know, the year 2000 computer technology problem stems \nfrom the earlier programing of two digit date codes; many old programs \nwere written assuming the year would begin with ``19.'' Therefore the \nyear-2000 computer problem means that if an unknown number of programs \nand microchips around the world aren't fixed or replaced, computers \nthat read ``00'' as the year 1900, not 2000 will fail or malfunction on \nJanuary 1, 2000.\n  To correct this problem millions of dollars have been earmarked by \ngovernment and industry to identify, correct and test the millions of \nlines of code and embedded chips that perform mission-critical \nfunctions.\n  Senator Bennett and I co-chair the Senate's Year 2000 Committee and \nwe are actively reviewing the progress of U.S. industry and government \nagencies. Both must bring their own systems into compliance and the \ngovernment agencies must monitor the compliance status of the areas \nthat they regulate.\n  This is truly a world-wide phenomenon, and while the United States is \ndoing a pretty good job of playing catch up, many nations of the world \nhave hardly begun to address their own year 2000 or Y2K problems.\n  From time to time I will come to the Senate floor to brief the other \nMembers and the public on the progress of the committee's work and the \nhighlight problems areas.\n  One such problem area was highlighted during the committee's hearing \non health concerns. Whereas, in many industries, there are areas termed \nmission-critical which refers to embedded or coded systems without \nwhich the primary objective of that system fails. In the health field, \nthere are life-critical systems which sustain human life. An example of \na life-critical embedded system would be a cardiac monitor in the \nintensive-care unit of a hospital. If it fails, the patient could lose \nhis or her life.\n  With this in mind I was deeply disturbed to learn, during one of the \ncommittee's earlier hearings, that the FDA's attempts to survey and \ndocument year 2000 compliance within the medical device industry had \nindicated an unacceptable low level of response. At the committee's \nJuly 23, 1998 hearing on the health care industry, I was shocked by the \nfact that instead of taking steps to deal with this problem, the \nmedical device industry, as a whole, at that time, seemed to be \nexacerbating the problem by refusing to provide information either to \nthe FDA or to even the hospitals and clinics which use the devices \nevery day. I made it clear that this sort of attitude was stunningly \nshort-sighted and could only cause harm to both the makers and users of \nthese devices. Indeed, the committee learned that the FDA on June 28, \n1998 requested that the nearly 2000 medical device manufacturers \nimmediately respond and indicate their level of year 2000 compliance. \nThis initial lack of response was indeed irresponsible. According to \nthe FDA, of the nearly 1,935 medical manufacturers surveyed, \napproximately 755 replied.\n  Let me repeat this. Of the nearly 2,000 manufactures of life-critical \nmedical devices, the FDA tells us that less than 40 percent responded \nto the oversight agency tasked with insuring that critical medical \ndevices still work when you and I and the people we love are in need \nand might depend on this sophisticated equipment.\n  Again this is unacceptable. I am therefore submitting a list of those \nmanufacturers that did not reply to the FDA's request for information \nto the Record for all Americans to see. It is my hope that these \ncompanies quickly comply and provide information as to the year 2000 \nreadiness of these critical medical devices. It is also my hope that \nthis will serve as a wake up call to other industries to be vigilant, \nresponsible and pro-active in their efforts to insure that Americans \nwake up to a wonderful new year on January first of the year 2000.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the list of these companies be \nprinted in the Record. I understand the Government Printing Office \nestimates the cost of printing this list to be $1,426.00.\n\n[[Page S10791]]\n\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                    Company, City, State or Country\n\n       3d Ultrasound, Inc., Durham, NC; 3m, Tustin, CA; 3m Health \n     Care, Ann Arbor, MI; A.

Mr. President, going back to the previous discussion on \nthe Internet tax issue that the Senator from Arizona raised, I want to \nmake a comment about both the objection raised by the minority leader, \nSenator Daschle, as well as the bill itself.\n  The bill started out being a very controversial piece of legislation. \nThere was great disagreement on exactly whether and how to proceed on \nthis issue. But I must say, the Senator from Oregon, the Senator from \nArizona, and others have worked with a number of us who have had \nreservations and concerns about the bill. I think we have made a \nsubstantial amount of progress. I expect at some point it will get to \nthe floor of the Senate here, and I will hope to be helpful on a \ncompromise that I think does the right thing.\n  I always said if the proposition is, let us not apply punitive taxes \nto the Internet, I am for that. I am for a prohibition against punitive \ntaxes on the Internet. But the way it was described initially, I have a \nlot of concerns about that. There have been a lot of changes made on \nthis bill and I think the changes made a lot of progress. I compliment \nthe Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Oregon as we continue to \ndiscuss this. But I did want to mention one additional point.\n  The Senator from South Dakota, Senator Daschle, was constrained to \nobject. I know the Senator from Arizona understands well the concerns. \nIt is not just about the issue of the Patients' Bill of Rights. We must \nalso find a way to address this agricultural crisis in a satisfactory \nmanner. If we do not, about 20 percent of the family farmers in North \nDakota will not be in the field next spring. It is a devastating \ncircumstance in the farm belt.\n  So the Senator from South Dakota was saying we need somehow to \nprotect our rights to address these key issues. I know the Senator from \nArizona acknowledged that he understood that. I just wanted to point \nout, again, it is not anybody's intention to provide roadblocks. What \nwe want to try to do is see if we can find avenues to address \nsignificant and real issues.\n  Yes, the Internet bill will get here and I think get done at some \npoint. But we need to protect the rights, as legislation brought is to \nthe floor, to deal with the Patients' Bill of Rights and to deal with \nthe agricultural crisis which is potentially so devastating to the farm \nbelt in this country.\n  I wanted to make that point clear to reinforce the comments made by \nSenator Daschle earlier.\n  I yield the floor. I know the Senator from Oregon wishes to be \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will be brief. First, I thank the Senator \nfrom North Dakota for all the work he has done over the last few months \non the Internet tax freedom bill. We are going to get there to no small \ndegree because the Senator from North Dakota has worked so closely with \nus. I thank him for it.\n  In the last few minutes, we have talked about two extremely important \nsubjects: the question of a Patients' Bill of Rights and the Internet \ntax freedom bill. Both of these bills are extremely important to me. In \nfact, shortly after I came to the U.S. Senate in 1996, I offered one of \nthe key provisions in the Patients' Bill of Rights with Senator \nKennedy. It was legislation to ban these gag clauses, these ridiculous \nprovisions in managed care agreements that literally keep physicians \nfrom telling their patients about all their health care options. These \ngag clauses are unconscionable. We received over 50 votes the first \ntime we brought it to the floor of the U.S. Senate, at a time when \npeople knew very little about the subject. I feel very strongly about \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights and, hopefully, we can get an agreement, \nand I do think we can get an agreement that is bipartisan.\n  I also want to say, Mr. President, how strongly I feel about passing \nthe Internet tax freedom legislation as well. It is time for the U.S. \nSenate to begin to write the rules for the digital economy. The \nInternet is clearly going to be the business infrastructure in the 21st \ncentury. Usage is doubling every 60 days, or thereabouts, and it is \nclear we don't have any ground rules to address the critical issues \nthat involve electronic commerce.\n  If somebody in Iowa, for example, wants to order fruit from Harry and \nDavid's in Medford, OR, ship it to their cousin in Florida, pay for it \nwith a bank card in New York and do it\n\n[[Page S10796]]\n\nthrough America Online in Virginia, what are going to be the ground \nrules with respect to taxes?\n  What the Internet cannot afford is the development of a crazy quilt \nof discriminatory taxes with respect to this burgeoning area of our \neconomy. That is why it is so important that the Senate move on this \nlegislation.\n  I will close by saying a word about the manager of the legislation, \nthe Senator from Arizona. Throughout these many months, the chairman of \nthe Commerce Committee, the Senator from Arizona, and his staff have \nworked very closely with me and have worked very closely with a host of \nMembers of the U.S. Senate. There have been more than 30 separate \nchanges made in the Internet tax freedom bill from the time it was \noriginally introduced on a bipartisan basis.\n  I want it understood that a bipartisan effort under the leadership of \nChairman McCain has been made for many, many months now, involving \nSenator Stevens originally, with respect to the Universal Service Fund. \nSenator Dorgan has had a variety of issues with respect to treatment of \nthe States. Senator Bumpers has had enormous contributions and \nquestions that we felt had to be addressed, as well as Senators Gregg \nand Enzi.\n  I am very hopeful that very shortly this week this legislation is \ngoing to be brought to the floor of the U.S. Senate, and I am very \nhopeful that it can be brought to the floor in a way that will also \nallow for the important Patients' Bill of Rights legislation to go \nforward.\n  I have spent a considerable amount of my time since coming to the \nU.S. Senate on both of these issues, working on both of them in a \nbipartisan fashion. I think both of them are now ready for \nconsideration on the floor of the Senate.\n  I see the chairman of the Commerce Committee is here now and has \nanother important bill to bring up. I will close by, again, expressing \nmy appreciation to him for all the time that he has put in to try to \nget the Internet tax freedom legislation specifically before the \nSenate. I believe we are ready now, and certainly those Senators who \nhave brought amendments to the chairman and myself have a right to be \nheard and they should be heard.\n  I believe we are ready for an agreement that will protect the rights \nof every Member of the U.S. Senate and, at the same time, allow the \nSenate to go forward and take the first steps--it is going to be a long \njourney--it is time to take the first steps to writing some of the \nessential rules for the digital economy, the Internet, which is going \nto so dominate our lives in the next century.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Oregon, he is too \nkind in his remarks. The fact is that this legislation was originated \nby the Senator from Oregon. I have been glad to assist and help in that \neffort. He has done the heavy lifting. I appreciate his kind remarks.\n  I assure him that in discussions with the Democratic leader, with \nSenator Dorgan and others, I am confident that we will get this bill up \nand done in the next few days. I thank him for all of his efforts.\n  The Senator from North Dakota mentioned the difficulties in North \nDakota. North Dakota has gotten more than its share of natural \ndisasters this year, including one man-made in the form of an airline \nstrike that was very damaging to the economy of his State. I certainly \nbelieve that all of us are in sympathy with the agriculture crisis in \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, I have been awaiting the presence of Senator Ford, who \nis going to manage on the other side. I am a bit reluctant to move \nforward, so I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in morning business \nfor 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/23/senate-section/article/S10795-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10796-S10800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE SITUATION IN KOSOVO\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in the already strife-torn region of the \nformer Yugoslavia, the new year of 1998 was initiated with a new \ndeclaration of war. A then-small group of pro-independence rebels \ncalling themselves the Kosovo Liberation Army announced its intention \nto fight for the independence of the Kosovo region of what remains of \nYugoslavia. With the wounds from Bosnia still festering and U.S. and \nallied troops seemingly locked-into an intractable peacekeeping \noperation with no end in sight, Europe and the United States once again \nfound themselves with a serious dilemma involving life and death \ndecisions. The subsequent nine months of conflict in the Albanian \nmajority province of Serbia have illuminated the degree to which the \nenlightened nations of the West continue to wrestle with the most \nfundamental tenets of conflict prevention and resolution. The results \nare not impressive.\n  We have not lacked for rhetoric, but we have proven woefully \ninadequate at backing up our words with resolute action. Relatively \nearly in the conflict, but long after the gravity of the situation was \napparent, Secretary of State Albright warned that Serbia would ``pay a \nprice'' for its characteristically scorched-earth military campaign \nagainst the KLA and its ethnic Albanian supporters. ``We are not going \nto stand by and watch . . .,'' she declared, while ``. . . Serbian \nauthorities do in Kosovo what they can no longer get away with doing in \nBosnia.''\n  During the June meeting in Luxembourg of the European Union foreign \nministers, Britain's Foreign Secretary Robin Cook was quoted as \nstating, ``Modern Europe will not tolerate the full might of an army \nbeing used against civilian centers.'' A few days later, as reported by \nthe Washington Post,\n\n       Yugoslavia's reply to threats of NATO airstrikes could be \n     heard for miles around. The nightly bombardment of border \n     villages occupied by rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army has \n     unleashed a flood of tens of thousands of refugees. Caught in \n     the cross-fire, they have seen their homes shelled, then \n     torched by government forces in what other nations and \n     international organizations have denounced as ``ethnic \n     cleansing''.\n\n  The next day, NATO fighter jets streaked across Albanian skies in a \nshow of force that was less than the sum of its parts. ``I'm very \nglad,'' one Albanian said, ``because it shows that [NATO is] for the \nliberation of Kosovo.'' In less time than it took our fighters to land \nat Aviano, though, U.S. and allied credibility had descended to new \ndepths, and the victims of Serb aggression were once again lulled into \na false sense of security. United States foreign policy in the Balkans \nhas once again been shattered by the reality of a dictatorial regime \nadept at manipulating the anemic diplomatic process that resulted in \ntens of thousands of deaths in Bosnia and has now left Kosovo in ruins.\n  By conducting that aerial show of force back in June without \nfollowing-through, and by repeatedly allowing the regime of Yugoslav \nPresident Slobodan Milosevic to employ his tactics from Bosnia of \nprofessing compliance with United Nations demands one day only to \nreturn to his policy of ethnic cleansing the next, the United Nations \nhas failed to accomplish the overriding goal for which it was created: \nthe resolution of conflict so that the crimes of the past would not be \nrepeated in the future. Mr. President, the scale of human tragedy \nbefore us cries out for a European response that it has heretofore been \nunwilling to countenance.\n  There is no question that Russian and Chinese opposition to Security \nCouncil resolutions authorizing the use of force to compel Serb \ncompliance has been a serious, and tragic, obstacle to the kind of \nresolute response circumstances demand. It is also inarguably difficult \nto castigate the United Nations while simultaneously insisting that \nUnited States and NATO policy should not be subordinate to the dictates \nof the U.N. with regard to a conflict so central to European stability. \nAs is often the case in international relations these days, we do not \nenjoy the luxury of the level of clarity prevalent during the Cold War \nwhen Europe was firmly and evenly divided between competing centers of \npower.\n  Europe must take responsibility for the security of the Balkins. The \nUnited States cannot and should not be vested with responsibility for \nmaintaining security in the Balkins in perpetuity. Putting aside for a \nmoment the utter inability of the current Administration to articulate \nand implement a sound policy with regard to Kosovo, both the\n\n[[Page S10797]]\n\nUnited States and Europe must come to terms once and for all with the \ncentral imperative of supporting diplomacy with force.\n  Right now, the Serbs are conducting a major offensive against the \nremnants of the KLA. In fact, this latest offensive cannot truthfully \nbe characterized as counterinsurgency in nature; the cold, hard fact \nis, as with Bosnia before it, the Serb nation is carrying out the very \ntype of brutal, inhumane ethnic cleansing for which it was universally \ncriticized prior to the Dayton Accords. As with Bosnia, a strong, \nmeaningful--and I emphasize ``meaningful''--employment of military \npower against Serb military forces and associated infrastructure at the \noutset could have prevented the scale of devastation that has \nsubsequently transpired. Will Europe learn? If history is a guide, the \nlessons for other peoples subject to domination by stronger neighbors \nare not positive.\n  Our former majority leader, Bob Dole, upon returning from Kosovo, \nstated that ``American and European leaders have pledged not to allow \nthe crimes against humanity which we witnessed in Bosnia to occur in \nKosovo. But from what I have seen, such crimes are already happening.''\n\n  Mr. President, prominently displayed in the United Nations building \nin New York is Picasso's famous and haunting ``Guernica.'' That \npainting symbolized for the artist the carnage, the human suffering on \nan enormous scale, that resulted from the Spanish Civil War--a prelude \nto the Second World War. Perhaps it is too abstract for those countries \nin the United Nations that oppose the use of force to stop the \natrocities that have come to symbolize the former Yugoslavia, or that \nbelieve the war in Kosovo is the internal business of Serbia. A few \nminutes away from here is a reminder of what happens when Edmund \nBurke's adage that ``all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is \nfor good men to do nothing'' is ignored.\n  Ethnic cleansing is not an abstract concept in the Holocaust Memorial \nMuseum. Technology has advanced to wondrous degrees during this \ncentury, but the basic nature of man remains the same. He is capable of \ngreat good; he is just as equally capable of the kind of actions that \nhave made places like Auschwitz, Cambodia, Rwanda, Srebrenica, the \nGulag Archipelego, and Nanking synonymous with sorrow. To this list, \nwill we have to add Kosovo? The situation is clearly not at that stage, \nbut the onset of winter could change that very quickly, with \nimplications that I don't want my small children to have to read about \nin their history books with shame.\n  The Europeans have never been very adept at maintaining peace within \nand between their boundaries. It is instructive that the longest single \nperiod of peace the continent has experienced was during the Cold War \nwhen the United States stationed over 300,000 troops there. That troop \nstrength has since been reduced by two-thirds, and the stabilizing \naspects of the bipolar structure are gone. The turbulence of the post-\nCold War world demands a level of competence on the part of those \nentrusted with our national security and foreign policy that is sadly \nlacking. The history of the conflicts in Bosnia and Kosovo are \nhistories of threats not carried out and of the strong being \noutmaneuvered by the weaker. This Administration's conduct of diplomacy \nwith regard to Serbia, North Korea and Iraq is somewhat akin to what \nwould happen if Thucydides' Melian Dialogue were reversed, and the weak \nwere dictating terms to the strong.\n  But the stakes here are real. The situation in Kosovo is potentially \nmore dangerous than was the case in Bosnia. The KLA's professed long-\nterm goal of uniting the Albanian populations of Kosovo, Macedonia and \nAlbania into a greater Albania cannot be ignored. The conduct of \nSerbia's campaign against the insurgents similarly holds the potential \nfor spreading beyond the confines of that beleaguered province. We \ncannot afford the level of diplomatic ineptitude that has been \nprevalent with regard to the former Yugoslavia since 1992.\n  The United Nations' stagnation as an instrument of conflict \nresolution during the Cold War was, to an extent, understandable. Its \nfailure in the Balkans, however, is a very bad omen indeed for its \nability to perform its most essential core task. The Clinton \nAdministration's inability to comprehend the limitations of that body--\nthe U.N. is, after all, comprised of nations and not of ideals--do not \naugur well for the protection of United States security interests \nabroad. NATO, meanwhile, continues its contingency planning with a \nrange of military options, but anything less than truly decisive force \nthat makes the regime in Belgrade fear for its survival will leave us \nwith a battle yet to be fought, just as it has in Iraq. A token number \nof cruise missiles will cost a lot of money, but will not accomplish \nour goals. Missing is a strategy for ending the conflict, vice \ncompelling President Milosevic to agree to talk about negotiations. The \nemployment of military force must be sufficient to destroy the internal \npower structure that sustains those prosecuting crimes against \nhumanity. In short, NATO must either be prepared to do what militaries \nare trained to do, prevail, or it will reap limited gains of short \nduration.\n  Mr. President, people are dying. Prevarication, the modus operandi of \nthis administration when decisive actions are required, carries a price \nin lives. The world will look to this body for a glimpse of the level \nof U.S. resolve, seeing little in the White House. That is a burden we \nmust face with the grace and dignity and moral fortitude that comes \nfrom representing the citizens of the greatest country in history. It \nis a burden that carries with it implications that none should take \nlightly. Not just in Kosovo but elsewhere where our interests are \nthreatened, the world must know that the United States will stand firm \nand will not follow the path that leads to the inclusion of more places \nin the list of sorrow.\n  Mr. President, last night I was at a function here in Washington. All \nof us who are Members of the Senate attend many functions, many of them \nnightly. This was kind of a special evening, at least for many of us, \nand that is because we honored Senator Bob Dole, our former majority \nleader of the Senate and former nominee of our party for President of \nthe United States.\n  Bob Dole gave a moving, persuasive and compelling speech, probably \nthe likes of which I have never heard him give in the many years I have \nbeen a friend and a compatriot of Senator Dole.\n  This speech that he gave last night, Mr. President, was so strong and \nso compelling that I ask unanimous consent that it, along with my \nintroduction, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Remarks by Senator John McCain Awarding the IRI 1998 Freedom Award to \n                Senator Robert Dole, September 22, 1998\n\n       If you will permit me, I would now like to talk a little \n     bit about some other attributes of Senator Dole's character. \n     It is my privilege tonight to present the 1998 Freedom Award \n     to Bob, and to make a few, brief remarks explaining why the \n     IRI Board of Directors was pleased to recognize with this \n     award Bob's contribution to the American cause--the cause of \n     freedom.\n       I am at a little disadvantage, however. Two years ago, when \n     Bob honored me by asking me to place his name in nomination \n     at the Republican Convention in San Diego, I tried as best I \n     could to state succinctly why I admire Bob so much, and why I \n     thought he would make a great president. I fear that there is \n     little I can offer tonight that would be a truer expression \n     of my regard for Bob than the thoughts I offered in that \n     speech. So I thought I would begin by doing what most \n     politicians love to do: and that is, by quoting myself.\n       I wanted to open my speech in San Diego with a statement \n     that would encompass all the reasons I believe Bob Dole to be \n     such an honorable man; what it was that so distinguished Bob \n     that I thought him worthy to hold the highest office in the \n     land. After considerable thought on the matter, I came up \n     with a description of Bob's character that could also serve \n     as a pretty good definition of patriotism. It reads as \n     follows:\n       ``In America we celebrate the virtues of the quiet hero; \n     the modest man who does his duty without complaint or \n     expectation of praise; the man who listens closely for the \n     call of his country, and when she calls, he answers without \n     reservation, not for fame or reward, but for love. He loves \n     his country.''\n       Today, no less than two years ago, Bob Dole and patriotism \n     are synonymous to me. He loves his country, and has served \n     her faithfully and well all of his adult life. And though his \n     country is honored by his service, he has asked nothing of \n     his country in return save the opportunity to serve her \n     further.\n       He loves his country's cause, and has since he took up arms \n     many years ago to defend\n\n[[Page S10798]]\n\n     American freedom, been a champion for the cause of freedom \n     wherever it is opposed. He was and is an outspoken advocate \n     for all those who are denied their God-given rights to life, \n     liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n       His was among the first voices to bring America's attention \n     to the terrible assault on human life and dignity in Bosnia.\n       For many years, he has tried to alert the world to the \n     persecution of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. From the Balkans \n     to Latin America, he has distinguished himself as an ardent \n     defender of the rights of Man, as many people who have \n     struggled courageously to claim those rights would attest.\n       He has done so, I believe, because he had cause in his life \n     to appreciate how sacred are those rights, and how great are \n     the sacrifices that are too often necessary to defend them.\n       ``There is nothing good about war,'' Bob once wrote, ``for \n     those who have known the horror of battle. Only causes can be \n     good.'' And of his war, the Second World War, he wrote, \n     ``millions of servicemen like myself found a cause to justify \n     the greatest losses.''\n       They were losses that Lieutenant Bob Dole witnessed \n     personally, suffered personally. But the experience did not \n     embitter him, but only reaffirmed for him the nobility of the \n     cause he served. And he has, since the day he lay wounded in \n     a valley in Northern Italy, found his honor in service to \n     that cause.\n       Speaking of America, Bob could have been speaking of \n     himself when he said that in war, America ``found its \n     mission. It was a mission unique in human history and \n     uniquely American in its idealism: to influence without \n     conquest and to hold democratic ideals in sacred trust while \n     many people waited in captivity.''\n       The word ``duty'' was once as common to our political \n     lexicon as the words ``soundbite'' and ``spin control'' are \n     today. We don't hear it mentioned much anymore. Rarely do \n     public office holders offer the pledge that we once expected \n     of all public officials: to do their duty as God has given \n     them light to see it.\n       Of course, we do have an abundance of pledges in politics \n     today. At times, we seem to be practically drowning in them, \n     and as another election approaches I'm sure we will hear them \n     all more than once. But what we should hear more, what I \n     believe every American wants to hear, is the most solemn \n     promise of all--the promise to put the country's interest \n     before our self-interest.\n       I think the American people are almost desperate to believe \n     once again that their leaders conceive of their duty in no \n     lesser terms than that: to put the country and its cause \n     first, and to that end, to pledge, as our Founding Fathers \n     once memorably pledged, our lives, our fortunes and our \n     sacred honor.\n       Bob Dole always construed his duty in those terms, \n     believing that to do otherwise would not only ill-serve his \n     country, but shame him personally. Not once, in his long \n     years of service, has Bob given this country any reason to \n     doubt that he has always done his duty, that he has always \n     put his country first.\n       Late in 1995, President Clinton decided to commit American \n     troops to Bosnia in the hope that they might keep the peace \n     while the principles of the Dayton Accords took root in that \n     sad country. The decision was not overwhelmingly popular in \n     Congress, even less so among many Republicans who worried \n     that the mission was ill-defined, and the problem too distant \n     from American interests to justify risking American lives. I \n     must admit that I, too, harbored strong doubts, and still do \n     about the mission.\n       Bob had his misgivings as well, although he believed \n     strongly, devoutly, that rendering assistance to the victims \n     of aggression and unspeakable human atrocities wherever they \n     were suffering was always America's business. So, he resolved \n     to support the President's decision, and win from the Senate \n     he led an expression of our support as well. It was neither \n     an easy task nor a universally popular one within our own \n     caucus.\n       Bob's opponents for the Republican presidential nomination \n     had already spoken out in opposition to the decision, and \n     were beginning to put extraordinary pressure on Bob to do \n     likewise.\n       Were he to win the nomination he would be running against \n     the man whose controversial decision to put Americans into \n     harm's way Bob had now resolved to defend. You will remember, \n     at the time, most people expected our soldiers to suffer more \n     than a few casualties. I suspect more than one of Bob's \n     campaign consultants advised him to walk away from the issue; \n     to let someone else assume the burden of supporting our \n     troops. But Bob conceived his duty differently.\n       He is a good Republican, but he is an American first. He \n     has personal ambitions, but they are secondary to his ideals \n     and his ambitions for his country. The President had decided \n     to send American soldiers to Bosnia, and so they would go. \n     Bob Dole intended to stand with them. They would risk their \n     lives for a just cause. Bob Dole would risk his ambitions for \n     them.\n       It was a simple, and these days, all too rare act of \n     patriotism from a public servant who cannot conceive of \n     sacrificing his country's interests for personal gain.\n       I have never been prouder of any man than I was of Bob Dole \n     on that day when he reminded me how great a love is love of \n     country, and how richly God has blessed America to spare us \n     leaders, when we need them most, of courage and conscience.\n       Bob Dole has, through all the vicissitudes and temptations \n     of a long life in public service, stayed true to his mission, \n     the mission he glimpsed in a long ago battle on a now \n     tranquil field in Italy. He has done his duty, as God gave \n     him light to see his duty. And he has been a credit to \n     America and American ideals.\n       Bob's hero has always been another Kansan, Dwight David \n     Eisenhower, and he took as the model of faithful, honorable \n     service that exacting sense of duty that characterized \n     Eisenhower's leadership in war and peace. In all the \n     voluminous archives of President Eisenhower's papers, no \n     single article expresses more perfectly his decency, his \n     courage, and his sense of personal responsibility to America \n     than does the statement he wrote on the night before the \n     allied invasion of France.\n       Prayerful that the invasion would succeed, but prepared for \n     it to fail, General Eisenhower sat down, alone, to write a \n     statement that assigned the blame for the decision should D-\n     Day prove the calamity many feared it would be. He assigned \n     it to himself, and himself alone.\n       ``Our landings in the Cherbourge-Havre area have failed to \n     gain a satisfactory foothold and I have withdrawn the troops. \n     My decision to attack at this time and place was based upon \n     the best information available. The troops, the air and the \n     Navy did all that bravery and devotion to duty could do. If \n     any blame or fault attends to the attempt, it is mine \n     alone.''\n       When, by the end of June 6, it became clear that the allied \n     forces had, against daunting odds, accomplished most of their \n     initial objectives, and the invasion had been a success, \n     Eisenhower simply crumpled up the statement and threw it into \n     a waste basket. His foresighted aide retrieved the paper and \n     persuaded the General to preserve it for posterity so that \n     Americans might someday benefit from his example of \n     patriotism and principled leadership.\n       It is more than fitting, Bob, that IRI's 1998 Freedom Award \n     include as a testament to your service, a rare copy of the \n     original hand-written note by General Eisenhower provided to \n     us by the Eisenhower Library in Atchison, Kansas. I take \n     great pleasure in presenting it to you along with photograph \n     of the General addressing his troops on the eve of D-Day, and \n     a first edition copy of his personal account of the war, \n     Crusade in Europe.\n       In addition, IRI is privileged to make a contribution in \n     your name to the cause that is today so close to your heart, \n     and which you serve as National Co-Chairman, the World War II \n     Memorial Campaign. We offer this award to you with the \n     knowledge that it is but a small expression of the esteem you \n     are held in by IRI, everyone here tonight, and by the \n     millions of people whose aspirations IRI was formed to \n     support.\n       But the most important tribute we can offer you is to \n     simply observe of those Americans who with you once \n     sacrificed for something greater than their self-interest--\n     those who came home with you to the country they loved so \n     dearly, and those who rest forever in the European \n     cemeteries--how proud they must be of you for having honored \n     so well, in the many years since the guns fell silent in \n     Europe, their faith and yours in the America of our hearts, \n     the last, best hope of Earth.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Speech delivered by Senator Bob Dole to the International Republican \n                     Institute, September 22, 1998\n\n       Senator McCain, Friends, Ladies and Gentlemen: It is a \n     genuine honor to receive the Freedom Award from the \n     International Republican Institute. It is an honor to be \n     recognized by the IRI and also to be in the company of \n     previous recipients, such as President Reagan and Colin \n     Powell.\n       The IRI has made promoting freedom around the world its \n     mission. In Latin America, Africa and Europe--in countries \n     like Burma, Cambodia, Haiti, and Mexico. Bulgaria, Romania \n     and Belarus, South Africa and Angola, the IRI has worked to \n     promote freedom and in so doing, has made a real difference. \n     Ask President Constantinescu how valuable IRI's training was. \n     The proof was in the stunning 1996 election results that \n     finally put Romania on the road to democracy.\n       IRI's mission is based on the recognition that there cannot \n     be freedom without democracy, rule of law and free market \n     economics. The IRI's job is to turn the legacy of communism \n     and dictatorship into a future of liberty and prosperity. \n     This is a monumentally important task.\n       I would like to commend the IRI staff and join in \n     recognizing those staff that are here from Nicaragua, Romania \n     and South Africa. The process of democratization is not an \n     easy one--especially in countries like these which have a \n     recent history of great strife, inequality and lack of \n     liberty. Because of individuals like those recognized this \n     evening and because of organizations like IRI, there is not \n     only hope, but amazing progress--progress that would not have \n     been imaginable two decades ago.\n       Tonight, I would like to take a few minutes to talk about a \n     matter which I believe is of great importance to America--and \n     of direct relevance to the critically important work of the \n     IRI in fostering freedom. That is the situation in Kosovo.\n       Last Friday I met with President Clinton and National \n     Security Adviser Berger to discuss this growing crisis. I \n     told them what I witnessed and what I believed must be done. \n     This is what I would like to share with you this evening.\n\n[[Page S10799]]\n\n       There is a war going on right now in Kosovo because the \n     United States, for nearly a decade, did not make liberty, \n     democracy and free market economics the priority in the \n     former Yugoslavia.\n       If the United States had made its priority in the former \n     Yugoslavia democracy as opposed to unity, if the United \n     States had promoted reform, instead of status quo, if the \n     United States had isolated dictator Slobodan Milosevic, \n     instead of embracing him, I believe we would not have seen \n     three wars in the Balkans and would not now be witnessing the \n     fourth--and perhaps the most dangerous conflict there since \n     1991.\n       Last week, I returned from a human rights and fact-finding \n     mission to Kosovo with the very able Assistant Secretary John \n     Shattuck. I was last in Kosovo in 1990, when the repression \n     against the Kosovo Albanians had just begun. The Kosovars had \n     been stripped of their political autonomy; the beginning of \n     an apartheid-like system was just becoming apparent. Upon my \n     return, I joined the few voices warning the US State \n     Department, Pentagon and White House that war would come to \n     Yugoslavia. And, it did. First Slovenia, then Croatia and not \n     long after, Bosnia.\n       As terrible as the war in Bosnia proved to be, the war that \n     both the Bush and Clinton administrations feared most was in \n     Kosovo--where it seemed inevitable that conflict would easily \n     spread into neighboring countries, thus destabilizing the \n     entire region. In 1992, President Bush warned Serbian leader \n     Slobodan Milosevic that the United States was prepared to use \n     military force against Serb-instigated attacks in Kosovo. \n     When he took office, President Clinton repeated this so-\n     called ``Christmas warning.''\n       Now six years later, Milosevic is again on the warpath. \n     Based on what I saw two weeks ago, there should be no doubt \n     that Serbia is engaged in major, systematic attacks on the \n     people and territory of Kosovo.\n       Prior to my trip, I had seen some television reports of the \n     suffering in Kosovo. These few images, however, were only a \n     pale reflection of the widespread devastation of lives, \n     property, and society. Many homes have been firebombed; we \n     saw one home ablaze only yards away from a Serb police \n     checkpoint. Entire villages have been abandoned. We \n     encountered armed Serbian police every couple of miles and \n     twenty checkpoints in just six hours.\n       The Albanians we met--mostly women, children and, the \n     elderly ``are living in fear for their lives. They are afraid \n     to go where there are Serb police or other Serb armed forces. \n     And so, despite the near freezing temperatures at night, \n     hundreds of thousands of Kosovar Albanians remain hiding in \n     the hills--without adequate food, water or shelter. Many \n     thousands no longer have homes to return to. The children, in \n     particular, are already showing signs of a vitamin deficient \n     diet; they have sores on their mouths and most have scabies \n     or other skin ailments resulting from a lack of sufficient \n     hygiene. Humanitarian aid personnel are being harassed and \n     even attacked. These aid organizations do not enjoy freedom \n     of access, nor can they bring in certain critical supplies \n     because Belgrade has placed an internal embargo on them.\n       During our visit, we also heard chilling testimony from \n     eyewitnesses to human rights abuses and atrocities, including \n     direct artillery attacks on civilians; seizures at gun point; \n     and, as in Srebrenica in Bosnia, the separation of women and \n     children from men.\n       There may be some even in this audience who may think this \n     is a terrible humanitarian disaster, but why is it important \n     to the United States? What does it have to do with freedom \n     and democracy and American interests?\n       Yes, with hundreds of thousands of displaced persons and \n     winter fast approaching, Kosovo is a humanitarian and human \n     rights catastrophe. However, the problem in Kosovo is not a \n     humanitarian one. It is a political and military crisis, \n     whose most visible symptoms are humanitarian.\n       And so, while more humanitarian aid is desperately needed, \n     such assistance will not solve the problem. And not solving \n     the problem means that stability in that entire region--from \n     Montenegro to Albania, Macedonia and Greece--is dangerously \n     threatened.\n       America cannot wait three years, as it did in Bosnia, to \n     deal effectively with this foreign policy crisis. We cannot \n     afford to wait three months--for humanitarian and geo-\n     political reasons. Tiny Montenegro has closed its doors to \n     fleeing Kosovars, burdened under the strain of thousands \n     already seeking refugee there and by the struggle to distance \n     itself from Milosevic. Albania is on the brink of anarchy. In \n     the blink of an eye, violence could spread into Macedonia and \n     tear that fragile new democracy in two.\n       And what is the American policy response at this moment? \n     Active participation in diplomatic meetings that result in \n     policy statements calling on Slobodan Milosevic to halt his \n     attacks on Kosovo. In short, tough talk and no action.\n       As in Bosnia, America is asking the victims to negotiate \n     with those who are attacking them. As in Bosnia, there is a \n     real attempt to impose a moral equivalence--this time between \n     Serbian forces and the rag-tag band of Albanians, known as \n     the KLA, who have taken up arms against them. As in Bosnia, \n     the United States is not leading its allies, but hiding \n     behind their indecision. As in Bosnia, instead of firing up \n     the engines, NATO is firing up excuses.\n       The bottom line is that once again, Western diplomats are \n     trying to avoid the difficult decisions and are desperate not \n     to take on the person most responsible for the misery, \n     suffering and instability not only in Serbia, but the region: \n     Slobodan Milosevic. As my friend Jeane, who is here tonight, \n     has stated, Bosnia represents the single biggest foreign \n     policy failure of the United States since World War II.\n       Are we ready to repeat that failure?\n       As the diplomats' argument often goes, the situation on \n     Kosovo is ``complicated'' and NATO needs UN Security Council \n     authorization to act. Both of these assertions are dead \n     wrong. First, the situation is not complicated. Indeed, it \n     could not be clearer: This is a war against civilians, and we \n     know who is responsible: Slobodan Milosevic. Second, NATO \n     does not need and should not seek UN Security Council \n     resolution authorizing it to take action to respond to a \n     crisis in Europe that threatens stability in the region. All \n     NATO needs is some leaderhsip--from the United States first \n     and foremost, and then from Britain, France and Germany.\n       Let us not forget that NATO's credibility suffered in \n     Bosnia when it acted as a subcontractor to the United \n     Nations. Tying NATO to the UN now--with respect to Kosovo--\n     will repeat that mistake. And, this time it could have an \n     even more damaging effect on the credibility and relevance of \n     the Atlantic Alliance.\n       When Secretary Shattuck and I met with Milosevic two weeks \n     ago, he did not act like a man cowering in fear of NATO \n     action. Instead, he acted like a man who had already gotten \n     away with murder and would be rewarded for it. Milosevic \n     denied any offensives were underway or being planned, yet \n     within 36 hours of our departure, a serious offensive was \n     begun in the region of Pec.\n       The time is long overdue for the US to embrace a policy \n     that will end Milosevic's reign of terror. The United States \n     had the opportunity to do so when Milosevic was shelling the \n     ancient Croatian port city of Dubrovnik in 1991. It did not. \n     The United States had the opportunity again when the citizens \n     of Sarajevo first had to man the barricades of their city in \n     1992. It did not. The United States had its most significant \n     opportunity to do so at Dayton and did not. Indeed, the \n     Clinton Administration's failure to address the status of \n     Kosovo at Dayton may be the single greatest failure of the \n     already badly-flawed Dayton peace process.\n       The United States and its NATO allies must press urgently \n     for a cease-fire and a simultaneous withdrawal of Serbian \n     police and military forces by a date certain. the KLA must \n     also commit not to attack. NATO must back this ultimatum with \n     a plan to use major force immediately and effectively against \n     Serb military assets if all of the conditions laid out are \n     not met.\n       Let me be clear, the only language Milosevic understands is \n     force.\n       With a cease-fire and withdrawal of all Serbian police and \n     Yugoslavia Army forces, people can safely return to their \n     homes and rebuild their lives with international assistance.\n       There would also be progress on the diplomatic front. Only \n     if civilians are not under attack can Albanians and Serbian \n     leaders engage in genuine negotiations--on a level playing \n     field--with the goal of achieving a sustainable peace that is \n     built on democratic institutions. Such a peace would \n     guarantee that instability would not spread into Montenegro, \n     Macedonia or Albania.\n       Let me also emphasize that a peace based on democratic \n     principles and the creation of democratic institutions would \n     also serve to strengthen the position of the fledgling \n     democratic opposition in Serbia--especially by depriving \n     Milosevic of the opportunity to distract Serb citizens from \n     their deteriorating economy and near-pariah position in \n     Europe. Such a deal would provide significant momentum to the \n     democratization process, momentum which the IRI could \n     capitalize on by expanding its programs there.\n       In conclusion, let me emphasize that half-measures and \n     interim deals will not do. The options are not easy, but that \n     cannot be a justification for Bank-Aid diplomacy. Over the \n     past eight years numerous opportunities have been wasted. \n     American officials at the highest levels have publicly \n     pledged not to allow the crimes against humanity that we \n     witnessed in Bosnia to be repeated in Kosovo. From what I \n     have seen first-hand, such crimes are already occurring--and \n     the ramifications will not be limited to the plight of the \n     Kosovars.\n       Freedom and liberty--the principles that America stands \n     for--are at stake. American credibility and European \n     stability are on the line. What is urgently needed now is \n     American leadership and a firm commitment to a genuine and \n     just peace in Kosovo. It is my hope that President Clinton \n     will do the right thing and that there will be strong \n     support--among Republicans and Democrats. Many of you here \n     tonight can play a role in forging broad bipartisan support \n     for American resolve to end this conflict once and for all.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, Senator Dole spoke about the crisis in \nKosovo. We all know that with the ongoing scandal in our Nation's \nCapital, many of our important national security issues are being \nignored, whether it be Iraq or Korea or the Middle East peace process. \nBut Bob Dole focused the attention and riveted the attention of the \naudience last night, as he did in a recent op-ed piece in the \nWashington Post, on this terrible situation that exists today and the \nimpending terrible\n\n[[Page S10800]]\n\ntragedies that will ensue in Kosovo with the onset of winter.\n  Bob Dole pointed out that literally hundreds of thousands of people \nof Albanian nationality are in the mountains around Kosovo. These \npeople will freeze to death, they will starve to death, and they will \ndie by the thousands and thousands if something isn't done and done \nquickly.\n  Bob Dole's speech and his commitment on this issue should serve as a \ncompelling call to this administration to act--to act--on Kosovo in \nconsultation with the Congress of the United States and the American \npeople.\n  Six months ago, the Secretary of State of the United States of \nAmerica stated we will not allow the Serbs to do in Kosovo what we have \nprevented them from doing in Bosnia, and exactly what we prevented in \nBosnia is taking place in Kosovo at the cost of possibly hundreds of \nthousands of innocent lives.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to read the speech that Bob Dole \ndelivered last night, which has already been printed in the Record. \nRead it and take heed, because I know of no one who has the credentials \nthat Bob Dole has to speak on not only all issues of national security \nbut particularly this issue because of his deep and profound and \nprolonged involvement, and now very emotional involvement, in this \nissue.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I was inspired to come to the \nfloor to respond and to support the words of my friend from Arizona as \nhe spoke very eloquently and emotionally about the plight of the people \nof Kosovo. Growing up as a little boy, I have to tell you, I saw, with \nall Americans, reports and film footage from the Second World War where \nwe saw a holocaust carried out in a previous decade. And I reacted with \nhorror at things that I saw that humankind could do to one another.\n  It just seemed to me, at a young age, that if we had the ability to \nstop holocausts in our time that we should. I know we cannot be the \npolicemen of the world, but I am here to tell you we are right now in \nBosnia. We supported our President. And we are maintaining peace in \nBosnia. But right next door we are witnessing a holocaust unfold before \nour eyes, and we apparently are paralyzed in our efforts to respond.\n  Winter is coming, and tens of thousands of Kosovar Albanians are in \nthe hills and will soon die if something is not done to ensure their \nrights, to ensure their safety, and to stop the bloodshed.\n  Mr. President, I want to suggest that one person is solely and \ndirectly responsible for the catastrophe unfolding before our eyes, and \nthat is President Milosevic of Serbia. He has indicated no willingness \nto negotiate a solution that will allow the Kosovar Albanians to \nexercise their legitimate political rights. He is interested in one \nthing and one thing only--the consolidating and maintaining of his \npower on that country and region. And he apparently will do anything to \nensure that this remains the case.\n  Mr. President, for months the United States and our allies have stood \nby and watched one onslaught after another in Kosovo, rendering \nenormous tragedies in that land; and yet we just respond with critical \nstatements in the face of Serb offenses. For months the United States \nhas told Milosevic that we will not let him get away with in Kosovo \nwhat he has done in Bosnia, but yet we do nothing. We do nothing to \nstop his onslaught. For months, the United States has threatened the \nuse of force if Mr. Milosevic does not take necessary actions to \nwithdraw his forces from Kosovo and to begin a serious process of \nnegotiation.\n  I am saddened to say the other day a reporter just outside this \nChamber asked me if we were doing nothing as a country in the face of \nthis holocaust because of the President's internal difficulties, \nbecause of his unwillingness to wag the dog, if you will. I cannot \nthink of anything more indicative of why we need to make sure our \nCommander in Chief can respond, to have a Commander in Chief that can \nrespond with the integrity of his office. And here we sit paralyzed in \nthe face of unfolding, unspeakable tragedy.\n  I am here to say one thing to Mr. Milosevic: Our patience in the U.S. \nSenate is running out. I join the Senator from Arizona, and many \nothers, in saying time has run out and that I will support vigorous \nand, if necessary, unilateral use of force against Serbian \ninstallations in Kosovo and in Serbia proper. It is time for American \nleadership in Kosovo. It is unfortunate that we have thus far not seen \nevidence of this from the Clinton administration.\n  If it is up to Congress to provide the leadership, so be it. I \nwelcome Senator McCain's call for action. I understand the former \nmajority leader, Bob Dole, has made the same call. And I join them \ntoday in support of America doing something unilaterally, if necessary, \nto take action to stop this tragedy, this unfolding holocaust.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I now ask for the regular order.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/23/senate-section/article/S10796-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10800-S10814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n WENDELL H.

Madam President, since Senator Ford is not here yet, I \nwill not ask for a unanimous consent agreement because I believe he \nwould object at this time. But what I do want to do is go over the \npending amendments, as I know what they are, and urge my colleagues to \ncall in within the next half hour or come over with any amendments they \nmay have to this bill so that we can get a unanimous consent agreement \nnarrowed down on the amendments to the bill.\n  The amendments that I now understand would be pending are: McCain-\nFord amendment, which is a managers' amendment, which is 10 minutes \nequally divided; a McCain amendment, which is relevant, 5 minutes \nequally divided; a Hollings amendment, relevant, 5 minutes equally \ndivided; a Gorton, relevant amendment, 5 minutes equally divided; a \nFord amendment, relevant, 5 minutes equally divided; a Bingaman \namendment, overflights, bolster Native Americans' role, 30 minutes \nequally divided; DeWine sense of Senate, 10 minutes equally divided; \nDorgan, regional jet tax incentives, 2 hours equally divided; Dorgan, \nmandatory interline and joint fair agreements, 2 hours equally divided; \nFaircloth, sense of the Senate, 5 minutes equally divided; Inhofe, FAA \nemergency revocation power, 10 minutes equally divided; Mikulski-\nSarbanes--two amendments--Reagan National Airport, slots and perimeter \nrule, 30 minutes equally divided; Roth, reintroduce title VIII to the \nbill, 5 minutes equally divided; Thompson, criminal penalties for \nairmen who fly without a certificate, 10 minutes equally divided; \nTorricelli, Quiet Communities Act, S. 951, 1 hour equally divided; \nD'Amato-Moynihan, DOT issue 70 slot exemptions at JFK Airport, 10 \nminutes equally divided; Lott-Frist-Moynihan, limit eligible airport \nsize for regional jet section and Reagan National commuter slots, 10 \nminutes equally divided; Reed of Rhode Island, noise at Rhode Island \nairport, 15 minutes equally divided; Reed of Rhode Island, cost-sharing \nnotice, 15 minutes equally divided; Robb, Reagan National Airport, \nslots and perimeter rule, 1 hour equally divided; Snowe, handicapped \naccess violations, increase civil penalty, 10 minutes equally divided; \nSnowe, community air service grants, regional distribution, 10 minutes \nequally divided; Warner, prohibit new Reagan National slots and \nperimeter rule exemptions until Washington Metropolitan Airport \nAuthority nominees confirmed by the Senate, 1 hour equally divided; \nWarner, notice, comment, and hearings before proceeding with Reagan \nNational slots and perimeter rule exemptions.\n  If there are additional amendments to the bill, I would urge my \ncolleagues to send them over so that sometime within the next hour we \ncould try to initially propose a unanimous consent agreement at least \nto narrow down the list of amendments.\n  Madam President, I want to make clear to my colleagues the importance \nof this legislation and why we need to resolve it as quickly as we \npossibly can. Today is the 23rd of September, 1998. If we do not get a \nbill into conference and back and passed by the 1st of October, at \nleast $2 billion worth of moneys out of the airport trust fund/\n\n[[Page S10812]]\n\naviation trust fund will not be allowed to move forward, and also there \nare many letters of intent that entail hundreds of millions more.\n  Madam President, we all know how important aviation is to America. We \nall know how important it is for us to move forward with the ever \ngrowing air traffic in the United States of America.\n  Madam President, I rise in support of S. 2279, the Wendell H. Ford \nNational Air Transportation System Improvement Act of 1998. Today, I \nwill be offering a manager's amendment to the bill as reported by the \nCommerce Committee on July 14, 1998. This bill, as modified by the \nmanager's amendment, has the support of Committee Ranking Member \nSenator Hollings, Aviation Subcommittee Chairman Gorton, Aviation \nSubcommittee Ranking Member Senator Ford, and myself. As I indicated on \nthe floor last week, this is a ``must-pass'' piece of legislation which \nincludes critical aviation projects such as safety, security, capacity \nand noise projects at airports across the Nation.\n  Madam President, if the Congress does not pass legislation to \nreauthorize the programs of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), \nthe FAA will be prohibited from issuing grants to airports in every \nstate, regardless of whether the transportation appropriations bill is \nsigned into law. Therefore, we must act to reauthorize the programs of \nthe FAA before we leave this year.\n  I would like to highlight three areas of importance which this bill \naddresses. First and foremost, it reauthorizes the FAA and Airport \nImprovement Program, AIP. Second, the bill contains essential \nprovisions to promote a competitive aviation industry. Last but not \nleast, it will protect the environment in our national parks from the \nharmful effects of excessive commercial air tour overflights. I have \nworked long and hard on all of these issues. And many of these long and \nhard times have been spent with Senator Ford, the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  This bill provides a two-year authorization for most programs of the \nFAA including FAA Operations, Facilities and Equipment, and AIP, the \nAirport Improvement Plan. Research, Engineering and Development (RE) \nprograms have already been authorized for FY 1999 by separate \nlegislation that was signed into law on February 11, 1998. S. 2279 \nauthorizes the AIP at $2.4 billion for Fiscal Year 1999.\n  The legislation also includes funding for aviation security. Two \nyears ago, the Congress passed the 1996 FAA reauthorization bill which \ncontained numerous provisions designed to improve security at our \nnation's airlines and airports. These provisions included accelerating \ndeployment of the latest explosive detection systems; enhancing \npassenger screening processes; requiring criminal history record checks \non screeners; and requiring regular joint threat assessments and \ntesting baggage match procedures. While these provisions have helped \nsecure our airlines and airports, the legislation before us builds upon \nthe security foundation we established 2 years ago.\n\n  Madam President, S. 2279 legislation also includes several provisions \nto enhance competition in the airline industry. On October 29, 1997, I \nintroduced the Aviation Competition Enhancement Act of 1997, S. 1331. \nThe purpose of this bill was to further deregulate our domestic \naviation system for the the benefit of travelers and communities, by \npromoting more convenient options and competitive air fares for \ntravelers. According to the General Accounting Office report of October \n1996, several factors have limited entry at many airports. These \nfactors include the dominance of routes to and from the four slot \ncontrolled airports by one or two established airlines. In April 1996, \nthe Department of Transportation conducted a study that estimated that \nalmost 40 percent of domestic passengers traveled in markets with low \nfare competition, saving consumers an estimated $6.3 billion annually \nin airline fares.\n  Due to the interest of other Senators to increase competition in the \nairline industry, I worked with Senators Frist and Lott on a substitute \nto Senator Frist's competition legislation, S. 1353, which the Commerce \nCommittee also reported out of Committee on July 14, 1998. These \nprovisions are also included in the bill that is now before us.\n  The competition provisions--and I would like to again give great \ncredit to Senators Frist and Lott--have three main elements. First, \nthey would provide slot exemptions for nonstop regional jets to fly to \nand from so-called underserved communities and the four slot-controlled \nairports--Reagan National, O'Hare, LaGuardia, and JFK--would create 12 \nnew round-trip flights at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, \nand provide limited exemptions to the perimeter rule at Reagan National \nand finally, would add additional slots at Chicago O'Hare. I will \ncomment on each of these provisions.\n  The slot exemptions for nonstop regional jets must be approved by the \nSecretary of Transportation for service between a nonhub airport and a \nsmall hub airport and the high density airports which are O'Hare, \nLaGuardia, and JFK.\n  At Reagan National, the legislation would create 6 new daily round-\ntrip flights beyond the 1,250-mile perimeter, a federally imposed \nrestriction, and 6 new daily round-trip flights to under-served markets \nwithin the perimeter. Carriers can only use Stage 3 aircraft that meet \nstrict noise requirements in the new slots. The new service will result \nin only one or two new flights per hour at the airport.\n\n  At Chicago O'Hare, the legislation as reported by the Commerce \nCommittee would provide discretionary authority to the Secretary of \nTransportation to convert up to 100 unused military slots to air-\ncarrier slots over three years at Chicago's O'Hare Airport. Due to \nconcerns raised by some Senators, however, I have worked on a \ncompromise regarding additional flights at O'Hare. Under the agreement \nwhich is included in the managers amendment we are offering today, the \nSecretary of Transportation would be directed to allocate 30 new daily \ntake-off and landing slots over the next three years. Specifically, \neighteen slots would provide service to under-served communities, and \ntwelve slots would be available for general distribution.\n  I would now like to address those members of the Senate who have \nconcerns about the possible increase in noise at O'Hare and Reagan \nNational due to the increase in slots. The aircraft that operate in \nthese new slots would be required to operated Stage 3 aircraft only. \nStage 3 aircraft is the quietest technology available today. The entire \ndomestic fleet is in the process of converting from Stage 2 aircraft to \nthe significantly quieter Stage 3 aircraft. Currently, the fleet is 75 \npercent Stage 3. By 2000, thanks to legislation previously passed, it \nmust become 100 percent Stage 3. Once the fleet becomes 100 percent \nStage 3, the noise impact on areas surrounding airports will drop \nsignificantly.\n  At Reagan National, the FAA has already stated that the phaseout of \nStage 2 aircraft will have a significant impact on noise at the \nairport. Therefore, adding a few more flights of quieter Stage 3 \naircraft certainly should not cause noise levels to approach what they \nare today.\n  At O'Hare, before granting any of the exemptions, the Secretary is to \nstudy and report on the environmental considerations that are \nassociated with the flights that would utilize the additional \nexemptions, including determining that there is no significant increase \nin noise. I want to repeat: including the Secretary must determine that \nthere is no significant increase in noise. The Secretary must certify \nthat sufficient capacity is available at O'Hare to accommodate the \nadditional flights, and that the exemptions can be used safely.\n  Prior to issuing any of the slot exemptions, the Secretary is to \nprovide 30-days public notice in the Federal Register. Furthermore, the \nSecretary is to consult with local officials on the noise and \nenvironmental issues surrounding granting of the exemptions. At the end \nof three years, the Secretary will again study and report on how \nsafety, the environment, noise, access to underserved markets \nthroughout the country, and competition at Chicago O'Hare have been \nimpacted by the new exemptions.\n\n  Meanwhile, the revised bill will direct the Secretary to study and \nreport on the community noise levels in the areas surrounding the four \nhigh density airports O'Hare, Reagan National, LaGuardia and JFK, once \nthe national 100-percent State 3 requirement comes into effect in 2000. \nAmong other things,\n\n[[Page S10813]]\n\nthe report is to compare community noise levels since enactment of the \nStage 3 aircraft fleet requirements in the 1990 Airport Noise and \nCapacity Act. The report will also offer suggestions on improving the \nnoise impact of these airports.\n  In summary, Madam President, this legislation represents over a \nyear's work by the Commerce Committee and the Aviation Subcommittee. I \ncannot overemphasize the need to move quickly on this bill. As the end \nof the second session of the 105th Congress comes to an end, we cannot \nrun the risk of the bill getting caught up in unrelated, politically-\ncharged issues. This bill will have to be conferenced with the House, \nand we need to take the time to move through the appropriate process.\n  Before I conclude my remarks, I would like to comment on an important \nissue that is not being addressed in this bill--although I considered \noffering an amendment on the subject. The issue concerns the abuse of \nfamiliarization training programs at the FAA. Such programs authorize \nFAA employees to have free access to cockpit or cabin seating on \ncommercial flights. Cockpit access is designed to provide these \nemployees an opportunity to gain firsthand experience in the \noperational characteristics of various types of aircraft, to directly \ninterface with cockpit crews and air traffic controllers, and to gain \ninsight into the FAA's systems' performance.\n  A February 1996 audit by the Department of Transportation's Office of \nInspector General found that some FAA employees violated standards of \nethical conduct by using their familiarization privileges to fulfill \npersonal travel agendas and take vacations. The IG essentially found \nthat FAA oversight and control of the familiarization programs was \ninadequate. Despite the fact that the IG recommended that the FAA \nestablish stronger guidelines and internal controls with regard to \nthese training programs, it is my understanding that they still are not \nadequately managed.\n  Despite my concerns, I am not calling for elimination of appropriate \ntraining programs that provide valuable insight and experience for FAA \nemployees. Taxpayers simply want to be assured that such program are \nbeing used only for legitimate training purposes and not being abused \nfor personal gain, by managers and controllers alike. Unfortunately, \nthe ride-along privilege seems to have evolved from a legitimate \ntraining tool into a personnel perk that is easily subject to abuse.\n  I recently wrote to Secretary Slater and Administrator Garvey about \nthis matter. I strongly urged the FAA to review each of the \nrecommendations contained in the 1996 IG report. Without strong \noversight and control of these familiarization programs, they will \nremain open to abuse. It is inappropriate for FAA employees to use \nthese training programs for personal travel. This issue is particularly \ntroublesome because it involves taking advantage of an industry the FAA \nis responsible for regulating. Therefore, I urged the FAA to take every \naction to stop the abuse of these programs and establish guidelines for \ntheir proper use.\n  It is my understanding that the FAA, working with the DOT-IG, has set \nforth a plan to take decisive action to prevent further abuse of \nfamiliarization programs. I hope that changes are implemented \nimmediately. I will continue to follow this issue very closely.\n  Madam President, my message to the FAA is we should not have to pass \na law in order to prevent the abuse of a relatively important training \nprogram. Clean up your act and restore the Congress' and the American \npeople's confidence in this program or we will have to act. Sometimes \nwhen we act legislatively there are unintended consequences, as well as \nintended consequences.\n  Returning to the matter of the legislation at hand, I urge all of my \ncolleagues to support passage of S. 2279. We cannot adjourn for the \nyear without taking final action on this important legislation. If we \nfail to act, the FAA's hands will be tied and they will be unable to \naddress needed security and safety issues in every State in the Nation.\n  Madam President, about a week ago I included in the Record the \namounts of money that will be allocated to each State to take care of \nor begin to address many of their aviation requirements. At a later \ntime, I will include that again in the Record.\n  The last thing we want is a disruption of not only the funding, but \nalso the ongoing safety measures that are a part of this bill and that \nare a follow-on to the legislation that the Senator from Kentucky had \nto deal with a couple years ago.\n  I urge my colleagues, again, to call in their amendments. We will \ninclude them in a unanimous consent agreement which we will try to \npropound. I understand that there is an important function this evening \nwhich will require the Senate to go out around 6 o'clock. I would like \nto try, at the least, to get our agenda refined by that time.\n  I know that the Senator from Kentucky has remarks, so I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank my friend, Senator McCain, chairman of the \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation Committee. I compliment him on \nhis remarks. I think he fully and fairly explained the legislation that \nis before the Senate. One of the things I want to reiterate that he \nstated is that every State in this Nation has a vital part in this \npiece of legislation as it relates to air transportation, not only \ndomestically but internationally. It is important. We are talking, I \nthink, in the neighborhood of approximately $10 billion per year. It is \nso important, as the chairman has said, that we work hard and quickly \non this bill so that we might pass it prior to adjournment. I would \nhate to see this piece of legislation caught up in a continuing \nresolution that would generally turn into a ``Christmas tree.''\n\n  So, Madam President, before us today is S. 2279, a bill that my good \nfriend, Senator Ted Stevens, and this committee named after me. I hope \nhaving that name on it won't prevent it from moving expeditiously. It \nis an honor to have a piece of legislation named after a Member, and I \nthank the Senator from Alaska for his friendship and his kindness.\n  As many of my colleagues know, this bill is a ``must'' pass bill. \nWithout it, the FAA and our nation's airports can not continue to build \nto meet future needs. I have watched over my career as airports in \nLouisville, Cincinnati, Owensboro, Hazard and may other places in my \nState, have benefited from the work of the FAA. We all have seen the \ngrowth in aviation throughout the country and, yes, throughout the \nworld. Denver, for example, was a pipe dream for many years. Today, it \nis a vital part of the aviation system.\n  Past Administrators, like Linda Daschle, and Secretaries, like Sam \nSkinner, have also realized how critical aviation is to our economy. In \nnaming these two individuals, I do not mean to exclude the many fine \nindividuals who have held those posts.\n  The Administrator today, Jane Garvey, and the Secretary, Rodney \nSlater, have seen first hand how important airport improvements are to \nour communities.\n  I had hoped, in my last FAA reauthorization bill, that we could have \ndone more. In 1996, along with Senator McCain  and others, we tried to \nset a course to reforming the FAA. We worked through difficult issues \ntogether, and produced a good road map for the FAA. One piece remains \nmissing--funding. There will be options that will be debated next \nyear--a fee system, taking the Airport and Airways Trust Fund off \nbudget, or keeping the current system. As long as you can ensure that \nthe FAA has the money it needs to modernize and meet the future needs \nof the traveling public, you will succeed.\n  Today, we will lay down a managers' amendment. We have been working \non it ever since the FAA bill was reported by the Commerce Committee. \nMany issues of concern of the Members have been addressed. Some remain \nunresolved.\n  I want to make clear that there are a few provisions that still need \nsome work. Clarification of intent will be important.\n  The bill today does two critical things--it gives the FAA a road map \nto improve safety and to make sure that communities that have not \nbenefitted from airline deregulation have a chance to improve airline \nservices.\n\n[[Page S10814]]\n\n  I have heard the Chair's distinguished colleague, who is on our \nCommerce Committee, talk about the air transportation problems in small \ncommunities in their area. I am hopeful that in this piece of \nlegislation we moved in the right direction to help those communities \nthat have not benefited from airline deregulation and have a chance to \nimprove their services. I will talk more about the small community \nneeds later.\n  As I said earlier, I think Senator McCain explained the bill very \nwell and very fairly. I am hopeful that colleagues on my side will be \nmore than willing to accept the managers' amendment and will be Henry \nClay-like--that is, in the mood of compromise--as we move into the \namendments that are not quite ready to be agreed to.\n  I am hopeful that we will be limited to maybe five or six votes and \nthen final passage. If we can do that, then that will be a real victory \nfor the legislative process. I want to express a special thanks to the \nstaff on both sides who have worked so hard since this bill was \nintroduced to work out many of the amendments that were being proposed \nand suggested.\n  I think we come today with a package that is almost there. I am sure \nthat once we get into the five or six amendments that might be \ncontentious, we will be able to work it out. Even now, as we are \nbringing this piece of legislation to the floor, staff are working to \nsee if they can reach an agreement on the final pieces of legislation. \nI agree with my colleague, Senator McCain, that we are hopeful that \nbetween now and roughly 6 p.m., we will know how many amendments will \nbe brought to this piece of legislation, how many would need a vote, \nand how many we would need to discuss. We are hopeful that we can be \nvery close at the end of the day to getting this bill prepared to pass \nhere tomorrow and send it to conference, so that we can include this \nmust-pass bill in our agenda before we leave here somewhere around \nOctober 9.\n  Again, I thank my colleague for all of his hard work. He is a pretty \ntenacious fellow. When there are things that he believes should be \ndone, even though he may not have a majority with him at that time, \nlook out, here he comes. So we are down to five or six amendments, I \nbelieve, and we are still working to try to see if an accommodation can \nbe made, because when we are talking about the transportation and the \nindustrial development, those things are so important to this country \nand our ability to move in the international sphere that we must pass \nthis bill before we leave here.\n  So I am ready to work. I will meet with our colleagues any time. Our \nstaffs are prepared to meet, and we will do whatever is necessary to \nspend the time to work out these final few amendments. Before we leave \nhere this afternoon, I look forward to having some kind of a finite \nlist, if we can get it, of those that we will be considering in the \nnext 24 hours.\n  Madam President, I thank the chairman for his courtesy and the time. \nI yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, again, I thank the Senator from \nKentucky. I argue that if I possess any legislative skills, a major \npart of the reason for that is that I learned from a master for several \nyears. I was privileged to serve as the ranking member of the Aviation \nSubcommittee of which the distinguished Senator from Kentucky was the \nchairman. I watched the Senator from Kentucky masterfully, with \nenormous skill and bipartisanship, pass several pieces of landmark \nlegislation. He did it in a way that I will always remember, and he did \nit even though issues may have been rather controversial, and he did it \nwithout rancor. I believe that the contributions that he has made to \naviation in America will be remembered long past his time here in the \nU.S. Senate.\n  Madam President, we do have a managers' amendment, which I will bring \nforward in just a minute, as we attempt to get amendments.

Madam President, once again, I come to the floor to express \nmy opposition to fast-track procedures. Fast-track procedures were \nsoundly defeated last year by this body, but were resurrected by the \nSenate Finance Committee as part of a trade bill reported under its \njurisdiction.\n  In reviewing the trade bill reported by the Senate Finance Committee, \nI am reminded of a remark attributed to Napoleon in referring to one \ntime political-supporter-turned-foe, Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-\nPerigord. Purportedly, Napoleon referenced Talleyrand as ``a silk \nstocking filled with mud,'' believing that Talleyrand's costume and \ncharm covered nothing but light-mindedness and egotism. Regardless of \nthe legitimacy of Napoleon's remark, ``a silk stocking filled with \nmud'' is exactly my expectation of what would result from the \nprovisions of the trade bill reported by the Senate Finance Committee. \nThe bill's supporters have proclaimed a trade package promising \nlucrative U.S. economic gains, and have tried to stake out a claim to \nthe moral high ground in the name of free trade. The rhetoric may extol \na very pretty package, indeed, but, I am not sold by packaging. \nAmerican workers simply cannot afford pleasing packaged rhetoric that \nin reality might leave them in an uphill fight, through an \ninternational thicket, to save their jobs.\n  In addition to the certainty that current fast-track trade \nnegotiating authority offers no guarantee to the average American \nworker, my colleagues should take heed that, likewise, no certainty \nexists that rosy international economic predictions linked to fast-\ntrack authority would come true. Take a look at the current global \neconomic crisis. There are no guarantees.\n  I have listened to my colleagues who urge support of the fast-track \nprocess, but I cannot, and I will not, vote to undermine a \nresponsibility assigned to Congress through the Constitution. That \nresponsibility is ``to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations'' and to \n``lay and collect * * * Duties, Imposts and Excises''--a responsibility \nthat this legislation appears bent on diminishing.\n  Clearly, under the Constitution, the Senate is to have a meaningful \nrole in trade negotiations. Likely, the Founding Fathers recognized the \ndifferent institutional interests that affect trade negotiations and, \nthus, crafted provisions to provide checks and balances to ensure that \nthe broad interests of the states--and the people--are protected. By \nside-stepping the Senate's authority in trade negotiations, we are \ncircumventing the framework set up by the Founders to help guarantee \nthat the total national interest is met. We are playing dangerously \nwith the basic premises that underlie our system of checks and \nbalances, and separation of powers.\n\n  I note that many of my colleagues feel that the fast-track \nlegislation under consideration sufficiently revises past trade \nnegotiating authority to ensure that Congress' constitutional role in \nthe regulation of foreign trade is preserved. Particularly, in this \nregard, supporters are touting the bill's beefed-up notice and \nconsultation provisions as achieving the proper balance of power \nbetween the executive and legislative branches of government.\n  I am supportive of continuous dialogue between the Administration and \nthe Congress throughout any trade negotiating process. That would seem \nlike a commonsense approach to me. But guidelines and cursory oversight \nprovisions simply do not fulfill the Senate's constitutional role in \nforeign trade, and these new consultation and\n\n[[Page S10815]]\n\nnotification provisions can not overshadow the bill's basic \nshortcomings. That basic flaw is that the Congress through this measure \nhands the President broad authority to initiate, negotiate, and present \ntrade agreements to the Congress. The Congress must then consider those \nagreements by an up-or-down vote with little or no debate and no \nopportunity to offer amendments.\n  That is where we get off the track. They may call it the fast-track \nprocess. But that is where we leave the constitutional track. That is \nwhere we leave the track, which under the Constitution, says that the \nSenate has the right to offer amendments.\n  While the Members on the committees of jurisdiction may have the \nopportunity to influence and develop the implementing legislation, for \nall practical purposes, this bill obliterates the voices of most of the \nMembers of Congress when it comes to international trade agreements.\n  The Constitution says that revenue measures shall originate in the \nHouse of Representatives but that the Senate may amend as on other \nbills. But here in this so-called fast track, the agreement is \npresented to the Senate to accept--up or down, with no amendments in \norder.\n  Take it all or nothing. Frankly, I have little faith that \nconsultations with the administration will have much impact--this or \nany other administration, if we are to be guided by recent \nadministrations.\n  Such consultations--with this or any administration--usually do not \nyield significant results. They have not thus far, in recent years \ncertainly.\n  So consult and notify as you will, but I am well aware of the \nlikelihood that the President will sign an agreement, an implementing \nbill will stealthily materialize, and Senators will be provided with an \nimmense document which they have little ability to change.\n  It is take it or leave it. This is where we leave the track. This is \nwhere we part company as far as I am concerned. Under this bill, \nSenators' ``meaningful'' role in trade pacts will continue to be a yes-\nor-no vote on legislation that can affect millions of American workers \nand their communities.\n  Perhaps I would be more enthusiastic about fast-track procedures if I \nbelieved that past trade agreements implemented under fast-track rules \nwere beneficial to the nation as a whole.\n  Regrettably, I believe that past agreements, such as the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, which I voted against, have \npoorly represented the concerns of the average American worker.\n  By eroding the carefully crafted checks and balances provided under \nthe Constitution, our current trade policy poorly represents the \nbroader interests of American society.\n  Why can't the Senate be given an opportunity to at least offer 1 or 2 \nor 3 or 4 amendments? I am not suggesting that the Senate ought to be \nthe arbiter over every little, teensy-weensy item in a trade agreement. \nI am not suggesting that at all. Obviously, we can't do that. But to \nsay that the Senate cannot amend, can offer no amendments is off the \ntrack. To me that doesn't comport with the Constitution which provides \nthat the Senate may offer amendments to bills.\n  Trade agreements, in principle as well as in practice, always have \nwinners and losers. I believe the underlying issue for the average \nAmerican worker is precisely who benefits most from our trade \nnegotiations. I believe that the average American worker perceives that \na select few U.S. industries keep winning, while other domestic \nindustries keep losing, and that the promised ``trickle down'' of \nbenefits from the winners to the losers never actually trickles.\n  Some will say that the benefits have not yet had time to trickle \ndown. But data available today demonstrate a most distressing trend \ntoward U.S. income inequality. That is: the rich keep getting richer \nand the poor keep getting poorer. Under fast-track rules, Senators \ncannot challenge trade provisions that appear inappropriate or unfair. \nThey cannot question trade provisions which seem to contain juicy deals \nfor specific industries or companies, but hold few guarantees for the \naverage American worker just trying to make ends meet, take care of \nfamily responsibilities, and save a little bit for retirement.\n  Thus, it should be no mystery to Members of Congress as to why the \nAmerican public is increasingly skeptical about our trade policies. \nDuring the NAFTA debate there were promises that the agreement would \ncreate lucrative economic gains for Americans--all Americans. American \nworkers remember this promise, and they have judged that the promised \ngains have not materialized.\n  We need to wise up. Our trade negotiators are under strong pressures \nfrom certain influential industry sectors in our economy to negotiate \ndeals which benefit them. To achieve these deals, our negotiators often \noffer our trading partners concessions, such as tariff reductions that \nadversely affect less influential U.S. industries. Such concessions, I \nbelieve, are not usually properly reviewed. Too often, the benefits \nachieved in our trade agreements are insignificant compared with the \ncosts to the individual workers, and the total costs to the economy. \nWorse, many of the negotiated provisions to benefit U.S. industries \nfail to materialize because our trading partners fail to implement the \npromised reforms.\n  Therefore, we end up imposing enormous costs on various groups and \nsegments of our economy and wind up with nothing to show for the \ndamage. We end up with that pretty silk stocking filled with worthless \nmud.\n  Average American workers live in my state of West Virginia. They work \nhard for their money, very hard indeed. They labor in the coal mines, \non small family-operated farms, in steel, glass or chemical \nmanufacturing plants. These hard-working families deserve a fair slice \nof the pie. These and other American workers elected the various \nmembers of this body to look after their interests in national trade \nmatters. Senators simply cannot adequately fulfill this obligation \nunder fast-track procedures.\n  The Constitution established a system of government that has served \nthe United States well for over 200 years. It created a nation filled \nwith the promise of opportunity for all. It is our duty to do our best \nto make certain that the interests of every American are considered \nwhen it comes to matters of trade.\n  We live in an increasingly globalized world economy. I am not a \nprotectionist and I am not against fair and free trade. But I would \nvote to preserve the Senate's essential role in its right to amend \nbills and in regulating foreign commerce. I would vote against fast-\ntrack procedures, as I have in the past, procedures that camouflage \nprovisions that simply might not be acceptable to the majority of \nAmericans.\n  I urge my colleagues to carefully consider the institutional and \npractical problems that fast track presents. The Constitution is clear: \nCongress is assigned the power ``to regulate Commerce with foreign \nNations: and to ``lay and collect duties, imposts and excises.''\n  The Constitution is also clear on the point that the Senate has the \npower and the right to amend legislation that comes before this body.\n  Let us not again so easily relinquish our constitutional power when \nit comes to issues of such importance to American working families.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor a period of 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FORD.

Madam President, I wanted to return to the floor; I have \nspoken about this issue before, but I wanted to continue to raise the \nissue because as we move into the final weeks of this session of the \nCongress, it is one of the core issues we have to address; that is, the \nquestion of budget discipline as a Congress.\n\n[[Page S10816]]\n\n  It has taken us a long time--29 years, I believe--to get to a \nsurplus, but this year we finally have a surplus. The American people \nplace great faith in that and appreciation in that, and we as a \nCongress, obviously, are proud of the fact we finally reached a \nsurplus. It was done as a result of a lot of hard work. We made some \ndifficult decisions. We tightened down on the spending of the Federal \nGovernment and we especially maintained fiscal discipline here in the \nCongress. We did that through the use of what are known as caps. We set \na budget in place, we had a 5-year budget agreement with the President \nlast year, and it has led us on a glidepath to a surplus. The key to \nthat budget agreement was that we set spending limits. We said: ``We \nshall not exceed those spending limits.''\n  Unfortunately, as we move towards the closing days of this Congress, \nwe appear to be at the point of almost saying that the caps are \nirrelevant, that the disciplining effects which they had which got us \nto this surplus are going to be cast overboard. That is because we have \nsomething coming at us called an emergency supplemental.\n  An emergency supplemental is not an emergency, it is simply a bunch \nof spending which is going to be done outside the budget process, \nindependent of the caps. On top of the spending which we said we would \nmake, we are going to add new spending. It is as if you were running a \nhousehold and you had income of $100 a week and you set your spending \non your grocery bills and your electric bills so they would meet that \n$100. And then suddenly you said, ``I happened to make $110 this week \nso I am going to spend $110--well, no, maybe I'll spend $120. I am not \ngoing to limit my spending by what I had originally planned, I am \nsimply going to raise it arbitrarily.''\n  That is what is happening here. We are using a vehicle called an \nemergency supplemental to arbitrarily increase the spending of the \nFederal Government. The projection now is that we are going to have an \nemergency supplemental somewhere in the vicinity of $20 billion. That \nis a lot of money. That is going to have a very dramatic impact on the \nsurplus, because the surplus is projected to be not a great deal higher \nthan $20 billion. It could literally, depending on the economic effects \nof the Asian situation and the slowdown of the American economy, it \ncould literally slow down arriving at the surplus if we spend $20 \nbillion more than we budgeted for, to exceed the caps in that way.\n  Why does it get designated as an emergency? It gets designated as an \nemergency because, if it didn't get designated as an emergency, it \nwould be subject to a point of order and you would have to get 60 votes \nin order to spend it. But if it is designated as an emergency, it does \nnot get hit with a point of order and therefore it can be spent with \njust a majority of Congress supporting it. So the budget discipline is \nlifted off.\n  What are these emergencies? One of the emergencies is that the year \n2000 is coming. As my colleague from North Carolina, Senator Faircloth, \nwho happens to be one of the more original folks around here, said: Are \nwe just suddenly learning that the year 2000 is coming? That is hardly \nan emergency. We know and we have known for a long time that the year \n2000 is coming. Thus, the additional $3 billion to address that is not \nan emergency. It should have been budgeted for.\n\n  Another emergency is Bosnia. Did we suddenly find out that we are in \nBosnia? No. We have known we have been in Bosnia for quite a while. \nObviously, that is not an emergency.\n  Another emergency happens to be the farm program. Originally it was \nasking for $2 billion in emergency spending. Now it is up to $4 \nbillion. The leader on the other side wants to make it $7 billion. I \nhave to tell you, every year that I have been in the Congress the farm \nprogram has come to us and asked for an emergency spending bill. There \nis no emergency here, other than the fact that that is the way the \nmoney gets spent--outside of the budget process. We all know that \ncertain areas of this country every year are going to have problems \nwith their farm program. It is simply a function of weather and factors \nlike weather. In this case, it is a function of the international \neconomy going flat. But every year we have this. It is a predictable \nevent, so it is not an emergency. It is something that we should be \nanticipating.\n  Then we hear also that the President is going to come forward with \nemergency spending for defense. Clearly, defense needs more money. It \nis rather unusual that the President should be saying this, because for \nthe last 6 years he has essentially tried to cut defense and increase \nspending on all the other programs in the Federal Government on the \nback of defense, and now it suddenly becomes an emergency that he has \nfigured out that after 6 years he has cut defense so dramatically that \nit is in a horrendous situation and we are basically heading towards a \nmilitary establishment which may be a shell, which may not be able to \ndeliver the defense of the United States.\n  That may be an emergency in the sense that it is a clear threat to \nthis country, but from a fiscal standpoint it was a known action which \nwas taken by this administration over the last 6 years, to savage the \ndefense budget, which has led us to this point. If it is the desire of \nthe administration to suddenly increase defense funding, they should do \nit within the context of the budget process and take money from some of \ntheir beloved programs for which they have moved money out of defense \nand into those programs--take it back from those beloved programs and \nput it back in defense spending so this country is adequately defended.\n  So the fact is, as we head towards the closing days of this session, \nwe confront a potential hemorrhaging of the budget process through an \nemergency supplemental. We are hearing with crocodile tears, I think, a \nlot of talk from the leader of the other body and from the Vice \nPresident, and even the President to some degree, that any tax cut \nwould be an attack on the Social Security trust fund because any tax \ncut would come out of surplus and thus would be taken from the Social \nSecurity trust fund. That is the mantra, now, of the political \noperatives of this world who work for the Democratic Party, the James \nCarvilles. That is what they are going to try to label Republicans: \n``You are going to cut taxes and you are going to cut Social Security, \nbecause that's going to come out of the surplus.''\n  What is good for the goose is good for the gander. If that is the \ncase when the President sends up here a $20 billion supplemental \nrequest, many of which are not emergencies but which are predictable \nevents--like the year 2000, like the agricultural situation, like \nBosnia, like the defense issues--if they are going to send that amount \nof money up and ask that it come out of the emergency supplemental \nfunding process, which means it comes directly out of the surplus, that \nalso is an attack on Social Security in the same context as a tax cut \non the Social Security trust fund. You can't have it both ways, Mr. \nPresident and members of the administration. You can't be saying a tax \nreduction has an impact on Social Security but the emergency \nsupplemental doesn't. They both do, because the surplus is a function \nof excess tax revenue coming in under the Social Security trust fund.\n\n  What should we do? The proper fiscal thing to do is to offset this \nfunding, these expenditures which we are going to undertake on the \nemergency supplemental. Granted, we can't do it all, I accept that, but \nwe should certainly offset a large percentage of it. So before we come \nout here and hemorrhage the discipline that got us to a surplus, \nundermining the core elements that gave us fiscal solvency as a Nation \nfor the first time in 29 years, I think we should pause and think about \nthat and say, ``Listen, maybe we ought to step back, try to figure out \na way to pay for this supplemental so we don't undermine the budget \nprocess and undermine the surplus and, to some degree, undermine the \nSocial Security trust fund.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Madam President, I appreciate the remarks of the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire. Many of the economists give credit for the \nfinancial position of this country to the President and those who voted \nfor the 1993 Budget Act, for which not a one on the side of the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire voted.\n  Secondly, the CBO, which is an appointment of the majority party, has \nsaid there will only be a $31 billion surplus in the general fund at \nthe end of 10\n\n[[Page S10817]]\n\nyears. He is partially right in saying if we have an emergency \nsupplemental that it would come from the surplus, which is basically \nSocial Security. Any tax break that is given comes from Social \nSecurity. I think whatever we might believe about the President, if a \nbill that goes to his desk that takes part of the Social Security trust \nfund money and spends it for a tax break or anything else that he will \nveto it, because the economic situation of this country is still an \namazement to the rest of the world, how we have put our economy and our \neconomic position in place.\n  What is an emergency? I think the rules are basically something \nsimilar to this. I don't have it before me to read. But it is something \nthat doesn't come all the time, it is unexpected. The Senator from New \nHampshire says you can expect a drought, or you can expect too much \nwater, or you can expect all these things, so you should fund for it. I \nhave gone through years when we didn't have an emergency in the farm \ncommunity. I have gone through years when we did not have an emergency \nappropriations. So, therefore, you didn't need to budget it.\n  Secondly, the emergency is something that occurs and is not in \nperpetuity. The tax cut goes on; it doesn't stop. If you have an \nemergency now, you try to take care of that emergency; if it doesn't \noccur again, you don't have to do it again. If you give a tax break, \nthat goes on forever, in perpetuity. So there is a difference between a \ntax cut and an emergency supplemental appropriations. It isn't \nsomething that reoccurs; you do it one time.\n  As we look at the Freedom to Farm bill that was heralded as the \nsavior for the farm program, we see now that it really doesn't work; \nthere is no safety net for the farmers. There is a crisis in the \nMidwest. The farmers who raise the grain have had a lot of trouble, and \nit is not necessarily no rain, a drought, and so forth, but prices. The \nNorth American Free Trade Agreement, which only seven of us in the \nSenate voted against at the time, has now come back to bite us. When \nyou find farmers standing at the border between the United States and \nCanada preventing those 18 wheelers from coming in, it is somewhat \nunderstandable that we should be concerned about it.\n  I hope we can sit down and work out whatever moneys are necessary as \nit relates to an emergency supplemental, particularly for our farmers \nand particularly in defense.\n  I did not want the Senator from New Hampshire to get up and say all \nthese things as fact without having a little bit of the other side from \nwhom some people refer to as a moderate Senator from Kentucky. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton).

If there are not Members who come to the \nfloor to propose their amendments, then I will move to go to third \nreading of the bill, because there is no point in us going all the way \ntomorrow and into Friday and not having completed this legislation. I \nrepeat, it must pass.\n  I have heard personally from a number of Members who have strongly \nheld views on this legislation, particularly the Senators from Maryland \nand Virginia. I will point out, Mr. President, that one of the Senators \nfrom Virginia, Senator Warner, has had a tragedy in his family, which \nis why he is not here to debate the bill at this time.\n  I, again, urge my colleagues to come to the floor in the next couple \nof hours to either propose amendments or debate the bill.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I would like to preface my comments by commending the \nfloor leaders, my good friends, Senator McCain and Senator Ford, for \nthe leadership they have provided in getting this piece of legislation \nthrough the committee and on to the floor. I am not unmindful of the \nfact there are some points of contention, but both of them have \nprovided the kind of leadership and experience and real statesmanship \nwe have come to expect from both of these two leaders. And I, for one, \nwant to praise them for their leadership.\n  I want to talk about one of those points that has become historically \nsomewhat vexing when we deal with an FAA piece of legislation, and that \nis the so-called perimeter rule. The perimeter rule is extremely \nimportant to my State, Nevada, and particularly the expanding markets \nin southern Nevada. Within the next year, 20,000 new hotel rooms will \ncome on line. It will be critically important to have additional air \ncapacity going into southern Nevada in order that those new hotel rooms \ncan be filled. The Metropolitan Las Vegas area will have in excess of \n120,000 hotel rooms within the next 18 months.\n  I know of no place in the world that has that concentration of hotel \nrooms. It is no secret that the mainspring of the economy in southern \nNevada, as well as the entire State, has been for decades tourism. And \nbecause of the relative remoteness and isolation of southern Nevada, \nair transport is a critical factor for our continued economic viability \nand the expansion that we have enjoyed over the years.\n  I was able, with the support of the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee, the senior Senator from Arizona, to convene a hearing in Las \nVegas earlier this spring, because one of the challenges that we face \nin providing\n\n[[Page S10818]]\n\nadditional air service to southern Nevada are some economic changes \nthat are occurring in the airline industry itself.\n  During the time in which the economy was relatively soft and business \ntravel was not particularly robust, it was much easier for us in \nsouthern Nevada to get the kind of air service and the number of \nflights that we needed. As a result of the expanding economy and \nbusiness travel expanding quite rapidly, the airlines have reached an \neconomic judgment which, although hard to quarrel with, nevertheless \nhas had some profound implications for us in Las Vegas. And that is to \nsay that business travel, as opposed to recreation travel, generates \nmore revenue per seat mile than does resort, tourist destination \ntravel.\n  So the airlines, to some extent, have shifted some of their capacity \nto the more profitable business routes. That change poses some real \nchallenges to us in trying to fill those hotel rooms, I mentioned \nearlier in my comments, that are coming on line. That would be the \nlargest influx of new hotel rooms in the history of Las Vegas for any \ngiven period of time. So as part of this hearing that we held in Las \nVegas, we looked at a number of factors that might help to alleviate \nthat problem.\n  One area in which we desperately need expanded air service is from \nlonger distance destinations, from the east coast. And one of the \nthings that was pointed out as part of the barrier to that new service \nis that there are some artificial barriers that are created either by \nact of Congress or by policy, and to the extent that we can remove \nthose barriers, it will be easier for us to get expanded air service.\n  One of those barriers that was created by an act of Congress is the \nperimeter rule, established in 1986 as part of Federal \nlegislation. That was part of the Metropolitan Washington Airport Act.\n\n  Some history of the perimeter rule. In its initial origin, there may \nhave been some justification for it. At the time, there was \nconsiderable concern that Dulles would not attract the kind of airline \nservice needed to fully utilize that facility if, indeed, longer \ndistance flights could originate out of Washington National or could \ncome to Washington National.\n  So this perimeter rule--which has kind of taken on a life of its own \nand has been exalted almost to divine status, something that is so \nsacrosanct that we should never touch it under any circumstances--is in \npoint of fact an act of Congress' creation, and it is not inappropriate \nfor the Congress to revisit that rule.\n  The General Accounting Office, in examining airline competition, \nbolsters the argument that was made at our hearing in Las Vegas when it \ndescribes the perimeter rule as ``a barrier to entry service.'' It \npoints out that the rules limit the ability of airlines based in the \nWest to compete because those airlines are not allowed to serve--\nLaGuardia is another airport which has a perimeter rule, as well as \nNational Airport--from the markets where they are strongest. By \ncontrast, because of their proximity to LaGuardia and National, each of \nthe seven largest established carriers is able to serve those airports \nfrom its principal hub. So there is an invidious discrimination in the \nvery existence of these perimeter rules.\n  This report, as well as others, has suggested to the Congress that we \ngrant authority to allow exemptions to the perimeter rule. I believe \nthat is a sound recommendation and one that has been carefully crafted \nby my colleagues and friends who provide the leadership for us in the \nCommerce Committee, because a compromise has indeed been offered.\n  Let me add an additional basis, it seems to me, for that compromise \nto occur. Not only does this invidious discrimination make it very \ndifficult for new entrants to come into the market, but the original \njustification for the rule in 1986--if it ever had any validity, if one \nassumes arguendo that it may have been well founded at the time of its \nenactment--no longer exists.\n  You will recall that the original or ostensible justification was to \nmake sure that Dulles as an airport had plenty of activity and airline \nservice, and therefore this artificial creation of the perimeter rule \nwas designed to make sure that the longer distance flights emanated \nfrom Dulles. Having been to Dulles many times in the last month, none \nwould argue that this airport is underutilized. It is a robust, healthy \nair terminal, and all of us are pleased for that.\n  On two bases, it seems to me, the argument can be made: No. 1, that \nthe original rationale and predicate of the perimeter rule no longer \nhas any operative merit; and No. 2, the competitive aspect in the \ndiscrimination which I have alluded to in citing from the airline \ncompetition, ``The Barriers to Entering Into Domestic Markets,'' \npublished by the General Accounting Office.\n  I think for that reason the provisions that have been crafted into \nthis piece of legislation dealing with additional slots at National, \nparticularly those 12 which will be allowed to fly outside the \nperimeter, represent sound policy and a reasonable compromise.\n  Again, I commend the chairman of the committee, Senator McCain, and \nthe ranking member of the subcommittee, Senator Ford, for their \nleadership. I hope we can get this enacted. I salute them for their \nleadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada not only \non this issue but for his continued activity as a valued member of the \nCommerce Committee on all aviation issues. He is knowledgeable. He is \ngiven to bipartisan cooperation. I appreciate very much the opportunity \nto work with him not only on aviation issues but a variety of other \nissues, including the sport of boxing.\n  As I mentioned earlier in my remarks, there is a list that I had \nincluded in the Record about a week ago of all the different formula \nfunds, entitlement State allocations, totaling $2.1 billion, that would \nbe delayed at this time. In the case of the State of Washington, the \namount would be $7,410,694, to randomly pick a State; for the State of \nKentucky, it is $4,932,788.\n  Mr. FORD. What airports do they go do?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I do not know exactly which airports they go to, although \nthere are some letters of intent that I had printed in the Record. One \nis the Greater Cincinnati airport, $6 million; and Louisville, $18.243 \nmillion. These are letters of intent following fiscal year 1999 grant \nallocations that are already in preparation.\n  Texas: I see the New Austin at Bergstrom, $11.43 million; Dallas/Ft. \nWorth International, $12.5 million. Washington: Seattle-Tacoma, known \nas SeaTac Airport, $4,400,000.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent this list be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Letters of Intent\n\n       Current letters of intent assume the following fiscal year \n     1999 grant allocations:\n\nArkansas: Fayetteville (northwest Arkansas)..................$5,000,000\nColorado: Denver International...............................24,931,000\nGeorgia: Hartsfield Atlanta International.....................7,083,000\nIllinois:\n  Mid-America, Belleville reliever...........................14,000,000\n  Chicago Midway..............................................3,000,000\nKentucky:\n  Greater Cincinnati..........................................6,000,000\n  Louisville.................................................18,243,000\nMichigan: Detroit Metropolitan...............................16,400,000\nMississippi: Golden Triangle....................................300,000\nNevada: Reno/Tahoe International..............................6,500,000\nNew York: Buffalo International...............................1,700,000\nRhode Island: Theodore F.

Mr. President, I note that both Senator McCain and \nSenator Smith came to the floor to present their thoughts on Kosovo. I \nwould really like to join them and second their remarks.\n  Mr. President, it is estimated that at least 250,000 Kosovar \nAlbanians have been displaced by the violence and bloodshed of the past \nseveral months, and that many are currently living in the forests, \nwithout access to adequate food, shelter or medical care. With winter \nsoon approaching, we are on the verge of a major humanitarian \ncatastrophe in Kosovo, which is the direct result of a cruel and \nintentional policy directed by President Milosevic and carried out by \nSerbian security forces in Kosovo.\n  The time has come--indeed, it is my belief that the time came long \nago--for the United States, our NATO allies, and the entire \ninternational community, to back with resolve that what happened in \nBosnia must not be allowed to happen again in Kosovo. For too long, we \nhave stood by passively while Milosevic has acted in bad faith. He has \nmade numerous commitments to halt the violence, such as that contained \nin his joint statement with President Yeltsin on June 16, and he has \nhonored none of them.\n  In July, the Senate unanimously passed a bipartisan resolution which \ncalled on the United Nations War Crimes Tribunal to indict President \nMilosevic for his crimes in Bosnia. That resolution has not yet been \ncarried out. In my mind, the time has come for the United States to \ncall an end to the charade of taking at face value the word of a man \nthe U.S. Senate believes should be indicted as a war criminal.\n  If thousands, or tens of thousands, of people in Kosovo now die \nbecause they have been systematically forced from their homes, forced \ninto the forests, denied access to food, warmth, shelter and medical \ncare, it is a crime worthy of the world's condemnation.\n  With winter imminent in the Balkans, the U.N. Security Council is \nprepared to vote on a resolution threatening force under article 7 of \nthe U.N. Charter unless Milosevic calls a cease-fire and negotiates \nwith Kosovo's Albanian separatists.\n  At the end of this week, Secretary Cohen will be meeting with other \nNATO defense ministers. According to press reports, the Clinton \nadministration has already asked the North Atlantic Council to seek \ncommitments of arms, material and troops from NATO members to complete \nplans for a multinational force.\n  I hope and trust that this means that a plan of action to halt the \nviolence and bloodshed in Kosovo--a plan with clear benchmarks for \nsuccess and a clear exit strategy--will be at the top of the NATO \ndefense minister's agenda.\n  I trust that Secretary Cohen will take a strong leadership position \nat this meeting, and that Secretary Albright is taking an equal stand \non this issue in discussions with her counterparts. Although I wish it \nwere not the case, we have seen all too often that when Washington \nhesitates, our Europe allies become paralyzed.\n\n  And, lastly, I hope and trust that this time NATO, acting in \ncoordination with the United Nations, will develop a plan consistent \nwith this pressing humanitarian need, which will be quickly \nimplemented, and not just talked about.\n  Mr. President, it took us 4 years to develop the courage to join and \nurge NATO to intervene in Bosnia at the cost of 200,000 dead and 2 \nmillion displaced. Hundreds, if not thousands have already been killed \nin Kosovo, and hundreds of thousands have been forced from their homes. \nWhat more needs to happen before the international community acts?\n  There is no doubt that the search for peace in Kosovo has thus far \nproved elusive, and that finding a solution which provides Kosovar \nAlbanians with full political rights and civil liberties will be \ndifficult.\n  But the time has come for the international community to take action: \nWe must keep our promise not to allow Kosovo to become another Bosnia, \nand, unless Milosevic halts the violence immediately and unambiguously, \nto commit ourselves to the course of a much-needed humanitarian \nintervention in Kosovo.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I yield the floor, and I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/23/senate-section/article/S10819-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10819-S10823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I was over in my office earlier in the \nafternoon. I heard the quorum calls. Now again we are wasting time in \nthe middle of the afternoon. We are talking about a Wednesday afternoon \nat about quarter of 5. The Senate is in a quorum call when we could be \ndebating the issue of the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n\n[[Page S10820]]\n\n  I have taken the opportunity at other times to remind the Senate \nabout the importance of that debate. Last week, we had the Republican \nleadership effectively close down the Senate for 5 hours, by \nessentially prohibiting Members of the U.S. Senate to speak at that \ntime on the issue of the Patients' Bill of Rights. And, as has been \npointed out by our Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, the Republican \nleadership shows an unwillingness to debate this issue during the \nevening times, which would allow us to do the country's business and do \nthe people's business.\n  I rise again today to talk a bit about this issue, and the importance \nof it, because it is of such compelling importance to millions of \nAmericans--more than 160 million Americans.\n  Every time I go back to Massachusetts--and I think it is generally \ntrue with others as they travel across the country to their States--I \nrun into the people who have faced the kinds of situations that I will \nmention in just a moment or two. These are situations that cry out for \naction. Still we don't take the action.\n  We have considered other pieces of legislation that have some \nimportance. But I daresay that none of the recent pieces of legislation \nthat we have considered, I believe, rise to the importance of the \ndebate and discussion on the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  Mr. President, I want to include in the Record today the testimony \nand the comments of some leading American citizens who are very \nconcerned about ensuring adequate protections for consumers of mental \nhealth services--protections that are included in the Patients' Bill of \nRights, which has been introduced by Senator Daschle, and are not \nincluded in the Republican proposal.\n  In the forum that was held this afternoon, 36 groups--representing \npatients, families, psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and \nothers who are concerned about quality of health care for people with \nmental illness--begged the Senate to act to pass the Patients' Bill of \nRights. With every day that passes, these patients and their families \nare suffering because of abuses by the managed care systems. In too \nmany instances, the stories they told were tragic. They involved \nsuicide, spousal abuse, anxiety attacks inflicted on a Vietnam veteran, \nand successful courses of treatment cruelly interrupted because \ninsurance companies are putting their bottom line first and their \nobligations to patients last.\n  One of our speakers, the president of the National Alliance for the \nMentally Ill, NAMI, focused on an important provision of our \nlegislation that has not received as much attention as some of the \nother issues--access to needed prescription drugs that are not on a \nhealth plan's approved list. For mental patients, the last few decades \nhave seen a significant growth in the number of new medicines that can \ntreat their diseases. For many patients, these new drugs represent \ngenuine medical miracles and opportunities to resume lives that have \nbeen devastated by these cruel diseases. But too often managed care \nplans have said ``no'' to these patients and their doctors. They say: \n``The new drugs are too expensive. You will have to make do with older, \ncheaper drugs that are on our approved list. If they don't work for \nyou, that is just too bad.'' That should be unacceptable to every \nAmerican.\n  Our legislation will guarantee that no family with a mentally ill \nmember will ever be subjected to this kind of abuse again.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe statement of the Mental Health Liaison Group.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  Mental Health Liaison Group,\n\n                               Alexandria, VA, September 23, 1998.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Senate Majority Leader,\n     Capitol Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: The undersigned members of the Mental \n     Health Liaison Group (MHLG) are writing to urge the Senate to \n     pass meaningful legislation protecting consumers now enrolled \n     in managed care before the end of the 105th Congress. If \n     Senate passage is accomplished in an expeditious manner, \n     ample time remains to initiate a conference committee with \n     the House and achieve final passage of this important \n     legislation.\n       Our community has a large stake in timely consideration of \n     consumer protection legislation. Today, over 160 million \n     Americans receive their mental health care from a mere \n     handful of managed care plans. Virtually every organization \n     signing onto this correspondence has received reports of:\n       Consumers being denied access to emergency services despite \n     being in psychiatric crisis.\n       Health care plans applying rigid utilization review \n     criteria that radically reduce the availability of \n     outpatients mental health services.\n       Treatment plans, diagnoses and related clinical decisions \n     being reviewed by health plan personnel with no prior medical \n     or mental health training whatsoever.\n       HMO drug formularies insisting upon the lowest-cost \n     psychotropic medications, which may be clinically \n     inappropriate for individuals with more serious mental \n     disorders.\n       Procedural disputes should not inhibit free and fair debate \n     of consumer protection legislation on the floor. Key issues \n     like access to specialists, medical necessity, point of \n     service, legal accountability and related matters should now \n     be considered by the full Senate. The starting point for \n     debate could involve any of the wide array of comprehensive \n     bills now pending, including the measures endorsed by the \n     House and Senate Republican leadership.\n       In our view, at this time, the only bill that represents \n     meaningful reform is S. 1890, the Patients' Bill of Rights \n     Introduced by Senator Daschle.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry; \n           American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy; \n           American Association for Psychosocial Rehabilitation; \n           American Association of Children's Residential Centers; \n           American Association of Pastoral Counselors; American \n           Association of Private Practice Psychiatrists; American \n           Board of Examiners in Clinical Social Work; American \n           Counseling Association; American Federation of State, \n           County and Municipal Employees; American Family \n           Foundation.\n         American Group of Psychotherapy Association; American \n           Nurses Association; American Occupational Therapy \n           Association; American Orthopsychiatric Association; \n           American Psychiatric Association; American Psychiatric \n           Nurses Association; American Psychoanalytic \n           Association; American Psychological Association; \n           Anxiety Disorders Association of America; Association \n           for the Advancement of Psychology.\n         Association for Ambulatory Behavioral Healthcare; \n           Association of Behavioral Healthcare Management; \n           Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law; Child Welfare \n           League of America; Children and Adults with Attention \n           Deficit Disorder; Clinical Social Work Federation; \n           Corporation for the Advancement of Psychiatry; \n           International Association of Psychosocial \n           Rehabilitation Services; National Alliance for the \n           Mentally Ill; National Association for Rural Mental \n           Health.\n         National Association of Protection and Advocacy Systems; \n           National Association of Psychiatric Treatment Centers \n           for Children; National Association of School \n           Psychologists; National Association of Social Workers; \n           National Council for Community Behavioral Healthcare; \n           National Mental Health Association.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we heard today from Jackie Shannon. She \nis the president of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, NAMI, \nand the mother of a son with schizophrenia. I would like to read from \nher very, very moving testimony. This passage refers to a woman named \nPam Childs from Miami, Florida and her problems with manic-depressive \nillness:\n\n       Pam was a Ph.D. psychologist who specialized in treating \n     children and adolescents . . . Repeatedly, Pam's HMO told her \n     that the treatment being recommended by her doctors were \n     ``not part of the plan.'' On several occasions, doctors who \n     made progress in treating Pam were later told that they were \n     ``being taken off the plan.'' Pam Childs never got the \n     treatment she needed, and this story did not have a happy \n     ending. On July 2 of this year, at 34 years of age, Pam took \n     her own life by leaping from the window of her father's 15-\n     story apartment.\n\n  Mr. President, Jackie Shannon also told us about the problems the \nmental health community faces in terms of access to various \nprescription drugs. The prescription drug formularies used by insurance \ncompanies limit access to the newest and most effective medications. I \nwould like to read from her testimony:\n\n       Over the past decade, the most far-reaching advances in the \n     treatment of brain disorders such as schizophrenia and manic-\n     depressive illness have all been in the area of prescription \n     drugs. These new medications are highly effective in treating \n     severe symptoms, without many of the disturbing side effects \n     associated with older medications. While some of these \n     medications may cost more at the front end, they deliver \n     significant long-term savings through fewer and\n\n[[Page S10821]]\n\n     shorter hospitalizations, and, more importantly, a higher \n     quality of life for consumers.\n       Unfortunately, managed care plans too often use \n     formularies--restrictive lists and bureaucratic rules--to \n     limit access to the newer, more effective medications. What \n     kind of rules? A 1997 survey of managed behavioral health \n     plans by NAMI revealed widespread use of policies such as \n     prior authorization, and what they call ``twice-fail'' \n     requirements as parts of the formulary.\n       These ``twice fail'' rules are especially offensive to the \n     NAMI members. Our survey found that some managed care plans \n     actually require patients to fail on older, cheaper \n     medications multiple times before being able to access the \n     newer medication. NAMI believes that psychiatrists and their \n     patients should be able to select the medication that is \n     right for them based on clinical effectiveness, not on a \n     managed care plan's financial bottom line. The best treatment \n     available should be the treatment of first choice.\n\n  Do we understand that, Mr. President? The best treatment available \nought to be the treatment of first choice. The Democratic version of \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights guarantees that. It would allow the \ndoctors to overrule a plan's restrictive drug formulary when it is in \nthe patient's interests. The Republican bill would not.\n  Now, Mr. President, this is an issue of particular importance to \npersons with mental illness who need these newer drugs. We hear case \nafter case of patients who would be helped if they had access to the \nnewest and most effective medications. We heard of one young person \nwhose plan required him to use the cheaper drugs and demonstrate their \nfailure not just once, but twice, before they would even be eligible \nfor the right drugs. This is one of the reasons that we provide this \nkind of protection in our Patients' Bill of Rights. We believe it is \nimportant to ensure that the doctor can to say, This is the kind of \nprescription drug that is necessary to deal with your particular health \nneed and that the plan will cover it, if the plan offers drug coverage.\n  That is a very important protection. We would like to debate that \nissue. If the Republican leadership does not believe that we ought to \nprovide that kind of protection, they should come to the floor of the \nSenate and let's call the roll. This is not a complicated issue. It is \nnot a very complicated issue. But it is one of the very important \nprotections that exist in our bill and which does not exist in the \nRepublican bill.\n  The American people have been effectively denied--with the various \nproposals that have been offered by the majority leader in terms of the \ndebate of the Patients' Bill of Rights--from seeing where the Senate \nstands on these important issues. The leadership has said, in reference \nto their proposal, You can either take it or leave it. They are \nattempting to gag not only the doctors in this country from giving the \nbest advice on health care needs, but they are also attempting to gag \nthe Senate from having any kind of debate or discussion on these \nissues, let alone a vote on them. That is very, very important, Mr. \nPresident. The National Association of Mentally Ill feel that access to \nprescription drugs is of enormous importance to their membership. Their \nview is shared by all of the leading mental health organizations. That \nis why the 36 different groups have indicated strong support for the \nDemocratic Patients Bill of Rights.\n  Mr. President, I refer right here to this chart that compares our \nPatients' Bill of Rights, which puts patients before profits, and the \nRepublican legislation. Right here, No. 11--access to doctor prescribed \ndrugs--the question is whether you will be able to get the kind of \nprescription drug--new or old, perhaps somewhat more expensive--that \nyour doctor recommends, or be forced to take only those medications \nthat are listed on the HMO plan and just do not work for you.\n  Mr. President, this forum that we had was just the most recent one in \nwhich we heard patients and doctors and nurses pleading with the \nRepublican leadership to act on real managed care reform before the end \nof the year.\n  At today s forum, I spoke about a particularly tragic set of \ncircumstances surrounding the case of a man who died because his plan \ndenied necessary treatment. In this case, however, like too many \nothers, the plan was not held accountable for its abusive actions. Let \nme just tell you, Mr. President, about this very tragic case.\n  Richard Clarke of Haverhill, MA, was struggling to deal with a \nserious problem of substance abuse. His health plan clearly covered 30 \ndays of inpatient rehabilitation. But when Mr. Clarke's doctor admitted \nhim to a detoxification program, the plan provided only 5 days of \ntreatment. His treatment was cut short, and his pattern of abuse and \ninadequate treatment continued. Shortly after the first \nhospitalization, his doctor again tried to admit him. But his HMO \napproved just 8 days of inpatient rehabilitation. And 24 hours after \nthis discharge, Mr. Clarke attempted suicide. Again, he was referred \nfor additional inpatient treatment, but this time the HMO refused to \npay for any additional services--even though his policy clearly should \nhave covered 17 additional days.\n  At this point, a judge committed Mr. Clarke to a State correctional \ncenter. Mr. Clarke was abused in that center and received only minimal \ntreatment. Tragically, just a few weeks after being discharged from the \ncorrectional center, Mr. Clarke committed suicide at age 41. He left a \nwidow and four children and 17 days of inpatient rehabilitation \ncoverage on his insurance policy--17 days that were not used, 17 days \nthat were repeatedly denied by the HMO. And he took his life.\n  His widow took the insurance plan to Federal court. But Judge William \nYoung had no choice but to reluctantly dismiss the case because the \nFederal law protected the HMO from accountability for its actions.\n  Judge Young was frank in his opinion:\n\n       Federal law has evolved in a shield of immunity that \n     protects health insurers. . . and other managed care entities \n     from potential liability for the consequences of their \n     wrongful denial of health benefits. The Federal law thwarts \n     the legitimate claims of the very people it was designed to \n     protect.\n\n  There it is, Mr. President, an example of an individual who needed \nhelp, consolation, rehabilitation, and attention, but was denied it by \nthe HMO. A tragic, tragic ending, with the HMO responsible--I believe, \njust from a reading of these facts--or certainly contributing to the \nanxiety and ultimately to the untimely death, and the loss of this \nfather of four children. And, under current law, the HMO is able to \nstand back and say, no, we can't be sued. And they cannot be, Mr. \nPresident.\n  That particular issue is addressed in our legislation. Right here on \nthe chart where we say ``ability to hold plans accountable.'' But it is \nnot in the Republican legislation. We looked through their bill. It is \nnot there, but it is in ours. Another issue to debate. Another issue to \ndiscuss. Another issue to vote on. It is not very complicated. Are you \ngoing to hold a plan accountable when its decisions result in the death \nor serious injury of an individual who may be the breadwinner for a \nfamily? Are you going to deny a family the opportunity to hold \ninsurance companies responsible if a loved one has been the recipient \nof negligent treatment?\n  We ought to be able to vote on that. It is not very complicated. But \nno, no, we cannot even bring that up. We cannot even debate it. It is a \ncrucial matter, certainly, to the Clarke's or any other family in this \nsituation. It is a crucial matter to millions of other families.\n  Mr. President, there are millions of Americans who have that kind of \nprotection today, but it is not guaranteed to over 120 million \nAmericans who receive their insurance through employers in the private \nsector. It is not guaranteed. It is effectively excluded. Mr. \nPresident, more than 40 million Americans can hold their HMOs \naccountable, but more than 120 million others cannot. The others \ncannot. Why not, we might ask? Because the power of the special \ninterests will not permit us to get to this legislation, to consider \nit, debate it, and call the roll on it.\n  Mr. President, this forum was just the most recent one in which we \nhave heard the patients and doctors and nurses pleading with the \nRepublican leadership to act on real managed care reform. Several weeks \nago, we heard from Dr. Charlotte Yeh, an emergency doctor from Boston \nwho also is a leader in the American College of Emergency Physicians. \nIn fact, we have had the leaders of many of these professional groups \nappear in these forums--representatives of from many of the more than \n180 different groups of patients and doctors, nurses, health \nprofessionals that support our legislation.\n\n[[Page S10822]]\n\n  Dr. Yeh described cases where HMOs denied treatment that patients \nneeded because of managed care penny-pinching. She indicated she was \nappearing at the forum ``representing the concerns of 20,000 emergency \nphysicians, on behalf of 90 million patients we see every year.'' She \nwent on to say, ``For emergency physicians protecting patients is not \njust a job, it is our lives.'' They are strongly in support of our \nlegislation. They strongly believe that we ought to have an opportunity \nto debate this legislation. They are strongly opposed to Republican \nleadership, and are concerned about the leadership s refusal to let us \nhave an opportunity to debate the legislation. This is what Dr. Yeh \ncommented on:\n       For the last several years, the tactics of the managed care \n     industry with respect to coverage of emergency care has \n     become a national issue.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       We've all heard the stories.\n       In Detroit, a 46-year old woman collapsed in her husband's \n     arms and was rushed to the hospital by ambulance. She died of \n     cardiac arrest after a failed resuscitation attempt. \n     Unbelievably, her managed care plan later denied payment for \n     her treatment because she did not call for prior approval.\n       In Boston, a boy's leg was seriously injured in an auto \n     accident. At a nearby hospital, emergency doctors told the \n     parents he would need vascular surgery to save his leg and a \n     surgeon was ready and available in the hospital.\n       Unfortunately, for this young man, his insurer insisted he \n     be transferred to an ``in-network'' hospital for the surgery. \n     His parents were told if they allowed the operation to be \n     done anywhere else, they would be responsible for the bill. \n     They agreed to the move. Surgery was performed three hours \n     after the accident. But by then, it was too late to save his \n     leg.\n       These are not episodes from the TV program, ``ER''. These \n     are not anecdotes. They are real people with real lives.\n       A bipartisan majority in the Congress has called for \n     enactment of standards that will put an end to episodes like \n     the ones I just described. Last year, the Congress adopted \n     the prudent layperson standard and other protections for \n     Medicare and Medicaid patients seeking emergency \n     care. Millions of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries have \n     these protections, but not the 160 million people outside \n     of those programs. They do not have these protections.\n\n  She continues:\n\n       We thought there was consensus on this issue. . . . But we \n     are very disturbed about the way in which the emergency \n     service protections were drafted in the Republican ``Patient \n     Protection Act.'' As a physician, it seems that a little \n     unnecessary surgery was performed on the ``prudent \n     layperson'' standard to the point where barely recognizable \n     as the consumer protection we envisioned.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator from Massachusetts yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Just for a question. The Senator from Massachusetts, I \nknow, wants to indulge his colleagues. We have Senator Inhofe on the \nfloor on an amendment on pending legislation, and Senator Roth to \nfollow him. So if he could perhaps very quickly allow the amendment \nprocess to proceed, I would appreciate it very much. I thank the \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Seeing Senators are here and ready to move ahead, I will \njust make some few concluding remarks on this issue and then get back \nto it at another time. I think we could have been debating this, rather \nthan just filling in the time with the quorum calls, which we have been \ndoing frequently. So I indicate to colleagues, I will make some \nconcluding remarks for just a few more minutes and then yield the \nfloor. Again, from Dr. Yeh's testimony:\n\n       What's the difference between the real ``prudent \n     layperson'' standard included in the Balanced Budget Act and \n     the Democratic Patients Bill of Rights and the imposter that \n     has been included in the GOP Patient Protection Act?\n       The GOP Patient Protection Act would establish a weaker \n     coverage standard for privately insured patients than what \n     exists for Medicare and Medicaid patients.\n\n  This is not Senator Daschle or myself making this statement, this is \na leading member of the American College of Emergency Physicians--\ndoctors who deal with this problem every single day--talking about how \nthe GOP Patient Protection Act is a fraud.\n  She continues along. I ask unanimous consent to have her full \nstatement printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Testimony of Charlotte Yeh, MD, FACEP, Chair, Federal Government \n      Affairs Committee, American College of Emergency Physicians\n\n       Thank you very much. I am Dr. Charlotte Yeh, a practicing \n     emergency physician at the New England Medical Center in \n     Boston, MA. I am here today representing the concerns of \n     nearly 20,000 emergency physicians and on behalf of the 90 \n     million patients we see every year. For emergency physicians, \n     protecting patients is not just a job, it's our life.\n       For the last several years, the tactics of the managed care \n     industry with respect to coverage of emergency care has \n     become a national issue. I'm pleased to be here today as we \n     try to enact meaningful patient protections that will ensure \n     that patients get not only the care they deserve, but that \n     they also get the coverage that their managed care plan \n     promised them.\n       We've all heard the stories.\n       In Detroit, a 46-year old woman collapsed in her husband's \n     arms and was rushed to the hospital by ambulance. She died of \n     cardiac arrest after a failed resuscitation attempt. \n     Unbelievably, her managed care plan later denied payment for \n     her treatment because she did not call for prior approval.\n       In Boston, a boy's leg was seriously injured in an auto \n     accident.

They are real people with real lives.\n       A bipartisan majority in the Congress has called for \n     enactment of standards that will put an end to episodes like \n     the one I just described. Last year, the Congress adopted the \n     prudent layperson standard and other protections for Medicare \n     and Medicaid patients seeking emergency care. We thought \n     there was a consensus on this issue!\n       Just a few weeks ago, we were delighted to see that \n     Republican Task Forces in both the House and Senate had \n     decided to include the ``prudent layperson'' standard in \n     their respective patient protection measures.\n       But we are very disturbed about the way in which the \n     emergency services protections were drafted in the Republican \n     ``Patient Protection Act.'' As a physician, it seems that a \n     little Unnecessary surgery was performed on the ``prudent \n     layperson'' standard to the point where it is barely \n     recognizable as the consumer protection we envisioned.\n       What's the difference between the real ``prudent \n     layperson'' standard included in the ``Balanced Budget Act'' \n     and the Democratic ``Patient's Bill of Rights'' and the \n     ``imposter'' that has been included in the GOP ``Patient \n     Protection Act?''\n       The GOP Patient Protection Act would establish a weaker \n     coverage standard for privately insured patients than what \n     exists for Medicare and Medicaid patients.\n       The Democratic bill would provide the same protections for \n     all patients.\n       The GOP Patient Protection Act establishes a two-tiered \n     test for coverage of emergency services and guarantees \n     coverage only for a ``screening examination.''\n       The Democratic bill would require that health plans cover \n     all services necessary to evaluate and stabilize the patient \n     to anyone who meets the prudent layperson standard--no \n     questions asked!\n       The GOP Patient Protection Act sets no limits on the amount \n     of cost-sharing the managed care plans would be allowed to \n     charge patients who seek emergency services from a non-\n     network provider.\n       The Democratic bill would protect patients who reasonably \n     seek emergency services to protect their health from being \n     charged unreasonable co-pays and deductibles.\n       The GOP Patient Protection Act provides sets no guidelines \n     for the coordination of post stabilization care, making it \n     impossible for emergency physicians to coordinate and obtain \n     authorization for necessary follow-up care with the managed \n     care plans.\n       The Democratic bill would require health plans to adhere to \n     new federal guidelines that require managed care plans to be \n     available to coordinate post stabilization care, instead of \n     just permitting the managed plan to turn off the phone at \n     5:00 o'clock.\n       Obviously, we are very troubled by the changes to the \n     ``prudent layperson'' standard in the ``Patient Protection \n     Act.''\n       Our assessment is that this legislation--Will provide less \n     protection for privately insured patients than for Medicare \n     and Medicaid patients; Will lead to more coverage disputes, \n     not less; Will create even more barriers, not fewer; and Will \n     create new loopholes for managed care plans to deny coverage \n     of emergency services.\n       In four years, we have come so far, but we cannot support \n     these provisions in their current form. We will do everything \n     in our power to ensure that the ``prudent layperson'' \n     standard that is enacted will be consistent with the \n     meaningful protections that Congress enacted for Medicare and \n     Medicaid beneficiaries. Hard-working Americans who pay their \n     premiums deserve no less.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We heard from cancer patients, and their doctors, who \nexplained that the Patients' Bill of Rights is critical to ensuring \npatients\n\n[[Page S10823]]\n\naccess to quality clinical trials. These trials are often the only hope \nfor patients with incurable cancer or other diseases where conventional \ntreatments are ineffective. They are the best hope for learning to cure \nthese dread diseases.\n  Insurance used to routinely pay the doctor and hospital costs \nassociated with clinical trials, but managed care plans are refusing to \nallow patients to participate. Our bill forces the insurance companies \nto respond to these needs, but the Republican bill does not. And they \nrefuse to debate this issue. Here it is on the chart, ``Access to \nClinical Trials.'' We provide this protection, and they do not.\n  Yet, this is very important for women who are battling breast cancer. \nIt is important for children--like my own son, Teddy, who was able to \nget into a clinical trial when he had osteosarcoma at age 12, and \nsurvive that dread disease. He is alive today because he was in a \nclinical trial.\n  Mr. President, as I have pointed out before, these are the guarantees \nthat are in our legislation. Under our proposal, the doctor, the \nmedical professional, will make the decisions on medical treatment for \nthe patient--be that you or your spouse or your child or your \ngrandchild. Medical decisions will not be made by an insurance company \naccountant. That is what is at the heart of the differences between the \ntwo pieces of legislation.\n  We welcome an opportunity to just say we will take 10 of the issues \non this list, and vote on those measures and vote on the legislation, \nwhile permitting our Republican friends to have a similar number of \namendments. But let us at least get about it in these final days. It is \nnot too late. It must not be too late, or we would not see the kinds of \nactivity to deny or delay action on this legislation by our Republican \nfriends each day.\n  Just in conclusion, earlier in the day--although this was not \nadvanced, it was circulated by the majority--there was a unanimous \nconsent that was going to be proposed on the Internet tax legislation. \nI will include the whole provision in the Record.\n  This was circulated to see whether there would be any objection on \nthe Democratic side. It basically allowed all types of amendments--\nunlimited first and second degree amendments or amendments that are not \nrelevant to the Internet tax issues in the underlying bill--but, and \nthis is important, no health care amendments. Here is the text that \nwould have been spoken by the Majority leader, ``I further ask that \nduring the Senate's consideration of S. 442 or the House companion, no \namendments relative to health care be in order.'' There you have it: \nOne piece of legislation, with possibilities for all other legislation, \nexcept one--health care, the Patients' Bill of Rights, guaranteed \nprotections for more than 160 million people. Under this proposal from \nthe Republican leadership, we are permitting other kinds of amendments, \nbut we are going to say no amendments relative to health care be in \norder.\n  Thankfully, our Democratic leader rejected this, so it was not \noffered. But these are the tactics we are facing. We are as committed \nas ever to ensuring that we will have an opportunity to debate this \nissue--even if not on this particular measure. So we are going to \ncontinue to pursue it.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/23/senate-section/article/S10819-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10823-S10825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n WENDELL H.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of \nSenator Moynihan and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Roth], for himself and Mr. \n     Moynihan, proposes an amendment numbered 3621.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill add the following:\n\n   TITLE IV--EXTENSION OF AIRPORT AND AIRWAY TRUST FUND EXPENDITURE \n                               AUTHORITY\n\n     SEC. 801. EXTENSION OF EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Paragraph (1) of section 9502(d) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to expenditures from \n     Airport and Airway Trust Fund) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``October 1, 1998'' and inserting ``October \n     1, 2000''; and\n       (2) by inserting before the semicolon at the end of \n     subparagraph (A) the following ``or the Wendell H.

Mr. President, this amendment contains the necessary \nconforming changes to the Tax Code required by this reauthorization \nbill. This amendment does not affect Federal revenues. Therefore, this \nbill remains a nonrevenue bill. This amendment will allow expenditures \nfrom the Airport and Airway Trust Fund to occur as authorized by the \nunderlying legislation relating to airport construction, maintenance \nand technology.\n  It will also help ensure our air traffic control system continues to \nprovide safe and efficient services.\n  It is my understanding that this amendment is acceptable to both \nsides of the political aisle. At the appropriate moment, I will urge \nits adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nFinance Committee. As always, he has been extremely cooperative and \nhelpful as we have this kind of legislation out of the Commerce \nCommittee, which sometimes has tax implications. I am very grateful for \nthe continued cooperation and effort to not encroach on the \njurisdiction of the Finance Committee and also to make sure that their \nviews and their authority are well recognized.\n  The crucial programs in this legislation are directly dependent upon \nthe ability of the FAA to spend moneys out of the aviation trust fund, \nand the trust fund itself is supported by revenues from the aviation \nexcise taxes which are paid by all air travelers.\n  I thank Senator Roth for his cooperation in our effort to keep \nnecessary funds flowing to aviation programs. His amendment will help \nkeep the FAA on sound financial footing.\n  He and his staff have been very helpful in our efforts on this bill. \nI want to clarify with the chairman that this amendment merely \nauthorizes expenditures from the trust fund for 2 years and prevents \nexpenditures from the trust fund without an authorization in place?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I say to my distinguished colleague, that is \ncorrect; that is the intent of the amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am not aware of any objection. In fact, \nI support the amendment. I will urge adoption of the amendment after \nthe Senator from Kentucky speaks.\n\n[[Page S10824]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3620.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. AMENDMENTS, MODIFICATIONS, SUSPENSIONS, AND \n                   REVOCATIONS OF CERTIFICATES.\n\n       Section 44709 of title 49, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (e)--\n       (A) by striking ``When'' and inserting ``(1) Except as \n     provided in paragraph (2), if''; and\n       (B) by striking ``However, if'' and all that follows \n     through the end of the subsection and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(2) If the Administrator determines, in the order, that \n     an emergency exists and safety in air commerce or air \n     transportation requires the order to be effective \n     immediately--\n       ``(A) subject to subparagraph (B), the order shall be in \n     effect unless the Administrator is not able to prove to the \n     Board, upon an inquiry of the Board, the existence of an \n     emergency that requires the immediate application of the \n     order in the interest of safety in air commerce and air \n     transportation; and\n       ``(B) the Board shall--\n       ``(i) not later than 5 days after the filing of an appeal \n     under paragraph (1), make a disposition concerning the issues \n     of the appeal that are related to the existence of an \n     emergency referred to in subparagraph (A); and\n       ``(ii) not later than 60 days after the filing of an appeal \n     under paragraph (1), make a final disposition of the appeal.\n       ``(3) If the Administrator determines, in the order, the \n     existence of an emergency described in paragraph (2)(A), the \n     appellant may request a hearing by the Board on the issues of \n     the appeal that are related to the existence of the \n     emergency. Such request shall be made not later than 48 hours \n     after the issuance of the order. If an appellant requests a \n     hearing under this paragraph, The Board shall hold the \n     hearing not later than 48 hours after receiving that \n     request.''; and\n       (2) in subsection (f), by inserting ``by further order'' \n     after ``the Administrator decides''.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, this amendment is one that should not be \ncontroversial. I can recall as recently as the Oshkosh meeting this \nlast August where they voted--and we are talking about 250,000 people \nwho were involved--to say this is the No. 1 issue for general aviation \nin America this entire year and perhaps for several years.\n  It has to do with a process that is very similar to something we went \nthrough a few years ago. When the FAA exercises its power to invoke an \nemergency revocation of a license, they can do so for an indefinite \nperiod of time and that person will lose that license. In many cases, \nit may be this person's only way of making a living.\n  We have worked for several years to come up with some type of a \ncompromise that will allow an individual to recover his license in the \nevent that it is shown there is nothing dangerous in the way that \nindividual had been flying. It is very unfortunate that in any \nbureaucracy, there are a few people who will occasionally do something \nthat is not justified.\n  I share with you, Mr. President, a case of an individual named Ted \nStewart who had been employed by American Airlines as a pilot for more \nthan 12 years and presently serves as a Boeing 767 captain. No \ncomplaints had ever been registered against him or his flying.\n  In January of 1995, the FAA suspended Mr. Stewart's examining \nauthority. And the reason? Possibly improper issuing of ratings. He \ncomplied with the FAA request that he provide log books and/or other \nreliable records for inspections. On May 16, 1995, an emergency \nrevocation was issued, and he lost his airman certificates.\n  June 19, 1995, the National Transportation Safety Board \nAdministrative Law Judge Mullins ruled in Mr. Stewart's favor on all \ncounts. In July of 1995, the full NTSB upheld Judge Mullins' initial \ndecision. All pilot certificates were returned. I point out, this is \nalmost 2 months after the revocation. In January of 1996, he was \nawarded approximately 60 percent of the money spent to defend himself. \nThe FAA appealed the ruling and it is still pending before the full \nNTSB.\n  What I am getting at is, we have case after case where individuals \nhave lost their ability to make their living for their families when \nthere was not any type of an emergency, there was not any type of a \nhazard in their performance in terms of their acting as a pilot.\n  What we are trying to do is similar to what we did successfully a few \nyears ago under the civil penalties provision, and that is, insert into \nthe process an unbiased source that will be able to participate in the \nprocess. In the case of civil penalties, we had the NTSB to hear the \ncases after they have been ruled on by the FAA. This has been working \nvery well since that time.\n  My amendment, as far as it addresses the emergency revocation, \naddresses the problem prudently by providing an airman--that is the \npilot--48 hours after receiving an emergency revocation order the \nopportunity to request a hearing before the NTSB on the emergency \nnature of the revocation. This is not on the offense, this is on the \nemergency nature as to whether or not this would be an emergency. The \nNTSB then has 48 hours to hear the arguments. Within 5 days of the \ninitial request, the NTSB must decide if a true emergency exists. \nDuring this time, the emergency revocation remains in effect.\n  In other words, the certificate holder loses use of his certificate \nfor a maximum of 7 days. However, should the NTSB decide an emergency \ndoes not exist, then the certificate will be returned to the \ncertificate holder, and he can continue to use it while the FAA pursues \ntheir revocation case against him.\n  Keep in mind, no emergency exists, nothing is done to impose a hazard \non himself or the public.\n  If the NTSB decides that an emergency does exist, then emergency \nrevocation remains in effect and the certificate holder cannot use his \ncertificate while the case is adjudicated. That would revert back to \nthe way the law is today. That individual would not be able to fly. So \nall we are talking about is whether or not there is an emergency nature \nin this case.\n  Please do not misunderstand, in no way do I want to suggest that the \nFAA should not have emergency revocation powers. I believe it is \ncritical to safety that the FAA can ground unsafe airmen or other \ncertificate holders. However, I also believe that the FAA must be \njudicious in its use of the extraordinary power.\n  The FAA will argue that because emergency certificate actions are \nonly a small percentage of overall certificate actions, there is no \nreason for this concern. However, review of recent emergency cases \nclearly demonstrates a pattern by which the FAA uses their emergency \npowers far more frequently than the circumstances warrant.\n  For instance, of the emergency revocation orders issued during fiscal \nyear 1990 through 1997, 50 percent occurred 4 months to 2 years after \nthe violation occurred. In only 4 percent of the cases was the \nemergency revocation issued\n\n[[Page S10825]]\n\nwithin 10 days or less of the actual violation. In fact, the median \ntime lapse between the violation and the emergency order was a little \nover 4 months. That is 132 days, Mr. President. I suggest to you, how \ncan that be considered an emergency if nothing happened until 132 days \nafter the alleged violation?\n  I think clearly at issue is what constitutes an emergency. Simply \ndefined, an emergency is ``an unexpected situation or sudden occurrence \nof a serious and urgent nature that demands immediate action.'' Yet, as \ndiscussed above, the ``urgent nature'' of the revocation which \n``demands immediate action'' has more often than not occurred several \nmonths previously.\n  There are far too many cases where the FAA unfairly uses this \nnecessary power to prematurely revoke certificates when the \ncircumstances do not support such drastic action.\n  Mr. President, I have other cases that I could drag out here and talk \nabout, such as the case of Bob Hoover. I have had the privilege of \nflying in airshows with Bob Hoover for over 30 years. Bob Hoover--\nprobably if you were to ask anyone in the aviation community who the \nbest pilot in America is, they would probably say Bob Hoover. Yet he \nwas the victim of the emergency revocation. We had to go to bat for \nhim, and we had literally thousands of letters from all over America \ncoming to the aid of Bob Hoover because everybody knew there is nothing \nwrong and nothing of an emergency nature to the revocation of his \nability to fly.\n  So, Mr. President, I feel that this being the No. 1 concern and issue \nof general aviation today--it is a sense of fairness issue, something \nthat has worked very well in the case of civil penalties--it is one \nthat I feel should be changed in the FAA regulations.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nspeak as in morning business for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I do not mean to end this, but we are \ngetting to the point where we have amendments up. And apparently no one \nwants to vote tonight, but we would like to get our amendments up. And \nSenator Akaka has remarks as it relates to the legislation itself. I do \nnot want to prevent----\n  Mr. GRAMS. This will be very brief.\n  Mr. FORD. Fine.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Senator from Hawaii. I did talk to him and ask \nif it was all right.\n  Mr. FORD. We are trying to move this legislation forward. And I did \nnot want to cut the Senator from Oklahoma off either.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Minnesota \nis recognized as in morning business.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you, and I again thank the Senator from Hawaii for \nallowing me to make a brief statement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/23/senate-section/article/S10823-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO MURIEL HUMPHREY BROWN\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Muriel \nHumphrey Brown, who was the widow of the late Senator and Vice \nPresident Hubert Humphrey and known to many throughout my state as \nMinnesota's ``First Lady.''\n  Mrs. Humphrey Brown passed away on Sunday at the age of 86. \nThroughout her life, she remained steadfast in her dedication to family \nand her interest in politics. In her last public appearance, just 5 \ndays before her death, she was on hand to congratulate her son, Skip \nHumphrey, for winning the Minnesota DFL gubernatorial primary.\n  Many of my colleagues knew her, respected her, and join me in \noffering our heartfelt condolences to her husband, Max Brown, her sons \nHubert, Doug and Bob, her daughter Nancy, and the entire Humphrey \nfamily.\n  Muriel Humphrey Brown was born on February 20, 1912, in Huron, SD. \nAfter marrying Hubert Humphrey, she became a devoted mother and \nenthusiastically took on the role of a political wife.\n  She played an active part in her husband's numerous campaigns. After \nHubert's death in 1978, Muriel was appointed to his Senate seat, the \nsame Senate seat that I am proud to hold today. By finishing out her \nlate-husband's term, Muriel Humphrey Brown became Minnesota's first and \nonly female U.S. Senator and just the 12th woman to serve in the U.S. \nSenate. In fact, she was the only woman serving in the Senate at that \ntime.\n  In carrying out her husband's Senate term, Muriel Humphrey Brown was \nan inspiration to women throughout Minnesota as she accepted the call \nto public service even in her time of great personal loss. Rather than \nbeing known simply as the wife of the most popular politician in \nMinnesota, Muriel left her own mark on those issues of public policy \nabout which she felt so strongly.\n  Her calm and gentle manner did not mute her passionate voice on \nbehalf of social programs, labor issues, and the mentally disabled. She \nonce described her term in the Senate as, ``the most challenging thing \nI have ever done in my whole life.'' In 1979, she married Max Brown and \nlived the rest of her life out of the political spotlight. Her devotion \nto family and public service is truly an inspiration to all \nMinnesotans, and I am proud to say that her legacy will remain. It is a \nspecial honor for me to hold the Senate seat she once held, in the \nChamber where she served with such grace, dignity, and honor.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/23/senate-section/article/S10825-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10825-S10829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n WENDELL H. FORD NATIONAL AIR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM IMPROVEMENT ACT OF \n                                  1998\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I support S. 2279, the Wendell H. Ford \nNational Air Transportation System Improvement Act of 1998. This \nmeasure will enhance the safety and efficiency of our air \ntransportation system, upon which the island state of Hawaii is \nuniquely dependent. I am pleased that this weighty legislation is named \nfor the departing senior senator from Kentucky, whose contributions to \naviation are legion. I am especially supportive of Title VII of the \nbill which addresses the issue of air tour operations at national \nparks.\n\n  Mr. President, Title VII of S. 2279 establishes a comprehensive \nregulatory framework for controlling air tour traffic in and near units \nof the National Park System. The legislation requires the Federal \nAviation Administration, in cooperation with the National Park Service \nand with public input from stakeholders, to develop an air tour \nmanagement plan (ATMP) for parks currently or potentially affected by \nair tour flights.\n  Under the ATMP process, routes, altitudes, time restrictions, \nlimitations on the number of flights, and other operating parameters \ncould be prescribed in order to protect sensitive park resources as \nwell as to enhance the safety of air tour operations. An ATMP could \nprohibit air tours at a park entirely, regulate air tours within half a \nmile outside the boundaries of a park, regulate air tour operations \nthat impact tribal lands, and offer incentives for the adoption of \nquieter air technology. An ATMP would include an environmental \ndetermination.\n  S. 2279 also creates an advisory group comprising representatives of \nthe FAA, Park Service, the aviation industry, the environmental \ncommunity, and tribes to provide advice, information, and \nrecommendations on overflight issues.\n  As embodied in the ATMP process, this bill treats overflights issues \non a park-by-park basis. Rather than a one-size-fits-all approach, the \nlegislation establishes a fair and rational mechanism through which \nenvironmental and aviation needs can be addressed in the context of the \nunique circumstances that exist at individual national parks.\n  I am pleased that this procedural approach, in addition to \nrequirements for meaningful public consultation and a mechanism for \npromoting dialogue among diverse stakeholders, mirrors key elements of \nlegislation--the National Parks Airspace Management Act, cosponsored by \nmy colleagues Senator Inouye and Senator Frist--that I have promoted in \nthe last three Congresses.\n  Mr. President, adoption of this bill is essential if we are to \naddress effectively the detrimental impacts of air tour activities on \nthe National Park\n\n[[Page S10826]]\n\nSystem. Air tourism has significantly increased in the last decade, \nnowhere more so than at high profile units such as Grand Canyon, Great \nSmoky Mountains, and Haleakala and Hawaii Volcanoes national parks in \nmy own state. A 1994 Park Service study indicated that nearly a hundred \nparks experienced adverse park impacts, and that number has assuredly \nrisen since then. Such growth has inevitably conflicted with the \nqualities and values of many park units, in some instances seriously.\n\n  While air tour operators often provide important emergency services, \nenhance park access for special populations (e.g., the handicapped and \nelderly), and offer an important source of income for local economies, \nnotably tourism-dependent areas such as Hawaii, unregulated overflights \nhave the potential to harm park ecologies, distress wildlife, and \nimpair visitor enjoyment of the park experience. Unrestricted air tour \noperations can also pose a safety hazard to air and ground visitors \nalike.\n  It is therefore vital that we develop a clear, consistent national \npolicy on this issue, one that equitably and rationally prioritizes the \nrespective interests of the aviation and environmental communities. \nCongress and the Administration have struggled to develop such a policy \nsince enactment of the National Parks Overflights Act of 1987, \nCongress's initial, but limited attempt to address the overflights \nissue. S. 2279 will finish where the 1987 Act left off, providing the \nFAA and Park Service with the policy guidance and procedural mechanisms \nthat are essential to balancing the needs of air tour operators against \nthe imperative to preserve and protect our natural resources.\n  Mr. President, the overflights provisions of this bill are the \nproduct of good faith efforts on the part of many groups and \nindividuals. They include: members of the National Parks Overflights \nWorking Group, whose consensus recommendations form the underpinnings \nof this legislation; representatives of air tour and environmental \nadvocacy organizations such as Helicopter Association International and \nthe National Parks and Conservation Association; and, officials of the \nFAA and Park Service, notably Park Ranger Wes Henry, the Park Service's \nlong-serving point man on overflights, who has served as the agency's \ninstitutional memory and conscience on this issue.\n  However, Title VII is above all the product of the energy and vision \nof Senator John McCain. As the author of the 1987 National Parks \nOverflights Act, Senator McCain was the first to recognize the adverse \nimpacts of air tours on national parks, and the first to call for a \nnational policy to address this problem. Since then, he has employed \nhis moral authority and legislative acumen impel progress on this \nsubject. For his leadership in writing this bill and for his long \nadvocacy of park overflight issues, Senator McCain deserves our lasting \nappreciation.\n  Mr. President, I am tremendously honored to have worked closely with \nSenator McCain over the last year to formulate an overflights bill that \npromotes aviation safety, enhances the viability of legitimate air tour \noperations, and protects national parks from the most egregious visual \nand noise intrusions by air tour helicopters and other aircraft. Left \nunchecked, air tour activities can undermine the very qualities and \nresources that give value to a park; these must be protected. I believe \nthat the pending measure reasonably and prudently balances these \nsometimes opposing considerations, and urge my colleagues to support \nthis legislation.\n  That concludes my remarks, Mr. President. Before closing, however, I \nwould like to recognize the staff of the Commerce Committee--including \nJohn Raidt, Mike Reynolds, Charles Chambers, Sam Whitehorn, and Ann \nChoiniere--for their hard work in putting this legislation together. \nAnn Choiniere especially deserves mention for her day-to-day management \nof this issue. I would also like to recognize former members of my own \nstaff, Kerry Taylor, Bob Weir, and Steve Opperman, who made important \ncontributions to this issue. Steve in particular has served as an \nexpert resource whose tireless, and largely unheralded contributions \nhave shaped the overflights debate in a major way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Before my dear friend from Hawaii leaves the floor, let \nme thank him for his kind words. As always, he is too modest. For many \nyears now he and I have worked together on this issue. His dedication \nto the protection and preservation of Haleakala's and Hawaii's \nvolcanoes is notable. It is noteworthy and it is in keeping with his \nincredible dedication, passion and efforts on behalf of his Native \nHawaiians, as well as all citizens of his most beautiful State.\n  I thank the Senator from Hawaii for his kind remarks.\n  Mr. FORD. I associate myself with the remarks of the distinguished \nchairman, and thank my friend from Hawaii for his kind remarks about me \npersonally. It seems that more of these remarks are coming as the days \nnear the end, and maybe I won't want the days to end, but I do thank my \nfriend from Hawaii very much.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3620\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to go back to the amendment of the \nSenator from Oklahoma. I admire the tenacity and commitment to aviation \nof the Senator. Also, I have had the privilege of personally \nexperiencing his piloting skills while being with him in the great \nState of Oklahoma. Although I must admit that my willingness to ride in \nan airplane with him while he was at the controls had more to do with \nmy conviction that because of my colorful history associated with \naviation having long ago convinced me I was not intended to die in an \nairplane, as I watched my dear friend from Oklahoma fly into what one \nwould describe as ``threatening weather'' with intrepid courage and \nskill, I have grown to appreciate him even more.\n  Associated with that kind of piloting skills is his dedication to \naviation and his tenacity associated with this issue specifically. I \ndon't agree with the amendment of the Senator, but I do believe and I \nam convinced we can work out something which will be agreeable, because \nthe Senator from Oklahoma does identify a problem. I don't agree with \nthe Senator from Oklahoma that it is as big a problem, but when someone \nlike Mr. Hoover, who he just described, is subjected to what he was \nsubjected to, then there is a problem. But I am just not convinced that \nthe remedy that the Senator from Oklahoma is prescribing is the proper \nremedy. He certainly, in a very articulate fashion, describes the \nproblem we need to work together and address.\n  The FAA uses its emergency authority only as a remedial measure when \na certificate holder lacks the necessary qualifications to hold the \ncertificate, and the continued exercise of the privileges of the \ncertificate would be contrary to public safety in air commerce or air \ntransportation. All emergency suspensions are premised on a reasonable \nsuspicion as to the certificate holder's qualifications.\n  FAA policy since approximately 1990 has generally been that an \nemergency exists in which a certificate holder lacks the technical \nqualifications, or the care, judgment, or responsibility to hold an FAA \ncertificate, and remains in a position to use the certificated skills. \nIn such cases, the FAA has reasoned that it intolerably threatens air \nsafety to permit pilots, aircraft mechanics, or air carriers, for \nexample, to operate or repair aircraft when the FAA has reasonably \nconcluded that they do not possess the qualifications necessary to \nperform those functions. If it is clear that a certificate holder will \nbe unable to exercise the privileges of the certificate, the FAA will \nnot invoke an emergency suspension.\n  An emergency order is effective immediately upon issue, rather than \nbeing stayed pending conclusion of the adjudicative process. An \nexpedited adjudication process is initiated since the certificate \nholder immediately loses his or her privileges. The FAA respects the \nprivilege of holding a certificate, but must ensure as its primary \nmission the highest standards of aviation safety. Retaining authority \nto take immediate action in emergency situations is integral to the \nFAA's ability to carry out this mission.\n  While S. 842 would not limit the FAA's ability to immediately revoke \na certificate, it would complicate the process of appealing such an \norder by providing new avenues of appeal in addition to those already \nexisting. Currently, a person subject to an emergency revocation order \nmay appeal the\n\n[[Page S10827]]\n\nemergency nature of that order to the U.S. Court of Appeals. There is \nno deadline for the Court of Appeals to act although the FAA claims \nthat the court will usually rule within 5 to 7 days. According to the \nGAO, few choose to do this and even fewer prevail.\n  This amendment changes this procedure for challenging the emergency \nnature of a suspension. Rather than appealing to the Court of Appeals, \nthe emergency nature of the revocation could be appealed to the NTSB. \nUnder the amendment, the NTSB would have 5 days to decide whether it \nwas really an emergency. If the person does not prevail before the \nNTSB, he or she would then be able to appeal to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals under the same circumstances as currently exist. This risks \nplacing substantial strain on limited agency resources by creating a \nright to appeal to the NTSB, when there is no demonstrable need for \nsuch change.\n  Between 1993 and 1997 the FAA initiated an average of only 2.55% of \nits total enforcement caseload as emergency actions. This average \ndemonstrates the FAA's commitment to using this authority only in those \ncases where the FAA finds that a serious question exists as to a \ncertificate holder's qualifications, and no other action will suffice \nto ensure the highest standards of safety are maintained. Additionally, \nthe FAA prevails on the vast majority of emergency actions before the \nNTSB, supporting its position that it has acted properly and not abused \nits authority. From 1990 through 1997, the FAA was reversed in only 2% \nof the cases in which emergency orders or revocation were issued, and \nin only 1% of the cases in which emergency orders of suspension were \nissued.\n  The FAA opposes S. 842. The agency argues that the bill does not \nalter what may be appealed, merely who would have jurisdiction of an \nappeal. The FAA believes that S. 842 does not make the process more \neffective or efficient, but rather creates several new final agency \ndecisions, all of which would be subject to appeal in the Courts of \nAppeals, which in turn would complicate and potentially prolong, not \nstreamline, the process.\n  The FAA has stated that, even if the bill is enacted, an equal number \nof emergency actions can be expected to be issued with the only result \nbeing the additional strain on FAA and NTSB resources in response to \nmore appeals regarding the existence of an emergency. On the other \nhand, if the legislation results in a significant enough strain on FAA \nresources that the agency is discouraged from its current use of its \nemergency authority, the FAA argues that it would permit allegedly \nunqualified certificate holder to operate one to two years or longer, \nwhile the non-emergency litigation is ongoing. In sum, the FAA does not \nbelieve that its actions and record before the NTSB support the need \nfor any change in the current system.\n  Mr. President, I am always reluctant, whenever we are talking about \nsafety--and maybe it is a bit of cowardice, but I think it is good \nsense when we are talking about safety to be very, very, very serious \nabout the recommendations of those agencies that we entrust with those \nresponsibilities.\n  Obviously, the NTSB is one of those. As the Senator from Kentucky \nwill attest, we have had the NTSB before our committees on many \noccasions--not just aviation, but many others. They are comprised of \nvery outstanding, knowledgeable people. Mr. Hall, in particular, has \nimpressed us a great deal.\n  I understand the Senator from Oklahoma will want a recorded vote. I \nwant to assure him that if he doesn't prevail on this vote, I want to \nwork with him because he has cited serious examples of abuse of power--\nor certainly injustice, if not abuse of power. The Senator from \nOklahoma deserves, as those people who have not been fairly treated or \nwhere there is the appearance of unfair treatment--I won't allege that \nit actually happened, but certainly if there is an appearance of it, I \nwant to work with him in getting something added in the bill to provide \nadditional protections. At the same time, I hope that whatever we do, \nwe can achieve the support and cooperation of both the FAA and the \nNTSB, which is not the case with this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I join my chairman in his remarks. I thought \nthey were excellent and to the point. I agree with Senator McCain that \nwe ought to work with the Senator from Oklahoma to see if we can get \nsomething in the bill that will at least recognize the problem that he \nhas brought forth here this afternoon.\n  As of now, I will join with my colleague and oppose Senator Inhofe's \namendment. It is my understanding that GAO, FAA, and the Department of \nTransportation IG have all looked at FAA's use of its emergency \nauthority. There are only a few cases where the FAA has been reversed. \nGAO found that FAA used its authority in only 3 percent of its \nenforcement cases from 1990 to 1997. It shows a great deal of restraint \nthat they only use it in cases where they think it is an emergency. \nAnd, as my friend from Arizona has said, most of those cases have been \nupheld. So FAA must have the authority--must have the authority--to \nrevoke certificates on an emergency basis.\n  The National Transportation Safety Board, FAA, and GAO all oppose any \nchange. Beyond that, I think I will join with my friend from Arizona in \ntrying to work out something that might be satisfactory, rather than \njust to look at it a little closer than we have been looking at it. We \ncan all find one or two horror stories. I don't know how many \ncertificates were revoked. I don't know how many charges were presented \nto the FAA. Those figures are not here. But in all cases, the \npercentage that Senator McCain represented--2 percent or 1 percent--and \nthen only 3 percent, from 1990 to 1997, of its enforcement cases have \nthey revoked certificates. So I think it indicates that there is a \nconcern on the part of FAA that they not do anything irrational, but \nthat they look at the cases thoroughly and then make a judgment as it \nrelates to emergency authority only.\n  So I hope that the Senator from Oklahoma will give us an opportunity \nto sit down and work with him. I hate to be in opposition to all the \namendments that are brought, but this is one that I will have to be \nopposed to and would encourage my colleagues to vote against if the \nSenator insists that we go on.\n  He stops in my hometown on occasion, I say to my friend from Arizona, \nand buys gasoline from the chairman of the Republican Party in my \ncounty. He is keeping the Republican Party going. I want him to \ncontinue to fly over the Owensboro stop and fill up with gasoline and \nkeep our economy going. I would not want him to not stop in Owensboro. \nI gave you a hometown reason for us to try to help the Senator from \nOklahoma to work something out. I look forward to him agreeing to that. \nIf not, I could not agree to a vote tonight. I am sure the Senator \nwould not want one either. We would have to wait and set a time certain \nfor tomorrow because I understand that his side has a little shindig \ntonight that they would like to get to. We will accommodate him as they \naccommodated us last night. We ought to reciprocate, under the \ncircumstances.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, let me respond to the \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky. I can assure him that I will \ncontinue to stop in Owensboro to get my gas as I fly. There is good \nreason for that; it is the cheapest gas between Tulsa, OK, and National \nAirport.\n  Mr. FORD. We also have mighty fine barbecue there, too.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I eat at the Moonlight Cafe, which is owned by the \nchairman of the Democratic Party.\n  Mr. FORD. See, he is neutral.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I don't disagree with some of the \nstatements made here. I have a little different interpretation. I think \nthe Senator from Arizona is correct when he says 2.55 percent of those \nwere of an emergency nature. The numbers equate to about roughly 300 \npeople.\n  Now, all too often, we stand down here and say it is such a small \nnumber that, if there is an injustice, it doesn't affect that many \npeople. I think that is probably true, but those individuals who are \naffected, it is a matter of taking away their livelihoods. I disagree\n\n[[Page S10828]]\n\nwith the way the system works. When I look at the average between the \ntime of the alleged offense and the emergency revocation, the average \ntime of those in this last entire year was 132 days. I ask the \nquestion, How could there be an emergency nature to these revocations \nif it takes 132 days before that license is revoked?\n  I also comment on the extreme cases that we bring out, such as the \nTed Stewarts and the Bob Hoovers. There are many others out there like \nthat. Again, we are not talking about anything that is going to impair \nthe safety of the flying public or the pilots because we are setting \naside a process whereby there are a certain number of hours to appeal \nthis to the NTSB. It goes back to using the same argument that was \nsuccessfully used when we changed the rules having to do with civil \npenalties. With civil penalties, we argued that you can't have just the \nFAA be the judge and jury and appellate court; and, of course, it has \nworked out very well since then.\n  While I respectfully disagree with my colleagues from Arizona and \nKentucky, I say that there is no interpretation that can be put on my \namendment that is going to do anything to make flying more hazardous, \nor to keep a person from holding a certificate if there is an emergency \nnature to the revocation. If there is an emergency nature to the \nrevocation, as determined by the NTSB--and that is their job--then, of \ncourse, they will keep the certificate and that individual will not \nhave the ability to fly an airplane.\n  Let me just make one comment about the NTSB because, while it has \nbeen stated that the NTSB and FAA are both opposed to this amendment, I \ncan assure you we talked as recently as yesterday to Dan Campbell, the \nchief counsel for the NTSB, and he says, no, it is natural that they \ngenerally don't want a heavier workload than they currently have. But \nhe feels that this is a fair approach, and they don't have an official \nposition against it.\n\n  Does the FAA? Yes. I think any time you are dealing with a \nbureaucracy--I don't care if it is the IRS, the FDA, the EPA, or the \nFAA, or any of the rest of them--they don't like to give up anything. \nThis way, they would be giving up part of this appellate process. This \nis a matter of fairness.\n  I recognize that we will not be voting until tomorrow. However, I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient is second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. FORD. There we go. We are working together again.\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is right.\n  Mr. President, I will make one last comment. In the event that my \namendment will not prevail tomorrow, I look forward, of course, to \nworking with both the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from \nArizona to try to make it more workable.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n            Airport Protection From Forced Scheduled Service\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am speaking in support of an \namendment to address a problem facing small reliever airports that do \nnot accept scheduled service operations. Centennial Airport is a small \nreliever airport near Denver, Colorado, where operations consist \nprimarily of small private chartered and business planes. A unique \nsituation exists at Centennial Airport involving certain charter \nservices and a loophole in the federal regulations governing scheduled \nflights.\n  Centennial Airport is not certificated for scheduled flight service. \nIn fact, the Airport Authority, with strong local backing, has banned \nscheduled service at Centennial. According to federal law, the Federal \nAviation Administration cannot force any airport to become \ncertificated. The airport is not equipped with a terminal, baggage \nsystem, or passenger security. Furthermore, Denver International \nAirport is less than 25 miles from Centennial, and has the capacity to \nhandle additional scheduled service operations.\n  A situation arose more than three years ago when a company called \nCentennial Express Airlines, Inc. began charter service at Centennial, \nbut immediately announced that the airline's service would continue as \nscheduled service. The Airport Authority sued and the County District \nCourt ordered the flights stopped. In April of this year the Colorado \nSupreme Court ruled in favor of Centennial Airport Authority's ban. The \nCourt cited the safe operation of the airport as a priority, and upheld \nthe airport's discretion to prohibit scheduled passenger service.\n  While this decision protected the airport's right to refuse scheduled \nservice, a similar situation recently arose with another company, \nColorado Connection Executive Air Services, and the result has been \ndetrimental for Centennial Airport.\n  In 1997, Colorado Connection proposed to start public charter \npassenger service pursuant to a regular and public schedule. Colorado \nConnection, which is entirely owned by Air One Charter, tried using a \ncombination of Department of Transportation and Federal Aviation \nAdministration exemptions to offer scheduled service. Air One Charter \nindicated intent to market 6-12 daily flights to various Colorado \ncities and to contract baggage services for their flights.\n  The Centennial Airport Authority unanimously voted to deny airport \naccess to Colorado Connection's scheduled service. The vote took place \nin April 1998 and a month later the FAA initiated a Part 16 \ninvestigation. The FAA claims that the Airport Authority's move to deny \nservice is unjustly discriminatory. Recently, the FAA issued a decision \nto pull federal funding for Centennial Airport if the ban on scheduled \nservice is not lifted. This decision is in direct conflict with the \nColorado Supreme Court's ruling on the issue. It is the result of a \nloophole in a law that was not intended to force small airports to take \non the responsibility and burden of supporting scheduled service.\n  Immediately following the announcement of the FAA's decision, the \nowner of Centennial Express was reported by the Denver Post to have \nplans to begin scheduled flights from Centennial Airport.\n  I have proposed legislation to rectify this situation and uphold the \nauthority of airports like Centennial to ban all scheduled service if \nthey choose to do so. This proposal allows a general aviation airport \nto deny access to a public charter operator that operates as a \nscheduled service, and clarifies that such action would not be in \nviolation of requirements for federal airport aid. This will not \nrequire any airport to do anything, and it will not allow an airport to \ndiscriminate against one scheduled service operator and not another.\n  This measure, which is included in the manager's amendment, is nearly \nidentical to language that the House Commerce Committee has included in \nits FAA Reauthorization Act. It would prohibit the FAA from charging \ndiscrimination if an airport chooses to deny access to scheduled \nservice operators. It will only apply to reliever airports that are not \ncertificated under Part 139 to handle scheduled service and airports \nwithin 35 miles of a large hub airport.\n  I appreciate my colleagues' support for the rights of small airport \nauthorities and surrounding communities to retain control over their \nairports.\n\n\n  Banning Commercial Tour Overflights at Rocky Mountain National Park\n\n  Mr. President, I begin by thanking Chairman McCain and the other \nCommittee members for their efforts to mitigate the problems presented \nby scenic overflights at national parks. Tour overflight disturbances \nare a growing problem at a number of parks. This is an issue that I \nhave been involved in for the last four years, and I recognize that \nother Members of Congress have tried to address this issue.\n  While I support the plan put forth by the Committee, I am offering an \namendment to modify the overflights bill to address a specific Colorado \nissue. I appreciate the Chairman's willingness to work with me on this \nproblem.\n  In particular, I am concerned that helicopter sightseeing tours at \nRocky Mountain National Park would seriously detract from the enjoyment \nof other park visitors and would have a negative impact on the \nresources and values of the park itself, and I worry about the serious \nsafety risks involved with overflights in this area.\n  Rocky Mountain National Park is a relatively small park in the \nRockies, about 70 miles from Denver. The park receives nearly three \nmillion visitors each year, almost as many as Yellowstone national \npark, which is eight\n\n[[Page S10829]]\n\ntimes its size. The park is easily accessible, yet continues to provide \nquiet, solitude, and remoteness to visitors, especially in the back \ncountry. Trail Ridge road provides a unique experience for visitors \nthat are not able to hike in the park. It is the highest paved highway \nin the United States, and crosses the park from east to west. \nSpectacular views of peaks and valleys can be seen from the road and \nnearby overlooks in every direction, similar to what you could see \nduring a helicopter tour. Trail Ridge Road reaches above the timber \nline and travels for 4 miles above 12,000 feet and for 11 miles above \n11,000 feet.\n  Several problems are specific to this mountainous national park. The \nelevation of the Park does not allow for a large minimum altitude to \nminimize noise, therefore, according to the National Park Service, \nnatural quiet is unlikely if overflights are permitted at all. The \nterrain, consisting of many 13,000 foot peaks and narrow valleys, \ncoupled with unpredictable weather presents serious safety concerns. \nAlso, the unique terrain of Rocky Mountain National Park would cause \nair traffic to cumulate over the popular, lower portions of the park as \npilots are forced to navigate around the dangerous peaks and high \nwinds. Not only would the overflights be concentrated directly over the \nmost popular portions of the park, but more powerful, and louder, \nhelicopters must be used to achieve the necessary lift at a high \naltitude.\n  Rocky Mountain National Park has been fortunate enough to be free \nfrom overflights to this point, partially because local towns have \ndiscouraged companies that might provide such services. Last year the \nFAA issued a temporary ban on sightseeing flights over Rocky Mountain \nNational Park.\n  In light of these distinctive qualities, one can assess that the best \nsolution to overflight disturbance is a ban on commercial tour flights \nat Rocky Mountain National Park. My proposed ban will apply to \ncommercial tour overflights only, with exceptions granted for emergency \nflights and commercial airlines and private planes. Both the senior \nSenator from Colorado and I are strongly behind this effort to \npermanently ban overflights at the park.\n  A ban would be completely consistent with the recommendations of the \noverflights task force. There has been public involvement and \npreparation of an air tour management plan. There is no need to repeat \nthe steps required under this legislative proposal at Rocky Mountain \nNational Park.\n  A commercial tour overflight ban has wide spread support throughout \nmy state. State and local officials in areas adjacent to the park \nstrongly support a ban on overflights. In fact, local ordinances \nalready exist to protect the quiet at the Park. The entire Colorado \ndelegation and Colorado's Governor are on record in support of an \noverflight ban. My proposal is supported by the business community, \nincluding the local Chambers of Commerce, as well as the local \nenvironmental community.\n  In 1995, one of our top Denver newspapers editorialized that the FAA \nshould make Rocky Mountain National Park off-limits to low-flying \naircraft use, ``the sooner the better.'' Now, three years later, we \nhave finally taken the opportunity to place a permanent restriction on \nscenic overflights.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/23/senate-section/article/S10825-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter \nwhich I sent to the President about Kosovo be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               September 22, 1998.\n     President Bill Clinton,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: As NATO Defense Ministers, including \n     Secretary Cohen, gather in Portugal this week to consider the \n     situation in Kosovo, I write to express my deep concern over \n     the growing humanitarian crisis there. Unless immediate and \n     determined action by the U.S. and our western allies is taken \n     to address this situation, it is clear we will begin to face \n     a catastrophic loss of civilian lives with the onset of \n     winter in the region as early as mid-October.\n       Despite tight constraints on their reporting by the \n     government of Serbia, the western media daily offers new \n     reports on the rapidly deteriorating situation there. Candid \n     assessments by Administration officials acknowledge the \n     growing crisis. Systematic and brutal military action by \n     Serbian forces, accelerated during their summer-long \n     offensive against UCK forces, has forced an estimated 300,000 \n     or more ethnic Albanians to flee their homes. While many have \n     fled as refugees to neighboring countries, most of these \n     displaced persons remain inside Kosovo and are now vulnerable \n     to exposure, starvation, disease and further Serb military \n     attack. I understand that Assistant Secretary for Refugees \n     Julia Taft concluded during her recent visit there that over \n     210 villages in the region have already been looted, and many \n     torched, by Serbian security forces.\n       Serbia has failed utterly to comply with the persistent \n     demands of the Contact Group to: (1) cease attacks on \n     civilian populations, and withdraw its forces used to repress \n     civilians; (2) permit the establishment of an effective \n     international observer group in Kosovo; (3) allow refugees \n     and displaced persons to return to their homes safely, under \n     international supervision; (4) allow unimpeded access for \n     humanitarian organizations and supplies; and (5) make rapid \n     progress in the dialogue with the Kosovar leadership.\n       While Ambassador Hill is to be commended for his persistent \n     diplomatic efforts, it is clear that the time has come for a \n     more vigorous and sustained high-level multilateral effort to \n     pressure President Milosevic to comply fully with Contact \n     Group demands. I urge you therefore to proceed immediately \n     with a series of steps designed to prevent the looming \n     humanitarian crisis and to prepare for possible \n     implementation of more forceful options developed by NATO \n     planners. These actions include:\n       Moving forward now, under NATO auspices, with the pre-\n     deployment phase of NATO military plans on Kosovo, including \n     securing base rights agreements in the region, immediately \n     assessing the contributions of each NATO member in the event \n     military action is necessary, and then forward-deploying \n     appropriate levels of NATO military forces and equipment, \n     thus preparing us to take any appropriate military action \n     that may be necessary to secure Serb compliance with Contact \n     Group demands, and with international law regarding the \n     treatment of Kosovar civilians;\n       Bolstering border security efforts through preventive NATO \n     force deployments which can increase regional stability and \n     assist in international monitoring and anti-arms smuggling \n     efforts;\n       Leading an immediate multilateral effort, at the United \n     Nations and through regional bodies like the European Union, \n     to tighten the existing sanctions regime on Serbia, and to \n     re-impose the trade embargo, total airflight and investment \n     bans, and other sanctions lifted after signing of the Dayton \n     Peace Accords, coupled with renewed enforcement initiatives \n     to prevent the flourishing of black markets under a full \n     embargo;\n       Accelerating U.S. and NATO logistical support for the \n     ongoing international humanitarian aid effort in Kosovo, \n     including pre-deployment of humanitarian supplies in Kosovo \n     in anticipation of winter distributions by NGOs--but only in \n     a way which avoids absolutely the prospect of a repeat of the \n     disgraceful ``safe haven'' disaster of Srebenica;\n       Pressing for more extensive access for human rights \n     monitoring in Kosovo by internationally-recognized \n     organizations, including the Organization for Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe, and non-governmental monitors, and \n     providing appropriate support and assistance for their \n     efforts;\n       Encouraging the International Criminal Tribunal for the \n     Former Yugoslavia immediately to send its Chief Prosecutor to \n     Belgrade and Kosovo; increasing aid and intelligence support \n     to the Tribunal; and assisting them in placing forensics \n     teams on the ground there, thus signaling to all parties that \n     the Tribunal is committed to prosecuting war crimes committed \n     in Kosovo, including attacks on innocent civilians, and has \n     begun to actually gather evidence to support potential \n     indictments against perpetrators--and their commanders and \n     political leadership to whom they answer;\n       I believe it is essential that these actions be taken as \n     quickly as possible. We must act now, before the onset of \n     winter in Kosovo, to prevent a potential humanitarian tragedy \n     of historic proportions. I also recognize that these steps in \n     themselves may not be sufficient to force Serbia to comply \n     with the Contact Group's demands in a timely manner,\n\n[[Page S10830]]\n\n     and that further NATO military actions may need to be \n     considered if the situation in Kosovo has not substantially \n     improved, the massacres of civilians continues, and unimpeded \n     access for humanitarian relief workers has not be granted.\n       Thanks you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Paul D. Wellstone,\n                                            United States Senator.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues who have come to \nthe floor today to speak about Kosovo for their words.\n  Mr. President, I rise to call for urgent Presidential action to \nforestall a humanitarian catastrophe in Kosovo. Unless immediate and \ndetermined action by the U.S. and our western allies is taken to \naddress this situation, it is clear we will begin to face a massive \nloss of civilian lives with the onset of winter in the region as early \nas mid-October.\n  The western media offers new reports daily on the rapidly \ndeteriorating situation there. Candid assessments by Administration \nofficials acknowledge the growing crisis. Systematic and brutal \nmilitary action by Serbian forces, accelerated during their summer-long \noffensive against UCK forces, has forced an estimated 300,000 or more \nethnic Albanians to flee their homes. In recent weeks Serb forces have \nshelled entire villages, not just rebel positions, forcing more \ncivilians to flee. While many have fled as refugees to neighboring \ncountries, most of these displaced persons remain inside Kosovo and are \nnow vulnerable to exposure, starvation, disease and further Serb \nmilitary attack. I understand that Assistant Secretary of State for \nRefugees Julia Taft concluded during her recent visit there that over \n210 villages in the region have already been looted, and many torched, \nby Serbian security forces.\n  With winter approaching, international relief agencies now fear that \ntens of thousands of refugees without food or shelter could face death. \nBy some estimates there are 50,000 to 100,000 people in Kosovo living \nout in the open, without any shelter. Unless they can return to their \nhomes or be provided adequate shelter within the next few weeks they \nmay die of exposure.\n  Our respected former colleagues Senator Bob Dole recently returned \nfrom Kosovo warning that there is a ``human catastrophe in the \nmaking.'' President Clinton said last week that there is a potential \nfor a ``major humanitarian disaster'' in Kosovo and that it is \n``important that we move as quickly as possible with our allies to \navert a tragedy.'' The President cautioned: ``We don't want a repeat of \nBosnia.''\n  The President is right. We cannot wait any longer to take more \nvigorous action to force Serbia to cease making this crisis worse and \nto allow necessary humanitarian relief into the area. Serbia must \ncomply with the persistent demands of the Contact Group: (1) cease \nattacks on civilian populations, and withdraw its forces used to \nrepress civilians; (2) permit the establishment of an effective \ninternational observer group in Kosovo; (3) allow refugees and \ndisplaced persons to return to their homes safely, under international \nsupervision; (4) allow unimpeded access for humanitarian organizations \nand supplies; and (5) make rapid progress in the dialogue with the \nKosovar leadership.\n  In recent days there have been some positive developments in the UN \nSecurity Council and in NATO which indicate that those organizations \nmay be ready to take necessary action. The Security Council is \ncontemplating a resolution stating that the situation in Kosovo \n``constitutes a threat to peace and security'' that impels the council \nto demand an immediate cease-fire. This demand would be in accordance \nwith Chapter 7 of the UN charter. There are indications that Russia may \nbe willing to support this resolution. The resolution does not call for \nthe use of force, but I note that Chapter 7 authorizes the use of armed \nforce by NATO members to compel compliance with the council's orders.\n  Parallel progress is being made at NATO headquarters in Brussels \nwhere the U.S. has asked the North Atlantic Council to canvass member \ncountries to determine which countries are willing to provide personnel \nand equipment to military operations in Kosovo. This action will be \nuseful in precipitating consultations between NATO governments and \ntheir respective parliaments and bringing into the open the debate on \nmilitary options.\n  I applaud these developments and call on the UN and NATO to \naccelerate them.\n  I also want to commend U.S. Ambassador Chris Hill for his persistent \ndiplomatic efforts. The U.S. should continue to work toward a political \nsolution to this problem along the lines pursued by Ambassador Hill. At \nthe same time, though, we must also proceed with a more vigorous and \nsustained high-level multilateral effort to pressure President \nMilosevic to comply fully with Contact Group demands.\n  Mr. President, I want to outline some steps that I hope the \nadministration will proceed with.\n  I urge the Administration therefore to proceed immediately with a \nseries of steps designed to prevent the looming humanitarian crisis and \nto prepare for possible implementation of more forceful options \ndeveloped by NATO planners.\n  I urge the administration today on the floor of the U.S. Senate to \nproceed immediately with these steps.\n  These actions include: Moving forward now, under NATO auspices, with \nthe pre-deployment phase of NATO military plans on Kosovo, including \nsecuring base rights agreements in the region, immediately assessing \nthe contributions of each NATO member in the event military action is \nnecessary, and then forward-deploying appropriate levels of NATO \nmilitary forces and equipment, thus preparing us to take any \nappropriate military action that may be necessary to secure Serb \ncompliance with Contact Group demands, and with international law \nregarding the treatment of Kosovar citizens; bolstering border security \nefforts through preventive NATO force deployments which can increase \nregional stability and assist in international monitoring and anti-arms \nsmuggling efforts; leading an immediate multilateral effort, at the \nUnited Nations and through regional bodies like the European Union, to \ntighten the existing sanctions regime on Serbia, and to re-impose the \ntotal airflight and investment bans, and other sanctions lifted after \nsigning of the Dayton Peace Accords, and to consider reimposing the \ntrade embargo, coupled with renewed enforcement initiatives to prevent \nthe flourishing of black markets under a full embargo; accelerating \nU.S. and NATO logistical support for the ongoing international \nhumanitarian aid effort in Kosovo, including pre-deployment of \nhumanitarian supplies in Kosovo in anticipation of winter distribution \nby NGOs--but only in a way which avoids absolutely the prospect of a \nrepeat of the disgraceful ``safe haven'' disaster of Srebenica; \npressing for more extensive access for human rights monitoring in \nKosovo by internationally recognized organizations, including the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and non-\ngovernmental monitors, and providing appropriate support and assistance \nfor their efforts; and encouraging the International Criminal Tribunal \nfor the Former Yugoslavia immediately to send its Chief Prosecutor to \nBelgrade and Kosovo; increasing aid and intelligence support to the \nTribunal; and assisting them in placing forensics teams on the ground \nthere, thus signaling to all parties that the Tribunal is committed to \nprosecuting war crimes committed in Kosovo including attacks on \ninnocent civilians, and has begun to actually gather evidence to \nsupport potential indictments against perpetrators--and their \ncommanders and political leadership to whom they answer.\n\n  I believe it is essential that these actions be taken as quickly as \npossible. We must act now, before the onset of winter in Kosovo, to \nprevent a potential humanitarian tragedy of historic proportions. I \nalso recognize that these steps in themselves may not be sufficient to \nforce Serbia to comply with the Contact Group's demands in a timely \nmanner, and that further NATO military actions may need to be \nconsidered if the situation in Kosovo has not substantially improved, \nthe massacres of civilians continues, and unimpeded access for \nhumanitarian relief workers has not been granted.\n  Mr. President, again, I thank my colleagues who have spoken today on \nthis matter. I do think it is important that we speak out. I think in \nthe last couple of days we have seen positive developments in the U.N. \nSecurity Council and\n\n[[Page S10831]]\n\nNATO which indicate that these organizations may be ready to take \nnecessary action. But I wanted to outline today some options which I \nbelieve we need to consider and which I think will communicate a \nmessage to Milosevic that we are deadly serious; to talk actually about \ntaking military action is very serious. It is always the last option. \nBut I believe, at the minimum, we can do some predeployment phases of \nNATO military plans.\n  I think we can bolster some of our border security efforts. I think \nwe can tighten the sanctions regime on Serbia. I think we can \naccelerate United States and NATO logistical support for international \nhumanitarian aid efforts in Kosovo. I think we can press for more \nextensive access for human rights monitoring by some internationally \nrecognized organizations. And I think we can make it clear that we are \ngoing to give the International Criminal Tribunal all the support it \nneeds as well.\n  None of this may be enough--I want to say this one more time in this \nChamber. None of these steps may be sufficient to force Serbia to \ncomply with the contact group's demands in a timely manner and further \nmilitary action may be necessary. But if these actions are not taken as \nquickly as possible, we are--Senator Dole is right--going to see a \nhumanitarian crisis of tragic proportions. We are going to see a lot of \nmen, women and children who are going to die unless we take action.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, we are about----\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Mr. President, I thank the Chairman, Senator McCain, and \nthe ranking member, Senator Ford, for their assistance with my three \namendments.\n  One way that the FAA reauthorization bill will improve the nation's \nair service is through the new Community Carrier Air Service Program. \nThis program will provide assistance to communities so that underserved \nmarkets can attract carriers.\n  The Secretary of Transportation will select communities to \nparticipate in this program based on geographic diversity and other \nunique circumstances that presently hinder communities from attracting \nadequate air service. It is important to note that the intent of this \nlanguage is to ensure that participation in the program will promote \nthe development of a national air transportation system. And my \namendment will ensure that it involves the Transportation must ensure \nthis diversity so that every region of the nation can benefit from the \nprogram.\n  An important provision for Maine's pilots is included in my amendment \non the ASOS program. This amendment requires that the Federal Aviation \nAdministration retain human observers at the automated surface \ntransportation system stations which have had a high rate of reporting \nerror. The language in the amendment requires the FAA to correct the \nproblems and notify Congress that the problems have been solved before \nit can remove a human observer from an ASOS station.\n  ASOS is an automatic weather observance system which uses electronic \nsensors, computers and display units to detect weather. It is fully \nautomated and computerized and is intended to replace human observers \nof on-the-ground weather conditions in specific locales. Information \nfrom ASOS sensors are transmitted to a computer, and users, like \npilots, can call a special phone number or tune into a special radio \nfrequency to obtain information.\n  ASOS is intended to make weather information collection \nand dissemination more cost-effective by replacing\n\n[[Page S10832]]\n\nthe human element with electronics. The problem is that in the northern \ntier states, such as Maine, the ASOS system has problems discerning \ncertain weather conditions. For example, sleet falls faster than snow \nso ASOS records it as rain and recently heavy smoke from Canadian \nforest fires caused the ASOS at the Houlton airport to report heavy fog \nat the airport. Needless to say, flying through fog is very different \nthan flying through smoke. This is a very serious matter and could \nresult in life threatening problems if a pilot does not have the proper \nweather information.\n\n  The ASOS systems in Maine have been very unreliable. The station in \nHoulton recorded more than 1,400 mistakes in one year. A letter from \nthe FAA dated May 26, 1998, to you admits the problems with the system.\n  My third amendment increases fines for those airlines which chose to \ndiscriminate against the handicapped. Although the airlines have been \nworking to improve their treatment of the handicapped, there have been \nsome incidents which warrant a sizable fine by the Department of \nTransportation.\n  For example, one of my constituents, Ms. Alice Conway, of Portland, \nMaine was returning from Mexico in 1994 after attending a disabilities \nrelated conference. Her story is a very unfortunate one and clearly \nillustrates the need for penalties which will deter such treatment by \nthe airlines and their employees.\n  The problem began for Alice in Mexico City. There a mechanical \nproblem forced a 45 minute delay in departure. While other passengers \nwere able to exit the plane, nobody offered to help Ms. Conway off the \nplane. After the flight finally got underway, Ms. Conway, who is \nparaplegic, asked to use the aisle chair in order to visit the \nrestroom. Ms. Conway was denied access to the restroom because the \nchair had been forgotten.\n  At one point of the flight, the plane landed in Indianapolis. On the \nground there, the flight attendants refused to bring her a chair and \ndenied her any assistance which would have allowed her to visit the \nrestroom. As the flight traveled to Chicago, she asked is she could \nscoot along the aisle of the aircraft to get to the restroom, a flight \nattendant told her that sitting in the aisle was illegal and if she did \nso, she would be arrested when they landed.\n  Finally, after seven hours of travel, an attendant gave her a blanket \nand a bottle so that she could empty her colostomy pouch while sitting \nin her seat.\n  She had to empty her colostomy pouch in her seat!\n  How can any of us condone such behavior? Thankfully, this bill \ncontains language that will create stiff penalties for those who \nviolate the law.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Kentucky \nand their staff for their assistance in coming to agreement on these \nthree amendments.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I understand that these amendments have \nbeen cleared on both sides. I support them.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I have no objections and support the three \namendments of the Senator from Maine, Ms. Snowe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There being no further discussion on the \namendments, without objection, the amendments are agreed to.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3623, 3624, and 3625) were agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3626\n\n  (Purpose: To make technical corrections in the managers' amendment)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator Ford, I \nsend an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself and Mr. \n     Ford, proposes an amendment numbered 3626.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 48 of the managers' amendment, strike \n     ``additional'' in line 12, line 16, and line 23.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment is in the nature of \ntechnical corrections, and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There being no further debate, without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3626) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, shortly we will have a list of agreed upon \namendments for tomorrow. We do not have time agreements on those \namendments, I am sorry to say, but we at least have the list narrowed \ndown, and I am confident we are now approaching the point where there \nare probably only two or three controversial amendments.\n  My friend from Kentucky can correct me, but I think the majority \nleader, in consultation with the Democratic leader, will decide at what \ntime the vote on the Inhofe amendment will take place.\n  Mr. FORD. The Senator is correct. And I am more than willing to work \nout whatever time is agreeable to the two leaders. I agree with my \nfriend that we need to move on. We are down to just very few votes on \nthis piece of legislation. We have worked awfully hard on our side. We \nhave been able to clear up two or three that we worked on pretty hard. \nThe Snowe amendments we have agreed to, the technical corrections \namendment we agreed to, and those have been taken care of.\n  So we are moving on, even though it does not appear there is much \naction on the floor. Once the legislation is before the Senate, a \nvacuum is created. I learned that a long time ago. You may not have \neverything put together, but once you get started it creates a vacuum, \nand I think we are on our way to being able to pass this piece of \nlegislation sometime tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we are awaiting the approval from the \ncloakrooms of this list. So while we are awaiting that, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. GREGG). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \namendments be the only amendments in order to S. 2279, that they be \nsubject to relevant second-degree amendments, and that they be \nconsidered under time agreements where listed, and that any second-\ndegree amendment be accorded the same time as the first degree to which \nit is offered, and that the previous requirement of relevancy be in \neffect.\n  The following is the list of the amendments: McCain-Ford amendment, a \nmanagers' amendment; McCain amendment which is relevant, 5 minutes \nequally divided; Hollings amendment, relevant, 5 minutes equally \ndivided; Gorton, relevant amendment, 5 minutes equally divided; Ford, \nrelevant, 5 minutes equally divided; Bingaman, overflights, bolster \nNative Americans' role, 30 minutes equally divided; Boxer amendment, \nrelevant; Daschle, two relevant amendments; DeWine, SOS, 10 minutes \nequally divided; Dorgan, regional jet tax incentives, 2 hours equally \ndivided; Dorgan, mandatory interline and joint fare agreements, 2 hours \nequally divided; Faircloth, SOS, 5 minutes equally divided; Feinstein, \nNational Airport perimeter slots; Harkin, relevant; Harkin, slots; \nInhofe, FAA emergency revocation power--and, Mr. President, that is the \npending amendment No. 3620, the Inhofe amendment on FAA emergency \nrevocation power; Landrieu, relevant amendment; Lott, relevant \namendment; Moynihan, airport improvement, 1 hour equally divided; \nMikulski-Sarbanes, three amendments, Reagan National, slots, and \nperimeter\n\n[[Page S10833]]\n\nrule, 30 minutes equally divided for each of these three amendments; \nRoth, reintroduce title VIII to bill, 5 minutes equally divided--\n  Mr. FORD. That has been taken care of.\n  Mr. McCAIN. That amendment would be removed.\n  Thompson, criminal penalties for airmen who fly without a \ncertificate; Torricelli-Lautenberg, Quiet Communities Act, 1 hour \nequally divided; Torricelli, relevant; D'Amato-Moynihan, DOT issue 70 \nslot exemptions at JFK Airport, New York, 10 minutes equally divided; \nLott-Frist-Moynihan amendment, limit eligible airport size for regional \njet section, and Reagan National commuter slots, 10 minutes equally \ndivided; Reed of Rhode Island, noise at Rhode Island airport, 15 \nminutes equally divided; Reed of Rhode Island, code-sharing notice, 15 \nminutes equally divided; Robb, Reagan National Airport, slots and \nperimeter rule, 1 hour equally divided; Warner, prohibit new Reagan \nNational slots and perimeter rule exemptions until MWAA nominees \nconfirmed by the Senate, 1 hour equally divided; Warner, notice, \ncomment and hearings before proceeding with Reagan National slots and \nperimeter rule exemptions, 1 hour equally divided; Domenici amendment \nregarding Taos; D'Amato, travel agents, 20 minutes equally divided; \nCoats, Reagan National Airport slots; Daschle, relevant.\n  Mr. FORD. McCain-Ford managers' amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I did that at the start.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Before I proceed further, I do want to say that although \nit looks like there are a lot of amendments, we are working out \nagreements on almost all of them. So I urge my colleagues to get with \nus tomorrow. We can work out these agreements and have two or three \namendments and hopefully get this legislation passed today.\n  Before I proceed, I ask if the distinguished Senator from Kentucky \nhas any remarks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I have no disagreement with the unanimous \nconsent proposal, particularly retaining the relevancy that is in \neffect now. There is only one question I might have. There is a \nTorricelli-Lautenberg Quiet Communities Act amendment that should be \nfor both, I think. And just so long as that is understood that it is \nnot two amendments; it is only one.\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is a Torricelli-Lautenberg amendment.\n  Mr. FORD. One amendment rather than two. If we could cut an amendment \noff now, we ought to do it instead of waiting until tomorrow. So I \nagree with my colleague, we have an opportunity to finish this bill \ntomorrow. And it is one of those ``must-pass'' bills. And I am very \nhopeful that we can do it. We are here. Our staff is available. We are \nvery amenable right now and probably more so tomorrow; but toward noon \nand a little after we may get intolerable. So let's hope we can do \nthings early in the morning after our first vote.\n  I thank the Chair and thank my colleague.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, just for the record, I want to make it \nclear that these are first-degree amendments only.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Record will so reflect.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/23/senate-section/article/S10831-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, in June 1997, Senator Glenn, Senator Levin, \nand I requested the General Accounting Office (GAO) to examine the \nDepartment of Defense's (DOD) approach for addressing U.S. troop \nexposures to low levels of chemical warfare agents. That report is \nbeing released today. This kind of exposure, most recently experienced \nin the immediate aftermath of the Persian Gulf War--and possibly during \nit--is likely to become an ever greater threat, as more nations seek a \nbattlefield advantage by employing the ``poor man's bomb,'' chemical \nweapons. Our concern was to ensure that the Department of Defense had, \nin fact, learned the lessons of the Persian Gulf War and had taken \neffective steps to address any weaknesses that might result in the \nsoldiers of future wars being needlessly harmed by exposure to low \nlevels of chemical weapons. It is one thing to suffer casualties on the \nbattlefield due to the misfortunes of war; it is quite another thing to \ninflict on American service men and women unnecessary wounds caused by \na lack of foresight and planning. That is unacceptable.\n  Unfortunately, what the GAO discovered is that, as far as chemical \nweapons and chemical battlefields are concerned, the United States \nmilitary is still in Cold War mode. DOD's focus in this area is still \nto enable U.S. forces to survive, fight, and win in the dreaded all-out \nnuclear, biological, and chemical battlefields of the Cold War. DOD has \nno strategy to address low-level exposures to chemical warfare agents. \nNone. Nada. Zip. Despite the fact that existing DOD-conducted research \nindicates that low-level exposures to some chemical warfare agents may \nresult in adverse short-term performance and long-term health effects, \nthe Department of Defense has not stated a policy or developed doctrine \non the protection of troops from low-level exposures to chemical \nwarfare agents on the battlefield. Apparently, DOD prefers to \nconcentrate on ``winning,'' and hand off any chemical casualties to the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs with a ``no longer my business'' \nattitude. I think we need to look at the bigger picture and give the \nsafety of our military personnel the consideration they certainly \ndeserve.\n  Even in the wake of disclosures by DOD that approximately 100,000 \nU.S. troops might have been exposed to some harmful level of chemical \nnerve and blister agents resulting from the destruction of a single \nIraqi munitions dump, less than two percent of DOD's chemical and \nbiological defense research and development program funds have been \nallocated to low-level chemical exposure issues in the two years since \nthose disclosures. DOD claims that there is ``no validated threat'' of \nlow-level chemical exposure to warrant greater effort, even as it \ncontinues to analyze other incidents during the Gulf War that may \nresult in more troops being notified that they may have been exposed to \nlow doses of chemical warfare agents. Moreover, the GAO report notes \nthat DOD did a study just last year analyzing the impact of state \nsponsored terrorist attacks using low levels of chemical warfare agent \nto clandestinely disrupt U.S. military operations.\n  It seems both prudent and reasonable to at least begin the conceptual \nwork to address the issue of low-level exposures to chemical warfare \nagents. But what GAO found instead was a few uncoordinated efforts by \nconcerned offices to look into this current and future threat. This \nissue demands a top-down approach, in which the broad strategy or \nframework can guide the development of research, new technology, and \noperational practice to better defend American men and women, our sons \nand daughters, grandsons and granddaughters, when they don the uniform \nof the United\n\n[[Page S10834]]\n\nStates and defend our interests in the hardest and most courageous \nmanner.\n  For this reason, and based upon the material which the GAO \ninvestigators had uncovered, I authored an amendment, which Senator \nGlenn cosponsored, to this year's Department of Defense Authorization \nbill to require the Secretary of Defense to review and modify chemical \nwarfare defense policies and doctrine. The review calls upon DOD to \naddress providing adequate protection from any low-level exposure, \nwhether singly or in combination with other hazards, and whether to a \nsingle agent or to multiple agents and hazards over time. This \namendment also requires the Secretary to address the reporting, \ncoordinating, and retaining of information on possible exposures, \nincluding monitoring the health effects of those exposures by location, \nso that other mistakes of the Persian Gulf War are not extended to \nfuture battles. Additionally, this amendment calls upon the Secretary \nto develop and carry out a research program on the health effects of \nlow-level exposures that can guide the Secretary in the evolution of \npolicy and doctrine on low-level exposures to chemical warfare agents. \nI am very pleased that the amendment was retained in conference, and I \nlook forward to the report on the review, which is due on May 1, 1999.\n  I am also pleased with the fine and useful work done by GAO on this \nreport, particularly by Dr. Sushil Sharma and Mr. Jeffery Harris. I \nhope that the Department of Defense finds their analysis and their \nconclusions helpful as it begins the review mandated in the Department \nof Defense Authorization conference report. And finally, I thank \nSenator Levin and Senator Glenn for their interest in this matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/23/senate-section/article/S10833-3", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       U.S. FOREIGN OIL CONSUMPTION FOR WEEK ENDING SEPTEMBER 18\n\n  Mr. Helms. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports \nthat for the week ending September 18, the U.S. imported 7,411,000 \nbarrels of oil each day, 1,115,000 barrels a day less than the \n8,526,000 imported during the same week a year ago.\n  While this is one of the rare weeks when Americans imported slightly \nless foreign oil than the same week a year ago, Americans nonetheless \nrelied on foreign oil for 54 percent of their needs last week. There \nare no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf \nWar, the United States imported about 45 percent of its oil supply from \nforeign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s, foreign \noil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil supply.\n  All Americans should ponder the economic calamity certain to occur in \nthe U.S. if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double \nthe already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the U.S.: now \n7,411,000 barrels a day at a cost of approximately $89,006,110 a day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/23/senate-section/article/S10834-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, earlier today, I called in a hold on the \nnomination of Amy Rosen to the Amtrak Reform Board. Consistent with my \npolicy of publicly disclosing holds, I am including the following \nstatement in the Congressional Record, stating my reasons for placing a \nhold on this nomination:\n  I am placing a hold on the nomination of Amy Rosen to the Amtrak \nReform Board because of her role as an Amtrak Board member in voting to \nterminate Amtrak's Pioneer route. A subsequent GAO report indicates \nthat at the time Ms. Rosen approved terminating the Pioneer, other \nAmtrak routes that were even less profitable than the Pioneer were kept \nin service. Before I will allow Ms. Rosen's nomination to move forward, \nI am seeking certain assurances from Ms. Rosen that if confirmed as a \nmember of the Amtrak Reform Board, she will insist that Amtrak make \ndecisions about passenger rail service on the basis of objective \nfinancial criteria.\n  Subsequent to calling in my hold on Ms. Rosen's nomination, I and my \nstaff had conversations with her to discuss my concerns. During those \nconversations, I received assurances from Ms. Rosen that as an Amtrak \nBoard member, she would insist that decisions about Amtrak routes and \nservices would be made on the basis of objective financial criteria and \nthat she would work with me and other Members of Congress to address \nthe needs of rural communities for passenger rail service. As a result \nof these conversations, I am withdrawing my hold on Amy Rosen's \nnomination to the Amtrak Reform Board.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/23/senate-section/article/S10834-3", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10834-S10840]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FOREIGN CURRENCY REPORTS\n\n  In accordance with the appropriate provisions of law, the Secretary \nof the Senate herewith submits the following report(s) of standing \ncommittees of the Senate, certain joint committees of the Congress, \ndelegations and groups, and select and special committees of the \nSenate, relating to expenses incurred in the performance of authorized \nforeign travel:\n\n   CONSOLIDATED REPORT OF EXPENDITURE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND APPROPRIATED FUNDS FOR FOREIGN TRAVEL BY MEMBERS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE U.S. SENATE, UNDER AUTHORITY OF SEC. 22, P.L. 95-384--22\n                                            U.S.C. 1754(b), COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE, NUTRITION, AND FORESTRY FOR TRAVEL FROM APR. 1 TO JUNE 30, 1998\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                  Per diem               Transportation             Miscellaneous                 Total\n                                                                                         -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                       U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar\n              Name and country                             Name of currency                 Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent\n                                                                                            currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.\n                                                                                                         currency                  currency                  currency                  currency\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEdward J.

In accordance with this provision, I have sent the \nenclosed notice, stating that the emergency declared with respect to \nthe National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (``UNITA'') is \nto continue in effect beyond September 26, 1998, to the Federal \nRegister for publication.\n  The circumstances that led to the declaration on September 26, 1993, \nof a national emergency have not been resolved. The actions and \npolicies of UNITA pose a continuing unusual and extraordinary threat to \nthe foreign policy of the United States. United Nations Security \nCouncil Resolutions 864 (1993), 1127 (1997), 1173 (1998), and 1176 \n(1998) continue to oblige all member states to maintain sanctions. \ndiscontinuation of the sanctions would have a prejudicial effect on the \nAngolan peace process. For these reasons, I have determined that it is \nnecessary to maintain in force the broad authorities necessary to apply \neconomic pressure to UNITA to reduce its ability to pursue its \naggressive policies of territorial acquisition.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to establish a National Resources Institute at the \nIdaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                national resources institute legislation\n\n Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, today I introduce the Natural \nResources Institute legislation. Congressman Crapo, who represents the \nsecond Congressional district in my state of Idaho, introduced the \nNatural Resources Institute legislation in the House, on September 17, \n1998. I believe this legislation will help find solutions to many of \nthe problems that affect the health of our environment.\n  This country is faced with the challenge of protecting the \nenvironment, while maintaining economic growth. The use of our nation's \nnatural resources touches all of our lives every day. However, this use \nhas left a legacy of fragmented land-use and regions of environmental \ndegradation, including areas in my home state of Idaho.\n  Unfortunately, there has not been a comprehensive and coordinated \neffort to address these environmental issues or an organized effort to \nhelp other communities from making similar mistakes. I believe that \nmany of these problems could be avoided if the communities faced with \nland-use decisions had access to sound scientific research.\n  The Natural Resources Institute Act, utilizing expertise from \nnational laboratories and universities, will provide communities with \naccess to sound scientific research when making environmental and land-\nuse decisions. In addition, the Natural Resources Institute Act will \ncoordinate research efforts to solve real-world environmental problems. \nIt will be particularly helpful in addressing problems associated with \nagriculture, logging, grazing, hydro-power, fishing, mining, recreation \nand other natural resource activities.\n  Mr. President, I believe this important legislation gives state and \nlocal governments the necessary tools to make sound informed decisions \nregarding land-use decisions. I would like to commend Congressman Crapo \nfor his leadership on this important issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of Oregon:\n  S. 2513. A bill to transfer administrative jurisdiction over certain \nFederal land located within or adjacent to Rogue River National Forest \nand to clarify the authority of the Bureau of Land Management to sell \nand exchange other Federal land in Oregon; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n\n\n         oregon public land transfer and protection act of 1998\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation to transfer the administrative jurisdiction over certain \nlands within or adjacent to the Rogue River National Forest and to \nclarify the authority of the Bureau of Land Management to sell and \nexchange Oregon and California Railroad grant lands (O and C lands) in \nOregon. The bill represents a thoughtfully crafted compromise agreed to \nby the majority and minority in the other body, and the O and C \ncounties and the timber industry in my state.\n  Title I of the bill would consolidate the management over certain \nparcels of federal land by transferring jurisdiction over these parcels \nbetween the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. The \nstatus of any O and C lands transferred will not change, regardless of \nwhich agency has jurisdiction over the lands following the transfer. \nThis is not a land exchange in the traditional sense, but rather the \ntransfer of jurisdiction between two agencies of lands already in \nfederal ownership. It is my understanding that the Administration \nsupports this transfer.\n  Title II of the bill provides that, over successive ten-year periods, \nthere will be no net loss of acres designated as O and C lands. These \nlands are somewhat unique in the federal inventory, and are managed in \naccordance with the\n\n[[Page S10842]]\n\nAct of August 28, 1937, and other applicable federal statutes.\n  There have been concerns on the part of the O and C counties that the \nO and C lands will be used by the federal government in land exchanges \nand sales, thereby diminishing the total acreage over time. Since the \ncounties rely on revenues from these lands, it is important to clarify \nthat it is the intent of Congress that the acreage remain constant.\n  Mr. President, this bill is non-controversial, and I would ask for \nthe support of my colleagues on enactment of this measure before the \nend of this Congress. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2513\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING INTEREST RATES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds, as of the date of \n     enactment of this Act, that--\n       (1) real interest rates are at historically high levels, \n     the highest in 9 years;\n       (2) the Federal Funds rate is 5.5 percent, where it has \n     been since March 1997, despite an inflation rate of 1.6 \n     percent:\n       (3) between 1992 and 1994, the Federal Funds rate averaged \n     3.6 percent, while inflation was at 2.8 percent;\n       (4) to confirm that real interest rates are historically \n     high, the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal \n     Reserve System, Alan Greenspan, said during his Humphrey-\n     Hawkins testimony before the Committee on Banking and \n     Financial Services of the House of Representatives on \n     February 24, 1998, ``Statistically, it is a fact that real \n     interest rates are higher now than they have been on the \n     average of the post-World War II period.'';\n       (5) inflation over the 2 years preceding the date of \n     enactment of this Act was at its lowest level since the \n     1960's;\n       (6) interest rates on 30 year Treasury bonds have sunk to \n     record lows and are below the Federal funds rate, a signal \n     that the United States economy could be headed for a \n     recession;\n       (7) United States corporate earnings in the second quarter \n     of 1998 were down 1.3 percent from a year earlier;\n       (8) a reduction in interest rates would increase resources \n     for business growth;\n       (9) the farm debt is at its highest level since 1985, and \n     broad commodity price indexes are extremely low;\n       (10) there are significant, widespread signs of global \n     deflation, to which the United States has not been exposed \n     since the Great Depression;\n       (11) there has been a deterioration in a number of \n     economies around the world, which will negatively impact the \n     United States through fewer purchases of United States \n     exports and a greater influx of cheap imports to the United \n     States;\n       (12) the United States economy is a large, healthy economic \n     engine, and if the United States economy does slow, it would \n     be exceedingly difficult for the world-wide economy to \n     recover;\n       (13) a decline in equity values could dampen confidence and \n     slow consumer and business spending, which together \n     represents four-fifths of the United States economy;\n       (14) a decline in United States interest rates would help \n     bolster the currencies of countries throughout the world \n     suffering from economic hardships; and\n       (15) a reduction in interest rates would strengthen the \n     United States economy over the next year while the world's \n     weakened economies recover.\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that the Federal Open Market Committee should promptly reduce \n     the Federal Funds rate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      GRASSLEY AMENDMENT NO. 3617\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY proposed an amendment to the bill, S. 1301, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n     SEC.   .

and\n       (C) creating a toll-free, private-sector operated, \n     telephone number, staffed by multilingual operators, to \n     provide assistance to international tourist coping with an \n     emergency;\n       (9) by establishing a satellite system of accounting for \n     travel and tourism, the Secretary of Commerce could provide \n     Congress and the President with objective, thorough data that \n     would help policy-makers more accurately gauge the size and \n     scope of the domestic travel and tourism industry and its \n     significant impact on the health of the Nation's economy; and\n       (10) having established the United States National Tourism \n     Organization under the United States National Tourism \n     Organization Act of 1996 (22 U.S.C. 2141 et seq.) to increase \n     the United States share of the international tourism market \n     by developing a national travel and tourism strategy, \n     Congress should support a long-term marketing effort and \n     other important regulatory reform initiatives to promote \n     increased travel to the United States for the benefit of \n     every sector of the economy.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are to provide \n     international visitor initiatives and an international \n     marketing program to enable the United States travel and \n     tourism industry and every level of government to benefit \n     from a successful effort to make the United States the \n     premiere travel destination in the world.\n       (c) International Visitor Assistance Task Force.--\n       (1) Establishment.--Not later than 9 months after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Commerce shall \n     establish an Intergovernmental Task Force for International \n     Visitor Assistance (hereafter in this subsection referred to \n     as the ``Task Force'').\n       (2) Duties.--The Task Force shall examine--\n       (A) signage at facilities in the United States, including \n     airports, seaports, land border crossings, highways, and bus, \n     train, and other public transit stations, and shall identify \n     existing inadequacies and suggest solutions for such \n     inadequacies, such as the adoption of uniform standards on \n     international signage for use throughout the United States in \n     order to facilitate international visitors' travel in the \n     United States;\n       (B) the availability of multilingual travel and tourism \n     information and means of disseminating, at no or minimal cost \n     to the Government, of such information;

Mr. President, I rise today to call the attention of \nmy colleagues to a subject that many of us, especially men, do not like \nto discuss publicly--prostate cancer. However, as one of the most \nfrequently diagnosed cancers in the country, prostate cancer is a \nsubject that we cannot afford to ignore.\n  In my home state of Nevada, it is estimated that 1,100 men will be \ndiagnosed with prostate cancer this year alone. Nationwide, 200,000 men \nwill be diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1998. This deadly disease \nwill take the lives of 40,000 American men this year alone. Prostate \ncancer kills as many Americans yearly as AIDS or breast cancer.\n  The increase in regular screenings for prostate cancer over the past \nfew years is encouraging. Last year, I had the opportunity to \nparticipate in the Senate Special Committee on Aging's hearing on \nprostate cancer. Nevada's Governor Bob Miller, along with former Senate \nMajority Leader Bob Dole, NFL Hall of Famer Len Dawson and General \nManager of the New York Yankees, Bob Watson all testified about their \npersonal experiences with prostate cancer. These men shared a common \nmessage that was clear and urgent: get tested for prostate cancer as \nearly as possible, because early detection increases survival rates \ntremendously.\n  While the importance of early detection through regular screenings \ncannot be overstated, we can and we must do more. In each of the last \ntwo fiscal years, Congress has appropriated $40 million for new, \ncutting-edge peer-reviewed research at the Department of Defense. In \ninstituting the program, the DOD found it necessary to combine the \nfunds from both years to meet the needs of the grant proposals received \nin the first cycle. Consequently, the President announced the first \ncycle of prostate cancer research grants--releasing $60 million in June \nand July for peer-reviewed research.\n  In this year's Defense Appropriations Bill, we have provided $40 \nmillion for prostate cancer research. The House bill has only allocated \n$10 million for this purpose. These numbers fall short of what is \nneeded to fund crucial research initiatives. I hope that when the \nDefense Appropriations Bill is in Conference this week, funding levels \nfor prostate cancer research will be increased. Without adequate \nresources, promising research into causes and treatments for prostate \ncancer will go unfunded. For lack of research, millions of men and \ntheir families will face critical unanswered questions about screening, \ndiagnosis, treatment, prevention and cures for prostate cancer.\n  Yesterday, 110 American men died of prostate cancer. That same number \nwill die today, tomorrow, and every\n\n[[Page S10855]]\n\nday until research identifies a cure. I hope that my colleagues will \nmake more funds available for the prostate cancer research program at \nthe Department of Defense so that we may offer hope to the millions \naffected by this deadly disease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/23/senate-section/article/S10854-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   JIM SOLOMON AND HIS RETIREMENT AS THE ALABAMA ATTORNEY GENERAL'S \n                        OPINIONS DIVISION CHIEF\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to take a few \nmoments to speak to you about Jim Solomon, who is retiring from his \nposition as head of the Alabama Attorney General's Opinions Division \nafter 35 years of service to the state of Alabama.\n  This division fields legal advice requests from all over the state of \nAlabama, with the majority of the requests coming from local government \nofficials having various questions concerning ambiguities in state \nlaws. While opinions are not legally binding, they are used as \nguidelines by the various entities in developing public policy. \nTherefore, correct interpretation of Alabama laws are essential to the \nsmaller communities and agencies that do not have a legal staff. Mr. \nSolomon's contributions to this effort have been extraordinary and \nshould be noted.\n  I had the honor of working with Mr. Solomon during my term as the \nAttorney General of Alabama. He was an outstanding employee who \nbelieved in service above self. He never strayed from this work ethic \nduring his 19 years in that office. He served as a role model to others \nand was someone who could always be counted on regardless of the job or \nthe circumstances. His administrative and supervisory abilities were \nsuperior and he was greatly loved by those with whom he worked. One of \nhis most impressive achievements was the indexing of all Opinions from \n1979 forward, making it possible for the public to have access to them \non the Internet.\n  During Mr. Solomon's employment in the Opinions Division, he was \nresponsible for writing approximately 8,000 Opinions for state and \nlocal officials. One of the most memorable opinions caused the \npreviously closed state legislative committee meetings to open to the \npublic.\n  Jim Solomon is more than a great public servant. He possesses in rich \nmeasure the qualities that made for a great citizen, a strong \nchurchman, a faithful family man and a good friend to many. He sets \nhigh standards and a good example for all of us.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate being able to make these brief comments \nto my fellow colleagues because it is important that Jim Solomon be \nrecognized for his years of outstanding service to Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/23/senate-section/article/S10855-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  AMERICAN ASSOCIATION ON MENTAL RETARDATION ILLINOIS CHAPTER'S 1998 \n               DIRECT SERVICE PROFESSIONAL AWARD WINNERS\n\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, it is my distinct pleasure \nto join the Illinois chapter of the American Association on Mental \nRetardation in honoring the recipients of the 1998 Direct Service \nProfessional Award. These honorees are being recognized for their \noutstanding commitment and contributions to the lives of people in \nIllinois with developmental disabilities.\n  These award winners have distinguished themselves through their \ncompassion, dedication, patience and professionalism. Their work not \nonly enriches the lives of those who they care for, but also enriches \nall of our lives and sets an example of service for all Americans to \nfollow.\n  It is important to note that the individuals being honored are \nprofessionals who spend at least 50 percent of their time directly \nworking with and assisting their clients in the clients' life-space. \nThese people are not supervisors or managers. Instead, they are direct \nservice providers on the front-lines of our nation's mental health care \nsystem, delivering much needed and much appreciated care and \nassistance.\n  It is indeed my privilege to recognize and celebrate the achievements \nof the following Illinois direct service professionals: Henry \nBarrington, Raymond Betke, Shelly Cross, Caroline Frost, Patty Hart, \nZarina Hasham, Debbie Huff, Carolyn Johnson, Molly Kuster, Preston \nMcBride, Pearlene McDougal, Patricia Mercer, Lisa Pyle, Della Reese, \nMichael Smith, Marie Thompson, Marcia Weidman, Jodie White, Katie \nWhiteford and Sabrina Willis. It is my honor to serve these dedicated \nprofessionals in the United States Senate.\n  I am confident that my colleagues here in the Senate will take this \nopportunity to join me in saluting the winners of the 1998 Direct \nService Professional Award. These awardees represent the best spirit of \ncommunity service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/23/senate-section/article/S10855-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO CONNIE DRAKELEY\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I come to the floor today with the \nsad task of informing the Senate of the passing of one of my staff, \nConnie Drakeley. Connie died in her sleep last week and coming to terms \nwith her sudden passing has been difficult.\n  Connie was a very important member of my staff and will be greatly \nmissed. She will be missed not only for the large contributions she \nmade to the office, but also because she was our friend.\n  Connie joined my staff in March, 1995 in the position of Editor. She \ncame aboard during a time when the mail was building up and a \nsignificant backlog was forming--in short order, Connie alleviated the \nproblem.\n  The mail we receive from our constituents and, in return, answer is \nthe lifeblood of our representative government. It was in this context \nand with this attitude that Connie worked as Editor on my staff. She, \nin many ways, had the hardest job in the office--with red pen, she \npointed out everyone's mistakes! But she always worked very diligently, \nprofessionally and responsibly. She worked long hours and often took \nwork home with her; she made us all better writers. She labored in this \nmanner to make sure that my mail was without fault.\n  Connie was always ready with advice and assistance when someone on \nstaff needed help right away with a letter, speech or a press release. \nThough the work load sometimes could have overwhelmed her, she always \nrose to the challenge and kept her promises to get her editing done on \ntime.\n  She was very knowledgeable and up-to-date on legislation--she watched \nthe floor, read Congress Daily--she didn't just correct grammar, but \ncontent as well. She knew the issues and could spot a mistake a mile \naway. We realized how much the entire process depended on her whenever \nshe took vacation. Mail came first to Connie! I will always be thankful \nfor her remarkable commitment to a demanding and stressful job and her \nrespect for the English language.\n  Connie dedicated her life to being the best editor one can be. Before \nshe came to my office, she worked as an editor for Senator Harry Reid, \nfor the National Archives, for Bechtel, and as a picture researcher for \nLIFE magazine.\n  I would like to extend my deepest sympathies to Connie's daughter, \nbrother and other family members. On behalf of my entire office, I wish \nto let them know that our prayers and thoughts are with them.\n  Connie was an indispensable member of our team; her energy, vitality, \nand dedication will be missed for a long time. We simply couldn't have \naccomplished what we did on a weekly basis for the past few years \nwithout her. Personally and professionally, we have lost a good friend \nand coworker.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/23/senate-section/article/S10855-3", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10855-S10856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE\n\nMr. DODD. Mr. President, in light of the recent vote on national \nmissile defense, I feel compelled to explain my position on this \nimportant issue. In short, I agree with this Nation's senior military \nofficers, the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Each of them opposes the National \nMissile Defense bill, and they provided a detailed explanation of their \nposition in a letter they sent to Capitol Hill prior to the vote.\n  The National Missile Defense bill would require that a national \nmissile defense system be deployed as soon as it is ``technologically \nfeasible.'' Conversely, the current plan calls for the Defense \nDepartment, by the year 2000, to research and develop such a system and \nthen be able to deploy it within\n\n[[Page S10856]]\n\nthree years. This policy allows us to develop our capabilities in view \nof developing threats rather than run the risk of deploying a system \nthat proves to be ineffective. In the absence of a current long range \nballistic missile threat from a rogue state, this is the most \nreasonable policy.\n  Research and development of a National Missile Defense system is \nadvancing at an accelerated pace. Most weapons systems require six to \ntwelve years before they are fully developed and ready to be deployed, \nbut under the current timetable, the National Missile Defense system \nwill spend as little as three years in the development phase. This \nrepresents the Defense Department's strong commitment to protecting the \nUnited States from an intercontinental missile attack. That commitment \nis backed by billions of dollars in funding. The nation will spend \nnearly a billion dollars on national missile defense during the next \nfiscal year alone.\n  The National Missile Defense bill would not have advanced the \ntimetable for developing and deploying a missile defense system. What \nit would have done is lock this nation in to buying a yet-to-be-\ndeveloped system against an unknown threat for an unidentified sum of \nmoney. A decision to buy a system at such an early stage would not only \nhave been unprecedented, but it could have sapped funding from programs \nthat are directed at addressing existing threats. For example, the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff pointed out that a weapon of mass destruction may \npresently be delivered through unconventional, terrorist-style means, \nyet a national missile defense system would not address that threat.\n  This bill would have had a detrimental impact on arms control \nagreements. Had the United States gone forward to deploy a National \nMissile Defense system as the bill required, this nation would have \nviolated the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty. Additionally, it \nmight have caused Russia to withdraw from the START I Treaty and \ncertainly would have prevented the ratification of the START II Treaty. \nThe intercontinental ballistic missile threat to this nation will be \nintensified if Russia retains hundreds of additional nuclear weapons as \na result broken agreements. The current policy, continued research and \ndevelopment of a system, would not violate arms control agreements or \ncause Russia to withdraw from treaties that place important limitations \non both nations' missiles.\n  In conclusion, although I oppose this National Missile Defense bill, \nI feel strongly that there is an important place for missile defense in \nour national security strategy. There have been some important \nadvancements in the development of both theater and national missile \ndefense systems that will surely benefit this nation in the future. Our \nefforts along these lines must continue. Considering all of our defense \nand non-defense priorities, however, now is not the time to rush \nforward with a decision to deploy an undeveloped national missile \ndefense system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/23/senate-section/article/S10855-4", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10856-S10857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AMERICAN RED CROSS BLOOD \n                                SERVICES\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, yesterday I submitted a concurrent \nresolution recognizing the 50th anniversary of the American Red Cross \nBlood Services. I ask that the text of remarks made at the 50th \nAnniversary Bicentennial Celebration by Mrs. Elizabeth Dole, President \nof the Red Cross, be printed in the Record.\n  The remarks follow:\n       Thank you, Paul, for that kind introduction and ladies and \n     gentlemen, thank you so much. And special thanks to Donna \n     Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services, and David \n     Kessler, Dean of the Yale Medical School and former \n     Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. We are \n     delighted you could be with us today as we mark the 50th \n     anniversary of the most important of our national reserves: \n     America's reserve of life, the American blood supply. Thank \n     you, Donna and David, for your continued leadership, and for \n     your steadfast dedication to the safety and quality of \n     American health.\n       Aren't we thrilled to have Garth Brooks here. Garth, you \n     have a magical hold on the spirit of our people. What a joy \n     it is that you would share that bond with us. We are \n     enormously grateful.\n       What a day! We are also so very pleased to be joined by the \n     Oak Ridge Boys! Boys, your music puts the party in the \n     birthday, and we thank you.\n       Also, many thanks to the other wonderful celebrities with \n     us today--Lynda Carter, Kennedy, and William Moses. We \n     sincerely appreciate your generosity in joining us to \n     celebrate our 50th birthday of Biomedical Services. And, \n     welcome to Councilwoman Charlene Drew Jarvis, the daughter of \n     Dr. Charles Drew, renowned plasma pioneer for the American \n     Red Cross and leading authority on transfusion. The Charles \n     Drew Institute honors his memory. Thank you, Charlene, for \n     your support over the years.\n       As we observe this 50th anniversary, of American Red Cross \n     Blood services, it's a time to take satisfaction in our past \n     and pride in where we've been. The Red Cross started \n     collecting blood during World War II in order to save \n     soldier's lives, and our efforts were credited with reducing \n     the death rate among these soldiers to half that of their \n     World War I counterparts. When peace came, we created \n     America's first nationwide, volunteer blood collection and \n     distribution system, assuring all our citizens access to one \n     of the great medical advances of this century.\n       But health events in the last two decades rocked us to our \n     very foundations. The age of blood-borne diseases such as \n     AIDS and new forms of hepatitis swooped down on us with a \n     vengeance. We knew we could no longer operate at the Red \n     Cross as we had done for so many years. Which is why this \n     year, our 50th anniversary, is a year to look forward, rather \n     than back. Today I take great joy in announcing an historic \n     achievement:\n       As the year closes, the American Red Cross will celebrate \n     the completion of our nearly seven-year, $287 million dollar \n     transformation of our blood operations. This long-awaited \n     milestone is the reason I stand here with so much \n     confidence--and hope--for the future. The accomplishment of \n     Transformation is a great, triumphant victory in our common \n     endeavor to expand what is possible in health care.\n       And I'm also pleased to announce today that, following this \n     speech, I am leaving on a nation-wide tour of blood drives \n     and celebrity events to focus attention on the safety \n     revolution in America's blood supply. Many of our citizens \n     are still frightened of transfusions, and they should not be! \n     Many millions still mistrust those red bags of life, and they \n     must not! We have achieved a new American miracle in blood, \n     and I will take that message across America. We will \n     celebrate and we will educate but first, let me ruminate.\n       When I came to the Red Cross in February 1991, the legal \n     and financial vulnerabilities of our blood operations \n     threatened the very viability of the Red Cross. The country \n     was pretty worried about the safety of America's blood supply \n     back then. And as the person newly responsible for half of \n     it, so was I. Some of our Board members wanted us to get out \n     of blood banking altogether, believing our duty to safeguard \n     the rest of our historic organization demanded that we \n     abandon this mission field. Between Congressional hearings, \n     media exposes and enormous regulatory pressure, there were \n     days when I wanted to get out, too.\n       Still, the question haunted us: if we left blood banking, \n     who would fill our shoes? The Red Cross is not a public \n     agency, but what we do--especially in blood--is a public \n     trust. We weren't going to let America down. Not on our \n     watch.\n       The blood supply was as safe as the current blood systems \n     and contemporary scientists knew how to make it. But in the \n     age of AIDS and other blood borne infectious diseases, wasn't \n     there more we could do? We had to ``think outside the box'' \n     with respect to existing science, blood supply management, \n     and safety approaches.\n       We dreamed, in 1991, of where we wanted to go. But we did \n     more than that. We mustered our courage and embraced \n     Transformation as our ticket to ride. It was the most \n     ambitious project the Red Cross had ever undertaken; the \n     total redesign of how we collect, process, test, and deliver \n     nearly half of America's blood supply. I dare say it is the \n     most profound change any non-profit organization has made in \n     recent memory!\n       At the time, it felt the way I imagine a Shuttle astronaut \n     must feel on her first space walk letting go of the ship, \n     taking her first step into the unknown. It felt as if our \n     whole organization had let go . . . let go of the security of \n     status-quo standards, let go of the financial certainty \n     underpinning our entire operation, let go of what we knew, in \n     search of what we hoped to find--but knowing that each step \n     was backed up by a truly exceptional scientific team entirely \n     committed to forging new frontiers. I feel so fortunate that \n     Jim Ross with Brian McDonough and each member of his \n     outstanding team answered my call to complete this challenge.\n       In 1993, the Food and Drug Administration imposed a consent \n     decree on our blood services operations. But as David will \n     tell you, we were already more than two years into \n     Transformation. The consent decree was basically a \n     codification or ratification of our far-reaching plan, with \n     timelines and milestones for measuring our progress. And \n     today, as we conclude Transformation, we also are wrapping up \n     our last requirements under the decree.\n       With the completion of Transformation this year, we will \n     have forced ourselves from the mind set of always doing \n     things the way we had done them before. We already have left \n     behind our days in the comfort of industry average to become \n     the undisputed leader\n\n[[Page S10857]]\n\n     in blood banking. Once we were weighed down with 53 non-\n     standardized blood centers running 28 computer systems in a \n     patchwork quilt of regions, each with its own operating \n     procedures and business practices. Today we have one set of \n     operational procedures, one set of business practices, and \n     one state of the art computer system--which gives us the best \n     national donor deferral system and the largest blood \n     information data base in the world for transfusion medicine \n     research.\n       We determined that today's demands were best met in high-\n     volume, state-of-the-art, centralized labs, so we replaced \n     our 53 testing facilities with 8 state-of-the-art, high-tech \n     laboratories that today are the leading centers of their kind \n     in the world. This enables us to quickly incorporate medical \n     technology as it evolves.\n       Perhaps most importantly, today we no longer fear finding \n     our own faults. We actively seek them out, report them and \n     then fix them, ourselves. We hired a leader in quality \n     assurance who created an independent program, providing more \n     than 200 experts to audit and consult with all of our fixed \n     sites. We actively monitor for more than 150 possible \n     deviations in manufacturing. And our folks, can and on \n     occasion have shut down a process immediately, when they have \n     found a serious deviation from standard operating procedure.\n       In short, we have a new, centralized management structure, \n     a new information system, and the best quality assurance \n     program in existence. We have consolidated and modernized \n     testing and have strictly standardized procedures and \n     training across our system. As a matter of fact, we now run \n     the highly acclaimed Charles Drew Biomedical Institute--and \n     provide leadership to the entire blood banking community.\n       We have moved to a position of leadership in an industry \n     which has achieved phenomenal success in the face of \n     frightening odds: In 1991, an American's risk of HIV \n     transmission from a blood transfusion was one in 220,000. \n     Today, is it nearly one in 700,000--more than a three-fold \n     reduction in risk. I'd say that is worth cheering about, \n     wouldn't you?\n       Today, I can say what I could not seven years ago: the Red \n     Cross is in the blood business to stay. We are sure of our \n     mission and we know how to fulfill it. No longer an \n     organization constrained by yesterday's technology, we \n     operate today with the gleaming precision and efficiency of \n     what is still, for most in the world, only tomorrow's \n     possibilities. We offer Cadillac quality coupled with Volvo \n     security. Don't get me wrong: every car on the lot meets the \n     government standard for safety. But like Cadillac and Volvo, \n     we have set standards of our own.\n       Unlike car companies, however, we don't do what we do for a \n     profit. The pins on our lapels and the patches on our sleeves \n     remind us daily that we are in this business to fulfill a \n     national trust, to live up to our moral commitment to do the \n     best we can to ensure the well-being of the American people. \n     We are also reaching out to the rest of the world, sharing \n     the lessons we have learned from Transformation to help \n     improve the safety and reliability of the world's blood \n     supply.\n       Of course, modernization and improvement is a process that \n     must never end. As David Kearns, the former chairman of \n     Xerox, once said, ``In the race for quality, there is no \n     finish line.'' This could never be more true than in the \n     blood banking business. We're determined to remain not only \n     the industry leader in quality and safety, but to place \n     ourselves in the forefront of new product development.\n       At our world-class Hollard Laboratory, Red Cross physicians \n     and scientists are evaluating and monitoring possible threats \n     to the blood supply and working on many other new, cutting-\n     edge technologies--some of which we will share with you \n     today.\n       But all this technology wouldn't be worth a thing without \n     the Red Cross who make it work for America. They are the \n     reason and the inspiration for our service. We have 1.3 \n     million volunteers, 32,000 paid staff, and 4.3 million blood \n     donors--that's 20,000 donors every day--I'd like to stop just \n     a minute give those heroes a loud round of applause.\n       Yes, after 50 years in Blood Services--and spending the \n     last seven years transforming them, the American Red Cross \n     has much to celebrate. In addition to enhancing blood safety, \n     our investment has given us the knowledge and confidence to \n     shape our own future.\n       Before Transformation, the Red Cross and other blood banks \n     around the country waited for signals from the FDA that \n     change was required. Today, the Red Cross is a leader of \n     change. While Transformation the program is nearly complete, \n     Transformation the process will be never ending.\n       There is a story I love about Supreme Court Justice Oliver \n     Wendell Holmes. When Justice Holmes was in his 90s, he took a \n     trip on the Pennsylvania Railroad. As he saw the conductor \n     coming down the aisle, he began patting his pockets, looking \n     for his ticket. The conductor, recognizing the famous jurist, \n     said ``Don't worry, Mr. Justice. I'm sure you'll find your \n     ticket when you leave the train, and certainly the \n     Pennsylvania Railroad will trust you to mail it back later.''\n       Justice Holmes looked up at the conductor with some \n     irritation and said, ``My dear man, the problem is not, where \n     is my ticket. The problem is, where am I going?''\n       Ladies and gentlemen, the American Red Cross knows where \n     it's going! As we have led the nation in blood \n     transformation, so we will set a new credo of business for \n     businesses of the heart. But more than that, we are dedicated \n     to saving and improving every life we can. We at the Red \n     Cross want to be the model for non-profits in the next \n     century. The status quo is no longer our milieu. Well into \n     the new millennium, the Red Cross will seek out the cutting \n     edge; we will be the people who question the range of \n     possibilities--in blood banking as well as in every other \n     aspect of our mission.\n       But we know we cannot accomplish all of our dreams by \n     ourselves. We need the time and money, the brainpower and the \n     lifeblood of Americans like you. Together, we will continue \n     to imagine the unimaginable and attain the unattainable. \n     Together, we will be privileged to touch, and in so doing \n     transform, the millions of individual lives we are dedicated \n     to serve.\n       On behalf of our entire Red Cross family, thank you for all \n     you've done, and for all you continue to do. And on this \n     special day, thanks for coming to our party.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/23/senate-section/article/S10856-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10857-S10858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n Mr. DOMENICI.

The \nIndependent Counsel, who is bringing this prosecution, seeks testimony \nat trial from two present and one former employee of the Senate about \ncommunications with meat and poultry processing industry \nrepresentatives and Executive Branch officials about a labeling rule \npromulgated by the Agriculture Department in 1993. The trial is \nscheduled to begin on October 1.\n  In keeping with the Senate's practice regarding similar matters, this \nresolution would authorize testimony by employees of the Senate, except \nwhere a privilege should be asserted, with representation by the Senate \nLegal Counsel.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the resolution appear at the \nappropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 281) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 281\n\n       Resolved,\n       Whereas, in the case of United States v. Alphonso Michael \n     Espy, Criminal Case No. 97-0335, pending in the United States \n     District Court for the District of Columbia, a trial subpoena \n     has been served upon Galen Fountain and Jo Nobles, employees \n     of the Senate, and Leslie Chalmers Tagg, formerly an employee \n     of the Senate;\n       Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(2) of the \n     Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 288b(a) \n     and 288c(a)(2), the Senate may direct its counsel to \n     represent employees of the Senate with respect to any \n     subpoena, order, or request for testimony relating to their \n     official responsibilities;\n       Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United \n     States and Rule XI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, no \n     evidence under the control or in the possession of the Senate \n     may, by the judicial process, be taken from such control or \n     possession but by permission of the Senate;\n       Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or \n     in the possession of the Senate may promote the \n     administration of justice, the Senate will take such action \n     as will promote the ends of justice consistently with the \n     privileges of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved That Galen Fountain, Jo Nobles, Leslie Chalmers \n     Tagg, and any other employee from whom testimony may be \n     required, are authorized to testify in the case of United \n     States v. Alphonso Michael Espy, except concerning matters \n     for which a privilege should be asserted.\n       Sec. 2. That the Senate Legal Counsel is authorized to \n     represent Galen Fountain, Jo Nobles, Leslie Chalmers Tagg, \n     and any other employee of the Senate, in connection with \n     testimony in United States v. Alphonso Michael Espy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/23/senate-section/article/S10858-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10858-S10859]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1998\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.
