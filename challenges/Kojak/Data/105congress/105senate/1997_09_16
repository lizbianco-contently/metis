Your gift of wisdom enables true \nsuccess, righteousness, justice, and equity. The Talmud reminds us that \nthe aim of wisdom is repentance and good deeds. With wisdom, we turn \nour lives back to You in authentic repentance and commit ourselves to \ndo and say what You guide.\n  Thank You for the clear invitation to receive wisdom given us by \nJames, Jesus' brother: ``If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God \nwho gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given \nhim.''--James 1:5.\n  Having asked for wisdom, we praise You in advance for the x ray \nvision to see beneath the surface of issues and discern what is Your \nwill for us and our beloved Nation. Bless the women and men of this \nSenate with a special measure of wisdom today. Through our Lord and \nSaviour.

Mr. President, this morning we are scheduled to have 30 \nminutes of debate prior to a vote on the motion to invoke cloture on \nthe substitute amendment to S. 830, the FDA reform bill. This is the \nsecond cloture vote we have had to have on this very important \nbipartisan legislation to reform the Food and Drug Administration so \nthat medicines and medical devices can get to the American people in a \nresponsible and reasonable period of time so that they don't have worse \nhealth conditions, or even death in many instances. We are scheduled to \nhave a rollcall vote at 10 a.m. this morning on cloture, if it is \nrequired. And we had hoped to go ahead and do that and then go back to \nthe Interior appropriations bill and complete that, and then come back \nto FDA.\n  We have a Senator that has an illness this morning who would like \nvery much to be able to make this vote. So we are contacting all of the \nmanagers of the legislation that is pending this morning, including the \nInterior appropriations committee, to see if we can maybe take some \nadditional time this morning on Interior appropriations. If we can get \nthat worked out, we may delay that 10 o'clock vote until either say \n11:15 or 12:15 in an effort that I know all Members would want to make \nto accommodate this Senator who is anxious not to miss the vote.\n  So we will ask our colleagues on both sides to cooperate as we try to \nuse this time for constructive debate and see then exactly what time we \ncould expect these votes to occur.\n  Under the consent agreement that we entered into last week, Members \nhave until 10 a.m. today to file second-degree amendments to the FDA \nreform bill. After the disposition of that cloture vote and/or the FDA \nreform bill, depending on what we can work out, then we will resume \nconsideration of H.R. 2107, the Interior appropriations bill. Senators \ncan expect additional votes throughout the day either on the FDA reform \npackage or on the Interior appropriations bill.\n  I will ask the managers of the FDA bill to work with us on this and \ncooperate with us so that we can have some orderly consideration of \nboth the FDA and the Interior appropriations bill. Hopefully we will go \nto Interior after we invoke cloture again on FDA reform, then allow \nSenators that are interested to continue to work together, and then see \nif we can get an agreement to complete action on FDA reform in a \nreasonable time this week.\n  Does the Senator from Vermont want me to yield at this point?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Yes. If the Senator will yield, my understanding was \nwhen we went home this weekend that we would be ready to close the bill \nand have all amendments with time agreements. Now my understanding from \nthe minority is that they are not in agreement on one particular \nprovision of the substitute. Thus, I would believe we should go forward \nwith the cloture vote. We are ready, though, with a number of \namendments for which I believe we have agreements. We could address \nthose in the interim while we try to work out the final amendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. I was under the impression last week that there was one \nremaining issue where there was disagreement, and there was a lot of \ndiscussion about that--the so-called cosmetics portion of the bill. I \nwas not involved in the substance of that discussion. But I understand \nSenators did work out an agreement and that matter has been resolved. \nBut I understand as well that there is another issue.\n  I just wonder how long this is going to go on.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I do, too. I understood that all matters were taken \ncare of. But now I understand from the leader of the minority that is \nnot the case--that they still have this problem with respect to one \nprovision. But we are ready to go ahead with all of the other \namendments and believe we should expeditiously go to the cloture vote \nwhenever the situation presents itself, as the leader outlined.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator from Vermont. I know he is committed to \ngetting this legislation completed. There are very few bills that I \nhave seen that have such broad bipartisan\n\n[[Page S9360]]\n\nsupport as this one does. It is costing millions of dollars to comply \nwith the ridiculous delays from FDA, and the American people are being \ndeprived of medicines and devices that should be approved much quicker. \nSome of them are just impossible to explain.\n  I hope that we can complete action this week.\n  I appreciate the efforts and the leadership of the Senator from \nVermont.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the leader will yield, I have a question.\n  So we are not having a cloture vote at 10 a.m. Was there a unanimous-\nconsent agreement entered into that I missed before I came onto the \nfloor?\n  Mr. LOTT. No. There was no unanimous-consent agreement.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Are we not voting at 10 o'clock?\n  Mr. LOTT. We have a Senator that is unavoidably detained that really \nis anxious to be present on that vote. We are trying to accommodate his \nschedule, as I know the Senator from Iowa would want us to do. We are \nworking with the managers of both this bill and Interior appropriations \nand the interested Senators to see when we might have that vote. We \nwould at some point try to enter into an agreement as to when it would \nbe.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Are we going on the FDA bill?\n  Mr. LOTT. We will talk about it for a little while. But at 10 o'clock \nwe will advise Members whether we are going to have a vote, or when we \nare deferring it to.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/16/senate-section/article/S9359-5", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9360]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson).

The Senate will now resume consideration of S. \n830, with the time until 10 a.m. to be equally divided.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 830) to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and \n     Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act to improve the \n     regulation of food, drugs, devices, and biological products, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n\n\n            Modified Committee Substitute Amendment No. 1130\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. President, we are here to discuss yet again the need for cloture \non S. 830, the FDA Modernization and Accounting Act. We have already \nhad 14 hours of floor debate on this measure and we have not yet \ndiscussed this amendment. This will be the second time that cloture has \nbeen voted on regarding this measure. The first vote was 89 to 5 to \ninvoke cloture. The Senate has spoken. And, yet, we are here to repeat \nourselves again and again.\n  My colleagues have already heard repeatedly from both sides of the \naisle about the strong bipartisan commitment to crafting this measure, \nabout the months of negotiations, deliberation and collaboration with \nthe administration, the minority, and outside groups. Literally dozens \nof accommodations have been made and agreements reached. No one \ndisputes that this is a good bill. No one should dispute that we have \nmoved forward, or that we should move forward, with our debate on the \nremaining issues. Now we should move forward on that debate.\n\n  This measure accomplishes two very important objectives. First, it \nmodernizes the way that the Food and Drug Administration accomplishes \nits mission. It streamlines the review and approval process for medical \ndevices, pharmaceutical, and biological products. In so doing, it helps \nto ensure that the best and safest medical technology available in the \nworld would be available to the American people. In so doing, it helps \nensure that the best medical technology jobs will continue to be \navailable for the American people.\n  Second, this measure authorizes the Prescription Drug User Fee Act--\nor PDUFA, as it is known. Everyone agrees that PDUFA has been immensely \nsuccessful in helping FDA do its job better and more efficiently.\n  Mr. President, congressional authorization for PDUFA expires in 15 \ndays. At the end of September this successful and innovative program \nwill be at serious risk. It is the height of irony that a program like \nPDUFA that was designed to reduce delay at the FDA is now at risk of \nbecoming bogged-down in a procedural delay on the Senate floor.\n  I would argue that the time for delay is over, and that the time for \nthe Senate to do its work it was sent here to do is now.\n  Almost 50 amendments have been filed on this measure. And, frankly, \nvirtually all of them are nongermane, or they have been worked out, or \nthey can be worked out. A single provision remains that may require \nsome extended debate, and we should move to its consideration and an \nup-or-down vote on it as soon as possible.\n  Last week we spent almost 15 hours talking about uniformity for \ncosmetics. We have an agreement on that provision, thanks to the \nefforts of Senator Gregg.\n  I say that we should move on. I say we complete this debate, and \nfinish this measure, and let's vote.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, with all due respect to my friend and \ncolleague, the majority leader, the fact of the matter is by the votes \nthat we had last week requiring that we have some opportunity to \nexamine a very important provision--and that is the preemption of \nvarious States' ability to protect their public--we have seen a rather \ndramatic change in the language of the provision that will continue to \npermit the States to protect their public. That was very important for \nthe protection of the American public. I know that there are some \npeople around here who want to see the trains run on time. But some of \nus--not only those of us here but the National Governors' Conference, \nthe public health organizations, the women's network organizations that \ndeal with women's health issues--a wide range of consumers believe, \nquite deeply, that we are absolutely within our rights to make sure \nthat this provision was offered and changed, and we did so. And, by \ndoing so, the public health interest is preserved.\n  Now here we are on the floor of the U.S. Senate the morning after \nhaving seen the headlines from two national journals--yesterday in the \nWall Street Journal, talking about a particular prescription drug \ncalled fen/phen, that had been moved through, rushed through the FDA. \nIt has been linked to everything from brain damage in animals to \nprimary pulmonary hypertension; a rare but fatal lung disease; millions \nof Americans tried the drugs to slim down; some 60 million people \nworldwide were estimated to have taken the drug; the straw that broke \nthe camel's back was a heart valve problem which now has been widely \nrecognized.\n  Here is an item in the Washington Post. Two diet drugs are pulled off \nthe market. Why? Because the products were used for purposes for which \nthe drug was not approved.\n  We are talking about an identical provision in this body with regard \nto medical devices--the use of the medical device for purposes for \nwhich it has not been approved.\n  We have seen the whole world being awakened to this particular health \nproblem. Some of us are trying to making sure that we don't have \nheadlines like this in 3 months, 4 months, or 6 months with regard to \nthe medical device issue. That is what we are talking about.\n  Mr. President, I would just point out that there are about six little \nwords that, if the majority would be willing to accept, would move us \nright ahead, and get us very short time agreements on the other \nelements.\n  Let me just point out. Mr. President, there are the two provisions \nwith regard to medical devices--one they call class II--devices which \nrepresent about 5 percent of the devices. Those are the new devices.\n\n[[Page S9361]]\n\n  In the language of this bill, it says, whether or not there is \nreasonable assurance of safety effectiveness, if the proposed labeling \nis neither false nor misleading.\n  ``Neither false nor misleading,'' that is in regard to class III \ndevices. But, if you look at class I and II devices with regard to the \nrepresentations that are made involving the FDA, there is no such \nlanguage.\n  If the majority will take the language that we propose for class III \nand apply that to class I and II, we will call this cloture vote off. \nWhat person in the United States of America wants to permit medical \ndevices to be approved if we cannot have agreement by the manufacturers \nthat their statements to the FDA reflect the true uses for the devices?\n  My goodness, are we in that big of a hurry? That is why this issue is \nimportant. Now, the majority leader says we have just one more item. We \nare glad to deal with this issue, and we have offered compromise \nlanguage to deal with it. It is of vital importance and we will have a \nchance later to discuss the health hazards associated with it. The \nmedical device industry, which has been enormously cooperative in \nworking out other provisions on this, had refused to go along with our \nproposed language. Medical device labeling has important health \nimplications.\n  You can rush this through and say the rest of the bill is fine. It is \nfine. Senator Jeffords and his Republican colleagues deserve great \ncredit. My Democratic colleagues deserve great credit. But do we have \nto be reminded again that the FDA has the responsibility for the \nprotection of the public health. If we do, we don't need to look any \nfather than reading this mornings newspapers. All we are saying is \nlet's not do with medical devices what was done with regard to these \ndiet medicines. I think that is an important health matter. So do the \noverwhelming majority of patient coalitions and public health \ncoalitions.\n  If the industry wants to debate that, we are going to take the time \nto debate it. If there are Members on the floor of the U.S. Senate who \nwant to take the position that we don't need this change in the bill \nlanguage on medical device regulation, let them make that case on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate. Because that is the case they are going to \nhave to make, because the amendment has been filed. If the majority \nindicates they will accept that, that's all fine and well. Our \namendment will ensure that FDA is able to comprehensively examine the \nsafety of medical devices. We will move through this legislation very \nrapidly indeed. But this is one Senator who is not prepared to roll \nover on that issue. We will have the opportunity during the course of \nthis morning or this afternoon or tonight or tomorrow, or however long \nit takes, to go through the various instances where medical device \nlabeling could pose an important and significant public health threat, \na threat to the American people.\n  There may be those who do not think this is an important issue. I \nbelieve the overwhelming majority of the American public will think so. \nAs they are reading their papers this morning and listening to those \nwho say, let's rush this bill on through, I would think some Americans \nwould say, let's take another look at what we have in this legislation, \nparticularly with regard to the medical device provisions.\n  Mr. President, with all respect to my friend and colleague, we have \ntalked about this. Senator Durbin has talked about sections 404 and \n406. This particular issue is the key issue.\n  If we can get the language in the bill ensuring that we will not \npermit the medical device industry to restrict the FDA's ability to \nmake a full study of medical device safety, I think we would move ahead \nwith the legislation.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I must answer that charge.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. To inflame this issue into being one of false \ninformation and filing of misleading information is totally incorrect. \nThe issue here is not that. The issue here, on each of these medical \ndevices, is whether or not they must file every conceivable, possible \nuse that FDA thinks might be made of it. FDA should focus rather on the \nuse that it is intended for or any other use that the manufacturers \nknow it will be intended for. There is nothing involving false or \nmisleading information. That, of course, is under the control of the \nFDA and that would be a serious matter with the FDA. It could, and \nshould deny approval of a device where a manufacturer deliberately \nfiles false and misleading information.\n\n  Let us set the record straight. Manufacturers cannot file false and \nmisleading language. To raise that as the issue is to really differ \nfrom what the important issue is, and that is how long do Americans \nhave to wait to get access to important, new medical devices. In Europe \nit takes much less time and it is much more expeditiously handled. We \ncan have the same kind of treatment here while ensuring that they are \nsafe and effective for their intended use. For any device that is \nintended for a particular use and it is known by doctors to be \neffective for another use, that's fine. That is the practice of \nmedicine. Doctors sometimes find other, valuable uses for medical \ndevices. That is how medical practice and innovation proceeds--and we \ndon't want the Federal Government telling doctors how to practice \nmedicine.\n  But for the manufacturer to search out every conceivable use and then \nto study every conceivable possible use ends up in delays of these \ndevices coming onto the market. That means that Americans, doctors and \npatients, are unable to utilize medical innovations that are more \nreadily available in Europe. So I wish we would get away from making \nthis into a ``false and misleading language'' filing. There is no such \nissue here as that. The question is how much right does the FDA have to \nrequire a manufacturer to understand and get involved with the practice \nof medicine where some other use might be made. That is the issue.\n  I think there are ways we can solve this, but not just by raising it \nto the issue of emotionalism. That is not the solution here. There is \nno problem having false or misleading information filed on a medical \ndevice approval application, because that is against the law. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 2 minutes \n32 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield the remaining time to the Senator from Iowa. I \nthink we will have more time later.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for yielding. Let me agree with \nSenator Kennedy on this issue. The stories in the paper this morning \nought to alarm us all about the need to proceed very cautiously and \nvery carefully about what we are doing. I spent a lot of time looking \nat devices. I had amendments on the bill itself, when it was in \ncommittee, on devices. The FDA has the authority now, if a device is \nused for a certain purpose, to make sure that there are not misleading \nor false advertising proposals. But when they want to use the device \nfor a purpose for which it is not intended, there is nothing in the \nbill to prohibit that. That is what we are talking about, and I think \nwe have to proceed very cautiously and carefully here.\n  Mr. President, I did want to talk about another issue. I thank \nSenator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy for their hard work and leadership \non this bill. I think we all agree we need some reform of FDA. I have \nbeen in favor of that. We need to streamline the processes. I agree \nwith Senator Jeffords in that regard. There are many positive \nprovisions in this bill.\n\n\n Amendment No. 1137 to Modified Committee Substitute Amendment No. 1130\n\n  (Purpose: To establish within the National Institutes of Health an \n    agency to be known as the National Center for Complementary and \n                         Alternative Medicine)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am disappointed, however, that an \nessential element was not included. A major goal of FDA reform was to \ninclude access to medical innovations without compromising public \nsafety. I have an amendment, amendment No. 1137, which speaks to that. \nI would like to call up that amendment at this time and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself, Mr. Hatch, \n     Mr. Daschle, and Ms.\n\n[[Page S9362]]\n\n     Mikulski, proposes an amendment numbered 1137 to modified \n     committee substitute amendment No. 1130.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, further, I ask unanimous consent that this \namendment be in order, notwithstanding any vote on cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I reserve the right to object. What is the regular \norder here with respect to amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendments are in order to both the substitute \nand the bill.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. At this time, prior to cloture?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendments may be called up prior to the \ncloture vote.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I object at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Iowa has \nthe floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 15 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this is cosponsored by a number of \nSenators on both sides of the aisle, Senators Hatch, Daschle, Mikulski, \nmyself, and a number of Senators on both sides of the aisle. I don't \nbelieve it is going to be objected to.\n  However, we are facing the problem of cloture. That's why I asked for \nunanimous consent. I am sorry the manager of the bill would not allow \nthis amendment to be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont controls the \nremaining time.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 5 minutes 26 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield the remaining time to Senator Coats.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I don't need all the 5 minutes. I would be \nhappy to yield back to the Senator from Vermont to wrap up before the \ncloture vote. It is unfortunate that we are in this position again. We \nhad a substantially bipartisan, overwhelming vote to invoke cloture on \nthe motion to proceed. I believe the vote was 89 to 5. I think that \nindicates a very broad level of support for the need to move forward \nwith this legislation that was 2\\1/2\\ years in the making. There is \nobviously a widespread, general consensus that FDA reform is necessary \nto provide better protection for the health and safety of Americans and \nto provide access to drugs and devices that Americans have been denied \ndue to delays at FDA. We are trying to expedite that process. We are \ntrying to bring in expertise from outside to help FDA, whether it is \nthrough the tax that is levied on prescription drug companies that goes \nto hire additional workers and provide additional resources for FDA, or \nwhether it is for outside agencies, certified by FDA, to help them in \nthe process of reviewing this tremendous backlog of applications for \nhealth-improving, and in many cases lifesaving, devices and drugs.\n  What we are trying to do here is give FDA the kind of support and \nresources it needs, along with a pretty good shove in the right \ndirection, to bring our agency up to world class standards and up to \nthe task of effectively dealing with this exciting explosion of \ntechnology through which the American people can reap great benefits.\n  I regret once again we have to go to a cloture vote. We just ran into \na problem here, procedurally, with the amendment, the Senator from Iowa \nfearing that cloture would cut off his ability to offer a relevant \namendment under cloture. I would say to the Senator from Iowa, none of \nus really wants to go to cloture. But in order to move this bill \nforward, it appears that we have to invoke cloture once again.\n  I know under the rules of cloture, it limits the amendments as to \nrelevancy. No one in favor of FDA reform wants to keep going through \nthis process of invoking cloture, but unfortunately we have to do it in \norder to move the bill forward.\n  Again, 2\\1/2\\ years in the making, there were extensive hearings in \nthe Labor Committee, efforts on a bipartisan basis to resolve problems \nand disputes, votes in committee, negotiations post-committee action, \n30-some concessions or modifications in response to concerns that were \nraised postcommittee on this. So, none of us here supporting and \npromoting the movement forward of this legislation is trying to delay \nanything. We are just trying to expedite it. Nor are we trying to say, \n``Our way or no way.'' There has been extensive negotiation, extensive \naccommodation, extensive work to move this bill forward in any way that \nwe possibly can.\n  So I urge my colleagues, as we did a week or so ago, I urge my \ncolleagues to vote with us on cloture. We have no other choice, other \nthan lengthy debate over items and issues that have been discussed over \nand over and over and voted on and negotiated. Clearly, we know where \nthe Members of the U.S. Senate stand, both Republicans and Democrats, \nliberals and conservatives. There is about as widespread support for \nthis reform bill as any major legislation that has come before the \nSenate as long as I have been in here, for 9 years. It is time to move \nforward. Regretfully, we have to do it once again with a cloture \nmotion.\n  I urge my colleagues to help us move this very needed and very \nimportant legislation the next step forward.\n  I yield back any remaining time I have to the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, as to the Senator from Iowa, I apologize \nthat we are in an awkward situation this morning. I have assured him \nthat we will have a hearing in October on NIH with respect to \nalternative forms of medicine. I look forward to that because I agree \nwith him on that issue.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npreviously scheduled cloture vote be postponed to occur at 12:15 p.m. \ntoday, and further, that second-degree amendments may be filed up to 10 \na.m. this morning. I further ask consent that following debate this \nmorning regarding the FDA reform bill, the Senate resume consideration \nof the Interior appropriations bill until the cloture vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I do not \nobject to moving the vote to 12:15 today. I understand the leader wants \nto get to the Interior appropriations bill. I do not want to unduly \ndelay that provision. However, it says under the proposal, ``I ask \nconsent that following the debate this morning regarding the FDA reform \nbill, that the Senate resume * * *.'' We would like to have at least a \nlimited period of time. I know the Senator from Iowa wanted to speak. I \nwas wondering if we can at least get a half hour debate on the FDA \nreform bill before finishing. It says here, ``I further ask consent \nthat following the debate this morning,'' I was wondering whether \n``following the debate'' could go until 10:30?\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, under the circumstances, I reserve the right \nto object since an additional proposal has been made here. Can I \ninquire of the Senator from Massachusetts exactly what he is proposing \nto add here?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator from Iowa wanted to be heard on a matter. I \nwanted to speak just briefly to clarify the record. I was wondering if \nwe can divide  that  time  between  now  and 10:30--we took up some of \nthe time between 9:30 and 10 for debate and discussion--and then go to \nInterior.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, further reserving the right to object, we \nare moving at this time to accommodate one of our Senators who has a \nhealth problem right now. It does disrupt the whole schedule. We have \nwork we need to do on Interior appropriations. If we delay it further \nand then come back to it and have to go off it at 12:15, it just \nconfuses and complicates the whole process.\n\n[[Page S9363]]\n\n  We have asked the managers of the Interior appropriations bill--now \nwe have interrupted them--to come to the floor. They are scheduled to \nbe on the floor. I know the Senator from Iowa is working to try and get \nan amendment included. I feel confident that will be done at some \npoint. At this time, I have to object to the expansion of the unanimous \nconsent request that was offered by the Senator from Massachusetts and \nsupport the request that was made by the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, under those circumstances and to \naccommodate the Member, I will not press this, although I do think we \nwill have an opportunity to address these issues later in the morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/16/senate-section/article/S9360-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9363-S9375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  1998\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the Interior \nappropriations bill.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2107) making appropriations for the Department \n     of the Interior and related agencies for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 1998.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Pending:\n\n       Ashcroft amendment No. 1188 (to committee amendment \n     beginning on page 96, line 12 through page 97, line 8) to \n     eliminate funding for programs and activities carried out by \n     the National Endowment for the Arts.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, just so we will be clear what we have agreed \nto, Senator Gorton and the other manager of the bill will be here to, \nagain, further debate amendments on the Interior appropriations bill. \nThey have been good partners on this appropriations bill and have \nworked out some of the areas where there have been disagreements, but \nthere will be amendments and, I presume, votes throughout the day on a \nnumber of issues, including the National Endowment for the Arts issue, \nperhaps on some mining issues. I understand perhaps the Senator from \nArkansas has an amendment.\n  But we need to make progress on the Interior appropriations bill \nbecause we hope to finish it tonight or tomorrow and then go to FDA at \nsome point. I hope we can work out a reasonable agreement where we can \ncomplete the debate on the Food and Drug Administration reform bill, \nand we hope to then pretty quickly, either late this week or early next \nweek, go to the District of Columbia appropriations bill. That would be \nthe 13th and last appropriations bill that we would have to deal with \nthis session, and then we could focus the rest of next week and the \nnext week on adopting conference reports to the appropriations bills. \nWe will need to move them very quickly. It will be my intent to try and \nhold time and focus on getting those conference reports agreed to.\n  I appreciate the cooperation of all Senators as we try to accommodate \none of our most beloved Senators who has a problem this morning, and we \nwill begin with the Interior appropriations momentarily. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we are now on the Interior appropriations \nbill once again. I believe that the first vote on that bill will be on \nthe Ashcroft-Helms amendment to strike the appropriation for the \nNational Endowment for the Arts. There has been discussion of several \nother amendments relating to that endowment. I believe it appropriate \nto continue that debate until the cloture vote at noon. I know that the \nmajority leader hopes, and I hope, that shortly after we get back on \nthe Interior appropriations bill, after our FDA vote, that we will \nbegin to vote on amendments relating to the National Endowment for the \nArts. In any event, that is the subject at the present time. I invite \nall Members who are interested in any of the amendments on the National \nEndowment for the Arts to come to the floor and speak on that subject \nbetween now and noon.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, is time controlled?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to rise in support of the bill which \nhas been brought forth by the Senator from Washington. I think he has \ndone an extraordinary job in developing this appropriations language in \nthis bill relative to the Interior and various departments which the \nInterior impacts. I especially want to thank him for his sensitivity \nrelative to the Northeast.\n  There is a different view in this country between the Northeast and \nthe West on a number of issues that involve land conservation and the \nquestion especially of protecting lands, public lands. In the \nNortheast, especially in northern New England, we are still struggling \nwith the fact that we would like to protect some additional lands. We \nhave a spectacular place called the White Mountain National Forest in \nNew Hampshire, and it is the most visited national forest in the \ncountry. In fact, it receives more visitors per year than Yellowstone, \nwhich is a national park. It is under tremendous pressures from popular \nuse because it is so close to the megalopolis of New York, Boston, and \nWashington.\n  It is an extraordinary place, but to maintain it and to maintain its \ncharacter, it requires that we continue to address some of the \ninholding issues around the national forest, and the Senator from the \nWest has been sensitive to the Senators from the East on this point. I \nthank very much the Senator from Washington for his sensitivity in \nallowing us to go forward in this bill and complete the purchase of a \nvery critical piece of land called Lake Tarleton in New Hampshire.\n  In addition, he has assisted us in a number of other areas in this \nbill, and I thank him for it.\n  I also want to talk about a position that has been brought forward in \nthis bill relative to the National Endowment for the Arts, because I \nthink the Senator from Washington has reached the appropriate balance \nin the language which he has put in this bill relative to the National \nEndowment for the Arts.\n  The National Endowment for the Arts, as we all know, has been a \nlightning rod of controversy, especially on the House side, less so on \nour side of the aisle, because of some of the things that the Endowment \nover the years has funded, which have been mistakes, to say the least.\n  But the fact is that there is a role, in my opinion, it is a limited \nrole, but there is a role for the Federal Government and for State \ngovernments in the area of assisting the arts in this country.\n  Arts are an expression of the culture of a country or a nation, an \nexpression of the attitude, personality, and the strength of a nation. \nThe ability to have a vibrant arts community in a nation is critical, I \nbelieve, to the good health and the good education of a nation.\n  The Federal role, in participating in this, should be one of an \nincubator. The Federal role should be one as the starter of the \ninitiatives. And the dollars which are put in this bill for the \npurposes of assisting the NEA and the Humanities Council are just \nthat--they are startup dollars.\n  Essentially, these dollars multiply two times, three times, sometimes \nfive times their basic number.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GREGG. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Arkansas for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. The Senator explained some, I think, valid points \nconcerning the role of our Government support for the arts. My question \nconcerns the very, very high administrative costs that the National \nEndowment has experienced, approaching 20 cents on the dollar in \nadministration, and the fact that the distribution of the funds from \nthe National Endowment have gone primarily to very few cities in the \ncountry. In fact, I think one-third of all of the direct grants go to \nsix cities in the United States. And the fact is that the Whitney \nMuseum in\n\n[[Page S9364]]\n\none exhibit received $400,000, received as much as the entire State of \nArkansas last year.\n  So my question is, if we are to continue a Government role in funding \nthe arts, would it not be better to eliminate the National Endowment, \nblock grant those funds directly to the States, cutting out the 20 \npercent in administrative costs and the inequities in the funding \nformulas for the funding decisions of the National Endowment--and of \ncourse I have offered an amendment that would do exactly that--and \nprovide 45 of the 50 States with more money for the arts than they \ncurrently receive under the status quo approach that we find in this \nbill?\n  Mr. GREGG. That is a good question. I think it is one of the \nquestions which we need to answer as we go forward with this bill. And \nthere are a number of amendments--I think the Senator has one; and I \nbelieve there are other Senators who are offering them--as to the \nproper allocation of the dollars between the States and between the \nNational Arts Council which administers the Federal moneys.\n  But if I can come back to that point, I want to talk generally about \nthe need for Government support of the arts; and then in the allocation \narea I would like to come back to that. Because I think, first, we have \nto reach a consensus that there is a need for any dollars in the arts \ncommunity to come from the Federal Government or from the State \ngovernments, and that consensus is a long way from being reached. \nCertainly on the House side they appear to be very resistant to that.\n  My view is, as I was saying earlier, that there is a need for the \nFederal Government to play a role as basically the initiator of arts \nactivities, as the incubator that allows the multiplier to occur that \ncreates funding for the arts.\n  As Governor of New Hampshire I had the same issue before me as to \nwhether or not the State government should be involved in funding the \narts. And at a time when we were having the most severe recession \nprobably ever in the history of the State of New Hampshire, \nregrettably, and we were having to curtail our funding in a variety of \nareas and cut them back dramatically, I maintained the arts funding, in \nfact increased it a little bit in the State because I felt strongly \nthat, first, it gave definition and it gave a way of viewing our \nculture that was critical and, second, it also had a very positive \nimpact, especially in New Hampshire, on our tourist industry.\n  The arts--performing arts especially; but all forms of arts--go hand \nin hand, at least in New Hampshire, with the ability of the tourist \nindustry, which happens to be our largest employer, to be a successful \nand vibrant industry.\n  So there is an economic benefit of significant proportions to having \na strong arts community. The investment which the State or the Federal \nGovernment makes in the arts community pays back not only in the way of \ngetting more people involved in the arts, getting more schoolchildren \ninvolved in the arts, getting more parents involved with their kids in \nthe arts, but also in the manner of producing economic activity which \nis fairly significant.\n  The Senator from Arkansas has raised a very legitimate issue. I know \nhis amendment raised this issue, an issue I raised in committee as a \nmember of the authorizing committee. I sit on both the authorizing \ncommittee and have the good fortune to work with the Senator from \nWashington on the Appropriations Committee. But he has raised the \nissue, what is the proper allocation here? I think that is proper for \ndebate. How much of the money should be retained with the central arts \nplanning here in Washington and how much should go out to the States?\n  I have always felt a larger percentage should go out to the States \nbecause I think that you get more benefit for the dollars spent at the \nState level. Therefore, a change in the formula would be something that \nI might well be amenable to. I have actually proposed such changes in \ncommittee. But I do think there is also a role, and I do not happen to \nbelieve we should eliminate a central arts council that manages a \npercentage of the dollars out of Washington.\n  Why is that? Basically because there are a number of national efforts \nwhich do transcend State lines which need to get their funding out of a \nnational fund as versus out of a State fund.\n  For example, I believe the No. 1 item chosen by the NEA this year to \nfund--they have a competition obviously and, unfortunately, sometimes \nthey choose some really poor ideas--but the No. 1 item that was agreed \nto on their list was to bring back out of mothballs the Egyptian \nexhibit which is now owned by the Brooklyn Museum. This is one of the \nmost expansive exhibits of Egyptian art and artifacts in the world. It \nis competitive with the English collection and not completely \ncompetitive but certainly representative of even the collections in \nCairo.\n  These items had been sort of put in storage and collecting dust. Now \nthe Brooklyn Museum has decided to bring them back. And I believe they \nare taking this around the country. It will be exceptionally \neducational for a large number of schoolchildren who participate in \nseeing this exhibit. It will be a national effort. That is the type of \ninitiative that really should be supported from the national level as \nversus having to be absorbed by, for example, the State of New York \nwhich will obviously benefit from this exhibit but actually the whole \ncountry will benefit from it because it is going to travel around the \ncountry. There are other items, yes, that obviously are of a national \nnature and, yes, most of those institutions which are of a national \nnature, whether it be the New York Symphony or some sort of major \nproposal in Chicago or Los Angeles are centered in your major urban \nareas. That is just a fact of life. They are centered there for a \nvariety of reasons and, therefore, those major urban areas do get a \ndisproportionate amount of the national share of the NEA funding.\n\n  But that is inevitably going to the happen that way as long as you \nhave a national program that is trying to move these various cultural \nactivities across the country. You are going to have to have a place \nwhere they are located where they start. The Boston Pops is in Boston, \nbut it certainly has an impact across the country. Therefore, the main \nart centers of this Nation--and they do happen to be in your major \nurban areas--are always going to receive a disproportionate amount of \nthe funds. So that does not bother me so much.\n  What I do think is legitimate is the question of the proper \nallocation between the funds going to the National Endowment for the \nArts versus going to the States. I do think we can take another look at \nthat formula. I know the Senator from Arkansas is going to make a very \naggressive and effective point for restructuring that formula, for \nrestructuring the entire institution.\n  I look forward to hearing his position on this. But I did want to \nmake these initial comments first in support of the overall bill which \nI think the Senator from Washington has done an extraordinarily good \njob on and, second, in support of the basic thrust of his proposals \nrelative to the endowments which are going to be the most controversial \nitems I guess we will be hearing about on the floor. I yield back my \ntime.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Just responding to some of the comments of my colleague concerning \nthe National Endowment for the Arts and the need to preserve and \nmaintain that national entity, I think that if the record is examined, \nas it has been examined by the General Accounting Office and the \ninspector general's office, that the record of the National Endowment \nis not only deplorable but fails to justify its continued funding and \ncontinued existence.\n  The issue of whether or not the Government plays a role in funding \nfor the arts aside, the best means of providing the limited funding, \nthe $100 million approximately that has been appropriated for arts this \nyear directly in the NEA, I think is clear that that money would best \nbe used by eliminating the existence of the National Endowment and \nallowing the funds to flow directly to the Governors, to the various \nStates for distribution to those programs and those projects and those \nartists within the States that are most deserving.\n  In fact, the notion that we are better off with a national endowment \nthat\n\n[[Page S9365]]\n\nfunds six States disproportionately, that funds certain congressional \ndistricts and certain States disproportionately, cannot be validated \nand cannot continue to be justified.\n  We have a General Accounting Office report indicating that the \nadministrative costs of the NEA, at almost 20 cents on the dollar, is \nhigher than most other Federal agencies, much, much higher than the \nNational Endowment for the Humanities.\n  The mission statement for the National Endowment is simply that they \nare to broaden access to the arts. In effect, they are mandated to \nprovide arts to underserved areas in this country. Yet, if you look at \nwhere the National Endowment today is sending those funds, it in no way \ncorresponds to the mission that they have been given by this Congress \nto serve those areas which are, if you will, culturally deprived or who \nhave less access to these arts programs.\n  Six cities getting over one-third of the direct grants from the NEA \ncannot be justified. When we had--and the chairman is on the floor this \nmorning--our hearing on the National Endowment in April, and Jane \nAlexander came in and testified before us, I questioned her as to why, \nin view of the mission of the NEA to provide arts for underserved \nareas, in view of that mission, why, out of 12 grant proposals from the \nState of Arkansas last year, was only 1 approved and the Arkansas Arts \nCouncil got approximately $400,000 last year. That equates to little \nmore than many grants for single exhibits across this country.\n  Her answer was that it is only in certain select States that we find \nthe environment such to foster the arts. And she gave the analogy of \ngrowing apples. She said, apples grow everywhere, but there are certain \nareas of the country in which they are more productive. I think the \nimplication that there are parts of this country that do not have \npotential artists, there are parts of this country that among their \npopulations do not have those ready to blossom into writers and \nsculptors and authors, I think, is the very epitome of the elitism that \nthe American people find so offensive by the National Endowment.\n  So to my colleagues who believe that there is an important role that \nthe Government plays in subsidizing and supporting arts, to those of my \ncolleagues who feel very adamantly that we must show our support to \nculture and to the arts in general in this country by providing some \nseed money, I ask you to consider the possibility that we would be far \nbetter off eliminating the controversial and I think indefensible \nactions of the National Endowment, eliminate the NEA as it has \ntraditionally existed, and allow that appropriation, exactly the same \namount of money, the $100 million to be sent directly to the States on \nthis basis: A $500,000 grant to every State, $200,000 to every \nterritory, the remainder of the appropriation to be distributed on a \nstrictly per capita basis.\n  I ask you, could anything be more fair than that? If we took that \nsimple formula, and we said that there will only be 1 percent spent for \nadministrative costs on the Federal level, that the Department of \nTreasury can spend no more than $1 million to write those checks, and \nthat the State arts councils or the State legislatures or the Governors \ncan spend no more than 15 percent in overhead, that if we adopt that \nsimple formula, the result is that 45 of the 50 States will come out \nahead, that 45 of the 50 States will have more resources to fund arts \nin their States than under the current status quo which this bill, with \nall due respect, maintains.\n  I simply ask my colleagues in the Senate, how can we, with a straight \nface, no matter which side we are on on the concept of whether the \nGovernment ought to be involved in the arts, how can we, with a \nstraight face, face our constituents and say, we are going to defend 20 \npercent administrative costs, we are going to defend one-third of the \ngrants going to six cities, we are going to defend three-fourths of the \ngrants going to congressional districts represented by Democrats?\n  I just want to tell you, Mr. President, I do not believe those \ncongressional districts represented by Democrats in this country are \nintrinsically less cultured or more culturally deprived or in more need \nof those arts grants than those congressional districts that happen to \nbe represented by Republicans. Yet there has been a clear bias, with 75 \ncents out of every $1 going to congressional districts represented by \nDemocrats.\n  It has been very selective funding by a group of elitists in \nWashington, bureaucrats in Washington, who make themselves the arbiters \nof what is good art and what is culture and where it should be funded.\n  So I say consider an option that would say we will end the National \nEndowment, we will block grant the money to the States on a fair, fair, \nfair formula based upon the resident population. The result is that 45 \nStates are going to have more money for the arts, more money to help \nthe local writer, more money to go to the schools for education \nprograms in the arts, more money to help that struggling artist who may \nnot have an opportunity and may not happen to live in the six blessed \ncities that have been honored by the NEA with over one-third of the \ngrants.\n  So when this amendment is debated and when this amendment is voted \non, I trust later today, I ask my colleagues to look at that breakdown, \nto look at that chart, and to consider the fact that their State will \ncome out ahead, that their Governor, their State legislature, or their \nState arts council will have more money to support their local efforts \nthan under the status quo.\n  Remember that we are not responsible to a few culture elitists. We \nare responsible to our constituents in our States for how those limited \nresources are spent and how we can support the arts. I believe it is \nfair. I believe it is equitable. I believe it makes eminent common \nsense. If we will just break out of our lock that the status quo has \nheld over us in the disproportionate influence that this group at the \nNEA has had in this Congress and consider that there might be a better \nway, then I think the moral high ground is certainly on behalf of this \namendment. I ask my colleagues to support it later today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If the Senator from Arkansas has a minute, I would like \nto ask a question or two about this subject. I certainly support him in \nhis effort.\n  I believe it was Senator Helms yesterday who talked about substantial \ngrants being given to Harvard University, which has an endowment of \nover $6 billion, I believe, and Yale University. Does the Senator know \nif those figures are correct? Are there universities, let me ask, in \nArkansas who could use funding from the National Endowment for the Arts \nequally as those great universities?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Senator from Alabama for his question and \nthank him for his support and cosponsorship of this amendment.\n  My answer is an unequivocal yes, that is accurate; the incidents that \nSenator Helms cited, to my knowledge, are accurate. And I secondly \nanswer your question by saying, yes, there are many institutions in \nArkansas very interested in the arts, very interested in promoting the \narts within the State of Arkansas, many that have a great relationship \nwith the local schools and foster arts education in those local schools \nwho would rejoice at having additional funds.\n  The State of Arkansas would more than double what would be available \nfor arts in the State of Arkansas by going to the block grant approach.\n  Senator Gregg, commenting earlier, was defending the distribution of \nthese funds to a few select cities--one-third of all grants going to \nsix cities. I say that many of those institutions currently receiving \ngrants, like the Boston Symphony or like the Metropolitan Opera, are \nvery well endowed, have very high annual incomes, have a huge base of \nsupport, and are less needy and less dependent upon any kind of Federal \nhelp than, say, the University of Arkansas or the University of Central \nArkansas, or the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, or the many \nother fine institutions in Arkansas that would be able to work with our \nlocal schools and the Arkansas Arts Council, which received just a \nlittle over $400,000 last year. That was all the State of Arkansas \nreceived. The Whitney Museum by itself received almost as much as the \nState of Arkansas, and if I am correct, I believe the State of Alabama \nwas in a similar dilemma.\n\n[[Page S9366]]\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Whitney funding almost matched the entire funding of \nthe State of Alabama. It is a concern.\n  We have one of the finest Shakespeare festivals in the world. As a \nmatter of fact, the Shakespeare theater in Montgomery is well renowned, \nand people have contributed very heavily of themselves. The former \nPostmaster General Winton Blount had gone beyond the call of duty in \nhelping create this facility. We only got $15,000 for that premier, \nworld-class facility that is supported substantially by the gifts of \nlocal residents.\n  Let me ask you, if the money came to the State, would they be able if \nthey so chose to give more money to the Shakespeare theater in \nMontgomery? Would they be able to do that?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. That, of course, is the whole concept behind our \namendment--local control. Send the money back to the States, the \nGovernors, the State legislatures, and the State arts council would \nhave the discretion to increase funding.\n  In the case of Alabama, and I do not have the exact numbers in front \nof me, but the amount of resources available to the State of Alabama \nwould be greatly enhanced under the block grants approach in which we \nsend a $500,000 grant to every State, and then simply distribute it on \na per capita basis. That would allow the State of Alabama to give much \nmore to the Shakespearean theater.\n  I was interested to hear your comments yesterday quoting Anthony \nHopkins and his appreciation for that Shakespeare theater there in \nMontgomery.\n  So the needed resources would be much more available, and that would \nbe controlled locally. So insomuch as there was local support in \nAlabama for increased funding, I think the opportunity would be much \nenhanced.\n  Frankly, I am puzzled why anyone would oppose the approach that you \nand I are offering. I can understand the 5 States that would lose \nfunding being opposed to this, but the 45 States and the Senators from \nthe 45 States that would see their funding for the arts increased under \nour approach while eliminating bureaucracy in Washington, it is really \ndifficult for me to see how someone objects to that.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Let me ask the Senator this, and this is something I \nthink we failed to think enough about, Mr. President. This money that \nis being spent in our States, the decision of where and how to spend \nthat money primarily is being decided by a group of people in \nWashington. Under this procedure not only will 45 States have more \nmoney--correct me if I am wrong--45 States will have more money, but \nthey will also have more control and be able to make the decisions that \nthey feel would be the best use of that money; is that correct?\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Senator Sessions, you are exactly right. One of the \nareas that this Republican-controlled Congress has pushed for most \nstrongly has been local control. In welfare reform, in a whole host of \nareas, we said, ``Let's flow that power back out of Washington, back to \nthe States.''\n  There is no better example, I think, of where we could do that than \nin the area of the arts. We not only have a 20-percent overhead that we \nare paying just by having this bureaucracy of almost 150 employees \ndispensing this money, but we have a small group that makes decisions \non what will be funded across this country, if you will, making \nthemselves the arbiters of what is good art, and the control of our \nconstituents is minimized because of the distance, the inability to \nreally affect the decisions that are made.\n  So, yes, I think the citizens of Alabama, the citizens of my home \nState of Arkansas, will have much greater input dealing with the \nArkansas Arts Council or the Alabama Legislature, or the Governor's \noffice than trying to affect the decisions that are made in Washington, \nDC, by a select group.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I understand one of the grants that was reported \nyesterday went to Philipps Academy, one of the most exclusive private \nprep schools, I think, in America. That is what I understood the \nreference to be. Do you think there are schools, public schools, \nthroughout Arkansas and Alabama and other States in this Nation that \nwould also likewise be able to make a claim for this money? And are any \nof those receiving any moneys from the National Endowment for the Arts \nin Arkansas and Alabama? In Alabama no private or public schools are \nreceiving money as happened in the Northeast.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I believe those local schools in rural communities \nacross our States and all across this country have a much more \nlegitimate claim to those funds than where those funds have gone under \nthe current status quo of the NEA.\n  I grew up in a town with a population, when I lived there, of 894. I \ncan remember in junior high school it being one of the great thrills \nwhen we were able to take a field trip 40 miles to the University of \nArkansas and watch a Shakespearean play. That is the first time I had \never seen a Shakespearean play.\n  Those kind of opportunities to the small communities of this country \nwould be increased so much if we eliminated the Washington bureaucracy \nand allowed that money to flow back to the States.\n  The objectionable art, Senator Sessions, that you cited yesterday, \nthat Senator Helms spent a great deal of time on, that has \ncharacterized much of the debate around the NEA in recent years--if a \nlocal arts council, the State arts council, or State legislature or \nGovernor made a decision to fund something that the mass of the people \nfound highly objectionable, I guarantee you they will be more \nresponsible in that State legislature or that State arts council, or \nthat Governor will be far more responsive to the complaints of the \npeople than a faraway bureaucracy in Washington, DC, in some ivory \ntower making those decisions.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I agree with that and I support this \nbill wholeheartedly.\n  I had an outstanding conversation with the three leaders and \ndirectors of three orchestras in Alabama. They are concerned about \nfunding. They need the little funding that we do get. It helps them. \nThey do not want to lose that. I can understand that. I asked them if \nwe could come up with a way that will leave the bureaucracy and put \nmore money in your hand, with more freedom to spend it as you wish, \nwould you support that? And they said, yes, of course they would.\n  I know some people believe and have committed themselves to \nsupporting the National Endowment for the Arts, but the truth is it is \nnot performing in a good and healthy way, it is not doing a good job of \nputting money to the arts, it is not invigorating the arts and \nproviding leadership for an enhancement of the good and beautiful and \nfine in America. Too often, it is, in fact, participating in a \ndegradation of the quality of art in America.\n  What we need to do is make sure it is done right. I believe the \npeople at the Alabama Arts Council, the arts councils in the other \nStates around this country, if given the opportunity, would spend that \nmoney wisely. They would be much less likely to give it to the arcane, \nthe pornographic, the bizarre, and the just plain silly that is so \noften happening today. It is just not acceptable.\n  It is time for this body to follow through. It is time for this body, \nafter years of begging and pleading with the National Endowment for the \nArts to do a better job to manage their money better, to put an end to \nit and make sure that what we do actually supports the arts in an \neffective way. That is why I support this amendment.\n  I am so proud of the Senator from Arkansas for his outstanding work \non it, the Senator from Michigan, Senator Abraham, and the Senator from \nWyoming, Senator Enzi, for their outstanding teamwork in putting this \nproposal together, which is a win-win situation for all America. It \nputs more money in the arts, and it will eliminate waste, bureaucracy, \nand silly funding projects.\n  I think it is a good bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to use just a few moments this \nmorning to talk about this appropriations bill that is pending before \nthe Senate and two projects under the Land and Water Conservation Fund \nthat the distinguished chairman, Senator Slade Gorton, had put into the \nbill but subjected them to prior authorization: The so-called \nHeadwaters acquisition in California which could cost $250 million; is \nthat correct, Senator Gorton?\n\n[[Page S9367]]\n\n  Mr. GORTON. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And the so-called New World Mine in Montana, which is \nan effort to acquire a mine before it is mined. That is in Montana. I \nbelieve it would cost $65 million.\n  Now, I am not here on the floor of the Senate to tell the Senate that \nthese projects are good, should be done, or should not be done. But I \nam here to tell them absolutely and unequivocally that if the \nadministration, through whatever source, is telling Senators that the \nbudget agreement reflected that these projects should be funded, I am \nhere to tell the Senate that is not true.\n  Now, if the administration wants to say these are their high-priority \nitems, which they have told the distinguished chairman, they are free \nto do that. In fact, they are free to do anything. Let me tell you that \nin the ritual and integrity of the agreement, they have spoken about \nthese projects and some others. But we did not agree how the $700 \nmillion in new money that we included in this budget agreement should \nbe spent. So one would say, well, how should it be spent? Well, \nobviously, it was to be spent in a typical manner of spending money out \nof the land and water conservation fund. Congress and the White House \nhave to work together to decide what they want to do. There is no \npriority treatment in this budget arrangement in any way, shape, or \nform.\n  Now, what I would like to do just visually for everyone so that they \nwill understand. I have before me and I am holding up an agreement \ncalled the bipartisan budget agreement, May 15, 1997. Now, it is \nhistoric. Nothing like this has ever been done in the history of the \nSenate, where the leadership from the Senate and House signed an \nagreement with the White House to do things in a budget. In this \nagreement, if you look at it, from its 1st page until its 24th page, \nand two attached letters relevant to taxes, you will not find the names \nof these two acquisitions--Headwaters Forest or the New World Mine--\nmentioned. It is not in this agreement. Now, one might say, does it \nhave to be? Yes. If it is a priority item that negotiators agreed would \nbe done, it is in this agreement. If anybody wants to look at it, they \ncan do so.\n  Mr. GORTON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. GORTON. But I take it, Mr. President, that the $700 million for \nthe land and water conservation fund is, in fact, in that agreement, is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, I am going to turn to that right now. It is in \nthe agreement. Anybody who wants to look at it can look at page 19. \nThere is a chart in here that says what this fund is about. \nEssentially, it says that we have decided that $700 million can be set \naside, at the option of the Congress, to be used for land acquisition, \nand a budget flow even shows how it will be spent. And the language \nsays the $700 million, if spent for priority Federal land acquisition, \ncan be done in excess of the caps for discretionary spending. That is \nwhy the U.S. House did not even put it in their appropriations bill, \nbecause there is nothing in this agreement that mandates it. It says \nthat if you include $700 million for land acquisition, then when you \nspend it, the budget credits it to the appropriations committee.\n  Mr. GORTON. But I ask the Senator from New Mexico, there is nothing \nthere that mentions any specific project?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I assumed everybody would be looking at the agreement. \nYou are correct. Verbally, I state there are three footnotes, there are \ntwo charts, and nowhere in that do these two projects appear. They are \nnot mentioned.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, I want to tell you one other thing. The two \ninstruments that judge our budget responsibility, vis-a-vis the \nPresident, what have we agreed to do with our President--frankly, they \nare not enforceable and everybody knows that, but we have agreed to do \nit. Might I say that this chairman, Senator Slade Gorton, has taken the \nagreements that are stated and he has followed them. As a matter of \nfact, one found on page 24 of the agreement and is also in the budget \nresolution, which I will talk to in a moment, was approximately a $74 \nmillion increase for Indian tribal priority allocation funding. Senator \nGorton had a meeting and asked, ``Is that a priority agreement that we \nagreed with?'' I said, ``Yes.'' He said, ``So it will be funded.'' Is \nthat not right?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Now, the only other instrument that has anything \nwhatsoever to do with implementing this 24-page historic agreement is \nthe budget resolution itself because what we chose to do is to put in \nthe budget resolution the priority requirements of this agreement. So \nthat if you look at page 23 of the budget resolution, you find a \ndescription of the $700 million for land acquisitions and exchanges, \nbut no mention of any single project--not a single project mentioned. \nIt merely states very precisely what I told the Senate 4 minutes ago \nwhen I said how the $700 million was to be set up. That is what it \nsays.\n  But conversely, throughout this agreement, throughout this budget \nresolution, when we have agreed on a specific program in this \nagreement, it is found in this resolution. So, Senator, if you want to \nlook at this agreement and say, what did the Congress and the President \nsay about Head Start, that might be a question you could put to me. I \nwould say that we agreed in this agreement that Head Start was a \npriority. Lo and behold, you will find in the budget resolution that \nHead Start, in the function on education, is listed, and guess what? \nThe dollar amount that we agreed upon is in the budget resolution.\n  Now, frankly, I think it is absolutely patent that had we agreed to \nthese two projects--and I repeat that I am not sure how I will vote \nwhen we really have them before us in a proper mode. I am not sure how \nI will vote in the committee that authorizes them. But the pure \nsimplicity of what I have just explained would say that if we agreed to \nthese two projects, you would find them in one of these agreements. In \nfact, if you found them in the 24-page agreement, you would find them \nin the function of the budget that funds these kinds of projects, and \nthey would be stated there. Now, I note the chairman is on the floor \nwith a question. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. GORTON. So, I ask the Senator from New Mexico, then the bill that \nI drafted and is being debated on the floor here today regarding \nappropriations for the Department of the Interior includes both the \n$700 million for the land and water conservation fund and a specific \nmention and, therefore, a degree of priority, for the New World Mine \nand for the California redwood purchase; this bill, in fact, goes \nbeyond and is more specific than the budget agreement itself, is that \nnot correct?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No question. But you might say, in this respect, it is \ncontemplated that if the Congress, and thus the Senate as the \ninitiator, at some point in time wanted to implement the $700 million \nfund, they would at some time have to decide what they are going to \nspend it on. At that point in time, however they decided, the White \nHouse and Congress would engage in a political dialog in the normal \nway, with each having its strengths; namely, a vote here, and namely, \nthe President says I don't want it, do it another way; that is typical. \nThat would be envisioned as part of how you would decide how to spend \nit.\n  Mr. GORTON. And so when the chairman of the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources, the Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski], chairing \nthe committee on which, incidentally, each of us serves as well, states \nthat he has a number of questions about the very complicated \ntransactions for these two projects proposed by the President and \nwishes to deal with those in the normal course of authorizing \nlegislation, he, the Senator from Alaska, in the view of the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, is taking a quite reasonable position?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. As a matter of fact, the budget agreement doesn't say \nwhether he should authorize them or not authorize them. The budget \nagreement speaks of allocating this money to this committee. But as I \nsaid, it does not prescribe the spending of the money in this committee \non these projects. That is a legislative matter to be dealt with with \nthe executive branch in the normal relationship that we have on \nspending money. It seems to me that the last thing that makes\n\n[[Page S9368]]\n\nthis argument most rational is that if you didn't put the $700 million \nin at all, there could not be a letter sent around saying ``you \nviolated the budget agreement.''\n\n  As a matter of fact, the letter being sent by the administration--\nfrankly, I want everybody to know I am trying desperately to get \neverybody to comply with the budget agreement. We are not complying in \nevery respect. Nobody is finding this Senator running around saying you \ndon't have to. Maybe others are, but I am not. Frankly, when the \nadministration, under letter of September 11, a statement of \nadministration policy, on the first page of that communication, it \nsays: ``In addition, the committee bill contains provisions that \nviolate the Bipartisan Budget Agreement, such as the provision to \nrequire additional unnecessary authorizing language for key land \nacquisition in Montana and California.''\n  It urges the Senate to strike that. They can urge that we strike it, \nbut we are not striking it because it violates the budget agreement; we \nmay or may not do it for some other reason. So, Senator, I wanted to \ncome down here and make sure, since many Senators have stopped me and \nasked me if we agreed to these two projects, my answer is no.\n  Now, are we forbidden from agreeing upon them and the $700 million to \nbe used for them? Absolutely not. You are not disagreeing with that. As \na matter of fact, you spend it. But you are saying that before we spend \nit we want to see what the authorizing committees say about that. I \nbelieve, to assume that you cannot authorize a project for the land and \nwater conservation fund, which would give its resources from the $700 \nmillion, is arguing an uncertainty. I mean, that can't be. We never \nsaid anything about that. Congress retained that right. Anything we \ndidn't agree upon, the Congress can do. It is just that they can't do \nanything inconsistent with it.\n  I could go on, Senator, but I think the Senate will take my word that \nif you look at the agreement and find specifics that are priorities, \nyou will find them in the budget resolution, which this Senate passed \noverwhelmingly. Theres a lot of things in it that Senators said they \ndidn't know were in it. That is not my fault. I will tell you that \nspecifics like Head Start and specifics like a new program for literacy \nare found in the agreement as priorities, and they are found in the \nresolution--resolved that--priorities such as these shall be funded to \nthe extent of so many million dollars.\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator from New Mexico believes, under those \ncircumstances, we are obligated to keep our part of the agreement?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator from New Mexico feels that if we don't \nfollow those, that a letter like this one from the administration, \nunder cover of September 11, could clearly say this bill does not fund \na priority item that was agreed upon. Therefore, it violates the budget \nagreement. I would not be here saying the correspondence is inaccurate, \nincorrect. It would be wrong. In this case, it is not.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I just ask the Senator, because I don't intend to speak \nlonger and clutter the Record unnecessarily, but would he think I \nshould make the bipartisan agreement a part of the Record?\n  Mr. GORTON. Why don't you make the relevant page of the bipartisan \nagreement a part of the Record.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that page 19 of \nthe agreement between the executive branch and the Congress be printed \nin the Record for purposes of showing how the priority land acquisition \nwas described on the page of the agreement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                       Environmental reserve fund\n\n               [Outlay increases in millions of dollars]\n\nOrphan share spending:\n    1998............................................................200\n    1999............................................................200\n    2000............................................................200\n    2001............................................................200\n    2002............................................................200\n    5-Year Spending...............................................1,000\n    10-Year Spending..............................................2,028\n\nThe proposal would provide new mandatory spending for orphan shares at \nSuperfund hazardous waste cleanup sites. Orphan shares are portions of \nfinancial liability at Superfund sites allocated to non-Federal parties \nwith limited or no ability to pay.\nThe funds will be reserved for this purpose based on the assumption of \na policy agreement on orphan share spending.\n\n\n            Priority Federal land acquisitions and exchanges\n\n               [Outlay increases in millions of dollars]\n\nPriority Federal Land Acquisitions and Exchanges:\n    1998............................................................300\n    1999............................................................150\n    2000............................................................150\n    2001............................................................100\n    2002...............................................................\n    5-Year Spending.................................................700\n    10-Year Spending................................................700\n\nUnder this proposal, up to $315 million would be available from the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) to finalize priority Federal \nland exchanges in FY 1998 and FY 1999.\nFunding from the LWCF for other high priority Federal land acquisitions \nand exchanges (totaling $385 million) would be available in fiscal \nyears 1999 through 2001.\nThe funding will be allocated to function 3000 as a reserve fund \nexclusively for this purpose.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I don't choose to put the budget resolution in the \nRecord because it was adopted. I assume if anybody wants to refer to \nany changes on education or to find specifics on the crime section \nwhere we obligated funds for the FBI, et cetera, I assume you can look \nin the budget resolution and find it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I have not heard every speech on the \nquestion of the National Endowment for the Arts. I know about the \nprincipal amendments. Frankly, the amendments that most intrigue me are \nthose that propose for block grant. I am not sure I am going to vote \nfor anything that provides for a block grant, based on what I know \nabout the proposals that are being made. But I will come back to that \nin just a moment.\n  I would like to share with my colleagues one of the reasons I am a \nstrong supporter of the National Endowment for the Arts. If I were \n``king,'' we would be putting over $1 billion a year into the program, \nmaybe more than that, because I personally feel that it provides the \nkind of cultural benefit that is not only sorely lacking in this \ncountry, but is diminishing. Mr. President, $100 million represents \none-tenth of 1 percent of our $1.6 trillion-plus budget. That is 38 \ncents for every American citizen to provide programs that enrich the \nculture of this Nation and give a lot of youngsters who would not \notherwise have the opportunity the absolute, abject joy of enjoying \nmusic, good literature, and dance.\n\n  I can tell you that no nation has ever really prospered well that \ndidn't have a culture that embraced the performing arts and the fine \narts.\n  I am sorry Mapplethorpe ever got a grant. That is the thing that set \noff the firestorm in the country, from which we have never recovered in \nthe Congress. But let me go back.\n  I grew up in Charleston, AR, with a population during the Depression \nof 851 people. The only cultural enrichment we got in that town was a \nhigh school band. It was started when I was a sophomore in high school. \nSo I took band and became a trumpet player and later became trumpet \nplayer in the University of Arkansas band as well as drum major of the \nRazorback Band--because I had learned some music in the high school \nband. I might add that we were extremely fortunate because we had an \nunusual band director, a brilliant man. He used to gather some members \nof the band at his home in the evening. We listened to great music--\nMozart, Bach, Beethoven, Sibelius--and that is when I developed, as a \nvery young teenager, a keen appreciation for symphonic music. We went \nto Jackson, MS, to a regional band contest, and our sextet won first \nplace. Not only were we learning something about good music, but we \nwere also learning something about how one builds his ego, his self-\nesteem, and his pride out of this little town.\n  So when I went to the University of Arkansas, as I said, I was in the \nband, sang in the university chorus, went to all the drama \npresentations, and then I went into the Marine Corps.\n  After the war--I told this story a couple of years ago on the floor \nof the Senate--I was waiting to come home. I was in Hawaii. One day I \nsaw a bulletin saying that anybody interested in Shakespeare should \nshow up at such and such a barracks this evening at 7 o'clock. So I \nwent. Lord knows I had\n\n[[Page S9369]]\n\nnever been exposed to Shakespeare. The man who had put the sign up and \nwho was going to teach Shakespeare turned out to be a Harvard professor \nof Shakespearean literature. He had a tape recorder. Tape recorders \nwere unheard of then. I had never seen a tape recorder, and I certainly \nhad never spoken into one, and, therefore, I didn't know what my voice \nsounded like.\n  So, after giving us about a 1-hour lecture on Shakespeare, he took \nhis tape recorder, and he said, ``I am going to deliver a couple of \nlines from Hamlet's Speech to the Players.'' He had a magnificent \nbaritone voice with that Shakespearean accent. He spoke into his \nmicrophone, ``Speak the speech, I pray you.'' And then he went on. I \ncould tell it to you now. I do not want to bore you with it. But I can \nstill remember every word of it.\n  So, when he played it back, it was so beautiful to hear this \nmellifluous voice. Then he handed it to me and said, ``Here, you do \nit.'' He put the lines in front of me, and I spoke into the tape \nrecorder. Then he played it back. I could not believe how poorly I \nspoke.\n  You know, I took a vow that evening that I did not want to sound like \nthat. I wanted to have a rich tone of voice like he had. But, more than \nanything else, I discovered that there was a lot of literature that I \nknew nothing about that could be very enriching.\n  So, I came back, and I studied diction and debate. I began, on \noccasions when I got a chance, to go to all the drama presentations. \nMost people in this audience are frustrated actors. But my point is all \nof that had such a powerful influence on my life. I daresay, if it had \nnot been for those experiences, I would have never been Governor of my \nState, and I certainly wouldn't be standing here as a U.S. Senator. \nThese are the sort of experiences that the National Endowment for the \nArts funds for so many youngsters, experiences that they would never \notherwise have.\n  When I was Governor, my wife was looking for some way to use her \nposition as First Lady to benefit the children of Arkansas. Nancy \nHanks, who was then Chairman of the National Endowment, came to \nArkansas at Betty's invitation. Betty talked Nancy Hanks into giving \nher a $50,000 grant to do a small pilot program of art in the first \ngrade. Betty had been an art major. She thought children ought to be \nexposed to art in the first grade.\n\n  So, the National Endowment, because of her appeal to Nancy Hanks, \ngave her $50,000, and she started a few programs. Today programs of \nthat sort are common. Every first grade in Arkansas has art. It is \nmandated now.\n  She had a little left over from the $50,000, so she decided she would \ntake it down to the prison and see if any of the inmates had any talent \nfor art. It was absolutely amazing how much talent the inmates had. All \nI could think about was how many of those people might not have been in \nprison if somebody had picked up on either their artistic talent or \nmaybe some musical talent that had never been explored.\n  Do you know something, Mr. President? When I became Governor of my \nState, the prisons were in such horrible condition that they were under \nthe control of the Federal courts. We couldn't do anything in the \nprisons without Federal court approval, they were so terrible. I was \nsort of hesitant to go down there. But I went. I was doing everything I \ncould to improve the condition of our prisons. You know what Winston \nChurchill said once that you can tell more about a civilization by the \nway they treat their elderly and the conditions of their prisons than \nanything else. It is a strange thing but probably true.\n  So, I started going down to have lunch with the inmates. I would \nvisit with them. I visited with the hardened killers that were on death \nrow. I can tell you, I don't believe in all my conversations with the \ninmates in the Arkansas prisons that I ever visited one who had a role \nin the senior class play in high school, who played in the band, who \nhad a college degree--though there were a few there--or who owned his \nown home. Nobody is shocked at that. We know who is in the prisons--\npeople from broken homes, people who are uneducated, and people who \nnever had a dog's chance as far as learning anything about art, \nliterature, or music.\n  I can tell you that the $100 million we spend on this program may be \nthe most productive money we spend. It is tragic that it is not at \nleast 10 times more than it is. You think about the greatest Nation on \nEarth, the United States, spending 38 cents per person per year to \nsupport the arts while Canada and France spend $32, almost 100 times \nmore per person than we do. In Germany, it is $27 per person. My \ncolleague and I share a concern. I heard his speech a moment ago. He \ncomes at it a little differently than I would. But certainly his \nargument about how much our home State gets is, in my opinion, a valid \nargument. We got about $400,000 this year. I think that in the past we \nhave gotten as much as $500,000. But, if you disbursed the $100 million \nof the National Endowment for the Arts money according to population, \nwe would get $1 million. We have 1 percent of the population of this \ncountry. We would get $1 million. We feel a little slighted.\n  But there is another dimension to it. That is, if we are going to do \nblock grants to the States, some money should be held aside for \nnational programs that serve all of the States, such as PBS, public \nbroadcasting. I see a lot of fine shows on PBS that are partially \nfunded by NEA grants. In my opinion, many of those shows would not be \nthere for all to enjoy without that funding. If you didn't have the \nNational Endowment, a lot of national programs that benefit everybody, \neven National Public Radio in Alaska and West Virginia, would not \nexist.\n  Second, the national programs that are funded by the National \nEndowment for the Arts raise an average of $12 in matching money for \nevery dollar that NEA provides. In my State, we leverage $3 in matching \nfunds for all the money you send to Arkansas. And we are proud of that.\n  So, I am not so sure that, if you put these block grants out, you are \nnot going to wind up losing a lot of matching dollars.\n  Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison from Texas has an amendment that has \nsome appeal to me. It provides 75 percent of the money in block grants. \nI think maybe 60 percent for openers would be better. So I am not \ntotally opposed to that. But I am not going to vote for any proposal to \nblock-grant money that does not carry with it a mandate for matching \nmoney. If we are going to match money, as we do in Arkansas now, $3 for \nevery $1, why not require the same of block grant recipients?\n  When you consider how much money the arts produce in this country--\nbetween $30 and $40 billion a year--and you think about how much income \ntax we collect a year from the arts, we are big winners. The $100 \nmillion is peanuts compared to the $ 3.4 billion in revenue the arts \ngenerate in this country.\n  I am not going to take much more time here. I see we have other \nspeakers wishing to speak. But there are some national programs that we \nneed to continue funding with this money. The YMCA is putting culture \nprograms in its facilities throughout the country with NEA support. \nThere are a lot of NEA-funded regional dance tours, a lot of national \ndance tours, and programs for children everywhere.\n  Incidentally, when I played in the high school band we thought we \nwere pretty good. At the bi-State band contest with Oklahoma, the Iowa \nState band performed on the stage of the Fort Smith High School. I had \nnever heard a really great band before. We only had 30 members in our \nband. Here was this Iowa State band with 150 members, and when that \nconductor brought his baton down, I thought I was going to faint. I had \nnever heard such music. So it was, the first time I ever went to a \nsymphony. I am telling you, these things are important to the culture \nof this country. I do not for the life of me understand the antipathy \nthat some of the Members of this body have for what I consider to be \nabsolutely essential and basic to the character of this country. It is \nimportant that we give a lot of citizens of this country access to the \nperforming and fine arts. That would never happen if it were not for \nthis program.\n  I look forward to the day--I will not be here, Mr. President, after \nnext year--but I yearn for the day when we treat this program with the \nrespect and the money it deserves. And, like so many other things, if \nwe do away with it and let that bulwark of our culture slip into \noblivion, we will pay a very heavy price for it.\n\n[[Page S9370]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I can only add a little bit to what the \nSenator from Arkansas has just said. I wish he would not be leaving the \nSenate. I have told him that a hundred times, but I will say it one \nmore time.\n  Mr. President, as a Senator from Minnesota, I rise in support of the \nNational Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the \nHumanities. I am troubled we are out here on the floor, again defending \nthe Federal role in really supporting the arts in communities all \nacross our country. Some of my colleagues are arguing that, with their \nblock grant proposals to States, they really support the NEA. This will \njust get the money to States in a more efficient manner, a more timely \nmanner. But these amendments do nothing more--and I think everybody \nshould be aware of this before they cast their votes--than cut off the \nlifeblood of the National Endowment for the Arts. That is exactly what \nthese amendments do. I think that is the purpose of these amendments.\n  There is a bitter irony to the timing of these amendments, because \nJane Alexander has done such an excellent job of reorganizing the \nendowment. I come to the floor to recognize her fine work and to \nsupport the NEA. When Ms. Alexander was confirmed as Chairwoman of the \nNEA, she made a commitment that she was going to work closely with the \nCongress, that she would take necessary steps to reorganize the \nEndowment, and she has done that and, as a matter of fact, I think her \neffort has been nothing short of heroic. She has, through her \nleadership, helped form and lead a NEA that touches the lives of all \ncitizens, regardless of their age, their race, their disability, their \neconomic status or, I might add, their geographic location. Jane \nAlexander has been blessed with a lifetime of creativity and \naccomplishment and she has blessed our country with that creativity. \nShe has done a marvelous job of bringing the arts into our classrooms \nand into every corner of our Nation.\n\n  Now, again we are out here having to defend the NEA. The budget is \npathetically low. We could do much more to fire the imaginations of \nchildren all across the country. Yet we have another attack on the NEA, \nout here on the floor today.\n  In my State of Minnesota, the NEA has given support to the American \nComposers Forum, the Minnesota Alliance for Arts and Education, Gray \nWolf Press, the Duluth Superior Symphony, the Rochester Civic Music \nGuild, as well as the nationally renowned Dale Warren Singers, the \nSaint Paul Chamber Orchestra, and the Guthery Theater.\n  In addition, because of support from NEA, national theater and dance \ngroups have visited many rural communities all across the State of \nMinnesota. The NEA has supported some wonderful partnerships in \nMinnesota, including a partnership between the Minnesota Orchestra \nAssociation and the science museum, which has created an interactive \nwork between actors, the full orchestra, and fifth and sixth graders. \nThat is what this is all about.\n  One grant we are especially proud of that really goes to Minnesota, \nbut goes to the whole Nation--and one of the most important things \nabout these grants is the way in which a grant can go, in this \nparticular case to the Minneapolis Children's Theater Company--and what \nthey have done is this grant has supported the development and \nproduction of a new work which is called the Mark Twain Storybook, \nwhich has toured 35 communities in 9 States, from Fergus Falls, MN, to \nMabel, MN, to Skokie, IL, offering a total of 73 performances and 5 \nworkshops.\n  Sometimes when my colleagues look at funding that goes to particular \nStates, they forget that one of the things the NEA has done under Ms. \nAlexander's leadership is taking a chance, this particular case on the \nMinneapolis Children's Theater Company, which is marvelous, and they \nthen take that on the road and reach out to 9 States, 73 performances, \n5 workshops. This is enriching work.\n  I just would like to make the point that the block grant amendments \nare not friendly amendments. As I say, they undercut the very heart of \nwhat NEA is about, which is national leadership of the arts in our \ncountry. We as a national community make a commitment to the arts. We \nunderstand how important the arts are to enriching the lives of all of \nour citizens. We make it one of our priorities--not much of a priority, \nbecause we have had attacks on the NEA over the past few years and it \nis so severely underfunded--but, nevertheless, we as a national \ncommunity understand that we make a commitment to leverage the funding \nand to get it to organizations to, in turn, get it to communities all \nacross the country.\n  The block grant proposal takes us in the exact opposite direction. I \nreally do believe that the timing of these amendments is just way off. \nOne more time, I just want to repeat for colleagues that regardless of \nthe words that are uttered and regardless of the intentions of \ncolleagues, I think the effect of these block grant amendments is to \njust cut off the very mission, the very lifeblood, the very richness, \nthe very importance of what the NEA is all about.\n  We are only talking about $100 million. It is an agency that has been \nseverely undercut because of attacks of past Congresses. But I will \ntell you something, people in the country have rallied behind the NEA, \nI think in large part because of Ms. Alexander's leadership. We have an \nagency that is bringing the arts into classrooms and bringing arts into \nthe communities all across our country. We have an agency which has \ndone a marvelous job of being in partnership with local communities and \nStates, doing a really superb job.\n  Mr. President, I also want to have printed in the Record a letter \nfrom James Dusso, who is assistant director of the Minnesota State Arts \nBoard. He writes in behalf of Robert Booker, who is the Minnesota State \nArt Board executive director, who is currently away at a conference, \nmaking it very clear that the Minnesota State Arts Board is opposed to \nthe block grant amendments, making it very clear that Minnesota, and I \nthink many, many people in the arts community, appreciate the work of \nNEA, and making it very clear that these amendments, rather than \nimproving NEA's work, would severely undercut what this agency has been \nabout.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                   Minnesota State Arts Board,\n\n                                  St. Paul, MN, September 8, 1997.\n     Hon. Paul Wellstone,\n     U.S. Senate,\n       Dear Senator Wellstone: I am writing on behalf of Robert C. \n     Booker, the Minnesota State Arts Board's executive director, \n     who is currently away from the office at a conference \n     addressing enhanced accessibility to the arts for people of \n     all abilities.\n       It is my understanding that the Senate is currently \n     discussing the amount and the type of support to be provided \n     to the National Endowment for the Arts. In that light, I \n     think it is important that you are aware of the following:\n       The National Endowment for the Arts currently provides over \n     two million dollars to the state in grants to the Minnesota \n     State Arts Board and Minnesota arts organizations.\n       Since 1994 the Arts Board has experienced a 48% reduction \n     in support from the National Endowment for the Arts. This \n     decrease parallels the NEA overall budget cuts from $175 \n     million to the current $100 million and reflects their \n     ongoing problems in Congress.\n       Minnesota is proud of the outstanding caliber of its \n     cultural institutions and its arts community. The citizens of \n     this State and our corporations and foundations have provided \n     extensive financial support to the arts in order to achieve \n     their current high artistic level. Within out state borders, \n     we are proud to have world-class arts organizations and \n     artists of international stature.\n       Because of the quality of the arts in Minnesota, we \n     consistently have been ranked third to fifth among all states \n     in receiving National Endowment for the Arts support.\n       Under a block grant funding structure at the National \n     Endowment for the Arts, Minnesota would drop to sixteenth or \n     lower in the amount of federal support it receives for the \n     arts.\n       Block grants would minimize, if not eliminate, any national \n     leadership for the arts in the country.\n       NEA support historically has been a valuable tool in \n     leveraging matching private support for the arts. Block \n     grants to states would take that tool away from arts \n     organizations, hampering their ability to raise needed \n     private support.\n\n[[Page S9371]]\n\n       Please let me know if you have any questions, or if there \n     is any additional information I can provide.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      James Dusso,\n                                               Assistant Director.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I think these amendments represent a different kind of \nattack. We had amendments to just eliminate the NEA. We may have one of \nthose amendments on the floor now, maybe, to eliminate NEA. We have had \namendments in the past to severely undercut the funding for NEA.\n  I just don't know what will satisfy colleagues. Jane Alexander made a \ncommitment to us that she would be very tough in her management, she \nwould do the necessary reorganization work, she would take all of her \ncreativity and use that creativity to make the NEA an agency that \nclearly was rooted in communities all across our country. And for \nMinnesota, for rural America, the east coast, west coast, North and \nSouth--that is exactly what has been done. So I hope we will defeat \nthese amendments and we can as a Senate vote for a commitment which is \na national community commitment that we care about the arts, that we \nare committed to enriching the lives of children, all children in this \ncountry, and we are committed to making sure the arts reaches out and \ntouches all of our citizens no matter their income, no matter their \nrace, no matter disability, no matter age. That, I think, is what its \nmission is all about, and I think the NEA under Ms. Alexander's \nleadership deserves the strong support of the Senate. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, today we are for arts. Last week we were \nfor education. Before that we were for housing. In fact, we are in \nabout a 60-year cycle where the way you show you are for something is \nto have the Federal Government take the money of working Americans and \nspend that money for them on the thing you want to show that you are \nfor. For 60 years, the choice that has been presented on the floor of \nthe Senate is a choice about whether or not you are for something based \non spending the Federal taxpayer's money on it. The choice is not, \n``Are you for art?'' in the sense that you want to let working families \nkeep their money to invest it in art, the choice is not whether you are \nfor education but letting families decide how to spend their money on \neducation. For 60 years, the only real choice we have had is whether or \nnot we are for things based on spending the taxpayer's money.\n  It is like the compassion debate we have in Washington. Compassion is \nnot what you do with your money, it's what you do with the taxpayers' \nmoney.\n  Rather than getting into all of the different elements of the debate \ntoday, I want to talk about this central point. This is the 12th \nappropriations bill that we have dealt with this year, and when it is \npassed today, we will have spent $268,195,000,000 on just domestic \nappropriations. Nobody knows how much money that is. I have a \nconstituent, Ross Perot, who knows what a billion dollars is, but \nnobody knows what $268 billion is. But it comes down to $2,126 for \nevery working American. When we pass this bill, we will have, in the \nlast few weeks, spent $2,126 of the income on average of every working \nperson in this country, and what we have decided and, in fact, what we \nare debating about the arts today is whether or not we are going to \nspend their money on this purpose.\n  I know we hear our President say the age of big Government is over, \nbut the plain truth is that next year, we are going to spend more money \nin Government as a percentage of the income of working Americans than \nwe have ever spent in the history of the United States of America. We \nare going to have the largest Government that we have ever had in the \nhistory of America next year as a result of the money that we are \nspending here, as a result of the money that we have committed to \nprograms we call entitlement programs and as a result of money that is \nbeing spent by State and local government. In other words, the tax \nburden on the average working American next year will be higher than it \nhas ever been in the history of the country in terms of how much of \ntheir money the Government will be taking.\n  How does this debate about the arts fit into that big picture? It \nseems to me that we are having the wrong debate. The debate here \nshouldn't be whether or not you are for the arts based on how much \nmoney the Government is going to take from working people and spend on \narts. Why don't we have a debate about who should do the spending?\n  I was examining the figures on spending for the National Endowment \nfor the Arts, for the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting, programs where we are taking money \nout of the paychecks of working American families and we are bringing \nthe money to Washington and deciding on their behalf that we want to \nspend it on NEA, NEH, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\n  We have heard a lot of debate about whether we are spending it \nwisely, whether what is being defined as art with the expenditure of \nour taxpayer money through NEA is, in many cases, art. I think the vast \nmajority of Americans would say in many cases it is not.\n  But the point is, if we took those three agencies and eliminated \nthem, we could give an art and entertainment tax credit of about $200 \nto every working family in America. It is in that context that I want \nto talk about the National Endowment for the Arts, because what we are \ndeciding today is not that we are for the arts by voting to continue \nfunding NEA. What we are deciding is that by funding NEA, NEH, and the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting that we are doing more for the \naverage working family in terms of the arts and the humanities and \naccess to information through broadcasting than they could do if they \nwere able to keep $200 more and spend it as they chose.\n  Granted, I am sure there are some here who would get up and say, \n``Wait a minute, with this $200, we are funding the symphony, and if we \nlet working families keep the $200, they might go see Garth Brooks, \nthey might decide to spend it going to three or four Texas A football \ngames.'' I guess I would argue that families ought to have a right to \nchoose what is art and what is entertainment to them rather than \ndelegating that responsibility involuntarily through the IRS to 100 \nMembers of the Senate.\n  In a very real sense, this is the choice that working families are \nmaking. How many families would choose to get an Internet hookup rather \nthan to fund public broadcasting if they had the choice to make? How \nmany families would choose to get the cable rather than to fund public \nbroadcasting?\n\n  So my point is, this is not a debate about whether you are for the \narts or not. This is a debate about whether Government should be the \nfinal decisionmaker about what is art and what should be funded.\n  Our colleague from Minnesota said, ``Well, this is only $100 \nmillion.'' Well, $100 million is a lot of money.\n  I personally would like to begin the process of making fewer \ndecisions in Washington so that we could have more decisions made back \nhome. I think part of our problem in the arts, part of our problem in \nGovernment, is that too many spending decisions are made around these \ncommittee room and Cabinet tables and too few decisions are made by \nfamilies sitting around their kitchen tables. The question that we face \nas Republicans is, if we are not for less Government and more freedom, \nwhat are we for? What do we stand for? If we really want to reduce the \nsize of Government and to let people keep more of what they earn to \ninvest in their own family and their own future, to invest in their own \nart, to invest in their own entertainment, to invest in their own \neducation and housing and nutrition, if that is what we really want, \nwhere do we begin?\n  We are not eliminating a single program in the Federal Government \nthis year that I am aware of. Not a single program in the Federal \nGovernment will be terminated as a result of this budget which will \nspend a record amount where we are increasing discretionary spending \nand, in the process, deciding that the Government ought to direct more \ngoods and services and where they go.\n  I don't, quite frankly, know a better place to start than the \nNational Endowment for the Arts. It is not that I am against the \nNational Endowment for the Arts or the National Endowment for the \nHumanities or against\n\n[[Page S9372]]\n\npublic broadcasting. But the question is, why not eliminate these \nprograms and let working families keep $200 more per family and decide \nwhat they want to invest that in, what brings the most to their family. \nIt seems to me that that is the choice.\n  As I understand it and they proliferated a little, we have three \namendments that are before us in some form. One of the amendments would \nblock grant the money to the States and eliminate the National \nEndowment for the Arts by giving the money directly to the States. \nAnother amendment would give 75 percent of the money to the States, \nhave 20 percent of the money go to national art organizations and give \nthe National Endowment for the Arts 5 percent so we can maintain their \ninfrastructure. The third proposal is to eliminate the National \nEndowment for the Arts.\n  Since I see all three of these as an improvement over the status quo, \nI am going to vote for all three of them. But the position that I want \nto take today and make clear is that you are not saying whether or not \nyou are for the arts based on how you vote on spending the taxpayers' \nmoney. I am for the arts, but I think families ought to have the right \nto decide what is art and what is not art. I think families ought to \nhave the right to make these decisions. I don't think we should be \nmaking those decisions for them.\n  Finally, if we are really serious about less Government and more \nfreedom, if you really believe that Government is too big and too \npowerful and too expensive, if you really believe that having the \naverage family give Government almost a third of its income is too \nmuch, if you believe all of those things, as I do, I don't see how you \ncan then justify having the Government take $100 million from working \nfamilies to spend on what we define as art.\n  So I think this is a fundamental choice. I would have to say that for \n60 years, I think we have been making it the wrong way. For 60 years, \nwe have been losing in the appropriations process, because the choice \nis always spending money and being for something, rather than not \nspending money. What I would like to do is to have the ability to put \nall these appropriations bills out here and go through them one by one \nand basically decide, would you like to do less of this and let \nfamilies keep more of this money themselves? I think when we start \nchanging the way we make these decisions, when we start looking at them \nfrom a bigger perspective, I think ultimately freedom will start \nwinning in this debate instead of losing.\n\n  The vote on NEA today is not a vote about arts to me, it is a vote \nabout freedom. It is a question of whether or not we want the \nGovernment, with the highest tax burden in American history set to be \nimposed on working families next year, to spend another $100 million \ntrying to tell people what is and what is not art, and I think given \nour record on the subject and given the issue itself, that we would be \nbetter off letting families keep this money. If they call Garth Brooks \nart, I call it art. If they would prefer spending their money on an \nInternet connection instead of public broadcasting, or if they would \nprefer going to Texas A football instead of going to the symphony, \nmaybe there is wisdom in each and every household. And what is wisdom \nin each and every household can hardly be folly, even in the greatest \nnation in the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I spoke at length yesterday. I will try \nnot to beat that record, but I do want to make a few comments.\n  First of all, if you take $100 million and divide it by 250 million, \nyou come up with about 38 cents a person and that represents what the \nendowment costs. I think we have to put in focus what we spend on the \narts and why we spend it there.\n  We had some excellent presentations yesterday and we had some this \nmorning on different views of how the money for the Endowment ought to \nbe spent. I guess if you analyzed the Senate, we would have probably 70 \nor 80 people who say, ``OK, let's spend the money, but we have a \ndifferent way to spend it.''\n  A number would spend it with more going to the States. Some would \nspend it with all going to the States. Others would spend it in \ndifferent proportions. But I guess that if it was just a question of \nwhether there ought to be that much money out there available, that we \nwould have a big vote, 70, 80 votes in the Senate, and that is what we \nneed to do--analyze and figure out whether the way we are spending it \nis the best way.\n  That, I think, is what is being asked of this body, and I think is \nbeing asked of the people throughout the country: Are we spending too \nmuch on administration? Are we directing too much of the money to the \nbig cities? Are we spending too much in other areas rather than out in \nthe States? So I hope we keep that in mind as we go forward and examine \nthe amendments that we will be faced with.\n  I would also like to point out some of the very excellent points that \nwere made by other Senators yesterday. I think Senator Bennett from \nUtah probably made one of the best presentations I have heard on why \nthe Endowments are so important and what it does mean to have your \nparticular program get the stamp of approval. As he stated, it is like \nthe Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval for a program. What this does is \nallow you to not only utilize the money, the small amount of money you \nget from the Endowment, but to use that as a fundraiser to be able to \nlet people know, ``Hey, this is a good program and it has the sanction \nof the Endowment and, therefore, you should help us put that program \non.'' It was an excellent presentation.\n  We have had others this morning, Senator Tim Hutchinson and others, \nas well as Senator Hutchison of Texas saying, well, yes, it is a good \nprogram, but more of it ought to be distributed to States and a lot \nless of it ought to be spent from Washington.\n  I spent my time yesterday stating that I might have an amendment \nwhich would spend more of the money in the area of education, \nindicating that the studies demonstrate that those people who \nparticipate in programs of art and music do substantially better on \nSATs than those who do not. I think that is something we should take \nnote of. And there are a lot of reasons for that.\n  Some of the basic problems we have in education is the lack of \ndiscipline and respect by students. Both of these qualities come along \nwith the arts and the programs with the arts--I delineated a number of \nthose programs that I have viewed as I traveled around the country \nwhere students have done exceptionally well, from the east coast to the \nwest coast. When the authorization bill came out of the committee, we \nsuggested that NEA ought to look at trying to evaluate and assist the \nrest of the country, understand which programs do work, what programs \nare helpful in improving the access to the arts in education.\n  Also, as I pointed out yesterday, there are many programs which have \nbeen successful in the cities around the country in helping those who \nare impoverished. I mentioned one program in New York City where there \nwas a horrible situation--so many young people had come from homes of \nviolence, where a member of a family had been killed. Through art and \nart therapy they were able to bring out the horrible experiences in \nthat child's life and begin to open up a vista of perhaps a life \nwithout violence and fear introducing instead hope and other positive \nthings like that.\n  I think there is a general consensus--or close, a substantial number \nof Members of this body--that we ought to keep the Endowment but \nperhaps take a look at how those funds are utilized. So I expect that \nthe Senator from Alaska will have an amendment along those lines.\n  Also, I would like to just raise a few things. I did not talk about \nthe importance of the Endowment in extending the benefits of the arts \nand the benefits of museums around the country.\n  For instance, the Portland Arts Museum moves out to support the \nNorthwest Film Festival, showcasing the works of artists from Alaska, \nIdaho, Montana, and Washington; the Paul Taylor Dance in New York \nreceived a grant to tour through Alaska, Texas, and California; the \nNEA-supported Educational Broadcasting Corporation in New York to put \n``Great Performances'' and ``American Masters'' on TV\n\n[[Page S9373]]\n\nfor the enjoyment of millions. The New England Foundation for the Arts \nreceived a grant to bring the ``Dance on Tour'' program to Connecticut, \nMaine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Massachusetts. The \nYMCA in Chicago received a grant to expand its Writers Voice centers--\nwriting workshops for young people--to Georgia, New Hampshire, Florida, \nand Rhode Island.\n\n  States have little incentive to fund projects which benefit people \noutside its borders, yet it is those partnerships which enrich our \nNation. These are examples of why national leadership is important. So \nI hope that as we move forward we remind ourselves that there are many \nactivities of the Endowment other than some of the areas of controversy \nthat we have heard of.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we are less than 30 minutes from moving on \nto another subject, the cloture vote on the bill relating to the Food \nand Drug Administration. If I may, I would like to summarize where we \nare on this interesting and multifaceted debate on the National \nEndowment for the Arts.\n  The Senator from Missouri, Mr. Ashcroft, who is present on the floor, \nand Senator Helms have proposed an amendment that will terminate the \nNational Endowment for the Arts in much the same way as the House of \nRepresentatives has already voted.\n  I hope that we will be able to vote on that amendment in not too \ngreat a time after the completion of whatever the majority leader seeks \nto do with respect to the Food and Drug Administration bill. The \nSenator from Missouri may very well tell us how much more time he \nthinks he needs on his amendment.\n  After that, logically the next amendment would be that proposed by \nthe Senator from Michigan [Mr. Abraham], which would also close down \nthe National Endowment for the Arts but would transfer the money to, I \nbelieve, the National Park Service for the preservation of historic \nAmerican treasures.\n  The next proposal would be that of the Senators from Alabama and \nArkansas who would essentially block grant the entire appropriation for \nthe National Endowment to the States; following that the proposal by \nthe Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison], that would have 25 percent, \nroughly, governed by the National Endowment for the Arts here and 75 \npercent block granted for the States.\n  Those are the proposals that have been discussed on the floor at some \nlength yesterday afternoon and this morning. I hope that we can reach \nan orderly method for voting on each of those amendments so that the \nwill of the Senate with respect to the National Endowment will be made \nknown.\n  I regret deeply to say that my partner on this bill, Senator Byrd, is \nindisposed today and will not be able to be here at all, something he \nregrets. He hopes that maybe at least some of these votes could be \npostponed until tomorrow. I will have to leave that up to the majority \nleader, who I think wants to move forward as quickly as we possibly \ncan.\n  It is appropriate now, however, I think, for me to state my own view \nat least on the four amendments that are in front of us. My views \nreflect those of the Appropriations Committee and, most particularly, \nmy subcommittee. I believe the National Endowment for the Arts does in \nfact play a constructive role in culture in the United States. I \nbelieve that reforms in the last 2 or 3 years have cut down \ntremendously on some of the truly objectionable grants which were \nrightly objected to by the vast majority of the American people.\n  So with respect to the first two amendments, I will vote no. I also \nam unable in my own mind to feel that we would somehow deal more \nsensitively if all of these grants were decentralized to State arts \ncommissions.\n  Finally, I find myself somewhat in sympathy with the proposal of the \nSenator from Texas. I believe that perhaps a greater focusing, but not \na universal focusing, on State and regional arts organizations may well \nbe appropriate but that there are also grants that are appropriately \nnational in nature and that many of the institutional grantees, while \nthey may be located in a particular city or a particular State, have an \nimpact on the arts that goes far beyond the locale of their principal \noffice, their museum, their symphony orchestra or their opera company.\n\n  Because, however, the Ashcroft-Helms position has governed the House \nof Representatives, my inclination is to vote against all of these \namendments that change the present system simply because we will have \nto take into account the views of the House of Representatives in a \nconference committee, a conference committee that I think is likely at \nleast to come out with a proposal that is perhaps closer to that of the \nSenator from Texas than any other that I have heard at this point.\n  So at the present time, unless I am persuaded to the contrary, Mr. \nPresident, I am going to suggest to the Members of this body that they \nleave the appropriation for the National Endowment for the Arts \ncontained in the bill as it is before us now untouched and discuss the \nvery important questions that all of them have raised with the House of \nRepresentatives that has taken a quite different view in a conference \ncommittee. With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1188\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  I rise to address the issue of the National Endowment for the Arts \nand some of the arguments that have been raised in this debate.\n  I think it is important that we debate this issue thoroughly. I think \nit is important that we have the discussion of as many Members of this \nbody on this issue made as explicitly as is possible for the American \npeople.\n  I am not in any rush to judgment or to election on this. To say \nbecause the House of Representatives has taken a position that here the \nSenate should not take a position or that it should merely endorse the \nposition of the Committee on Appropriations I think is to do less than \nthe American people expect of us.\n  The American people understand that the issue before us is whether or \nnot arts are to be funded by Government and whether that is a role for \nGovernment to play. We must look at the reason why we have Government, \nthe reason why we take money from people that they have earned and they \ncannot spend on their own families. That is a major issue. And whether \nor not we are going to take it and then give some of it back to a State \nwhere we do not have the ability to control it, or whether we are going \nto give part of it to the State and we are going to control the rest of \nit, is another major issue.\n  I think we ought to debate these things. So I, frankly, want the \nSenate to move forward, and I want us to move forward with dispatch and \nmake sure that we do not unduly delay things. But this is an issue \nworthy of the American people, it is worthy of our understanding. I \nthink there are substantially basic, philosophic items that are of \nimportance here: Does the Government have a responsibility to shape the \nculture by paying for artistic expression, and by paying for some \nartistic expression and not paying for other artistic expression? I \nthink that is a very important point.\n  I say that it is important to understand that both artists and \nnonartists are on both sides of this issue. There are people who love \nthe arts so much that they do not want the Government to contaminate \nthe arts. They feel that when the Government gets in the position of \nstarting to say that this art is good and is worthy of being subsidized \nand this other art over here is not good and is not worthy of being \nsubsidized, they think that is likely to distort the arts and to leave \nthe arts in a situation of impurity, with artists who are seeking not \nto express themselves but to express what the bureaucrats in Washington \nor in a State capital would want them to express.\n  As a matter of fact, that is exactly the point that Jan Breslauer, \nthe critic from the Los Angeles Times, has written about. Eloquently \nshe states--and as a matter of fact, it is more than an eloquent \nstatement. This is a rather embarrassing indictment of the National \nEndowment for the Arts. Let her words speak this position as I quote \nthem. And she says--or he says. I do\n\n[[Page S9374]]\n\nnot know whether Jan, J-a-n, is a ``he'' or ``she.'' I apologize if \nthere would be any offense in what I have said.\n\n       [T]he endowment has quietly pursued policies rooted in \n     identity politics--a kind of separatism that emphasizes \n     racial, sexual and cultural differences above all else. The \n     art world's version of affirmative action * * *.\n  She is describing the way the bureaucracy, known as the National \nEndowment for the Arts, has operated, that it has emphasized \nseparatism, emphasizing racial, sexual, and cultural differences above \nall else.\n  I think we need to get to an America that emphasizes our identity, \nthe common things we enjoy, the freedom we embrace, not the differences \nwe have. I think the Statue of Liberty has stood there without wincing \nfor a long time. She stood through hurricanes and the tests of time, \nstorms, good times and bad, in war and in peace, but I think she winces \na little bit when she thinks about all the people that have come here \nto pursue common goals of freedom being driven by Government to be \nseparate, to be forced apart.\n  Jan Breslauer says, ``The Endowment has quietly pursued policies \nrooted in identity politics,'' this idea of separating us into separate \nidentities. I kind of like a single identity for the United States of \nAmerica. What are the different identities, she says, that are being \nemphasized by the National Endowment for the Arts? She says that the \nNational Endowment is pushing us into separate racial identities, that \nit is pushing us into separate sexual and cultural identities. These \ndifferences are being elevated, instead of minimized, in the way, she \nsays, the funds are given out from the National Endowment for the Arts.\n  Fundamentally, I do not believe that Government should be striving to \ndrive wedges between Americans. Whether it is an arts program or \nanything else, I think we ought to come to the point where we realize \nthere is only one word that ought to describe us in a way that unites \nus, and it is ``America.'' I don't need someone to try and push me into \nsome politics of separatism or some identity politics and provide a \nbasis for separating me from my fellow Americans. I think the great \nunity of America is so very important.\n  I think of the millions of lives lost in the Civil War for unity, so \nthat this would be one Nation united under God with liberty and justice \nfor a few or for this group or that group, with preferences? No, for \nall.\n  The National Endowment for the Arts ``has quietly pursued policies \nrooted in identity politics--a kind of separatism that emphasizes \nracial, sexual, and cultural differences, above all else.'' These are \nnot my words. These are not the words of some individual who is against \nart. These are words from a critic from the Los Angeles Times. The art \nworld's version of affirmative action, to prefer people on the basis of \ntheir group identity rather than to prefer people on the basis of their \nown merit. The United States of America is a place where individuals \nshould have the ability to succeed or fail based on their own merit. \nShe says the art world's version of affirmative action, and its \npolicies have had a profoundly corrosive effect on American art.\n  A corrosive effect--I don't know how you can define that as lifting \nup the arts or improving the arts. We have heard individuals come to \nthe floor over the last several days and say the reason we need this is \nbecause it allows the arts that are sponsored to be shared with the \nentire culture. Do we want to corrode the arts before we share them?\n  I want to mention I believe there are some artistic endeavors here \nthat are supported that are good ones. Sure there are. You are spending \n$100 million, you will probably have some good ones. The question is, \nIs this what Government is for, to take the hard-earned money of \nindividuals and say we can spend that money better on art than you can \nspend it on your family?\n  At a time when real wages for individuals for over half the \nAmericans, according to a recent national article in one of our \nbusiness journals, are lower than they were in 1989, some 8 years ago, \ndo we still believe that we want to take money that people could be \nspending on their own families and we want to spend it on art that \nseparates us, that emphasizes racial differences, cultural differences, \nthat has a corrosive effect on the arts itself? That is \nincomprehensible.\n  Some people think it is great to have the symphony, it is great to \nhave great art and they think about the great artists of the past, they \nthink about artists from my State whose works are shown in art \ngalleries of this country and have been for hundreds of years. But that \nis not all that we are talking about here.\n  Here is a piece of art that is interesting to me. This art was funded \nby the National Endowment for the Arts. This is a poem. No, Senators, \nthis is not the title of the poem, this is a poem. This poem, spelled \nL-I-G-H-G-H-T, I am not sure what it means--maybe light--this poem cost \nthe taxpayers $1,500. This was the subject of a grant. Now, this is the \nEnglish version of the poem, I have to tell you. This is not the French \nor the German version. Maybe it is the German version of the poem. \nMaybe it is not the English version. This is it. This is why we would \ntax individuals, take money that they earned, working hard on their \njobs, and we want to say to the rest of the world, this is what you \nshould be doing.\n  I was stunned by the fact that my colleagues came to the floor and \nsaid we need this not because the arts need the money. They recognize \nit is 1 percent of the art funding in the country. As a matter of fact, \nless than that. But 1 percent of the art funding in the country comes \nfrom the Government. But we need it so we can have the Good \nHousekeeping Seal of Approval, that somehow when Government comes and \nputs its seal of approval on things like this, it signals to the \ncountry that this is what we are supposed to really look up to.\n  I am sure getting this poem around to schoolchildren will inspire \nlots of them to be poets. I don't know whether this is a typographical \nerror or whether this is profoundly insightful, but I don't think it is \ninspirational. I don't think we have to have the U.S. Government taking \ntax money from people who get up early and work hard all day and go \nhome late, families with two parents working, one to pay the \nGovernment, the other to support the family. I don't think we do that \nin order to be able to put a Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval on \nthis.\n  I want to talk a little bit about this concept that you put a Good \nHousekeeping Seal of Approval on things by having Government tell \npeople what is good and what is bad. Let me just indicate that one of \nmy colleagues yesterday spoke, and I quote from the Congressional \nRecord of September 15, 1997:\n\n       The National Endowment for the Arts is something like a \n     Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval put on a local effort \n     which allows people who are running that local effort to then \n     go out and do their fundraising and say you see what we have \n     here is really a class operation. It is something worthy of \n     your support, worthy of your private contributions. Look, \n     it's good enough that the National Endowment for the Arts has \n     put their seal of approval on it.\n\n  And the argument is that somehow the American people don't have the \nintelligence or the judgment or the capacity to know what values they \nwant expressed in their culture. They need someone from the Federal \nGovernment to tell them that this is great poetry and that they should \nbuy it or subsidize it.\n  I don't believe the genius of a democracy is having the Government \ntell people what is good or bad. The genius of a democracy is not that \nthe Government informs the people. The genius of a democracy is that \nthe people inform the Government. The genius of a democracy is that the \ncollective wisdom of the people is reflected in what is done in \nWashington. We have inverted the flow of information here. The people \nare supposed to be represented in Washington to do the will of the \npeople. The Government is not supposed to be represented by a good seal \nof approval so that the people can then do the will of Government. The \nwhole idea of a democracy is not that the Government puts its good seal \nof approval on anything and then the people do it. The ideal of a \ndemocracy is that the people express their wisdom to the Government, \nsending their representatives to achieve the will of the people, not \nthe will of the Government.\n  It is kind of amusing to me that we have this information flow. We \nare so conditioned to believing that Washington is the source of wisdom \nthat now\n\n[[Page S9375]]\n\nwe have to tell the people what good poetry is, and stuff like this is \ngood enough for their support or something else is good enough for \ntheir support. You would think we would learn that the central \ngovernment is not the place to direct investment, whether it be in art \nor whether it be in industry.\n\n  There are different cultures, there are different ways to do \ngovernment. There are different ways to allocate resources. One way is \nto have central planning, to have the Government make the decisions, \nencourage or allocate the resources on its own. That is a way which was \ntried for a long time.\n  Communism was a system which said we will do central planning. We \nwill not trust the marketplace. We will not trust the judgment that \npeople will reach on their own. We will trust the central planners, the \nsuperior intellects of Government to make those decisions. We will ask \nthem to decide how many potatoes are grown and how many cars are made \nand how many TV's are made, and with the superior wisdom of centralized \ngovernment, we can tell the people how things are and it will all be \nbetter.\n  I love the joke Ronald Reagan used to tell about the guy going to buy \na car.\n  The guy said, ``You have to wait 10 years for your car but on the \n12th day of February, 10 years from now, in the morning, we are going \nto deliver your car to you.''\n  The guy said, ``Oh, no, you can't deliver the car on the 12th day of \nFebruary 10 years from now.''\n  The car salesman says, ``Why not?''\n  He says, ``Well, the plumber is coming then.''\n  The whole point is planned allocation of resources by central \ngovernment is a failure, an abject failure.\n  Yet we have people come to the floor of the Senate and say people \nreally do not know the good art from the bad art, what to support, what \nnot to support, and they need the Government to come look and be the \nGood Housekeeping Seal of Approval. We cannot trust the private \nmarketplace, the will of the people, the understanding of the people to \nallocate the resources that they ought to put or want to put into art. \nWe have to confiscate resources from them and then we have to use those \nresources as some sort of gold stock. This is what you must support, \nyou ought to support this, this is great.\n  Well, if you put the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval on material \nthat emphasizes, above all else, racial, sexual, and cultural \ndifferences, in the words of Jan Breslauer, the art critic, what we \nhave is the Government telling us what is good and telling us that all \nthese things that divide us are good and the things that unite us are \nnot worthy of funding.\n  In my judgment, I think we should have learned something. We should \nhave learned that when the Founders of this great country considered \nthis question, they voted overwhelmingly not to have the Federal \nGovernment involved in subsidies for the arts. This is not new. This \nidea came into being in Lyndon Johnson's plan for a Great Society. We \nknow how the governmentalism of the Great Society has been so eminently \nsuccessful in other areas--such as attempting to deal with poverty. We \nsee there are more children on poverty now than there were when the so-\ncalled Great Society began. And in an attempt to deal with situations \nwhere there were children being born to parents who would not be \nparents--there were no families there, really--we have seen that \nproblem exacerbated and intensified rather than assuaged or reduced. \nHere we have one of the Great Society programs and here is another one \nthat says we know best from Government.\n  In the area of the Great Society, as it relates to the welfare \nprogram, we have that figured out that the central government should \nnot have a sort of a Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval. We have \nabandoned the old Federal approach that says there is a way you are \ngoing to do this and this is the way, the truth, and I guess it would \nnot be the light, would it? The Federal Government's welfare program, \nwe found out, was a failed program.\n  I yield to the Chair, if there is an item that needs to be brought to \nmy attention.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under a previous order, the hour of 12:15 \nhaving arrived, the Senate is to conduct a cloture vote.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute in which to \nconclude my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Chair. It is clear to me that the National \nEndowment for the Arts takes resources from taxpayers to spend in a way \nthat the Government thinks it can spend better than taxpayers. Even art \ncritics indicate that that taking has not only a bad effect on people, \nit divides them, seeks to separate them, but it has a corrosive effect \non the arts. I believe that having the Government establish values that \nit tries to impose on people is a denial of the genius of America, \nwhich is when the American people impose their values on Government, \nnot when the Government imposes its values on the people. The so-called \nGood Housekeeping Seal of Approval theory of support for the National \nEndowment for the Arts reveals the bankruptcy of the concept of \nGovernment telling people what they should believe and what they should \nvalue.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Since the Senator from Missouri has taken all the time, I \nask unanimous consent that I may have an additional 60 seconds before \nthe vote to make some comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank Senators for their indulgence. I do not have the \ntime to lay out all the reforms that we have made in the National \nEndowment for the Arts, nor to give you the details on how every single \ndollar that my colleague talked about is leveraged by $12 in every \ncommunity across this great country of ours, because the arts, just as \nthey are in the military, preserve our culture. We spend twice as much \non military bands as we do on the National Endowment for the Arts. If \nthe military bands make a mistake and play a song that we don't think \nis appropriate, we don't stop funding the military bands, because they \nare a very important part of our culture. If a postman acts wrong and \nis obnoxious, we don't stop delivering the mail.\n  So I think it is very important that when we go back to this debate--\nand I think right now it won't be for a couple of days--that we lay out \nall of the reforms that have been made and all of the wonderful \nprograms, such as the Youth Symphony, the ballet, and all the things we \ndo with the arts, and have a fair debate.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/16/senate-section/article/S9363-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9375-S9376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION MODERNIZATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF \n                                  1997\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have asked for this time to notify my \ncolleagues that I no longer intend to object to the U.S. Senate \nproceeding to the nomination of General Shelton to be Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff.\n  Last Thursday morning, I announced publicly that I would object to \nthe Senate proceeding to General Shelton's nomination. My colleague \nfrom Oregon, Senator Smith, supported me in this effort. We did so not \nout of any reservation about the general's qualifications but because \nhe is about to become the Nation's top ranking military officer.\n  Mr. President, General Shelton is in a position to assure that the \nmilitary--and in this case the Air Force--respond to rather than ignore \nthe requests of the Congress and our constituents. It is not too much \nto ask that the Nation's top general help us address the concerns of \nthe widows of the American airmen who have died serving our country. \nWhat they have wanted is simply to have the Air Force explain the \nreasons for the crash of a C-130 off the coast of California last \nNovember that killed 10 airmen on board. In April of this year, the Air \nForce informed the widows and families that the cause of the crash was \nengine failure due to fuel starvation. No further explanation was \noffered at that time. When the widows and families sought further \nexplanation, they were told that the case was closed. Later that month, \nthey came to me, and asked if we could help. I approached my colleague, \nSenator Smith. And, at every step of the way, Senator Smith has been \nexceptionally helpful in our joint efforts to work to make sure that \nthe Air Force would provide the loved ones of these airmen an answer to \nwhat happened in this tragedy. The families, my colleagues, have a \nright to know.\n  We asked that an independent group be allowed to review the file. We \nasked that information about the crash be made available to the \nfamilies. We asked that the Air Force give the National Transportation \nSafety Board's aviation experts access to the file.\n  The denying of the request to provide the National Transportation \nSafety Board access to the files was especially difficult for Senator \nSmith and I to understand, because in the interim the Air Force had \nallowed a private contractor to look at these materials. On September \n10, the National Transportation Safety Board informed us that, based on \nthe limited data available, the Board was unable to determine whether \nthe Air Force had conducted a thorough investigation.\n  Having exhausted all other avenues to get this critically needed \ninformation for Oregon families, it was my hope that we could command \nsome attention at higher levels of the military by appealing to the \nsoon-to-be most senior officer. General Shelton's staff responded \nquickly. The Air Force has now proposed an agreement with the National \nTransportation Safety Board that should provide us the information we \nseek. It is a solid agreement and we wish to thank the Air Force for \nthe prompt response to this case.\n  The agreement between the Air Force and the National Transportation \nSafety Board is supported by the widows and the Oregon families, and \nprovides for a joint, high-level review of the accident involving King-\n56 and other C-130 incidents. The agreement calls for the team to issue \na preliminary report within 90 days. It is our hope the full \nparticipation of the National Transportation Safety Board in a manner \nthat assures its independence of action will finally get the families \nand the widows the answers they have awaited for so long.\n  I want to yield to my colleague, Senator Smith. Before I do, I thank \nthe chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Thurmond, and \nSenator McCain, his colleague, and Senator Levin, for assisting Senator \nSmith and me. In yielding to my colleague, I again express my \nappreciation and thanks for the opportunity to work together on this \nmatter in a bipartisan way.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to my colleague from \nOregon, Senator Smith.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator \nWyden, for yielding. I publicly commend my senior colleague from \nOregon, with whom it has been my great pleasure to stand on this issue \nand ask for justice for our State. I want to point out a very pivotal \nrole that Senator Strom Thurmond played in breaking a logjam, if you \nwill, for the State of Oregon. For a very long time now, Senator Wyden \nand I have been trying to get answers from the Air Force for widows and \norphans, literally, as to why their loved ones, these airmen, perished \nin this tragic accident. For one reason or another, we were stalled and \nput off at every turn.\n  It was Senator Thurmond who, when he heard of Senator Wyden's hold on \nthis nomination--and, frankly, my encouragement of that--that he \nintervened in our behalf. I acknowledge it. I thank him. He asked me to \ngo immediately with him to the cloakroom where we got on the phone with \nthe Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force.\n  We laid out the terms of a deal that will include a new investigation \ninto C-130 air transports generally, and this one in particular. It was \npromised to Oregon's families, that these widows and orphans would be \ngiven the information they need as to why this accident occurred. It \nwas promised that a member of the National Transportation Safety Board \nwould be a part of this investigative team. And I think that is \nimportant for the Air Force that has, in my State, lost some \ncredibility. I thank the Air Force for their promise to provide to our \nState, and this issue generally, the kind of investigation that was \nconducted for Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, who perished in an accident \nin Bosnia.\n  So, I thank the Air Force for responding. I regret it took this level \nof intervention, but I compliment my senior colleague for his \nleadership on this. I have been proud to stand with him. I am grateful \nto Senator Thurmond. I am thankful the Air Force has come around to \nhelp us on this issue. I only hope that out of all of this will come \ninformation that will protect our men in the Air Force who fly C-130 \nair transports from this ever occurring again to anyone else.\n  With that, I encourage my colleagues in the Senate to vote for the \nconfirmation of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and I yield \nthe remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

CARTER\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the U.S. Senate lost one of its most \ncolorful and well liked staff members last Thursday night when my \nadministrative assistant, Wiley Carter, died. His sudden and unexpected \ndeath at 61 years of age following surgery at a hospital in Jackson, \nMS, has deeply saddened us all. He began his work with me as manager of \nmy campaign for reelection to the U.S. House of Representatives in \n1974. In that turbulent election year, with his good assistance we \nreceived over 70 percent of the vote. After the election, Wiley joined \nmy congressional staff in Mississippi where he served as my liaison to \nlocal governments and case worker. Two years later he became a member \nof my Washington staff and soon thereafter became my administrative \nassistant.\n  During these 23 years of close association, I developed a deep \nappreciation for Wiley Carter. His warm good nature was constant, his \nloyalty never failing, and his enthusiasm an ever present inspiration. \nHe was adept at handling constituents' problems, and he reminded all of \nus by his example that one of our highest priorities was to help solve \nthe problems of the people of our State and to treat everyone who \ncalled on us with respect and courtesy. He really loved his job. He \nloved people. He loved politics. He loved campaigns. He loved \nMississippi State University. But, most of all he loved his family. He \ncared about his children and his efforts to support and assist them in \nevery possible way were well known.\n  One experience with Wiley and his wife Gwen, and their children, and \ntheir extended family is particularly memorable for me. We were all in \nStarkville, MS celebrating the donation of his political memorabilia \nand papers to the Mississippi State University Library. The love the \nfamily members felt for each other was obvious to me, and the pride \nthey had in seeing Wiley's career celebrated with such ceremony--well \nattended by many friends--was evidence of their deep appreciation of \nhim. And, he loved every minute of it as he should have.\n  One of his former classmates said to me, ``Where did Wiley get any \npapers? When he was in school at State, he didn't have any papers.''\n  Of course, there were a lot of clippings, photographs, and letters \nthat had accumulated over a career dating from the organization of the \nMississippi Young Democrats in the 1950's and the Carroll Gartin and \nJohn Bell Williams campaigns for Governor, to the present.\n  The skills he developed along the way led our mutual friend, Bill \nSimpson, to say to me recently, ``Wiley Carter in my book is the best \nstreet politician in Mississippi.''\n  I didn't know whether that was such a high compliment or not until I \ntold Wiley what Bill had said about him, and Wiley said, ``You know, \nthat's one of the best compliments I've ever gotten.''\n  In this day of cynicism about politics and government, more Wiley \nCarters would be good to have. People who devote their energy to doing \ntheir best to make our government respond to the needs of ordinary \npeople and respect the opinion of average citizens.\n  Wiley engendered good will wherever he went. He warmed our hearts, \nand he put a smile on our faces.\n\n  Without Wiley, life will not be as interesting, and political \ncampaigns won't be the same either. He would say, for example, ``In a \ncampaign, if you haven't heard a rumor by noon, you ought to start \none.'' Wiley organized a War Room before Lee Atwater and James Carville \nmade the term famous. He was so well-liked by so many in Mississippi \nand here in Washington too. A Capitol Hill policeman, Andy Anders, was \none of the first Washington friends whom I called on Friday morning. \nAndy had taken his vacation a few years ago to come visit Mississippi \nat Wiley's suggestion, and Wiley gave him the royal treatment. They \nwalked up to the State Capitol. The legislature was in session. He \nintroduced him to Gov. Kirk Fordice, the Speaker of the House, and many \nothers. Of course Andy was impressed and delighted.\n  That says a lot about Wiley and his capacity and his sense of duty to \nreciprocate true acts of friendship and kindness.\n  There will never be another one like him. We all are so fortunate \nthat we have had the benefit of his unique insights into human nature \nand his example of loyalty to his friends and family.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I join my colleague to express my sadness at \nthe loss of our friend and Thad's administrative assistant, Wiley \nCarter. I extend my sympathy to Senator Cochran and his staff, and \ncertainly to the family and all the many friends that Wiley Carter had \nin Mississippi.\n  Senator Cochran did a wonderful job of talking about his indomitable \nspirit. He was a lovable guy, a great pleasure to be around. He was a \nfriend of mine. And on many occasions when I needed advice and counsel, \nI can remember seeking out Wiley Carter. He did always have good \nspirits. I have never seen anybody who actually enjoyed Government and \npolitics, which is the art of Government, any more than Wiley Carter. \nHe was dedicated to maintaining an America in which we want our \nchildren to grow up. I am not the only person to note that more Wileys \nwould serve us all well.\n  In the initial part of his 40-year career, Wiley worked for the \nState's economic development department, the Mississippi Democratic \nParty, former Lt. Gov. Carroll Gartin and former U.S. Representative \nJohn Bell Williams of Mississippi. But it was during his 23-year stint \nas Senator Cochran's administrative assistant that people throughout \nMississippi knew him best.\n  Wiley spent much of that time criss-crossing our State, listening to \nits citizens, and working on Thad's behalf to carry out their mission. \nPeople trusted Wiley. They were comfortable sharing their concerns with \nhim, and they knew that their words would go straight to Thad's ear.\n  Thad and I were not the only ones who counted on Wiley's knowledge. \nVery few people knew more about Mississippi politics than Wiley, and in \npast years, few young political hopefuls in our State have considered a \nrun for office without first consulting him. He also provided advice \nand perspective for many who had been around for quite a while, and he \ndid it with his infectious smile and sense of humor.\n  His wit always seemed to put political life in perspective. While \nrunning Senator Cochran's Senate race, Wiley\n\n[[Page S9378]]\n\nquipped, ``In a campaign, if you haven't heard a good rumor by noon, \nyou better start one.'' Needless to say, Wiley knew how to have fun in \nserious situations, and he always got the job done.\n  Wiley's outstanding work and invaluable knowledge were not the only \nreasons he was well loved by Mississippians. Many benefited from his \ntireless work as an ambassador for his beloved Mississippi State \nUniversity. Wiley was a servant of the people, and he was one of them.\n  He is best described as the kind of person who never met a stranger \nor knew an enemy. He reached out to individuals at all levels, and his \nfriendliness was contagious. Quite simply, everyone liked Wiley.\n  I understand that the church in Jackson couldn't hold all those who \nshowed up yesterday to pay tribute and show appreciation for Wiley. To \nanyone whose life he touched, this is no surprise.\n  There is not a story that can be told or a memory brought to mind \nabout Wiley that wouldn't bring a smile to the faces of those who knew \nhim, which is a tribute in itself to his character. Wiley will be \nsorely missed, but more importantly, he will be fondly remembered.\n  I am sure all my colleagues in the Senate join me in extending \ncondolences to the members of his family, to his friend Senator \nCochran, and to the many others who loved him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I know we all join in expressing those \nfeelings about Wiley. They were so adequately and eloquently expressed. \nWe appreciate that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/16/senate-section/article/S9377-4", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank my colleague \nfrom Vermont, the chairman of the committee.\n  Let me begin these brief remarks by commending all of our colleagues \non the Labor and Human Resources Committee. This has been a long \nprocess, 2\\1/2\\ to 3 years. The Presiding Officer is a member of this \ncommittee as well and all have worked very hard, I think, to bring a \nbill which I think most would agree is a very good bill.\n  There obviously still are some issues that will have to be resolved, \nbut this has been a very fine product that has been assembled by both \nDemocrats and Republicans for the first time in several decades of \nreforming the Food and Drug Administration and the processes by which \nwe bring important pharmaceutical products and medical devices to \npatient groups and individuals across this country in an efficient, \nsafe, and expeditious fashion.\n  Let me begin as well by thanking our colleagues for their \noverwhelming support earlier today of the cloture motion to proceed \nwith this bill. Mr. President, 94 Senators, of both parties, loudly and \nclearly told us they are ready to move forward to reauthorize PDUFA and \nbegin debating the other critical reforms this bill contains.\n  There is no Federal agency with a more direct or significant impact \non the lives of the American people than the Food and Drug \nAdministration. The foods that we serve our family, the medicines we \ntake when we are sick, even the drugs we give our pets are all approved \nand monitored by the Food and Drug Administration. We must not lose the \nopportunity that we have before the Senate today to enact legislation \nthat ensures that the FDA has the authority it needs to bring safe and \neffective products to the American people quickly, efficiently and \nsafely.\n  I again thank both Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy for their \nperseverance on this issue. Time after time they have been willing to \nreturn to the bargaining table after many others would have just walked \naway. With open minds and good faith they have extensively negotiated \nthis bill line by line.\n  Mr. President, we have now come to a point where issues on which \nMembers were previously completely polarized--third-party review of \nmedical devices, off-label dissemination of information, health claims \nfor food products, the number of clinical trials needed for drug \napproval, and just today, national uniformity of cosmetics--we have now \nreached agreement.\n  I don't know that any of us would have thought unanimity possible on \nthese provisions even a month or two ago. Yet here we are, this \nafternoon on this day, with full agreement on all but a handful of \nissues, or less.\n  I know we have a better bill for all the arduous negotiations that \nhave occurred. As an example of how far we have come, let me just \nbriefly describe third-party review of medical devices. The bill would \nexpand the pilot program currently administered by the FDA. This is a \nprogram, I should note, that is supported by the FDA as a way to make \nmore efficient use of its resources.\n  In last year's debate on this issue, which many may recall as being \none of the more acrimonious, we were told that this provision was a \nnonstarter, no room for compromise, subject closed.\n  This year, I am pleased to say a spirit of bipartisanship and \ncompromise has prevailed. Senator Harkin, Senator Kennedy, and Senator \nCoats, the Presiding Officer, worked diligently to draft language that \nensures that higher risk devices are not inappropriately included in \nthis pilot program and that strong conflict of interest protections are \nin place.\n  Late last week, again on an issue that appeared unresolved, national \nuniformity for cosmetics, we have reached agreement. Senator Gregg of \nNew Hampshire has offered what I think is a very reasonable compromise. \nIn the area of packaging and labeling, States can continue to regulate \nwhere the FDA has not acted. Conflicting State requirements that could \nconfuse consumers will be removed. But where the FDA has not chosen to \nact, where it does not have either the manpower nor the authority to \nprotect the public, States can still play their historic role in \nregulating cosmetics.\n  This is the kind of effort, Mr. President, made over and over again \non this bill--some 30 times just since the markup 2 months ago that we \nhave made improvements in this legislation. A great many of us take \npride in the product that we have created --a bill that would speed \nlifesaving drugs and devices to patients and that clearly retains the \nFDA as the undisputed arbiter of the safety and effectiveness of the \nproducts.\n  I will speak about some of the positive reforms contained in this \nbill, as well.\n\n  At the heart of this bill is the 5-year reauthorization of PDUFA, the \nPrescription Drug User Fee Act, a piece of legislation remarkable for \nthe fact\n\n[[Page S9379]]\n\nthat there is unanimous agreement that it really works. PDUFA has set \nup a system of user fees which drug companies pay to the FDA. These \nfees have enabled the agency to hire more staff. As a result, drug \napproval times have been cut almost in half, getting new and lifesaving \ntherapies to patients more quickly.\n  In addition, by improving the certainty and clarity of the product \nreview process, S. 830 encourages U.S. companies to continue to develop \nand manufacture their products in the United States, not an \ninsignificant matter. The legislation emphasizes collaboration early on \nbetween the FDA and industry during the product development and product \napproval phases. This will prevent misunderstandings about agency \nexpectations and we think should result in quicker development of \napproval times.\n  Mr. President, in addition, S. 830 establishes or expands upon \nseveral mechanisms to provide patients and other consumers with greater \naccess to information and lifesaving products. For example, the \nlegislation will give individuals with life-threatening illnesses \ngreater access to information about the location of ongoing clinical \ntrials of drugs.\n  Based on a bill originally championed by Senators Snowe of Maine and \nDianne Feinstein of California, I offered an amendment in committee, \nwhich I was pleased to see adopted, to expand the existing AIDS \ndatabase to include trials for all serious or life-threatening \ndiseases.\n  Experimental trials offer hope for patients who have not benefited \nfrom treatments currently on the market. Currently, patients' ability \nto access experimental treatments is dependent on their spending large \namounts of time and energy contacting individual drug manufacturers \njust to discover the existence of trials.\n  Mr. President, this is not a burden that we should place on \nindividuals already struggling with chronic and debilitating diseases. \nThis database will provide one-stop shopping for patients seeking \ninformation on the location and the eligibility criteria for studies of \npromising treatments.\n  Mr. President, I am particularly pleased that this legislation \nincorporates the Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, legislation \noriginally introduced by our former colleague from Kansas, Senator \nKassebaum, and now cosponsored by myself and Senator DeWine of Ohio, \nalong with Senator Kennedy, Senator Mikulski, Senator Hutchinson, \nSenator Collins, and Senator Cochran.\n  This provision, Mr. President, addresses the problem of the lack of \ninformation about how drugs work on children, a problem that just last \nmonth President Clinton recognized publicly as a national crisis.\n  According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, only one-fifth of \nall drugs on the market have been tested for their safety and \neffectiveness on children. This legislation provides a fair and \nreasonable market incentive for drug companies to make the extra effort \nneeded to test their products for use by children.\n  It gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to \nrequest pediatric clinical trials for new drug applications and for \ndrugs currently on the market. If the manufacturer successfully \nconducts the additional research, 6 extra months of market exclusivity \nwould be given.\n  I recognize that there are a few matters unresolved in this bill \ndespite the best efforts of all involved, and we will need to hold \nvotes on those issues. One issue, which I plan to discuss further when \nwe debate the bill this week, involves section 404 of the bill, which \nrelates to the FDA's medical devices. This provision, the so-called \nlabeling claims provision, clarifies current law by stating that while \nreviewing a device for approval, FDA should look at safety and efficacy \nissues raised by the use for which the product was developed and for \nwhich it was marketed.\n  Again, this is current law. Unfortunately, in a few instances the FDA \nhas inappropriately expanded the scope of its review by requiring \nmanufacturers to submit data on potential uses of the product. Some \nhave raised concerns that under this provision a manufacturer could \npropose a very narrowly worded label for a device and that the FDA \nwould be barred from asking for information on other obvious uses.\n  I don't believe this is the case. The FDA retains its current \nauthority to not approve a device if features of the device raise new \nquestions of safety and efficacy. Clearly, if a bad actor device \nmanufacturer attempted to get a misleading label past the FDA, the \nagency would have full authority to disapprove the product.\n  Again, I urge, on this matter, that some common ground be sought to \nsee if we cannot resolve this, but I do believe the present legislation \nis more than adequate to protect the concerns that have been raised \nabout a use for a device beyond what its intended purpose would be.\n  I was pleased to join Senator Jeffords, the chairman of \nthe committee, as the first Democratic cosponsor of this bill. I thank \nhim again for the hard work and long hours that he and his staff, as \nwell as Senator Kennedy, Senator Mikulski, Senator Wellstone, Senator \nCoats, Senator Gregg and others, have contributed.\n\n  Mr. President, this has been a long process, and while there are \nstill some outstanding issues, I think this committee deserves a great \ndeal of credit for having been open to the suggestions of others. There \nare about 50-some-odd amendments that are kicking around that may be \noffered. I don't know how many will actually survive the germaneness \ntest when they are raised, but I hope, for those who are bringing up \nnew matters here that we have not had a chance to look at, that they \nwould reserve those unless there is an overwhelming need for them. In \nmany cases, if the matters had been brought before the committee \nearlier, we might have been able to handle them.\n  We have a few days left to get the bill done. PDUFA goes out of \nexistence on September 30. We have been 2\\1/2\\ years at this now. My \nhope is we will not delay this to such a degree that we lose a historic \nopportunity to make a difference. When it takes 14 to 17 years to get \nsome cancer treatments approved, there is something fundamentally wrong \nwith that kind of a process. We ought to be able to make it far more \nefficient than that and also be able to provide people with the safety \nthat they demand. It is a wonderfully encouraging thing in this \ncountry, when we think how many places we go and how many products we \ningest and how many products we apply to our bodies and to our children \nand families, that we have a high sense of confidence that when we do \nthat, it is safe and, by and large, efficient and effective. We don't \nwant to lose that.\n  We also believe in this day and age with all the technology available \nto us that we ought to be able to not give up on safety or efficacy and \nbe able to move that process forward.\n  I thank my colleague from Vermont for yielding.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for yielding.\n  We can all remember 2 years ago when there was a debate on Capitol \nHill about closing down the Federal Government. Rush Limbaugh and \npeople like him went on the radio and said, ``Go ahead and do it, no \none will notice. No one will notice if you close down these Federal \nagencies. They are just a drain on the Treasury and our tax dollars.''\n  But the agency that we are talking about today is an agency you would \nnotice immediately--immediately--because the Food and Drug \nAdministration, as small as it is by Federal standards, is one of the \nmost important. There is not a single thing you buy in the drugstore or \nlook at in your medicine chest at home that the Food and Drug \nAdministration has not taken a look at to make sure it is safe for you, \nyour kids, and your family.\n  That is why this FDA reform bill is so critically important to this \nNation to make sure we make this agency more efficient. I want to \nsalute the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from Massachusetts. \nThey have had their differences on issues, but I think most Senators, \nDemocrats and Republicans, agree reform is needed. This bill is a step \nin the right direction.\n  It is in that spirit that I will offer several amendments. Let me \ntell you about two that I think people should take notice of. If you \nwent out today and decided to buy a car for your family--a few years \nago I went out and\n\n[[Page S9380]]\n\nbought a Ford--you will have your name and address entered into a \ncomputer. If at some later date something is found wrong with that car, \nthe brakes are faulty or there is some mechanism on the door that is \nnot safe, they will notify you, they will track you down, and they will \nsend you a notice. A lot of Americans have received them, ``Come on in \nto our shop, and we will fix your car.'' That is reasonable. None of us \nwant to drive an unsafe vehicle.\n  My amendment says is it not now reasonable, when it comes to heart \nvalves and pacemakers and items like that, that we do the same thing? \nIf you or your loved one is told by the doctor you need a pacemaker, \nyou think long and hard about it but say, ``Doctor, if you think that \nis what I need to live, so be it.'' You go through the surgery, and \neverything works out just fine. Wouldn't you like to be on a list \nsomewhere so that if a defect is found in that pacemaker 6 months, a \nyear, or 2 years later, that you can be notified? That is what my \namendment says. Track and surveillance, find the customers that use the \nproducts. If there is a change, let the customers know, let the people \nknow, so they can go back to their doctor, back to the hospital. I \ndon't think that is unreasonable.\n  The second thing is we want to move some of the drug surveillance, \nfor example, and drug approval off the Food and Drug Administration \ncampus and take it to third-party reviewers. Now, this is being done in \nEurope and other places. It is not unreasonable that we would go to a \nlaboratory and say, ``You do the testing, you read the results; you \ntell us whether this drug is ready for the market.'' I think that is a \nreasonable thing for us to try to do, under supervised \ncircumstances. But my amendment says let us make certain, absolutely \ncertain, that this third-party reviewer does not have an economic \ninterest in the drug company seeking approval. Would you trust a \nreviewer who just happened to have a thousand shares of stock of the \ncompany making the product that he is deciding whether it will go to \nmarket or not? Would you have second thoughts if that person was being \noffered a job by the same company whose drug he is reviewing just \nhappened to get a vacation in the Caribbean last summer at the expense \nof the same company?\n\n  Conflict of interest statutes are important here. If we are going \nbeyond the Federal Government and we are going to have private \nlaboratories doing this, for goodness sakes, let's be certain that \ntheir judgment and decisions are based on sound science and not on \nfinancial gain. That is what my second amendment will do.\n  I think these will move us along toward making the FDA an even better \nagency. There are a lot of critics of the Food and Drug Administration. \nI have worked closely with this administration for over 12 years. Some \nof the finest people in Government are working out there. Sometimes \nthey are frustrated that we wish they would bring things to market more \nquickly. Did you read the newspaper this morning? Occasionally, things \nare moved to the market that aren't safe. Thank goodness, the FDA can \nsay it is time to take the item off the market, or decide the benefits \nare not outweighed by the problems this drug creates. We have to keep \nthis agency strong and independent and above political criticism. The \ntwo amendments which I will be offering on the floor are an attempt to \ndo that.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 25 minutes, \n20 seconds under his control.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 20 minutes, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and friend from \nIllinois for reminding us how important this debate is here on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate. We are talking about the agency of Government \nthat has the prime responsibility for protecting the health of the \nAmerican consumer. We all have an interest in making sure that medical \nproducts are available earlier. Every one of our families have \nbenefited from the innovation and resourcefulness of the medical device \nindustry and from the advances of pharmaceuticals. I doubt there is any \nMember of the body that has not. So all of us want to be able to make \nsure that medical advances will be available to the American public.\n  We are in a situation today where the United States through the FDA \nis leading the world, in terms of approving new drugs as well as \nmedical devices. That has changed from recent years. I think all of us \nhave seen some very dramatic and important progress made in recent \nyears. As I have said many times before, I want to give a tribute to \nthe chairman of our committee who has worked tirelessly on this issue. \nHe has brought together those individuals on our committee and outside \nthat have differing views, all struggling to try and advance the \ninterest of the public health. I think he has made remarkable progress \nin moving us forward to where we are today. But there are important \nremaining items that I hope we can dispose of in the Senate within a \nreasonable time period so that the process could move forward. I take \nexception from the understanding of the language that has been included \nin this bill with regard to ensuring that the consumers of medical \ndevices and users of medical devices have the kind of protection that \nhas been referred to here by my friend and colleague, the Senator from \nConnecticut, and others.\n  I have here, Mr. President, a letter from the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services, which indicates that they have four major concerns with \nthis particular legislation. One of them was the area of cosmetics. \nAnother area is environmental considerations, and another area is \ndevice manufacturing procedures. But the other important area is the \none that I am going to address here today, and that is what I call the \nsafety issue, the fen/phen issue as it applies to medical devices.\n\n  The Secretary, speaking for the President of the United States, has \nidentified this as being a major issue. So when others gather around \nand say, ``Look, we have debated this and discussed it, why are we \nbringing these matters up in this debate at this time?'' The reason \nthat we are bringing it up is, as the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices has recognized, there are very powerful health consequences we \nought to take note of and deal with and that we ought to alter and \nchange.\n  It isn't only the Secretary of HEW. Here is the National Women's \nHealth Network, who points out:\n\n       The network is extremely concerned with the section 404, \n     which prevents FDA from requiring medical device companies to \n     perform complete reviews on the safety and effectiveness of a \n     medical device. This must be amended to give FDA the \n     authority to verify that the label is not false or \n     misleading. Section 404 is a serious danger to women's \n     health, which must be fixed before S. 830 is acted upon by \n     the Senate.\n\n  Then the Patients' Coalition indicates a similar concern. It outlines \nprobably eight or nine major issues and section 404 is one of them.\n  The Consumer Federation of America wrote:\n\n       We are writing in support of your amendment to change \n     section 404 to prevent serious injuries to patients and \n     consumers from medical devices with false or misleading \n     labels.\n\n  This isn't just the Senator from Massachusetts that is saying this. \nHere is the Secretary of HEW saying it. Here are the primary groups \ndefending women's health and consumers' health, all who have joined in \nrecognizing the dangers that this particular provision provides, and \nwhy it is so important that we are going to change it and alter it.\n  The Consumer Federation says:\n\n       Section 404 has been crafted to permit medical device \n     manufacturers of class II devices to limit FDA's review of \n     the safety and effectiveness of a device based upon \n     conditions of use listed on the label. Even if it were clear \n     from the device's technical characteristics that its real use \n     would be for risky purposes, FDA would be prevented from \n     looking beyond the conditions of use on the label.\n\n  There it is. That is what the issue is. The Consumer Federation \nunderstands it. They are pointing out that 404 was crafted to permit \nthe device manufacturers of class 2 devices to limit FDA's review of \nthe safety and effectiveness of a device based upon conditions of use \nlisted on the label. Even if it were clear from the device's technical \ncharacteristics that its real use would be for\n\n[[Page S9381]]\n\nrisky purposes, FDA would be prevented from looking beyond the \nconditions of use of the labels.\n  That is what we are addressing, Mr. President, and why this is \nimportant. Mr. President, all we have to do is look at today's \nnewspapers. Look at this morning's newspapers, the Washington Post, \nWall Street Journal, all across the Nation, talking about the off-label \nuse of pharmaceuticals, those pharmaceuticals that were used on an off-\nlabel basis. That is similar to the issue we are talking about here \ntoday with regard to medical devices, the off-label use of medical \ndevices.\n  But the issue that we have before the Senate this afternoon is more \ninsidious. Why? Because it says that if a medical device company is \nsubmitting an application for a certain use, FDA can't look at any \nother uses even if there is a clear intention--and we are glad to spell \nout what that criteria would be--for example predominant use--to use \nthe device or market the device for another use. That is what we are \ninterested in--having FDA look at the safety and efficacy of a use \nclearly intended by the design of the medical device.\n  I am going to illustrate this in just a few moments. The issue is \nwhether the FDA has the authority to look at whether that medical \ndevice has been tested for the off-label use, which is the clear \nintention of the medical device company. And the answer is, no, they \ncannot. This isn't off-label use of two products that are being put \ntogether and then prescribed by various medical professions. This is \nthe guardian of the American public, the FDA, that is being denied the \nability to look beyond the label at the technological differences of a \ndevice in terms of safety and effectiveness. That is the issue.\n  Now, there are those that say--and we heard the argument by my friend \nfrom Connecticut--that FDA inherently retains that power. If they do, \nlet's spell it out. If we spell it out, we haven't got a problem. But \nthe Secretary of HEW does not believe they have the inherent power. The \nConsumer Federation doesn't believe they have the inherent power. The \nvarious patient groups don't believe they have the inherent power. The \nvarious groups that are out there protecting the public, virtually none \nof them believe they have the inherent power. If they have it, let's \nspell it out. We can work that language out. We have been attempting to \ndo that for a considerable period of time, but we have not been able to \ndo so.\n  The answer on the other side is, well, we can't anticipate every \npossible use that a medical device might have and we are not going to \nsubmit safety data for every possible use and that FDA shouldn't get in \nthe minds of various doctors using that medical device, for whatever \npurpose. That is not the argument. That will be the argument you will \nhear out here on the floor of the Senate. That isn't what we are \ntalking about.\n  We are talking about a limited number of medical device companies \nthat will go to FDA and abuse this process because they are able to get \nthrough the process with a label that in so many respects matches a \npreviously approved one, but the medical device has an entirely \ndifferent technology that clearly indicates a different intended use. \nThat is what we are talking about.\n  For example, the new lasers that are being approved by the FDA \nlabeled as general lasers that are for cutting various tissue, but \nclearly designed to treat prostate cancer. We want the FDA to be able \nto say, if you are going to use that for prostate cancer, we want to \nmake sure that it is safe and efficacious. We don't want to permit the \nmedical device industry to submit false and misleading statements.\n  That is a powerful statement. But I daresay if they are going to \nsubmit a statement that says they are going to use a particular medical \ndevice for one purpose and FDA can demonstrate that the company has \nintended the device for another purpose, and they are already involved \nin, advertising and promoting that particular medical device in \ncountries all over Europe for an entirely different purpose, I say that \nis false and misleading. The Members of the U.S. Senate are going to \nhave a chance to decide whether or not they are going to stand and say \nwe will not permit the medical device industry to submit false and \nmisleading information on labeling. We will see how that vote will go.\n  We include false and misleading under what they call the PMA's, which \nmeans the various medical devices that have to go through a more \nelaborate procedure. We have protections against false and misleading \nadvertising on that. But we are going to say that the American public \nshouldn't be assured that when the medical device industry submits a \nparticular product, that they do not submit information that is false \nand misleading. And what we mean by that is that they have an intention \nto use that various medical device for an entirely different purpose \nfor which there have not been adequate safety standards established or \nsafety records advanced. That is the issue, Mr. President.\n  That is a very, very important health issue. It is a very important \none. You can say it is only one section out of a whole piece of \nlegislation, but it is very important. First of all, let me review very \nquickly about how medical devices are approved in the FDA, so that we \nunderstand and put this into some criteria.\n  I want to go through examples of some of the problems that we are \nfacing today. I'd like to let the American people make judgments and \ndecisions about whether they think adequate safety information should \nbe available for digital mammography and digital diagnostic x rays. Let \nthe American people judge whether these devices should be used in \nsurveying women who may have cancer when they haven't been approved for \nthat.\n  Mr. President, let's get back to where we are today. In the light of \ntoday's revelations about fen/phen should we be thinking about a \nprovision in this bill that would allow device manufacturers to get \ntheir products approved for off-label use on the basis of a false and \nmisleading label.\n  There are two stories in the Wall Street Journal--one yesterday and \none today--as well as one in the Post today, which tell us why the \nSenate should give a resounding ``no'' to this fen/phen device \ndivision.\n  The first article explains in detail how an unscrupulous drug company \nengaged in a broad conspiracy to illegally promote the use of a product \nfor treatments that have not been shown to be safe and effective. This \nconspiracy involved the laundering of money, deceptive deals, and \nhospital physicians' coercion of honest employees who objected to these \ncorrupt practices. Fortunately, companies which engage in these kind of \nfraudulent practices are the exception rather than the rule. But it is \nprecisely the exceptions that make a strong FDA so critical.\n  The second story outlines the tragic results of off-label use of two \napproved drugs, dexfenfluramine and fenfluramine. These two drugs, used \nin unapproved combination for weight reduction, were found to have \ncaused irreversible heart damage in thousands of women. In addition, \nthere are early revelations that fenfluramine phentermine, known as \nfen/phen, had also caused severe heart damage.\n  This is truly appalling--women receiving medical assistance for \nweight reduction, assistance they have been led to believe was entirely \nsafe but which has not been tested adequately for that use--ended up \nsuffering severe heart damage.\n  The provision that is before us, rather than increasing protection \nfor American consumers against products that have not been safe and \neffective, would actually reduce those protections. It would permit a \ndevice manufacturer to design a product for one use and falsely claim \non the label submitted to the FDA that the device was for a different \nuse. The FDA would be barred from protecting consumers. It would \nrequire the FDA to accept the manufacturer's label at face value. The \nFDA under this legislation has to accept the labeling that the \nmanufacturer has put forward, even if it were false or misleading. Fen/\nphen should teach us that the American consumers deserve to be \nprotected against unsafe product uses. But the provision before us goes \nin exactly the opposite direction. That is why the President has \nthreatened to veto it. That is why a broad coalition of consumer health \ngroups oppose it. And that is why the Senate should reject it.\n  Mr. President, as we know, there are two categories of medical \ndevices. Let me give a brief explanation of how the\n\n[[Page S9382]]\n\nFDA regulates and clears medical devices for marketing. It will help \nclarify the need for this amendment.\n  Under the current law, the manufacturers of new class I and class II \ndevices get their products onto the market by showing that they are \nsubstantially equivalent to devices already on the market. For example, \nthe manufacturer of a new laser can get that laser onto the market if \nit can show the FDA that the laser is substantially equivalent to a \nlaser that is already on the market.\n  Similarly, the manufacturer of a new biopsy needle can get that \nbiopsy needle onto the market by showing that it is substantially \nequivalent to a needle already on the market. These manufacturers are \nobligated to demonstrate substantial equivalence to the FDA by showing \nthat the new product has the same intended use as the old product, and \nthat the new product has the same technological characteristics as the \nold product. If the new product has different technological \ncharacteristics, these characteristics must not raise new types of \nsafety and effectiveness questions in order for the product to still be \nsubstantially equivalent to the older product.\n\n  So, if the product is substantially equivalent and doesn't raise new \nsafety effectiveness questions, it moves on through. The logic of the \nprocess for bringing medical devices onto the market is simple. If the \nproduct is very much like an existing product, it can get to market \nquickly, but if it raises new safety or effectiveness questions, those \nquestions should be answered before it gets on the market.\n  This process for getting new medical devices on the market, commonly \nknown as the 510(k) process, is considered by most to be the easier \nroute to the market. That process accounts for how 95 percent of all \ndevices get to the market. Devices that are not substantially \nequivalent class I or class II devices already on market must go \nthrough a full premarket review. Thus, device manufacturers have an \nincentive to get new products on the market through the 510(k) process. \nIn fact, well over 90 percent of the new devices get on the market \nthrough the submission of a 510(k) application. Section 404 of the bill \nprohibits the FDA from requiring safety and effectiveness data on any \ndevice following the 510(k) route except for uses the manufacturer \nchooses to put on the label, even if the label is false and \nmisleading--even if the manufacturer says, ``We are just going to use \nit for cutting tissue, we are not going to use it for prostate \ncancer,'' knowing full well that they intend to use it for prostate \ncancer. All the world knows that they are going to use that device for \nprostate cancer. The FDA is prohibited from saying, ``Let us see where \nthe safety is.'' Where is the safety information on that? That, Mr. \nPresident, is the issue.\n  Let me give you a few more examples.\n  On the biopsy needle for breast tumors, the needle is labeled for \nperforming a biopsy. But the design clearly indicates that it is \ndesigned to remove tumors. Here you have a case where you have a small \nneedle with a very narrow opening at the one end which is used for \ntesting a biopsy of a particular tumor. Now the manufacturer comes in \nwith a much broader needle, a much wider needle, and says, ``Look, our \nneedle is for the same thing, just to biopsy the tumor.'' The design \nclearly indicates that it is built to remove tumors. Under the bill \nlanguage, FDA could not ask for safety and efficacy data for the \nneedle's use for tumor removal, even though that is clearly indicated \nby the designer of the device. The company comes in, and says, ``Look, \nwe have a biopsy needle right here. Sure, ours is a little larger. But \nthis biopsy needle is really absolutely intended to do the same thing \nas the others out there and, therefore, we are substantially \nequivalent,'' even though they are out there advertising that this \nneedle can be used for removing a tumor. They don't have to provide any \nsafety information about how safe or effective that device is for the \nremoval procedure.\n  There is also the ``laser for cutting'' issue. The labeled use is for \ngeneral cutting. But the laser has been adapted specifically and \nclearly to cut prostate tissue. Under the bill language, FDA could not \nask for safety and efficacy data for cutting prostate tissue.\n  Digital mammography is currently approved and labeled for diagnostic \nx rays--which are used to confirm the suspicion of a breast tumor. If \ndigital mammography is clearly going to be used for screening, based on \nthe design of the instrument, which requires a higher degree of \naccuracy, FDA should be able to look at the effectiveness of that \ntechnology for that use. Without this assurance, too many women may \nundergo biopsies or be misdiagnosed. But this bill would prevent FDA \nfrom asking for the data needed to protect women.\n  Orthopedic implants--plates and screws for long bones--some implants \nare made to be removed after the bone has healed and, therefore, \nlabeled for short-term use. But if the FDA determines from the design \nof the device, or from the particular materials that the implant will \nclearly be left in the patient on a long-term basis, FDA should be able \nto ask for safety and efficacy data. For example, how does the bone \nreact to having the implant there over a long period of time? Is the \nbone weaker? But this bill would prevent the FDA from asking these \nquestions.\n\n  Mr. President, I can go on, and will go on when we have the more \ngeneral debate. But these stories exemplify the issue. The issue is \nsafety. The issue is protecting the safety of the American consumer in \nregards to the use of medical devices which clearly demonstrate that \nthe dominant use of those medical devices differs from what is put on \nthe label.\n  It would surely seem to me that men and women of reason would be able \nto work this out in a spirit of order to provide those protections. But \nwe have been unable to do so. Being unable to do so we should \nunderstand the real implications. As when you have the off-label use of \nfen/phen, and the concern of the American people and all of the \nnewspapers all over the country. You would think that here in the U.S. \nSenate we would be thinking about how we are going to provide further \nprotections for the American people instead of fewer protections. Here \nin this particular medical device provision, we are hamstringing the \nFDA and its ability to gather data on safety and efficacy when it is so \nclear that the devices are going to be used for in a manner that \ndiffers from the one claimed.\n  That is why many of us--not only the administration, but many public \nhealth groups and organizations that represent women--have been so \nconcerned about this issue.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized to speak for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I think I would like to talk a little \nbit about where we are right now in the process.\n  We had an agreement this last weekend which would have allowed us to \ndispose of this bill without the necessity of going through the cloture \nprocess. But then fen/phen happened. All of a sudden the Nation is \nalarmed and concerned, and reasonably so. But to bring the \npharmaceutical fen/phen issue into the device issue is disingenuous. \nThe situation with fen/phen is that two different, approved drugs were \nused in combination on the basis that doctors found out that when used \nin combination they were more effective in achieving their purpose of \nreducing weight. It was determined by some astute doctors who noted \nthat there were some problems being caused with respect to heart valves \nthat there was a relationship between those problems and the drug \ncombination. This was brought by the doctors to the attention of FDA, \nand the FDA immediately alerted the marketplace and called for a prompt \nin-depth evaluation. On the basis of further data the companies \nvoluntarily removed them from the market.\n  Now we are talking about a very, very different issue when it comes \nto the device issue discussed by the Senator. For instance, let's go \nback to fen/phen. If a drug company had to test its drug in combination \nwith every other drug that is on the market with which it might \nreasonably be expected to be used in combination, it would take decades \nbefore anything would be approved. Right now I have had a whiplash. I \nam taking two different drugs to\n\n[[Page S9383]]\n\nmanage the injury. But I don't think anybody has done a study to figure \nout whether Ibuprofen and the other drug I am taking is going to create \nsome problem for me. I hope they don't spend all of that time \nresearching that question because we would never get anything approved. \nThat is certainly the case with the devices, we must not allow the FDA \nto endlessly question device manufacturers about how physicians might \nor might not use their product in the future, especially if the \nmanufacturer does not seek permission to market or promote for that \nuse.\n  Again, we had an agreement going into this week that we would argue \nthis device thing out, and then we would vote on it. Now that is off \nbecause of fen/phen. So we are now in the a post-fen/phen situation.\n  But let us remember that we just had a vote. It was 94 to 4 that we \nought to go forward. Why? Last week we were delaying consideration over \n6 pages of a 152-page bill, we are now talking about 2 pages of a 152-\npage bill. I agree that section 404 is an important issue. We need \nsection 404 to correct problems at FDA.\n  Also, I am concerned that my good friend from Massachusetts is \ngetting into an emotional argument about the security of people in this \nNation, and that somehow we are threatening their security by this \nparticular provision--I have been chastised in my own State, and \nperhaps the country, saying I am threatening the lives of all Americans \nwith this bill. That is life in politics. You have to take that.\n  Let me talk about the issue that we have with respect to the devices.\n  While the past has been marked by advances for both patients and the \neconomy, the present is increasingly troublesome, and the future is by \nno means assured. For both premarket-approved products and the 510(k) \nproduct--that is, nearly identical products--the FDA's review \nrequirements have become more burdensome and are taking more time. This \nhas resulted in the delay of approving new devices. That is the issue \nhere. Should we have to wait years to get something which will help us, \nhelp our health, help save our life, because FDA wants to explore \nhypothetical uses of the product by physicians, acting on their own \ninitiative?\n  This has resulted in the delay of approving new devices. Furthermore, \nthe current regulatory system is not keeping pace with medical \ninnovation. U.S. patients face delayed access to the newer, more \nadvanced generations of devices. In some cases, Americans are going \nabroad to take advantage of these technologies. U.S. device firms are \nthemselves moving production and research facilities to other \ncountries.\n  A study conducted by Medical Technology Consultants, MTCE Ltd., found \nthat patients in the United States wait up to three times as long as \ntheir European counterparts for Government approval of new medical \ndevices. The study also found that higher risk, breakthrough medical \ndevices were approved in Europe within 80 to 120 days, provided the \nmanufacturer has passed an EU facility inspection, which is completed \nwithin 120 days. Similar devices take an average of 773 days to be \napproved in the United States. New lower risk devices entered the \nEuropean market with no delay once a manufacturer has passed the \ninitial facility inspection. Similar devices take an average of 178 \ndays to be approved in the United States.\n  The FDA already takes four times as long to approve breakthrough \nmedical devices as is allowed by U.S. statute--it has to do them \nfaster--according to the Health Industry Manufacturers Association, \nHIMA. The approval times for these devices have nearly doubled since \n1990. The FDA's record on approving incremental improvements to \nexisting devices is similar, with approval times also nearly doubling \nsince 1990. Manufacturers will not continue to research and develop \ndevices in the United States--they will all be overseas--if they face \nsuch egragious delays. Patients presently have to wait for devices \nstuck in the FDA's pipeline, and manufacturers have little incentive to \nbring new devices into that pipeline in the first place.\n  According to another study conducted by the Wilkerson Group, a New \nYork-based independent consulting firm, FDA delays in approving devices \nwill lead to the loss of U.S. jobs to nations where approval processes \nare more streamlined--an estimated 50,000 jobs over the next 5 years. \nGovernments in Ireland, the Netherlands and elsewhere have already \nbegun to highlight the impediment of FDA regulatory delay in their \nmarketing materials to attract United States businesses overseas. Such \nactions will erode our Nation's medical research infrastructure over \ntime.\n  So we are going to be getting them all from Europe. That is not going \nto help us obtain better health care for our citizens.\n  I would say one of the problems we have had, and the reason we have \nPDUFA and everything else, is to try to help the FDA be more efficient \nand effective in getting through their duties. It is important that we \nbecome more effective and efficient in reviewing these devices. I point \nout we here in this country have a wonderful record, but it can be a \nbetter record.\n  Certainly another thing I would like to point out--why are the \npatients' representatives in favor of amendments that we have and \nconsumers opposing them at times? Because consumers, obviously, are \nlooking at it from a different perspective. They are not ill. They \ndon't need it. So they say, ``Don't do anything that might hurt us. It \nis better to be safe and take a long time and delay it, than it is to \nput it on the market.'' That's fine. But if you are a patient, you say, \n``Hey, wait a minute. I am willing to take a little risk. I am willing \nto take a little risk. I'm in bad shape.'' So you have to keep those \nthings in mind when you listen to the arguments. In most all the cases, \nthe patients certainly are on one side, in a sense, and the consumer is \non the other.\n  With that, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for yielding time. \nVery briefly, what we have done in the overall FDA law is create an \nincentive for companies, under section 510(k) to get approval of class \nI and II devices, to go out and pick out existing devices and say the \nnew device is substantially equivalent. This, I think, provides \npressure for companies to go out and simply say we are going to do \nexactly what these other devices do, even though their new design might \nhave many more capabilities. This is not an academic problem.\n  Take, for example, the issue of a biopsy needle. Typically these \nneedles are very small. They remove a very small amount of tissue, \nabout the size of a pencil tip. If the FDA was presented with a new \nbiopsy needle that was claimed to be simply for biopsy of tissue but in \nfact removed 50 times that amount of tissue, a much, much larger bit of \ntissue, the suspicion would be that this is not just for biopsies, it's \nactually to remove the lesion. Yet under this law, today, as we speak, \nthey could not look behind that claim on the label. They could not look \nbehind it and say, give us some data about the removal of lesions. This \nis a serious public health problem. That is what we are addressing \ntoday. I hope, with Senator Kennedy's direction and leadership, we can \nresolve this along with Senator Jeffords and his colleagues. I yield \nthe remainder of my time.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield to the Senator from Indiana 2 minutes.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I don't intend at this particular point to \nget in a specific discussion over section 404. I just urge--clearly, \nthere is a differing point of view. We heard from Senator Dodd from \nConnecticut, who was involved in the drafting of the bill; and Senator \nJeffords from Vermont, the committee chairman, explained this. This was \nsomeone who was directly involved in the 404 question and has been \ndrafting the language and negotiating the language. This is clearly an \nissue we are going to have to address. The committee debated it. There \nhas been negotiation subsequent to that. We are now in a position where \nwe are going to have to agree to disagree. I just urge the Senator from \nMassachusetts, at the earliest possible time--I know it can't be done \ntoday given the problems we\n\n[[Page S9384]]\n\nhave with scheduling the Interior appropriations bill--to bring the \namendment to the floor and then let us have the debate and then let the \nSenate work its will by vote and then go forward. Hopefully, this is \nnot something that is going to further delay passage and then \nimplementation of FDA reform.\n  Every day we delay, many things happen, most of them bad. No. 1, we \nmove ever closer to September 30, at which time the PDUFA, the drug \nprescription user fee which is used to provide the individuals with the \nresources necessary to expedite drug approval, expires. That expires on \nSeptember 30. The House has yet to act on this. They are waiting for \nthe Senate to act. We are trying to wrap up appropriations bills. The \nclock is ticking and we need to move forward with this so we can allow \nthe House to go forward, get into conference, get the bills back here.\n  I wonder if I can ask additional time from the Senator from Vermont? \nMaybe an additional minute or two. I don't know how much time is left.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. The Senator can have whatever time he wants.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. President, it is going to be extraordinarily difficult for us to \nfinish our business on this bill, unify the different positions between \nthe House and the Senate, and get the legislation to the President of \nthe United States before September 30 so we do not have to lay off \npeople at FDA, so we do not have to further delay review of devices and \ndrugs and health-saving and health-improving and lifesaving products \nfor the American people. That is what all this is about, is expediting \nthe process; not to short-circuit the process but just to bring some \nefficiencies to the process.\n\n  The United States lags dramatically behind our foreign competitors. \nBut more important than that, we have American citizens who are being \ndenied access to health-improving and lifesaving drugs and devices \nbecause of this huge backlog at FDA. So, we can continue to go through \nthese debates, as the Senator from Vermont said, 2 pages out of 150 \npages--an important part but a small part of the entire, overall reform \nbill.\n  I hope we can come to some reasonable agreement in terms of bringing \nforward amendments; where there are disagreements, agreeing to a time \nlimit on debate of those amendments, let each side present their case \nand then let the Senate vote on the matter and then move forward. \nDelay, delay, delay simply postpones what is, or at least what I \nbelieve is, inevitably going to happen and what should happen. That is \nthat a majority of the Members of the U.S. Senate, on a bipartisan \nbasis, and a majority of the Members of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, on a bipartisan basis, and the vast majority of the \nAmerican people, want to see changes in the current FDA so they can \nbring lifesaving devices and drugs and health-improving devices and \ndrugs safely but efficiently to the marketplace so that people can \nutilize those without having to get on a plane and go to Mexico or a \nforeign country, so we do not have to keep shifting manufacturing \nfacilities and jobs out of the United States into areas which have a \nmore reasonable and effective review process.\n  Many of us thought the device section was resolved and closed and \nthat--at least last week it was presented that the only remaining item \nleft on the agenda was the cosmetics. We went through great drama here \nover the problem with cosmetics. Now cosmetics has been agreed to. All \nof a sudden we are back onto devices. Many of us are concerned that \neven if this issue is resolved, we will suddenly have a new issue \nappear that will further delay the steps that we need to take here in \nthe Senate to move this legislation forward.\n  So, I ask our colleague from Massachusetts if we could at least set \nsome schedule here to ensure that we do not go another week, that at \nleast this week we complete debate on the amendments, move to final \npassage, and then allow the House of Representatives to begin their \nprocess. I am not asking him to respond. It's just a plea here that we \nhave spent 2\\1/2\\ years, and each day we delay we run into problems \nwith reauthorization of PDUFA and we run into serious, considerable \ndelay in terms of bringing in the processes which will allow us to more \nefficiently do the work, the legitimate work, of the Food and Drug \nAdministration.\n  How much time is left? I will be happy to yield whatever time is \nremaining back to the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I just say to my good friend from \nIndiana, as well as the Senator from Vermont, I think if we could work \nthis particular provision out we would probably be able to end this \nlegislation today--tonight. I think this is really the last remaining \nmajor issue.\n  I know the Senator mentions the cosmetic issue and then this new \nissue was raised. This was one of the four items that were identified \nin the President's letter. I have identified this issue previously. We \nhad a brief discussion on section 404 during the cosmetic debate.\n  But this, I believe, is really the last issue. There are other issues \nthat other colleagues have spoken about, but I urge early time \nconsiderations if we are able to resolve this legislation. I shall try \nto do the best I can to continue to work on these issues.\n  If I can ask consent to have 1 more minute and then 1 more minute on \nhis side, too? I ask unanimous consent to have 1 more minute on either \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We will try to work with the Senator hoping that we \nmight now be able to work something out that will meet both the \nlegitimate objectives that the Senator has and the concerns that I have \ndiscussed and share with the administration. I am not suggesting that \nFDA read the minds of all the device companies and determine every \nconceivable way that a device might be used. Instead that they be \nlimited to the very narrow case where there is a predominant or \ndominant use or clearly defined use that would be intended that was not \non the label. Perhaps an advisory group could make these decisions. I \nam not interested in trying to anticipate every possible use, just in \nthose very narrow areas which I think pose a threat.\n  I will try to explore a compromise with both the Chair and the \nSenator. We are going to the Interior bill and then come back to the \nFDA reform bill, but as I indicated to Senator Jeffords earlier I \nthought there could be a very timely disposition of all of the \nremaining amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will say, we will continue to \ncooperate to bring this to an expeditious ending. I thought we had that \nagreement. I am ready to enter another one. I hope by the time the \nInterior bill is over, we will have one. I urge us to work together. I \nyield back whatever time I have.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am not sure what unanimous consent is \nrequired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute, I believe.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute to respond to the remarks of the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts offers \nexpediting of this process. No one wants to keep delaying it. We have \nbeen in negotiation for months, if not years. This particular item has \nbeen discussed, debated, turned upside down, dissected. I think we are \nat the point where the best way we can expedite this is simply to have \nthe amendment offered, have the debate, let the Senate work its will. \nThere are Members on both sides who are willing and able to present the \ncase, and then let the Senate work its will.\n  Having said that, this Senator has on two occasions now responded to \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services, who personally called and \nasked\n\n[[Page S9385]]\n\nthat I look at new language. I said I will be happy to look at new \nlanguage, but it just seems every time we look at new language and make \na concession, there is another issue that pops up. We made 30 some \nconcessions. We don't want to have 31 and then 32.\n  I appreciate the offer of the Senator from Massachusetts, and we will \ncontinue to operate in that spirit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/16/senate-section/article/S9378-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  1998\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Ashcroft amendment is the pending \nbusiness.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I understand that the proponents of the \nAshcroft-Helms amendment are not willing to vote on that amendment \ntoday and wish that vote to take place tomorrow so that they have a \ngreater opportunity to discuss it both here on the floor of the Senate \nand in public. I am firmly of the opinion, because that is the \namendment that deals with the National Endowment for the Arts in the \nmost radical fashion, that it should be voted on first, because if it \nis defeated, there are other amendments, including one sponsored by the \nPresiding Officer, that may get a fairer and broader view if they are \nvoted on in an appropriate sequence.\n\n  So I intend, and I believe the majority leader intends, to try to see \nto it that all Members who wish to speak on the National Endowment for \nthe Arts and any of the four amendments that have been offered and \nspoken to so far have the opportunity to do so and that, at an \nappropriate time tomorrow, we vote first on the Ashcroft-Helms \namendment, second on the Abraham amendment, third on the amendment of \nwhich the Presiding Officer is the sponsor, fourth, the amendment of \nSenator Hutchison of Texas, with I hope relatively small or short \ndebate times in between the amendments, hoping that people will have \nhad the ability to say all they wish to say about them in the course of \ndiscussing all of them together. There is no agreement at this point \nthat this will be precisely the procedure, but I think it is likely.\n  In the meantime, for the remainder of the afternoon, we are open for \nbusiness. There are two controversial provisions relating to Indian \nmatters. I am attempting to get the other Senators, in addition to \nmyself, to the floor as soon as possible to consider those. They will \nnot require a vote but will take a certain degree of discussion.\n  I have been told that Senator Bumpers will be willing to present one \nor more amendments this afternoon, to have them debated and perhaps to \nhave a vote by early this evening. Assuming that he and/or his staff \nare within hearing, I hope that he will come to the floor as soon as \npossible and present his amendment and will notify his opponents or ask \nus to notify his opponents of the fact that he is doing so, so that we \ncan talk about them.\n  We should not waste this afternoon, Mr. President. If we get some \nbusiness accomplished today, there is still a very real possibility \nthat we can finish debate on the Interior appropriations bill by \ntomorrow evening and go on to other questions. The debate so far has \nbeen healthy. I look forward to any Member who wishes to come to the \nfloor and propose an amendment. With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes, I will be happy to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to ask the Senator a question. I \nthink he knows I am interested in the two Indian issues, and I gather \nat some point he is going to try to get the three or four Senators who \nhave been working on this with him here?\n  Mr. GORTON. I asked, or caused to be asked, Senator Campbell, \nchairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, Senator McCain, yourself, \nSenator Stevens, and Senator Inouye to gather together as soon as most \nof us can make it. I think the lead in that is Senator Campbell as \nchairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs. As soon as we can arrange \nthat, even if we are on something else, I will see if we can interrupt \nand get this part of the bill completed.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator very much.

Mr. President, the competency and appearance of \nintegrity, if not the integrity itself, of the Department of Justice \nwas called into sharp question when Attorney General Reno, FBI Director \nFreeh, and CIA Director Tenet briefed the Senate Intelligence Committee \nlast Wednesday and the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee on \nThursday.\n  In last week's briefing, the CIA Director advised that an individual, \nreferred to here as ``X'', who had been identified in many news \naccounts as a major foreign contributor to political campaigns and \ncampaign committees, has made significant contributions as part of a \nplan of the Government of China.\n  The CIA Director further advised that the CIA obtained that \ninformation about ``X'' from the FBI, and it only put the FBI \ninformation on ``X'' together with the news reports on ``X'' after an \nanalysis which was made following a request by Senator Bennett at the \nJuly 1997 FBI-CIA briefing of the Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  The FBI Director advised that the information about ``X'' had been in \nthe FBI files since September or October of 1995 on one report and \nsince January 1997 on a second report. The FBI Director advised that \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee was not told about that information \nat the July 1997 briefing because the FBI did not know it had the \ninformation.\n  These disclosures raise a fundamental question of whether the FBI \ndeliberately withheld the information or was not competent enough to \nknow what information it had in its own files. Either alternative is a \nstrong indictment of the FBI.\n  With the new information on ``X,'' the question is: Where do we go \nfrom here on dealings with the Department of Justice and the FBI?\n  When the FBI Director said the FBI did not know the FBI had the \ninformation on ``X'' in its files, based on my extensive dealings with \nDirector Freeh, I accept and believe that he personally did not know \nthe FBI had the information in its files. Frankly, I am not so sure \nthat others in the FBI did not know of the import of that data.\n  This matter obviously adds fuel to the fire on recent questions about \nthe FBI and Director Freeh's leadership of that agency. There are \nquestions on many matters, including the FBI laboratory, the FBI's \nhandling of the interrogation of Mr. Richard Jewel in the Atlanta pipe \nbombing case, the FBI allowing White House people to look at \nconfidential personnel background files, and the FBI's handling of the \nRuby Ridge incident after Judge Freeh became director, as well as \nbefore.\n\n[[Page S9386]]\n\n  But notwithstanding those matters, I believe that Director Freeh is \ndoing his job about as well as it can be done with that giant agency \nwhich is ever-expanding and taking on new worldwide assignments. But I \ndo believe that Director Freeh is going to have to find out what went \nwrong here, take corrective action, including punitive measures, if \nwarranted, and establish procedures to protect against its recurrence.\n  It is really not a very complicated matter. All that is required is \nan index of names like ``X'' who have connections with the Government \nof China and then to cross-check those names against people who have \nappeared in the news media as major contributors to candidates or \ncampaign committees.\n  When I refer to this context, it is obviously not intended to be a \ncomment on any special group. It is hard to understand why that cross-\nchecking of a simple index was not done by the FBI. And it is even \nharder to understand why the Department of Justice investigators did \nnot find out about it, if in fact they did not.\n  In a context where the Attorney General has consistently refused to \npetition the court for appointment of an independent counsel, it may \nwell be that either consciously or subconsciously, those under her \ncommand may be less inclined to pursue, vigorously, leads which may \nembarrass the administration. After all, the fundamental purpose of \nappointing independent counsel was to have someone in charge who was \nnot allied with the administration, not beholden to the administration, \nand not motivated in any way to favor the administration.\n  It is not unusual, as a matter of common experience, for subordinates \nto do what they think their superiors want whether or not they \ncorrectly speculate on their superior's wishes. Beyond giving a clear \nsignal to all the subordinates, an independent counsel would be in a \nposition to press hard on a continuing basis for people to make all \nsearches and analyses which were not done here.\n  Leadership and intensity establish a tone and purpose. From numerous \nindicators, that tone and purpose are not present in the current \nDepartment of Justice.\n  The Attorney General said at last Thursday's briefing that she was \n``not comfortable now'' to discuss cooperation with the Governmental \nAffairs Committee but would ``want to sit down and talk with the \nDepartment of Justice task force.''\n  There are two problems with her statement. First, she had ample time \nto discuss the matter with the task force since she had met with the \nIntelligence Committee the day before and certainly had some advanced \nknowledge prior to that meeting. Second, she has continually said she \nwould be willing to consider our request, but consistently there has \nbeen no followup.\n  The Governmental Affairs Committee was further advised at last \nThursday's briefing that if in the future the Department of Justice \nfound information like that on ``X'', they would ``very seriously \nconsider and talk about bringing that information to the committee.'' \nThat is palpably insufficient.\n  An independent counsel should be appointed so that the individual can \npress to obtain all such information on a continuing basis and so that \nthere is no doubt about the duty of all units in the Department of \nJustice, including the FBI and other governmental agencies, to follow \nthe direction of the independent counsel.\n  In short, Mr. President, we have a situation here where the FBI has \ninformation in its files since September or October 1995--almost 2 \nyears ago--and other information since January 1997. That information \nis very important in linking an individual who is reputed to be a major \ncampaign contributor, as noted in many news accounts, with a plan of \nthe Government of China. Yet, that information was not made available \nto the Governmental Affairs Committee, and on the representation of the \nFBI not even known to the FBI.\n  It came to light only because the FBI provides that information to \nthe CIA. And the CIA had done an independent analysis at the request of \nSenator Bennett. Absent that request by Senator Bennett, absent the \nindependent analysis of the CIA, today, we would not have that \nimportant link as we seek to understand the puzzle, put together the \npieces on the so-called dotted lines, and understand what is going on \nin this matter.\n  If we had independent counsel vigorously pursuing these matters and a \nclear-cut understanding throughout the entire Department of Justice and \nall Federal agencies, then we would have a realistic opportunity to get \nto the bottom of whatever is going on and take the corrective action.\n  This is another link that I suggest is a very, very powerful link in \nthe chain of evidence and circumstances really demanding appointment of \nindependent counsel.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  In the absence of any other Senator seeking recognition, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/16/senate-section/article/S9385-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9386-S9406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  1998\n\n  The Senate continued with consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1188\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am aware there are other Members of \nthis body who are going to be coming to the floor to speak on other \namendments. However, because of the absence of debate at this moment, I \nwill add additional thoughts to the thoughts I have already expressed \nregarding the need to cease funding the National Endowment for the \nArts.\n  I have made my position clear here, and I hope I can add something by \nway of suggesting that there are a variety of reasons why it is time \nfor us to stop spending the hard-earned resources of taxpayers to \ntheoretically support or engender culture or the arts in this country.\n  I find it somewhat amusing for individuals to suggest we need to have \na Federal subsidy in order for people to be artistic. For us to come to \nthat conclusion involves us in what is a substantial repudiation of \nAmerican heritage, culture and art.\n  We began as a nation long before the midnight ride of Paul Revere. As \na matter of fact, we remember the poem:\n\n       'Twas late in April of '75.\n       Hardly a man is still alive\n       That can remember that special day and year\n       Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere.\n\n  Those who say you have to have subsidies in order to have art or \npoetry would have to wonder how that poem ever came into existence. Or \nthey might say you have to have a subsidy in order to have quality art. \nWell, I don't know, but I believe that some of the poems and some of \nthe art and some of the literature of bygone days will stand inspection \nvery well and stand in comparison very well with items that have been \nproduced more recently.\n  So I want to say for the first several hundred years of this culture \non this continent we managed to muddle through, but I don't think we \nmuddled through it all. We mastered, through creating things that were \ntruly artistic and truly things of value, the kind of art that would \nspeak to people and that they could understand.\n  I was interested in noting an article by William Craig Rice, who is a \npoet and an essayist, who teaches expository writing at Harvard \nUniversity. As an individual who went to a competing institution, I am \nnot accustomed to citing Harvard University, but you would think if \nthere would be anyone who would be able to have insight about this, it \nmight be someone from Harvard University, and you might expect them to \nbe uniform in their support of the NEA. He lists objections to the NEA. \nHe says that the NEA refused to fund a conservatory in New York City \nbecause its students were required to master the human figure in \ndrawing like the old masters did. They could actually draw people and \nnot just put paint on paper. That disqualified the particular \ninstitution from participating in the NEA funding.\n  He points out that the NEA said that being able to draw people that \nlooked like people would hamper the creativity of artists.\n\n[[Page S9387]]\n\n  I wonder whether the NEA has this figured out. I don't believe that \npeople are not creative because they can draw the human figure. I don't \nthink you would want to say that Rembrandt was not a creative \nindividual. I don't think you would want to say Thomas Hart Benton, \nfrom my home State, with his ability to capture people at work, people \nbringing this Nation into existence, people conducting themselves in a \nway that makes America strong--was not a creative individual. He showed \npeople in the fields, he showed people in the Civil War, he showed \npeople at play, but he showed America as America was and for the \nstrength of it. I don't think being able to do that hampers creativity.\n  William Craig Rice, who is a poet and essayist, who teaches \nexpository writing at Harvard, says, ``The NEA recently refused funding \nto an art colony on aesthetic and sociopolitical grounds and then made \nthe inclusion of performance artists and installation artists a \ncondition of future funding.'' So you start criticizing people because \nthey are the wrong sociopolitical mix.\n\n  Here we have the National Endowment for the Arts taking taxpayers' \nresources, trying to impose on people some political correctness or \nsociopolitical correctness, the right kind of mix, in order to satisfy \nthe bureaucracy. These kinds of things--denying funding because they \ninsist that people learn how to draw so that they are recognizable \nfigures, denying funding because there is an inappropriate \nsociopolitical mix among the artists--sound to me like Government \nmanagement of what people are thinking and of the kind of people with \nwhom they would associate. It seems to me that is not what we earn \nmoney for and pay taxes for: so Government could discriminate against \nsomeone because they were not of the right sociopolitical mix.\n  Mr. Rice, of Harvard University, further writes that ``Nowadays, NEA \ngrants are weighted toward multiculturalism, a political cause.''\n  I wonder if, really, we as Americans want to try to foster and \nadvance political causes through a subterfuge which we might label as \nthe National Endowment for the Arts.\n  Now, his is not the only voice that has been raised in the arts \ncommunity against the NEA. His is not the only voice which has alleged \nthat the NEA is really an enemy of the arts, which he does say. He puts \nit this way: ``The marketplace, with its potential for democratic \nengagement and dissemination, is hardly the enemy of the arts. The \nburgeoning American theater of the 19th century owed nothing to \nWashington. In fact, any system of selective, expert-dictated federal \nsupport for the arts would have been anathema to the rollicking \nimpresarios of that era.'' He says had we had a National Endowment for \nthe Arts a century ago, it would have hurt the arts in America, it \nwould have curtailed, it would have stifled the creativity of \nindividuals in the arts community.\n  Responding to a written piece by Robert Storr and Lawrence W. Levine, \nRice puts it this way: ``What both authors fail to recognize in their \nown examples is that the NEA actually harms artists and the arts by its \nmethods of selective sponsorship and top-down control.''\n  America prides itself on the freedom of expression, free speech, the \nability of people to stand and speak their mind, and America has also \nunderstood that speech is not merely what you say but it is your \nability to communicate. If you want to communicate artistically, in \npoetry, graphically or pictorially, that is one of the privileges and \nrights of an American, within certain bounds of decency to protect \nchildren and others from obscenity. We say you are entitled to be able \nto express yourself. We have never thought that the Government should \nbe meddling in the way people express themselves. It should not be \nsubsidizing one person's expression as opposed to another person's \nexpression.\n  Here is a good reason for it. Here the author says, ``The NEA \nactually harms artists and the arts by its methods of selective \nsponsorship and top-down control.''\n  We have to measure what is meant by free speech. I don't think we \nwould say that one of the things included in free speech is top-down \ncontrol. The control of speech is the kind of thing we associate with \nother cultures.\n  Now, we know about what happened in Eastern Europe, we know what used \nto happen in the Soviet Union, and we abhor what we hear about the \ncontrol of communication in China. Yet we have an arts bureaucracy \nwhich is saying to the arts community, if you want to have the favor of \nyour Government, you have to be willing to participate in a system of \nselective sponsorship and top-down control.\n  To put it additionally, Jan Breslauer, of the Los Angeles Times, in a \nspecial to the Washington Post said it this way: The effect on the \nAmerican art system is ``pigeonholing artists and pressuring them to \nproduce work that satisfies a politically correct agenda rather than \ntheir best creative instincts.''\n\n  You have to understand, it takes me a minute to put this in \nperspective. Artists might operate at their best creative instincts in \none system and they might distort or twist what they would otherwise \nsay in order to satisfy something else in the other. She is saying that \nthe National Endowment for the Arts pigeonholes artists, it gets them \nto create within a very confining space, a space they didn't create, \nbut a place where they would be put if they wanted to satisfy the \nbureaucracy. Then it says it pressures them to produce work that is \npolitically correct rather than work that is the best of what they can \noffer.\n  America succeeds when it operates at its highest and best. America \nfails when it accommodates or induces people to operate at their lowest \nand least. I think it is tragic that we have in the National Endowment \nfor the Arts what is confessed by the art critic of the Los Angeles \nTimes, the person who spends her endeavors studying art and commenting \non art, a situation where artists are pigeonholed and pressured to \nproduce work that satisfies a politically correct agenda rather than \nproducing work that reflects their best creative instincts. I think \nthat is a pretty serious charge.\n  I think there are other reasons why the National Endowment for the \nArts ought to be zeroed out in funding. It does not spend money well. \nIt is not really something authorized under the Constitution. The \nfounders of this country considered it, they voted on it, they rejected \nit. Somehow, the elasticity that some people find in the Constitution \nis supposed to now grow with the document to include something that no \none ever voted to ratify as part of the Constitution but somehow it is \nappropriate now but it was not appropriate back then.\n  The National Endowment itself is not an efficient organization. It \nspends 20 percent of its resources on overhead, so that by sending the \nmoney to Washington, DC, we get a 20 percent shrink factor immediately \njust by including the bureaucracy in that which we are pursuing.\n  So my judgment is that we ought to think carefully about saying what \nthe House has said. Let's stop. This thing was never intended as a \ngovernmental responsibility by those who constructed this country and \nfounded it and developed the Constitution to limit what we would do. \nThis was not to be within the limits. Let's stop the waste of money. \nLet's stop the frivolous things that are done.\n  I was interested to see one of the projects, and I mentioned this \nbefore. This represents a poem funded by the National Endowment for the \nArts. This is not the title for the poem, this is the entirety of the \npoem. I had represented earlier that I think this is the English \nversion of the poem but because this is not a word which I recognize in \nthe English dictionary, it could be some other language version of the \npoem. This poem cost taxpayers $1,500 to write. So it would be about \n$214 a letter we paid for this poem. I wonder if this deserves what \nsome Members of this body have called the need for the Federal \nGovernment to be placing the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval on \nvarious art projects.\n  It is obvious to me that the average American is not smart enough to \nrecognize this as genius and it may take the special imprimatur of the \nU.S. Government to tell us just how profound this is--whatever it is--\nand that we should support this because, well, because Government says \nto support it.\n  There are those who came to the floor yesterday who said we need the \nNational Endowment for the Arts not because it is a big part of arts \nfunding--they recognize it is 1 percent or\n\n[[Page S9388]]\n\nless. The truth of the matter is 99 percent of arts funding comes from \nother sources. They said we need it because when the National Endowment \nfor the Arts funds something, it tells everybody that it is something \ngood and that by putting that sort of Good Housekeeping Seal of \nApproval on it, it lets people know to support it as opposed to people \nbeing able to make up their own minds.\n  I have to concede the argument is partly correct. I don't think the \naverage American would think this is worth $1,500 unless he was told it \nwas by his Government. It may be that, once told by Government that \nthese seven letters are worth $214 apiece, the average American citizen \nwill nod in complete complicity and agreement, and say, ``Well, Thelma, \nI never thought of it that way before, but now that the Federal \nGovernment has told me of the value of those letters, whatever they \nmean, I sure hope we get a chance to do that over and over again.'' \nWell, as a matter of fact, they do get a chance to do it over and over \nagain.\n\n  But the truth of the matter is, there is something more profound than \nthe light that I would make of this poem--would I be making light of \nlight poetry? I don't know whether that means light or not. The truth \nis--and it is a fundamental truth--that the values are not to be \nascertained in this culture by Government and then imposed on the \npeople. The genius of America is that the values are to be developed by \nthe people and imposed on the Government. The genius of a democracy is \nthat people have values that they say should be reflected in their \nGovernment and not that the Government has values that it imposes upon \ncitizens.\n  Similarly, when they said that we need this kind of guidance from \nGovernment so that we will know what to support in the marketplace, \nthat smacks of marketplace planning of other economies. You know, \ncommunism is the system whereby the government decided what should be \nproduced and what should not be produced. It allocated the resources of \nthe culture. It said, well, we are going to have this many potatoes and \nairplanes, and we are going to have this many chairs, and we are not \ngoing to allow the marketplace to operate. They tried that for 70, 80 \nyears. Cuba is still trying it; so is North Korea, and their people are \nin serious distress, and we hear the subject of relief over and over \nagain to try to give them something to eat. But in this country, we \nhave all said that the marketplace should determine this, and we don't \nbelieve Government should decide how to allocate resources.\n  Finally, most of the world has come to that conclusion. The Soviet \nsystem tried to manage production based on the values of the central \ngovernment and say how money ought to be spent, and it collapsed. And \nwhen it came down, it wasn't long before the Berlin wall fell, too. \nThankfully, the people are free there, and they are rejoicing over \ntheir freedom, and the government that was at the center of things no \nlonger tells them what to produce or what not to produce. It is their \nprivilege as free citizens to decide about how things ought to be \nproduced and when and where. The marketplace either rewards them or \npunishes them. If they don't produce things that are particularly good, \nthey don't sell well. That has a way of suggesting that they should \nchange their minds.\n  Here we have the National Endowment for the Arts with the argument or \nsuggestion that it is a good thing to have Government telling people \nfrom the center of the Nation what they should or should not reward \nwith their own support. Well, frankly, that is a failed system. I could \nunderstand short memories, but it seems to me that while we are \ncontinually reminded of the poverty of that system and the abject \nfailure of that system by countries like North Korea and Cuba, we \nshould at least remember long enough to know that we should not be \nembracing some sort of resource allocation strategy in the United \nStates of America whereby we put a Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval \non seven letters that may make some sense somewhere, and say, folks, \nwith our help, you can learn to recognize a real buy in art when we \ntell you that it is a real buy.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to make these remarks. I appreciate the \nopportunity for the debate to go forward on the National Endowment for \nthe Arts. I think it is time to say to the American people, who are \ntaxed at a higher level than ever before, we believe you work hard for \nyour resources and we should not take your hard-earned dollars and try \nto tell you what to support and what not to support artistically. We \nshould let you have some of those resources to spend, believing you can \nspend your resources better on your own family than we can to subsidize \nwhat the Government has decided is art.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, I note the presence on the floor of \nSenator Campbell, who is the chairman of the Committee on Indian \nAffairs. He and I and Senator Stevens, Senator Inouye, Senator \nDomenici, and Senator McCain have had extensive discussions over \nsections 118 and 120 of this bill, both of which relate to \nappropriations for or conditions under which Indian tribes operate in \nour American system. Both are of considerable importance.\n  We have reached agreement with respect to the bill and with respect \nto what will take place after this bill has passed. In that connection, \nI think it will be a matter of some intense relief to many of my \ncolleagues that what we are going to do is not require a rollcall vote \nat this point. So it does seem to me, in the absence of any Member here \nwho is willing to send up an amendment that will require a rollcall \nvote, that we should go through this matter. Two of the Senators are \npresent on the floor. I believe others are coming.\n  With that, I yield the floor and hope that the Chair will recognize \nSenator Campbell.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, I have an amendment, but before I send \nit to the desk, I want to make a few remarks on H.R. 2107, the fiscal \nyear 1998 Interior spending bill. I certainly want to commend the \nmanagers, Senator Gorton and Senator Byrd, for their efforts in \nconstructing a spending bill that balances the competing interests of \nthe approximately 27 different agencies and programs included under the \njurisdiction of this committee. As the chairman of the Committee on \nIndian Affairs, I want to acknowledge both Senator Gorton's and Senator \nByrd's efforts in funding Indian programs that are administered through \nthe Bureau of Indian Affairs and Indian Health Service at the levels \nthat meet or exceed the President's fiscal year 1998 budget request.\n  Overall, the funding for these two agencies, which accounts for the \ngreat bulk of Federal spending on Indian-related programs, is \nsignificantly increased over fiscal year 1997 enacted levels to the \ntune of about $150 million. The committee has given priority to funding \nbasic services that are provided to Indian communities through tribal \npriority allocation [TPA] of the BIA and through direct services \nprovided by the Indian Health Service, while also funding several \nimportant construction initiatives, of which there is currently a \ntremendous backlog.\n  While I have supported the priorities given to funding Indian \nprograms, I have shared my concern with many colleagues over two \nprovisions that remain in the bill. Senator Gorton has alluded to those \ntwo sections, section 118 relating to the means testing of TPA funding, \nand section 120 relating to the broad waiver of immunity imposed on \ntribal governments. Both are broad policy-related items that I felt \nshould not be included in this spending measure.\n  I am happy to announce that after several meetings--and Senator \nGorton alluded to one we had yesterday afternoon--with concerned \nMembers on these provisions, an acceptable accommodation has been made \nwith regard to both of these provisions. At the appropriate time, I \nwill offer an amendment that will reflect this agreement.\n  I want to speak briefly to each of these provisions and why, as \npresently written, they would adversely impact tribal government \nactivity to a degree that is all but unknown.\n  As I informed my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee prior to\n\n[[Page S9389]]\n\nmarkup, these two provisions constitute a dramatic departure from \nexisting Federal Indian policy, which is based on promoting tribal \neconomic development, tribal self-sufficiency, and strong tribal \ngovernments. Sections 118 and 120 would seek to condition the receipt \nof TPA funding, requiring in section 120 that Indian tribal governments \nunilaterally waive their immunity from any and all lawsuits. Further, \nsection 118 would require all tribal governments that receive TPA \nfunding to be subjected to a form of means testing analysis of all the \navailable tribal resources as a determining factor in future TPA \nfunding allocations.\n\n  The nature of these provisions would suggest that because TPA funding \nconstitutes approximately $760 million, or over half of the overall BIA \noperating budget, there needs to be some higher level of accountability \nto the Congress and to the taxpayer over how these funds are allocated \nand that the appropriate means to this end is the proposed blanket \nwaiver of immunity and an imposed means testing formula allocation.\n  I want to be very clear and try to inform my colleagues that the \nimpacts of these provisions, if enacted, have yet to be fully \ncontemplated. We can't begin to contemplate what effect they would have \non the native American people.\n  For example, with regard to a broad waiver of immunity, as proposed \nin section 120, we could ask several questions:\n  What are the potential liabilities that would be incurred by the \nexecutive branch agencies who serve as the Federal trustees to Indian \ntribal governments and, therefore, would have to defend the tribal \ngovernments in lawsuits?\n  What specific actions would become the purview of the Federal courts \nunder a broad waiver of immunity? Is it limited to non-Indian disputes \nwith Indian tribes, or could any and all intertribal disputes also be \nheard in Federal court?\n  More importantly, what will be the impact on the Federal courts as a \nresult of section 120? Would it simply clog the courts with more \nlitigation?\n  Further, regarding section 118, we should ask:\n  What resources should be included in any analysis of how to better \nallocate TPA funding?\n  Could the BIA begin to implement any alternative allocation method \nbeginning in fiscal year 1998, which begins in just 2 weeks, without \nany public input or hearings?\n  These are very practical problems that arise when addressing both of \nthese provisions. It is for these reasons that I have strongly \nadvocated that the appropriate authorizing committees be involved in \nfinding practical solutions to these very complex issues. As the \nchairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, I have made it very clear \nthat I am committed to examining these issues through the hearing \nprocess. I have told that to Senator Gorton and have followed it with a \nletter to him guaranteeing that we would hear a bill and we would also \nattempt to have a markup by April 30, 1998.\n  Madam President, I want to thank my colleagues for their wisdom in \nsupporting this accommodation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be temporarily set \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n       Excepted Committee Amendment beginning on Page 52, Line 16\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question before the Senate is the excepted \ncommittee amendment beginning on page 52, line 16.\n  The excepted committee amendment is as follows:\n       Sec. 118. (a) No funds available in this Act or any other \n     Act for tribal priority allocations (hereinafter in this \n     section ``TPA'') in excess of the funds expended for TPA in \n     fiscal year 1997 (adjusted for fixed costs and internal \n     transfers pursuant to other law) may be allocated or expended \n     by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (hereinafter in this section \n     ``BIA'') until sixty days after the BIA has submitted to the \n     Committee on appropriations of the Senate and the Committee \n     on Appropriations of the House of Representatives the report \n     required under subsection (b).\n       (b) The BIA is directed to develop a formula through which \n     TPA funds will be allocated on the basis of need, taking into \n     account each tribe's tribal business revenues from all \n     business ventures, including gaming. The BIA shall submit to \n     the Congress its recommendations for need-based distribution \n     formulas for TPA funds prior to January 1, 1998. Such \n     recommendations shall include several proposed formulas, \n     which shall provide alternative means of measuring the wealth \n     and needs of tribes.\n       (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the BIA is \n     hereby authorized to collect such financial and supporting \n     information as is necessary from each tribe receiving or \n     seeking to receive TPA funding to determine such tribe's \n     tribal business revenue from business ventures, including \n     gaming, for use in determining such tribe's wealth and needs \n     for the purposes of this section. The BIA shall obtain such \n     information on the previous calendar or fiscal year's \n     business revenues no later than April 15th of each year. For \n     purposes of preparing its recommendations under subsection \n     (b), the BIA shall require each tribe that received TPA funds \n     in fiscal year 1997 to submit such information by November 1, \n     1997.\n       (d) At the request of a tribe, the BIA shall provide such \n     technical assistance as is necessary to foster the tribe's \n     compliance with subsection (c). Any tribe which does not \n     comply with subsection (c) in any given year will be \n     ineligible to receive TPA funds for the following fiscal \n     year, as such tribe's relative need cannot be determined.\n       (e) For the purposes of this section, the term ``tribal \n     business revenue'' means income, however derived, from any \n     venture (regardless of the nature or purpose of the activity) \n     owned, held, or operated, in whole or in part, by any entity \n     (whether corporate, partnership, sole proprietorship, trust, \n     or cooperative in nature) on behalf of the collective members \n     of any tribe that has received or seeks to receive TPA, and \n     any income from license fees and royalties collected by any \n     such tribe. Payments by corporations to shareholders who are \n     shareholders based on stock ownership, not tribal membership, \n     will not be considered tribal business revenue under this \n     section unless the corporation is operated by a tribe.\n       (f) Notwithstanding any provision of this Act or any other \n     Act hereinafter enacted, no funds may be allocated or \n     expended by any agency of the Federal Government for TPA \n     after October 1, 1998 except in accordance with a needs-based \n     funding formula that takes into account all tribal business \n     revenues, including gaming, of each tribe receiving TPA \n     funds.\n\n\n  Amendment No. 1197 to the Excepted Committee Amendment beginning on \n                            Page 52, line 16\n\n         (Purpose: To provide for tribal priority allocations.)\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Campbell] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1197 to the excepted committee amendment \n     beginning on page 52, line 16.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 52 beginning on line 16, strike all through page \n     54, line 22, and insert in lieu thereof the following:\n       Sec. 118 Any funds made available in this Act or any other \n     Act for tribal priority allocations (hereinafter in this \n     section ``TPA'') in excess of the funds expended for TPA in \n     fiscal year 1997 (adjusted for fixed costs, internal \n     transfers pursuant to other law, and proposed increases to \n     formula driven programs not included in tribes' TPA base,) \n     shall only be available for distribution--\n       (1) to each Tribe to the extent necessary to provide that \n     Tribe the minimum level of funding recommended by the Joint/\n     Tribal/BIA/DOI Task Force on Reorganization of the Bureau of \n     Indian Affairs Report of 1994 (hereafter ``the 1994 Report'') \n     not to exceed $160,000 per Tribe; and\n       (2) to the extent funds remain, such funds will be \n     allocated according to the recommendations of a Task Force \n     comprised of two (2) representatives from each BIA area. \n     These representatives shall be selected by the Secretary with \n     the participation of the tribes following procedures similar \n     to those used in establishing the Joint/Tribal/BIA/DOI Task \n     Force on Reorganization of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. In \n     determining the allocation of remaining funds, the Task Force \n     shall consider the recommendations and principles contained \n     in the 1994 Report. If the Task Force cannot agree on a \n     distribution by January 31, 1998, the Secretary shall \n     distribute the remaining funds based on the recommendations \n     of a majority of Task Force members no later than February \n     28, 1998.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, I am very pleased to offer this \nsubstitute amendment that our colleagues have worked on, which \naccomplishes several things.\n  First of all, it holds the tribes harmless to the fiscal year 1997 \nTPA levels; it follows the recommendations of the 1994 Joint Tribal/\nDOI/BIA Task Force report by providing funding to the 309 small and \nneedy Indian tribes; it provides $15.5 million for fixed costs and \ninternal transfers; it provides for $17.1 million in increases to \nformula-driven programs; instead of having the BIA or the Congress \nallocate the remainder, it\n\n[[Page S9390]]\n\ncreates a mechanism comprised of Interior and BIA officials and tribal \nrepresentatives from around the country to distribute the remaining \n$27.8 million.\n  I think that is probably all we need for an explanation.\n  With that, I move the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, first of all, I want to express my \nappreciation and high regard for the leadership of my friend from \nColorado, Senator Campbell, on this issue. In his role as chairman of \nthe Indian Affairs Committee, he has taken an active and vigorous role \non Native American affairs. I am proud of the job he is doing. I know I \nreflect the view on both sides of the aisle on the outstanding job that \nhe is doing. We all recognize he is uniquely qualified--uniquely \nqualified, Madam President--to address the issues that affect Native \nAmericans in our society today.\n  Second, I thank the Senator from Washington, Senator Gorton. He has \nstrongly held views on these issues, as we know. Senator Gorton's \nissues have been made clear to those of us on the Indian Affairs \nCommittee, of which he is a distinguished member. He has worked very \nhard on these issues. We have significant and profound philosophical \ndifferences, but our debate and discussions on these issues have been \ncharacterized by respect for each other's views. I have the utmost \nregard not only for his views, but Senator Gorton has long experience \nin these issues dating back to when he was attorney general of the \nState of Washington and tried cases before the U.S. Supreme Court \nregarding Native Americans.\n  I understand his advocacy, and, frankly, sometimes his frustration. I \nam very pleased to see the path of the agreement is that the chairman \nof the Indian Affairs Committee has agreed to hold hearings to consider \nSenator Gorton's legislation, which is the proper way to carry out our \nlegislative work.\n  I did point out to Senator Gorton--and he knows full well--that his \nproposal will probably not receive the majority approval of the Indian \nAffairs Committee. But the purpose of hearings and the purpose of the \ndebate and discussion is to educate our colleagues. I am very pleased \nthat Senator Gorton will withdraw that provision which would have \nprovoked profound, intense, and emotional debate on the floor of the \nSenate and has decided, albeit with some reluctance because of his \nimpatience over his view of our failure to address these issues, to \nagree to take it through the Indian Affairs Committee.\n  I thank Senator Gorton. I really do, because without his agreement \nand his position as chairman of the subcommittee, he had every right--\neven though I disagreed from time to time about legislating on \nappropriations bills--to bring this issue to the floor as part of his \nbill. We proved in recent days that we do give the utmost respect to \ncommittee chairmen and subcommittee chairmen in their work.\n  I thank Senator Stevens, chairman of the full committee. Senator \nStevens, who is as knowledgeable on Native American issues as anyone in \nthis body, played a key role in negotiating the agreement and \nsettlement that we came to, along with my friend, Senator Dan Inouye, \nwho is most respected, along with Senator Campbell, on these issues.\n  Senator Domenici, I might point out, in his usual articulate, \nvigorous, and certainly nonconfrontational fashion played an important \nrole in the spirit of the discussions that we had in Senator Stevens' \noffice.\n  The upshot of it all is that really, Madam President, there are six \nold guys here that know each other pretty well. We know that we have to \nact in what is the best interests of Native Americans, the interests of \nthis body, and, very frankly, the continued bipartisan--indeed, \nnonpartisan--addressing of Native American issues.\n  I think we have a very, very good resolution. It would not have been \npossible without all the figures that I mentioned, and I believe that \nwe will continue.\n  If I could, finally, caution my colleagues, there will continue to be \nissues before this body and the Nation concerning Native Americans. \nThere is population growth, which brings Native American tribes and \nnon-Native Americans into collision with one another. There is an \nincrease in Indian gaming, which in the view of many Americans has made \nall Indians rich. And, by the way, that is far, far from the case. \nThere is a total of about 10 tribes that have become wealthy. There is \ncontinued issues, such as taxation. There will be continued Supreme \nCourt decisions, including the recent ones concerning and affecting the \nState of Alaska.\n  I urge my colleagues to get involved in understanding these issues. \nBut I have some comfort in the knowledge that we have experienced \npeople such as Senator Campbell, Senator Inouye, Senator Stevens, \nSenator Gorton, and Senator Domenici who have many, many years of \nexperience with these issues.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for resolving this very difficult issue \nin a more than amicable fashion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I thank my good friend from Arizona for \nhis comments concerning my participation in the dialogue on this \namendment which has just taken place in my office. Let me state at the \noutset that I believe that in this country there is a period of rising \nexpectations on the part of our Alaska Native and native American \npeoples that there will be more assistance coming to them from the \nFederal Government. And, of course, we all seek to have greater self-\ndetermination on the part of those people who are part of the Indian \ntribes and native peoples of our country. The great difficulty is that \nthis is not just an expectation but an increasing demand now for \nadditional money to enable these peoples to carry out the legitimate \nroles that they have in their own tribal and native organizations. This \ncomes at a time when we are living under a budget ceiling with \ndiminishing resources, as far as the Department of Interior is \nconcerned, caused primarily, in my opinion, because of the vast \nincrease--the enormous increase--in the amount of interest we are \npaying on the national debt, which is literally squeezing out a lot of \nthe items that we were able to afford previously. We are working on \nthat in connection with the balanced budget process. But it is hard for \nmany people on the reservations in the contiguous States and small \nvillages throughout my State, and throughout our Nation, to understand \nthat there is a limit on the amount of money we have available to put \ninto such funds, like the Tribal Priority Allocation Fund. We face this \nyear a situation where there is a budget request for an increase in \nmoney. Yet, because of actions that have taken place in the last 3 \nyears, there are almost 100 percent more tribes in number than we \npreviously dealt with under this account. Those are primarily in my \nState, the State of Alaska. Alaska now has 226 different entities that \nare called tribes by the Department of Interior. In the past, they were \nNative villages. The population of the Native villages belonged to the \nseveral different tribes in our State.\n\n  The net result of this is that, despite the increased request for \nfunds, it is not really possible to meet these legitimate requests, \nand, as I said, in some instances, demands for increased money. This \nhas led to a series of alternative suggestions--some from the Senator \nfrom Washington, as the chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee \ndealing with these issues, and others from those who serve on our \nIndian committee, led by my good friend from Colorado. And I say to the \nSenate that I think it is time that we really have some more \ninformation to deal with this. I know some people are reluctant to \nsolicit that information. But I have joined the Senator from Washington \nin asking the GAO to do some examination into the various types of \noptions that may be available to Congress to deal with these increasing \ndemands which exceed our ability to provide funds in all these areas.\n  It does seem to me that we have to realize, despite our own personal \nfeelings that some people might have on the subject, that the people \nwho live on Indian reservations and in these very\n\n[[Page S9391]]\n\nisolated Indian and Native communities in my State are literally the \npoorest of our poor. They are the people that need our consideration, \nand our help, more than any I know in the Nation. Many of us have spent \nyears trying to find ways to help them deal with their problems. There \nhas been no real panacea. We have not discovered a way yet. But we \nclearly now have increasing participation in governmental affairs in a \ndemocratic way in most of these tribes and villages of our Nation.\n  I am hopeful that these tribal priority allocations will, in fact, be \nused to provide a greater degree of democracy, a greater degree of \nparticipation, and a greater attempt to satisfy the needs of the people \nwho should be receiving the benefits of the Federal money that we \nprovide through the Bureau of Indian Affairs. We all have some serious \nquestions about the BIA. It is an institution that may well have \noutlived its usefulness in the sense of being able to deal with the \nproblems of the native American and Alaska Native people. But, for the \ntime being, it is the only institution we have.\n  As Members of Congress we are vitally interested in the affairs of \nthe Indian tribes and Alaska Native people. We need to take more time \nin trying to not only work out the differences among us, but also work \nout solutions with respect to how the Federal Government can further \nthe aspirations of these people to become more able to deal with the \nproblems of the present and the future and better able to find a way to \npreserve their own culture and have greater participation in American \naffairs.\n\n  For that reason, I am pleased that we have had these meetings. I \nthink that the meetings that have taken place between the Senators who \nare on the Appropriations Committee and the Indian Affairs Committee \nhave been most helpful for us not to only understand one another but \nunderstand some of the problems that are different. They are different \nin Colorado, they are different in Arizona. They are different in \nHawaii. Most people do not think of Hawaii having Indian problems. But \nthere are issues involving the indigenous peoples in Hawaii that are \nvery, very complex. My friend from Hawaii is spending a lot of time on \nthis issue, as is the Senator from New Mexico, and legitimately so.\n  Our constituents, by the way, don't all make the same requests. They \ndon't necessarily seek the same goals. They don't even seek the same \nsolutions to their common goals. What I'm saying is that it is not an \neasy thing right now for us to deal with this issue in appropriations.\n  Therefore, I am delighted as the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee that we have this commitment from the Indian Affairs \nCommittee that there will be hearings on the subject, that there will \nbe really an examination in depth into the possible solutions to the \nproblems presented by these issues arising out of the allocation of \nfunds in the tribal priority allocation.\n  I thank the Senator from Washington for his willingness to step down \nfrom some of the requests he has made of the Senate, and to give us a \nchance to go back and get some basic data and information that will be \nnecessary for us to deal with this. I hope and pray we will deal with \nit next year in a fair and open way, and find a way to ensure that the \nmoneys that are available are made available first to those who have \nthe greatest need for them, and particularly that the people who are \nseeking this money understand what it is for. It is for assistance in \nmaintaining the governance of these tribes and villages. These aren't \nslush money accounts. They are very strictly limited by law, and we \nwant to make certain that they are, in fact, used for the benefit of \nthe people who are on reservations, as well as in those very isolated \nvillages in my State.\n  Let me thank all of the Members who have participated in this. I do \nhope that the Senate will accept our compromise amendment to the \namendment on this subject that was originally in the bill as reported \nfrom our committee.\n  I thank all concerned for their participation.\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, this is a battle day--an important day in Indian \ncountry. And I am certain that Indian country applauds the resolution \nthat has been reached concerning sections 118 and 120 of this bill.\n  So, Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in applauding and \ncommending the distinguished Senator from Washington for making this \nday possible.\n  I am well aware--and I am certain that all of us are well aware--of \nthe controversy that sections 118 and 120 have engendered over the past \n2 months. It has been a difficult time for all of us.\n  Indian country has been vocal in its opposition to these provisions--\nand I believe rightly so--for these sections go to the very essence and \nthe very foundation of our relationship with Indian governments.\n  As my chairman, the distinguished Senator from Colorado, Senator \nNighthorse Campbell, has indicated, section 118 will cause us to \nrevisit the commitments this Government made to Indian nations in over \n800 solemn treaties. Most Americans are not aware that our relationship \nwith the Indian country is based upon treaties, the Constitution of our \nland, decisions of the Supreme Court, and the laws of this land. These \n800 treaties enable the United States to exercise dominion and control \nover 500 million acres of land which once belonged exclusively to our \nNation's first citizens. As Chairman Campbell has indicated, section \n120 would have stripped tribal governments of one of the most \nfundamental attributes of their sovereignty.\n\n  So, in the days ahead, I hope we can focus our attention on the \nconcerns that sections 118 and 120 were designed to address in a venue \nthat will enable the full participation of those who would be most \ndirectly affected by these provisions, the tribal governments and the \ncitizens of Indian country. For it is my sincere belief that the \nsolutions to these matters can be found in Indian country and that the \ntribal government leaders will join us in this effort, and that is the \nway it should be. If we are to legislate, it should be only after we \nhave given careful and thoughtful consideration to these matters. We \nshould have the benefit of all affected citizens, Indians and non-\nIndians, and whatever we come up with ought to have the benefit of some \nconsensus.\n  With this in mind, I have given my personal assurance to the chairman \nof the Interior appropriations subcommittee, the Senator from \nWashington, that we will seriously and deliberately address these \nmatters in the authorizing committee. We have received assurances of \nthe chairman of that committee, Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell.\n  In the interim, I am pleased we have been able to reach agreement and \nthat we have done so in a manner that will enable us to work together \nin partnership with Indian country as well as other affected citizens \nto assure the best outcome within the context of our history, our laws \nand our policy.\n  So, Mr. President, once again, may I applaud and commend my friend \nfrom Washington, Senator Slade Gorton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in the interests of clarity in dealing \nwith two related but distinct issues, I have asked, and the Senator \nfrom Colorado has agreed, to deal separately with two amendments on his \npart to sections 118 and 120. So, while most of the speakers have \ntalked about each, to this point, now, before we vote on the proposal \nof the Senator from Colorado, I am going to address only section 118, \nthe section that calls, in the form in which it was reported by the \nIndian Affairs Committee, for a study not only of the needs of Indian \ncommunities across the land but the resources available to those Indian \ncommunities to support, in whole or in part, their governmental \nentities.\n  These tribal priority allocations, in the amount of just over three-\nquarters of a billion dollars, are directed at the activities, on the \nbroadest possible scale, of the self-governing Indian tribal \norganizations all across the United States, numbering several hundred \nin total. And there are, it seems to me, two distinct questions even as \nwe deal with this appropriation of more than three-quarters of a \nbillion dollars of\n\n[[Page S9392]]\n\nthe money of all of the taxpayers of the United States. The first is: \nIs the historic distribution of money from this account to the various \nIndian tribes done in a fair and rational manner? And, if not, what can \nbe done to improve that method of distribution?\n\n  The second and quite distinct question is whether or not full support \nof Indian tribal governments is a permanent duty of the people of the \nUnited States; a form of entitlement or a matter of discretion in which \nthe people of the United States, in addition to encouraging the \ndevelopment of self-governing institutions, are also entitled to demand \non the part of successful Indian governments an increasing duty of \nself-support of these governing institutions--the tribal legislatures, \nthe court systems, the police systems, and the like, systems that in \nour Federal system are paid for by the people of the United States in \nconnection with this Congress, the people of the States with their \nlegislatures, and the people of cities, counties, and towns with \nrespect to their governing institutions. And we ran into opposition in \nconnection with each of these; a protection of the status quo in \nconnection with each.\n  I took over the chairmanship of this subcommittee 2 years ago, and \nfor 2 years asked the Bureau of Indian Affairs, when it justified its \nbudget, about the formula through which it distributed its moneys to \nIndian tribes, without getting a satisfactory answer. Asked whether or \nnot it had any ability to determine the relative needs of the varying \ntribes in the United States, the reluctant, ultimate answer was, no, \nthe Bureau of Indian affairs didn't have that kind of information, did \nnot know in any detail the income of tribal governments through gaming, \nthrough gambling operations, through natural resource extraction, \nthrough rental of its properties and the like.\n  Moreover, it became quite clear that the Bureau of Indian Affairs \ndidn't care to get that information. The reason that the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs doesn't really care about getting that information is \nthat it does, in fact, believe that these payments are a permanent \nentitlement, a permanent burden on all of the other taxpayers of the \nUnited States, and that, therefore, while perhaps an examination of \nneeds is appropriate, an examination of resources is not appropriate in \nany respect whatsoever.\n  With both of those propositions I disagree. While section 118 that \nexists in the bill today does not change the system and require a \nmandated distribution on the basis of a system of needs, which of \ncourse implies something about the resources that cover these needs on \nthe part of each individual tribe, it became evident that there is so \nmuch disagreement in Indian country with even a determination of the \nfacts on which we can make a later determination of needs and resources \nthat section 118 was unacceptable.\n  The proposal that Senator Campbell has made, and with which I agree, \ndeals rather narrowly with the distribution of the money in this \nappropriations bill, increased by something more than $75 million over \nthe current year, and most particularly with the way in which any \nexcess over last year's distribution and over a formula already \ndeveloped in the Bureau of Indian Affairs will be made. In that \nconnection, it is a significant step and it is something with which I \nagree. Because it is insufficient, however, because it doesn't even \nmention either needs or resources, in my view something else very \nsignificantly is needed.\n\n  Before I get into that, however, much of the debate on the other side \nof this issue, many of the newspaper editorials, have spoken of the \nappropriation for tribal governments, so-called TPA, as an entitlement \nbased on treaty--because there are several hundred treaties with \nvarious Indian tribes, the last of which was ratified in 1868--that we \nare in fact dealing with an entitlement, that we should not look at \nrelative needs, we should not look at the ability to provide for \ngovernments through the resources of Indian tribes at all because this \nis a matter of treaty obligation between the Government of the United \nStates and these various Indian tribes.\n  I wish to make the point, as we look forward to a future debate on \nthis issue, that there is no such treaty right. Mr. President, there is \nno such treaty right. We found one treaty with one tribe that calls for \npayment in perpetuity of several thousand dollars a year. Most Indian \ntreaties, however--and we use here the treaty of Point Elliott in my \nown State, a treaty signed in 1855, that includes a clause very much \nlike this one:\n\n       In consideration of the above cession [that is the lands \n     the Indians were signing away] the United States agree to pay \n     to the said tribes and bands the sum of $150,000 in the \n     following manner.\n\n  And it sets out declining annual payments for a period of 20 years, \nending, presumably, in 1875, or in 1876. That is the typical Indian \ntreaty with respect to a fiscal obligation on the part of the people of \nthe United States. Obviously, that period of time ran out over a \ncentury ago. The optimism with which it was signed, the implication \nbeing that by that time the Indians would be integrated into the larger \nsociety, did not take place, and the Congress of the United States has \ngone through several phases of attitudes toward Indian tribes, toward \ntheir integration, toward their self-determination and the like. We are \nnow in a period of time in which the strong public opinion, and opinion \nin this Congress, is in favor of self-determination, conscious self-\ndetermination in the Indian institutions.\n  The point I am making here is not to disagree with that policy. I \nthink it is a perfectly appropriate policy and one that I have \nsupported. The point that I am making here is that it is a \ndiscretionary policy, and that this three-quarters of a billion dollars \nis appropriated as any other discretionary account is in the Congress \nof the United States. Therefore, it is totally appropriate for us to \ndetermine whether we think the money is being well spent, whether we \nthink it is being fairly distributed, whether we think there is a \nbetter formula, whether we think there should be some obligation on the \npart of wealthier tribes to pay all or part of the cost of their own \ntribal governments.\n  So we have taken a sample number of tribes with respect to this \nyear's distribution, about 20, on this chart. I may say that this is \nnot one of these telescoped graphs that only works between No. 100 and \nNo. 200. This graph goes from zero to $2,452. Tribal allocation per \nperson to the Pequot Tribe in Connecticut from this year's distribution \nis $2,452. That is the tribe with the most successful gaming operation \nin the United States. Unemployment in the Pequot Tribe is zero.\n  At the other end of the scale, the Fond du Lac Tribe, which gets $24 \nper person in its TPA allocation, has 67-percent unemployment.\n  This, of course, doesn't include anything like all the tribes in the \nUnited States. I think it is a fair sampling, and any Member who \ndesires to know where on this scale a tribe in his or her State falls \ncan get that information through us. But you have a range of between \n$24 per capita and $2,452 per capita--a range of 100 to 1. The net \nresult of failing to deal with that issue this year is that the ratio \nwill be greater in 1998 in the bill we are voting on, it will be \ngreater than it is at the present time.\n  The original formula, I think, dates from sometime in the 1930's. \nUnder those economic circumstances, having no relation to the present \nday, these tribes' governing authorities, of course, have various \npowers. Some provide more services than others do. But nonetheless, \neach year's change has made this system worse and is exacerbated.\n  I will show you the same chart in a slightly different form, Mr. \nPresident. This form works from the Rosebuds in the Dakotas, which have \nthe highest unemployment, 95 percent, down to the Pequots that have \nzero. In other words, to the best of our ability to determine need--\nbecause we don't have all of the figures, unemployment figures have to \nbe a shorthand here for need--the most needy tribe gets $225 per \ncapita. Again, the Pequots, $2,400. But if we don't want to take that \none, let's take this one in Alabama; it is $1,195.\n  Interestingly enough, the second highest distribution here is to the \ntribe that has the second highest unemployment. But the obvious import \nof these charts is that there is simply no relationship whatsoever--no \nrelationship whatsoever--between the need, the economic poverty, the \nunemployment on a given Indian reservation and the distribution of \nmoneys to the governing\n\n[[Page S9393]]\n\nbody of that institution from the Federal Government pursuant to these \nTPA's.\n  One further point, of course, in connection with this question about \ntreaties, most of the tribes in the United States are not treaty \ntribes. The Senator from Alaska referred to the fact that by fiat, the \nadministration created, I think, a couple of hundred new tribes in \nAlaska, none of which are treaty tribes, but all of which, by that \nadministrative action, will in a year or so fall into this kind of \ndistribution of money. So the distribution has nothing to do with \nwhether or not tribes are treaty tribes or nontreaty tribes. The tribes \nreally don't have anything to say about the issue.\n  We are distributing the money at the present time in a manner that is \nhighly irrational. As a consequence, Mr. President, Senator Stevens and \nI have authored a letter dated today to the Comptroller General of the \nUnited States in the General Accounting Office, asking for a General \nAccounting Office study of the system I have described here, how we got \nto that system and how we can do better.\n  Our request does, of course, include in it a request to the GAO to \nmake a determination, not only of the needs of the tribes, but of their \nability to meet those needs with their own resources. We may well learn \nfrom the GAO that even it cannot answer that question, because the \ntribes will not release a sufficient degree of information for us to \nmake an intelligent decision. Then we will be told what kind of \nlegislation is necessary so that Congress can deal with this matter in \na rational fashion.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter that Senator Stevens and I \nhave authored to the General Accounting Office be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Appropriations,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 16, 1997.\n     James F. Hinchman,\n     Acting Comptroller General, General Accounting Office, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Hinchman: We are writing to request that the \n     General Accounting Office (``GAO'') immediately undertake a \n     study of issues related to the distribution of funds by the \n     Bureau of Indian Affairs (``BIA'') through Tribal Priority \n     Allocations (TPA). The GAO is requested to complete the study \n     and submit a report by June 1, 1998. The study should address \n     in detail the following:\n       (1) any inequities in the current distribution of TPA funds \n     among Tribes;\n       (2) the results of the distribution of TPA funding in FY 98 \n     (to the extent such results are available);\n       (3) the tribal and non-tribal resources, including tribal \n     business revenue, available to each Tribe for meeting \n     governmental needs;\n       (4) the extent to which each Tribe can or should, in whole \n     or in part, become self sufficient, in terms of its ability \n     to provide government services, through the use of resources \n     available to it;\n       (5) the impact of recognition of new Tribes on TPA funds;\n       (6) recommendations for determining the level of funding \n     needed for a Tribe to provide governmental services; and\n       (7) recommendations for a formula for the distribution of \n     TPA funds that takes into account the disparate needs, \n     population levels, treaty obligations and other legal \n     requirements with respect to the provision of governmental \n     services, and the resources available to each Tribe to \n     provide such services.\n       In undertaking the study the GAO should consider the \n     formulas currently used by the BIA for the distribution of \n     funds for other programs, the formulas previously used by the \n     BIA or other federal agencies for the distribution of funds \n     under the Indian Priority System that was developed after \n     enactment of the Indian Reorganization Act, and any \n     formulas recommended by the 1994 Joint Tribal/DOI/BIA Task \n     Force on Reorganization of the BIA, the Commission on \n     Reservation Economics, the American Indian Policy Review \n     Commission, and any other relevant commissions or reviews.\n       In evaluating the resources available to each Tribe for \n     meeting governmental needs, the GAO should enumerate in its \n     report the nature and availability of the information BIA \n     needs to determine accurately the level of resources \n     available to each Tribe for the provision of governmental \n     services. The report should include recommendations regarding \n     any changes in law that may be necessary in order to obtain \n     such information and what constitutes a de minimus level of \n     revenue for which the cost of reporting or assessing such \n     revenue would outweigh the benefit of obtaining that \n     information. For the purposes of this study, the GAO should \n     consider the term ``tribal business revenue'' to mean income, \n     however derived, from any venture owned, held, or operated, \n     in whole or in part, by any entity on behalf of the \n     collective members of any Tribe. Such term shall also include \n     any income from license fees or royalties collected by a \n     Tribe. The term ``any venture'' includes any activity \n     conducted by an entity, regardless of the nature or purpose \n     of the activity, and shall include any entity regardless of \n     how such entity is organized, whether corporate, partnership, \n     sole proprietorship, trust, cooperative, governmental, non-\n     profit, or for-profit in nature.\n       The recommended formula for the distribution of TPA funds \n     should include a means of assigning priority among Tribes for \n     the allocation of funding, so that those with the greatest \n     need for governmental services and the fewest resources to \n     meet that need, relative to the needs and resources of all \n     other Tribes, are given the highest priority. The GAO shall \n     include as an appendix to the report suggested legislative \n     language to accomplish any changes in law or regulation \n     necessary to ensure the distribution of TPA funds according \n     to the recommended formula.\n       Thank you for your prompt attention to this request. If you \n     or your staff have any questions regarding this request, \n     please contact Anne McInerney of the Senate Subcommittee on \n     Interior and Related Agencies at 224-2168.\n       With best wishes,\n           Cordially,\n     Slade Gorton.\n     Ted Stevens.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. I do want to say this, Mr. President. A number of \ncompliments have been made about the way in which Members deal with \nissues that are highly controversial and on which they have great \ndifferences of opinion. I say, with respect to every one of those who \nhave spoken here today, that I have gotten from each of them the \ngreatest consideration, even when they have disagreed with me. Each of \nthem holds his views as firmly as I do and as significantly as I do.\n  The chairman of the committee has agreed, and will speak to that \nlater, to dealing with a specific bill on the other subject. I haven't \nasked him to deal with this subject in his committee, but I rather \nsuspect that he is going to wish to do so in order to be able to deal \nrationally and intelligently with this issue as well.\n  So I have not gained the goal that I have set for myself when I was \nwriting this bill to make substantive changes, but we are going to be \nable to vote these issues intelligently in the course of the next year \nin a way that has not been done in this Congress, certainly since I \nfirst arrived here in 1981 and probably for some time before that.\n  I believe the debate on this issue is long overdue, Mr. President. I \nam persuaded, quite persuaded, that we can't engage in it in its full \nsubstantive fashion at the present time, for lack of information, and \nthat what we are doing here is going to give us a greater ability to \nmake our points at some time in the future.\n  For their cooperation in seeing to it that we are moving forward on \nthis issue, I thank each one of them, and we will be back here, I \nsuspect, at some time in the future to debate this and the other issue \nmore on its merits. Because the other issue is distinct from this one, \nI hope as soon as others who wish to speak on it have spoken, we will \nadopt the proposal, the amendment proposed by the Senator from \nColorado, and then move on to the second one, and I will have a set of \ndifferent remarks on that one.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Senator from \nColorado, Senator Campbell, and the distinguished Senator from \nWashington, Senator Gorton, would it be appropriate for me to speak now \nor would they rather proceed with something else? If they have to \nintroduce a measure and want to get it done, it will be all right with \nme.\n  Mr. President, I say to my fellow Senators, I think the important \nthing for the hundreds of thousands of Indians in the United States and \nIndian country and the 10 percent of the population of the State of New \nMexico who are Indian people. There are 22 different Indian tribes and \npueblos in my State, living in a completely different style, but all \nIndians nonetheless.\n  The most important thing for them is we have won today. We did not \nlose on the issue of sovereignty as it pertains to their immunity in \ntheir court systems. We did not lose, in an appropriations bill, \nwithout adequate hearings, without adequate information on one of the \nmost complex and historic-filled situations in our Government and our \ngovernance. We won, because those decisions to take away tribal \njudicial immunity, whether it be for 1\n\n[[Page S9394]]\n\nyear or forever, have been withdrawn from this bill.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator, Senator Slade Gorton, for \nwithdrawing his judicial immunity provision. I think it has become \nabsolutely and unequivocally discernible by everyone that is a very \ncomplicated issue.\n  Later, I am sure, in this discussion, we are going to hear proposals \nabout how that is going to be fleshed out and how we are going to talk \nabout judicial immunity, the right to sue Indian tribes or not to sue \nthem in the courts of America and the courts of the States. We are \ngoing to hear discussions perhaps on how hearings ought to be \nstructured to get to the bottom of certain issues where inequity may \nrequire that some modifications be made. But essentially, for the \nIndian leaders and the Indian people who came here by the hundreds, at \nleast, this year, their tremendous concern about what was going to \nhappen to them if this occurred is gone from the scene.\n\n  The Senator from New Mexico is fully aware that the distinguished \nSenator, Senator Gorton, desires to fix some things that he feels are \nwrong with Indian law and the distribution of money, and he feels that \njust as strongly as I feel that we ought to be very careful about what \nwe do and that it is not a simple proposition. Even the two graphs that \nwere put up that show the disparity in incomes and the disparity in the \ndistribution of our Federal resources don't tell the complete picture.\n  The picture is one of a tribal allocation system evolving over time \nfilled with history, filled with court decisions, filled with Senators \nwho have purposely helped certain tribes and not helped others, which \ncauses some of these funding levels to be out of whack.\n  Nonetheless, the needs in Indian country are not debatable, because \nfor every Indian person that has an average American income and an \nopportunity for a job and some assets, tribal or otherwise, that are \nsignificant, my guess would be 50 that don't have these assets. For \nevery one that does, my guess would be 50 don't, 50 are poor. Their \ntribes are poor. Their reservations are economically depleted. So I \nsuggest, as I did early on when the issue of means testing arrived, \nthat we ought to be equally concerned about the needs of the Indian \npeople.\n  Frankly, the GAO letter that my friend, Senator Gorton, proposes, is \nfully within his rights. Any Senator can write to the GAO, whether it \nis joined by the chairman of the Appropriations Committee or whether it \nis the most junior Member here. You can write to GAO and ask them for \ninformation. Now I intend to ask them to assess the needs of the Indian \npeople: How poor are they, and why are they poor? I want to ask them \nwhat physical needs they have--water systems, sewers, roads--for they \nlive, in most cases, in a pretty bad economic situation and a pretty \ndeteriorated public environment with reference to infrastructure and \nthe like.\n  So it is mighty easy to say, let's fix this formula and have somebody \nin government formulate a new means test for us, but I will tell you, \nit is a lot more difficult to find out what our responsibility should \nhave been over the years and how much of the Indians' plight is because \nof the laws we have and our failure to take care of the related trust \nresponsibilities that we have.\n  The history of Indian people versus the United States of America is \nas old as some of the Supreme Court opinions written by Justice Chief \nMarshall back in 1830's. I am sure Senator Gorton, who is an expert on \nthe legal debates, knows about all those cases. While I am not as \nlegally perfected, I know that there is not one simple evolution of the \nrelationship of the Indian people to the American Government and to the \nStates. It has evolved because of court opinions, it has evolved \nbecause Presidents have articulated American policy with reference to \nIndians. President Nixon articulated a policy of self-governance and \nself-determination, which has then been carried out by the Government \nof the United States.\n  So the next time we debate this issue, we will not just have three \nexhibits here, one of which quotes from one treaty, for I am sure that \nmore than one of us will be steeped in the history of how we got to \nwhere we are. It is not going to be as simple as devising a new means \nformula and distributing federal money based upon some kind of new \nmeans testing.\n  It may be that treaties don't govern all of these responsibilities, \nbut I can guarantee you, the statutes are filled with commitments to \nthe Indian people. Before we have this next debate and during the next \nhearings, we ought to be talking about all of those statutes that said \nwe are going to educate the Indian people, and then we never provided \nenough money; that says we are going to house them, and then did not \nprovide enough money. Where does that come into the equation?\n\n  We said we wanted economic prosperity for Indians--but until the \n1980's through the highway trust funds, we hardly funded any roads for \nthem. I can remember, when I arrived in 1973, $10 million was the level \nof funding for Indian roads. We were thrilled to get it up as high as \n$30 million. When we included Indians in our highway trust funds for \nthe first time, the funding jumped dramatically to $80 annually, and in \nthe most recent highway bill 6 years ago, we finally got it over the \n$150 million mark for all of Indian country out of the highway trust \nfunds. In spite of them paying into the funds everytime they bought \ngasoline, we weren't building any roads from this fund for them until \nthe mid 1980's.\n  Just a few remarks on judicial immunity. I believe it is incumbent \nupon the Indian leadership of this country to work with us, those of us \nwho are genuinely concerned about their well-being and protecting their \nrights to self-determination and self-governance. We ought to work on \nsome of the troubling areas where the lack of judicial review is \nsomething that is beginning to offend many people and that many of us \nwho are protective of our Indian people are beginning to ask questions \nabout.\n  In that regard, Senator Gorton, in conversations that are off the \nrecord and not on the Senate floor, has talked about the fact that \nmaybe the solution isn't a total waiver of their judicial \nimmunity. Maybe we need to examine these judicial areas that cry out \nfor some kind of equity and fairness. I assume in the next year those \nwill be looked at by various committees.\n\n  But in the final analysis, the important thing that happened here \ntoday is that, in my humble opinion, fairness prevailed because it \nwould have been grossly unfair to waive tribal sovereign immunity. In \nfact I think it would have been wrong in the appropriations process to \nwaive judicial immunity across Indian country so that Indian tribes can \nbe sued by almost anyone for anything in any court. I believe we would \nhave wreaked havoc on Indian governance and we would have destroyed the \ntribes of our country in many cases. And this too is an evolving \nsituation.\n  For in many of the cases where we have cited that the Indian tribes \ncannot be sued, they have insurance, I say to Senator Inouye. We found \nmany of them are in fact settling lawsuits because they bought \nliability insurance. We have even found that some of the suits that \npeople talked about here on the floor were indeed covered by liability \ninsurance. So those who sued tribes were not without a remedy.\n  But let us say the process has worked because we have not jumped \nprecipitously into changing that very large body of law with reference \nto the governance and status of a recognized Indian tribe in terms of \nthe courts of our land and judicial review of their actions.\n  And on the previous issue on means testing, in summary, I believe \nthat justice prevailed and the right thing is done by us not acting to \nestablish some formula or even indicate that we are setting down that \npath.\n  All we have done today is to set in motion some questions to the \nGovernment, the GAO. As indicated, there might be a lot of other \nquestions of them. Then, in due course, means testing will be looked at \nin a manner that it should be looked at by appropriate committees.\n  I thank Senator Gorton. I was privy to the meetings where this \nresolution was finally arrived at. I was not there at every meeting, \nbut nonetheless I was there in time. I was there in time to make sure \nthat some ideas that were apparently gaining credence were denied their \ncredence. And I feel very good about that. And we are now back together \nsaying, let us work together and see what we can do.\n\n[[Page S9395]]\n\n  I say to Senator Campbell, as chairman of the committee, our new \nchairman, I have served on your committee for a while, never as \nchairman because I could not do that, but I pledge to you my support as \nwe move through the next year or so in trying to solve some of these \nproblems. I am firmly convinced that it will not be a simple \nproposition of ``let's have a means testing formula,'' because there \nwill be a lot more to it before we finish as we try to understand just \nwhat we ought to be doing in fairness.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I think it is certainly appropriate, for a \nfew moments, to speak to the issue at hand here on the floor and my \nsupport for what the Senator from Washington has chosen to do with the \ntwo issues that he brought to the Interior appropriations bill dealing \nwith native Americans and sovereign immunity.\n  I discussed these issues with him at length and certainly with native \nAmericans of my State--four different tribes. I have spent a good \nnumber of hours discussing this issue and how it relates to their \nrights and how it relates to the rights of all citizens in this \ncountry.\n  I am extremely pleased also to have worked very closely with the \nSenator from Colorado who I respect greatly for his opinions in this \narea and certainly his long-term knowledge about issues of native \nAmericans because he is so proudly one of those amongst us who can \nclaim that title and does so proudly and represents them so well in \nthis body.\n  I am pleased that we are willing to take this back to hearings. It is \nan issue of immense proportion for both non-Indian citizens of our \ncountry and Indian citizens because of the nature that is evolving upon \nmany of our reservations and the questions that are mounting outside of \nthem as it relates to fairness and equity.\n  In my State of Idaho we have at this moment some conflict that must, \nI think, in the end be resolved so that there is a sense of fairness \nfor all parties involved. There is now on both sides of this issue a \nlack of that sense. I hope that we can resolve some of it. It is our \nresponsibility. We are talking about Federal law and the recognition of \nthat law and that which has built up around it now for well over a \ncentury.\n  I certainly trust my colleague from Colorado to deal with it in an \neven-handed, straightforward way and the Senator from the State of \nWashington who forced this issue upon us, in the right way, to cause us \nto look at something that sometimes we are not willing to or we find \ndifficult to deal with.\n  Yet there are times in our country's history when it is appropriate \nto look at what we intended in the past and how it has revolved into \nthe present and whether it fits today's modernness or if there are some \nreasonable adjustments that can be made within law that affect people \nin their lives. That certainly is our responsibility.\n  So I thank both of my colleagues for their willingness to cooperate \nand work with each other and to resolve, out of what could have been \nsubstantial conflict, an approach that I think in the end meets all of \nour interests in a way that serves this body and native Americans in \nour country well along with non-Indian citizens.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from Hawaii is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, as my distinguished friend from New Mexico \nsuggested, the matter before us is a very complex one. The history that \nwe will be considering in the days ahead, when we debate this matter, \nis also a complex one filled with tragedy and filled with sadness.\n  It is true, as stated by my friend from Washington, that many of the \ntribes are not treaty tribes. But I will explain why I believe it is \nnot so.\n  Mr. President, when the first European came upon this land, \nanthropologists have suggested there were anywhere from 10 million to \n50 million native Americans residing in the present 48 States. Today, \nthe number is less than 2 million.\n  The history of our relationship with our first citizens is not a very \nhappy one, Mr. President. In the early days, we looked upon them and \ncounted upon them to help us in our wars. The record indicates that if \nit were not for certain tribes belonging to the Iroquois Confederacy, \nGeneral Washington and his troops at Valley Forge could very well have \nperished. These Indians traveled hundreds of miles carrying food on \ntheir backs so that our troops would be fed.\n  Well, that was a long time ago, Mr. President. But this is part of \nour history. There was a time when Indians sent ambassadors here \nbecause they were sovereign nations, just as sovereign as Britain or \nFrance or China or Japan. And we treated them as sovereigns.\n  So sovereign nations conferring with other sovereign nations usually \ncome forth with an agreement which we call treaties.\n  Our history shows that we entered into 800 treaties with Indian \nnations. Of that number, 430 never came to this floor. They are \nsomewhere in the archives of the Senate of the United States. For one \nreason or another, we decided not to act upon these treaties, treaties \nthat were signed either by the President of the United States or his \ndesignated representative. They were solemn papers, documents that \nstarted with very flowery words such as: ``As long as the sun rises in \nthe east and sets in the west, as long as the rivers flow from the \nmountains to the oceans, this land is yours.''\n\n  It is true, as I indicated, that not all Indian nations are treaty \nnations, because 430 of the 800 treaties were not ratified, were not \neven discussed, were not debated, were not considered. But most of the \nremaining treaties are treaties that were signed in perpetuity.\n  It is true that there are some that were not signed in perpetuity. \nBut most of them had the flowery language: ``As long as the sun rises \nin the east and sets in the west, that is yours.''\n  Then we decided that the 370 remaining treaties may have been a \nmistake. And, Mr. President, this is a chapter that many of us would \ntry to forget and it is almost difficult to believe. But we proceeded \nto violate provisions in every one of them.\n  Ours is a proud Nation. We always point to other nations and say, \n``You have violated a treaty. You have violated START II. You have \nviolated the nuclear proliferation treaty,'' and we convince ourselves \nthat we always fulfill every provision in our treaties. Yes, today we \ndo so.\n  But there was a time when we disregarded these solemn promises. After \nthe treaties were signed, we decided that Indians were a nuisance. That \nis a harsh word to use, but we established a policy of extermination. \nWe may not have used that word, but the actions we took were \nextermination.\n  We often hear about the trail of tears. We have had hundreds of \ntrails of tears. For example, the Cherokees were rounded up in the \nCarolinas--thousands of them. They were rounded up in the summertime, \nand in the wintertime, with their summer attire, some in shackles, had \nto travel across the country to Oklahoma. It is no surprise that over \nhalf of them perished. These were the trails of tears.\n  Oklahoma, Mr. President--we hate to admit this--is a dumping ground. \nThere are tribes there that cannot trace their ancestral land in \nOklahoma. What are the Apache doing in Oklahoma? What are the Seminoles \ndoing in Oklahoma? What are the Cherokees doing in Oklahoma? They were \nsent there, and oftentimes sent to areas that no one wanted. Yes, if we \nfound gold on certain land, that treaty was violated.\n  So, Mr. President, this is a very complex issue. After the Indian \nwars--and we oftentimes look back to those days with great pride; there \nwere great soldiers, great generals, like General Custer--at the end of \nthe Indian wars, as a result of wartime death, disease, and such, the \nIndian population of the land had come down to 250,000--250,000.\n  Yet, with this background, with this history, I think we should \nrecall this footnote.\n  In all of the wars that we have been involved in since World War II \nof this century, native Americans have put on the uniform to \nparticipate in the defense of our freedoms, our liberties, our \nConstitution, our people, and our land. They have sent more men on a \nper capita basis than any other ethnic group.\n\n[[Page S9396]]\n\n More men from Indian reservations served in Desert Storm on a per \ncapita basis than any other ethnic group.\n  In fact, we oftentimes look at that great statue of the raising of \nthe flag at Iwo Jima on Mt. Suribachi. It should be noted that of the \nfive Americans that are raising the flag, one is an Indian. That has \nbeen the contribution of Indian men and Indian women throughout our \nhistory. They have done so notwithstanding their strange and tragic \nhistory in the back. So I think they have earned the right to say, \n``Let's not break any more treaties.'' Enough is enough.\n  Mr. President, like my distinguished friend from Washington, my \nfriends from Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, and Alaska, I look forward \nto this great debate where we can finally with some definitiveness and \nwith some depth discuss our relationship with the first citizens.\n  In closing, I will read part of the statement of Governor Stevens of \nthe State of Washington when he asked the tribe in the Pacific \nNorthwest to sign the treaty of Point Elliott. The Governor used some \nextraordinary words:\n\n       There will be witnesses. These witnesses will be tides. You \n     Indians know that the tide goes out and comes in, that it \n     never fails to go in or out. You people know that streams \n     that flow from the mountains never cease flowing. You people \n     know the sun rises and sets and never fails to do so. Those \n     are my witnesses. And you Indians, your witnesses and these \n     promises will be carried out and your promises to me and the \n     promises to the Great Father made to you will be carried out \n     as long as these three witnesses continue.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank Senator Inouye for those very thoughtful \ncomments. Until he introduced a bill just a few years ago that \nestablished a museum of the American Indians as part of the \nSmithsonian--and I was a House sponsor when I was on the House side--\nuntil that happened, there was a common saying here in Washington, DC, \nby Indians throughout the Nation. That saying was, ``There are more \ndead Indians in Washington than live ones.'' It was because at that \ntime there were over 16,000 remains, mostly skulls, but other body \nparts, housed by the Smithsonian.\n  Senator Domenici, when he was here, I think put it in a good and \nproper perspective. We are dealing with a couple of sections. My \nprimary opposition was not that I was trying to lock anybody out from \ndebate, but I felt it was the wrong vehicle for putting these very, \nvery important policy changes on an appropriations bill. But Senator \nDomenici put it in a proper perspective. Since he did, I will make a \npoint of that, too.\n  Senator Inouye mentioned the number of treaties that were dealt with. \nIt is my understanding that 374 were ratified by the U.S. Senate and \n374 broken--every single one--but not by the Indians. That is something \nthat ought to be in a historical perspective when we talk about section \n120 or 118.\n  Most of the things that the Indians lost in the centuries past were \ndone through two manners: either at gunpoint or through some \nsubterfuge. Certainly if they had known the value of Long Island, they \nwould never have sold it for $27 worth of beads. In the case of the \nBlack Hills, they did not have a choice; it was at gunpoint, as many \nother lands were, too.\n\n  Some authorities, including Herman Viola, head of the National \nArchives and a prominent author on American Indians, has written about \n14 thoughtful books on American Indians, and he says in some writings \nthat estimates are as high as 30 million aborigine people--30 million--\ndied in North and Central America between 1492 and 1992--30 million. It \nwas not like this place wasn't inhabited. There were complete nations.\n  If you go back in history and you look at the great cities of \nCahokia, which disappeared 400 years before the landing of Columbus, \nwhich had 20,000 acres in cultivated crops and astronomers, doctors, \nartists, and every imaginable kind of profession in their own way--\ngone, 400 years before anybody landed on a boat here from any of the \nEuropean countries.\n  The great city of Tenochtitlan, which the modern city of Mexico City \nis built on top of, had thousands of years of their own history before \nthe coming of post-Columbian people. I live about half an hour from \nMesa Verde, called the Cliff Dwellings. They were there before Christ \nwalked the Earth, the people living on the mesas, planting their corn, \nraising their kids, praying to their Lord, passing on generation to \ngeneration. They left there almost 400 years before Columbus even got \nhere.\n  So when we talk about who owes what to whom around here, I think it \nis very important that we remember that Senator Domenici and Senator \nInouye have tried to put this in a proper perspective. They were a \nculture. They did not have prostitution. They did not have jails. They \ndid not have communicable diseases. They did not have unemployment. \nThey did not have taxes, by the way, Mr. President. They did not have \nwelfare, mental institutions, literally all of the social problems that \nwe now think are consuming America, eating up America. They did not \nhave those. They could not even swear. They could not even swear. They \nhad no swear words in the Indian language.\n  They were a pretty good culture. We could learn a lot from them. We \ndid not learn very much because we found it was easier to take things \nat gunpoint or to get one to sell out another. That was common in those \ndays. If the negotiators with the Federal Government could not talk \nsome of the chiefs out of the land, they would simply say, ``OK, we \nwill set up our own chiefs. We will set up these guys over here. They \nbelong to the tribe. We will say they are the guys that have the \nauthority to sign the agreements and the treaties.'' That is the way \nsome of the land disappeared.\n  If we decided we could not deal with the Government of France or \nGreat Britain or any other foreign country, we would simply say, we \nwill set up our own puppet leaders in your country and then we will \nsign an agreement with them and that will become the law of the land. \nThat is how a lot of the land disappeared.\n  They had none of these problems. It was not in their nature and it \nwas not in their culture. They inherited it all. Many, many tribes are \nstill trying to find their center, find their way, and make a better \nlife for themselves and their kids. It is an uphill battle all the way \nbecause this Government, by and large, has never been very sensitive of \ntheir needs.\n  If you remember, historically, in fact, the Bureau of Indian Affairs \nwas not part of the Department of the Interior when it was set up. It \nwas part of the Department of War. Do you think anybody that sets up a \nframework to try to find fairness after fighting decades of battle, \nwhere some of their own people were lost in their battles, do you think \nthey will be fair? Probably not.\n\n  That is what led to the rise of the Surgeon General in the 1800's \nasking the War Department to send out a request to collect body parts \nfrom American Indians. If they were already dead, that was OK, dig them \nup and send them in. If they were not, kill them and then send them in. \nThe point of that whole study is a matter of historical record. It was \nto do one thing: They took measurements of the skulls, the bones; they \nmeasured how far apart were the eyes, and the cranial cavity and so on, \nand in their infinite wisdom decided, because those measurements were \ndifferent from the Anglo majority of this country, they could not have \nhad the intelligence to own land. That was one of the reasons and one \nof the driving forces of westward expansionism.\n  I didn't want to get into a big history lesson here, but that is all \na matter of record.\n  It seems to me that if Senator Domenici and Senator Inouye did \nanything, they tried to put this in a proper perspective. There have \nbeen many, many bills and many laws passed dealing with American \nIndians where they have had very little input and no voice in this \nbody. All they are asking now is to have a voice in this body by having \nthese bills introduced in a legislative forum so they can speak to \nthem, too, and not just slipped in in an appropriations bill.\n  In the past, there have been many devastating laws passed by this \nCongress. Certainly one was simply called relocation. That was not so \nlong ago, it just happened in the 1950's, in which Congress decided \nIndians had lived on reservations long enough and they could be \nassimilated, and they uprooted families and sent them to the city and \ntaught them to be electricians, plumbers, automobile mechanics, and \nafter they finished school,\n\n[[Page S9397]]\n\nthey dumped them on the streets of Los Angeles, New York, Fresno, and \nall over this country with no jobs and no skills or ability to get the \njobs with which they could make a living doing the things they had been \ntaught under relocation.\n  That is the reason why we have such high alcoholism rates among urban \nIndians now, still to this day, 40 years after the relocation act.\n  In its infinite wisdom, this body decided, through the Termination \nActs of the 1950's, they would arbitrarily say the Indians have been \nliving around the city long enough, therefore we will not call them \nIndians now but terminate them as a legal body. The heck with the whole \ntreaties, the heck with what we agreed to, our word is no good, we will \nterminate them. I have never understood that. It is like telling a \nblack American you have been around the cities long enough, you are no \nlonger black. I don't know how they could have even done that, but they \ndid it.\n  To this day, many of those tribes that were terminated and left in \nlimbo, not quite in the Anglo world and certainly not in the Indian \nworld because they were no longer legally Indians, and they have been \ntrying to find their center. That is why in the last few years we have \nallowed more and more tribes to go through the Bureau's procedure to be \nreinstated as tribes.\n  I guess in closing I should say we do an awful lot around here based \non the law book. It seems to me we ought to do a little more based on \nthe Good Book. You can be legally right and morally wrong. Everybody in \nthis body knows that. I think we can put something in place that might \nbe legally right and stand up in any court of law, but we have to ask \nourselves, was that the right thing to do? Was that a fair thing to do \nto 2 million people without their input, without them knowing, without \nthem having a voice? I don't think so.\n\n  If you look at the unemployment rate on the charts that Senator \nGorton showed, it was 95 percent on the reservation in Pine Ridge, SD. \nWhen you talk about a 9 percent unemployment nationwide, this country \ncomes unglued. We think we are in a major catastrophe if we have a 9 \npercent unemployment. Try 40, 50, 80, 90, or 95 percent, like in Pine \nRidge, SD, and all the dysfunctional problems, including fetal alcohol \nsyndrome. One out of five or six babies born is destined to lead a life \nin an institution because his mother drank too much because she didn't \nknow the difference or did not know it would hurt her unborn baby. Try \nto apply those statistics to the outside world.\n  Half of our high school kids don't finish high school. We have kids \nsniffing glue, eating paint, blowing spray paint in their face, burning \nour their mind. They don't know what they are doing because they have \nnot had proper education or training. We have a suicide rate on some \nreservations where one out of every two girls, one out of every two, \ntries suicide before she is out of her teenage years, and one out of \nevery three boys, and too many of them succeed.\n  That is the historical perspective that I try to put this in when I \nsay we went the wrong way in trying to add this to an appropriations \nbill with no input. I am delighted and honored that so many Senators \ncame forward and spoke to this, and at least for this year, we got it \nright and we are telling people this Nation is no better than a human \nbeing when we give our word. We are now in the process of dealing with \nfast-track for NAFTA, expanding that; we dealt with the Chemical \nWeapons Ban Treaty, and we are dealing with another treaty dealing with \nlandmines. They are all going to affect millions of people. It just \nseems to me that if this Nation can give their word in treaties to \neverybody else in the world that live halfway around the world, we can \ndarn sure give our word to the first Americans and keep it.\n\n  With that, Mr. President, I would like to get back to the amendment \nand clarify that. I did ask unanimous consent on the pending question \nthat is now referred to as section 118, beginning on page 52, line 16; \nis that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's amendment does propose a \nsubstitute for that language. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I am not sure. Did I ask for the yeas and nays?\n  Mr. GORTON. No. I think we are ready to vote on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment by \nthe Senator from Colorado?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1197 by the \nSenator from Colorado.\n  The amendment (No. 1197) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GORTON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n Excepted Committee Amendment Beginning on Page 52, Line 16, as Amended\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is now on the Committee \namendment, amended by the amendment of the Senator from Colorado.\n  The excepted committee beginning on page 52, line 16, as amended, was \nagreed to.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I will move to section 120.\n\n\n       Excepted Committee Amendment Beginning on Page 55, Line 11\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question before the Senate is the excepted \ncommittee amendment beginning on page 55, line 11.\n  The text of the excepted committee amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                 tribal priority allocation limitation\n\n       Sec. 120. The receipt by an Indian Tribe of tribal priority \n     allocations funding from the Bureau of Indian Affairs \n     ``Operation of Indian Programs''' account under this Act \n     shall--\n       (1) waive any claim of immunity by that Indian tribe;\n       (2) subject that Indian tribe to the jurisdiction of the \n     courts of the United States, and grant the consent of the \n     United States to the maintenance of suit and jurisdiction of \n     such courts irrespective of the issue of tribal immunity; and\n       (3) grant United States district courts original \n     jurisdiction of all civil actions brought by or against any \n     Indian tribe or band with a governing body duly recognized by \n     the Secretary of the Interior, wherein the matter in \n     controversy arises under the Constitution, laws, or treaties \n     of the United States.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I ask unanimous consent that the committee amendment \nreferred to as section 120, beginning on page 55, line 11, be \nwithdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The excepted committee amendment beginning on page 55, line 11, was \nwithdrawn.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I wasn't going to speak to that, but I \nmight make one comment. As I read the language of the bill, there were \nso many unanswered questions. One that came to mind was this. As I \nunderstand section 120, tribes who did not want to give up their \nsovereign immunity would be denied Federal funds. If they did willingly \ngive up Federal funds, then they would not have had to give up their \nsovereign immunity, which seemed strange to me because the tribes that \nare the most destitute and therefore the most dependent on Federal \nhelp, would have been the ones who would have had to give up immunity \nand therefore would have been sued more, where the very few, perhaps 1 \nout of 100, who do have a casino and have some money, simply would have \nsaid we don't want Federal money, we have enough; therefore, their \nimmunity would have been intact. It seems that paradox should be the \nthing that we discuss in a proper forum, which is the committee \nlegislation.\n  With that, I have no further comments, Mr. President. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, section 120 of the bill is a section that \nconditioned tribal priority allocations on the abandonment of a \ndoctrine called sovereign immunity on the part of Indian tribes. There \nhas been much said during the course of the day about justice, about \nsimple justice, about there being more important concerns than the \nletter of the law. With that proposition, I find myself in agreement. \nAnd the proposal with respect to sovereign immunity was aimed at just \nprecisely that goal--simple justice.\n  In fact, Mr. President, there is a letter to the editor in the \nWashington Post today that goes under the title of ``Simple Justice.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record at \nthis point.\n\n[[Page S9398]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 16, 1997]\n\n                             Simple Justice\n\n       I read with disappointment the comments of Sens. Ben \n     Nighthorse Campbell and John McCain regarding Sen. Slade \n     Gorton's provision to the Interior Appropriations bill that \n     would require Indian tribes to waive their sovereign immunity \n     from suit before they can receive federal funds [``Keeping \n     Our Promise to the Indians,'' op-ed, Sept. 10]. Their \n     argument misses the point.\n       Sen. Campbell said recently that the legislation that would \n     provide my family access to the federal court system to seek \n     justice for my son's death would pass over his [Campbell's] \n     ``dead body.'' Now Sen. McCain has joined the rhetoric.\n       On Oct. 25, 1994, two of my sons were returning home from a \n     school function in our farm pickup truck. When Jered, 18, and \n     Andy, 16, were crossing an intersection on an Indian \n     reservation, a tribal police vehicle hit their truck at a \n     speed calculated at 68 mph. My son Jered was killed \n     instantly, and Andy suffered serious injuries.\n       I then learned that my family has no recourse in the \n     federal and state court systems, because tribes have \n     protection for such actions under the principle of sovereign \n     immunity. According to University of Washington law professor \n     Ralph Johnson, sovereign immunity is based on European law--\n     ``you can't sue the King.'' There are no kings in America. \n     Sovereign immunity is not a right held by Native Americans; \n     it is an authority granted to them by Congress.\n       I was told that my only avenue to seek justice would be \n     through the tribe's makeshift court system that operates \n     without a constitution. Indian tribal courts have routinely \n     shown their inability to administer justice fairly. The \n     tribes don't even have to allow a person to seek damages \n     against them if they choose not to.\n       Sen. Gorton has written a provision that tribes receiving \n     federal tax dollars must accept responsibility for their \n     actions in the same court system that every other American \n     must. This proposal is a simple and fair one. Sen. Campbell's \n     objection to this legislation is denying my family's right to \n     seek justice for a tragic incident that has profoundly \n     changed our lives forever.\n       When Sen. Campbell talked about this legislation passing \n     over his ``dead body,'' it hit a deep and emotional chord \n     with me; that is why I am urging the passing of this \n     legislation. But the death I speak of is real, no political \n     talk. The justice I ask for is no more than any other \n     American enjoys when not dealing with Indian reservations.\n       The two senators wrote that Native Americans ``don't come \n     from large voting blocs, and most cannot afford the kind of \n     access in Washington other Americans have.'' In addition to \n     that, they referred to Native Americans as a ``silent \n     minority''.\n       The Center for Responsive Politics totaled the monies spent \n     by Native American interests on lobbying, soft-money \n     donations to national and state party committees, individual \n     contributions and PACs to be $4,248,464. Common Cause listed \n     the top 25 gambling industry soft-money donors during the \n     1995 and 1996 campaign cycle. The No. 1 donor was an Indian \n     tribe, as was the ninth, 16th, 17th, 18th, 20th and 23rd.\n       I am just the father of a son who was killed on a \n     reservation. I have spent $20,000 of my own money to seek \n     justice for his death--money earned by working on my farm. If \n     the Native Americans who have spent more than $4 million \n     influencing proliticans are the ``silent minority,'' I wonder \n     where that leaves me in the senators' eyes.\n                                                   Bernard Gamache\n                                                     Wapoto, Wash.\n  Mr. GORTON. The simple justice referred to in this article is the \ndeath of an 18-year-old high school student in an automobile accident \nin the lower Yakima Valley in the State of Washington. That accident, \naccording to the father of the boy and the police agencies, took place \nwhen a Yakima tribal policeman ran a red light in a pursuit and \nbroadsided the pickup being driven by the young man and killed him.\n  The Yakima Tribe, the employer of that police officer, cannot be sued \nbecause of the doctrine of sovereign immunity. In other words, there is \nno State or Federal court in which the father, the author of this \nletter, can seek simple justice. He is absolutely precluded by the \ndoctrine of sovereign immunity. Now, if that police vehicle had \nbelonged to the Yakima County sheriff's office, a suit could have been \nbrought against Yakima County. If it had belonged to the Washington \nState Patrol, the father could have brought a lawsuit against the State \nof Washington--but not against the Yakima Tribal Council, the employer \nof that police officer.\n  The Yakima Tribal Council states that the facts are somewhat \ndifferent and that perhaps the police officer was not negligent. \nNeither you nor I, Mr. President, nor any Member of this body can be \ncertain of those facts. But it is for exactly that reason that we set \nup courts in the United States, so that there could be a neutral body \nto make that determination and to reward damages where a judge and a \njury felt damages were due.\n  So when we discuss this question of tribal immunity, we aren't \ndealing with an abstraction, we are dealing with a very real question \nof justice involving very real people and involving responsibilities \nthat are undertaken by every other governmental corporation in the \nUnited States.\n  During the course of the debate over sovereign immunity, we have also \nheard, as one of the principal defenses, that it is created by these \n367 treaties with Indian tribes. Unlike the debate on the previous \nquestion, a treaty-created right of financial support, I can't put a \ndisplay behind me here showing a treaty and what it does to deal with \ntribal immunity because, bluntly, there isn't a word about sovereign \nimmunity in any one of those 367 treaties. The reason is not \nsurprising. Governmental immunity from lawsuits is not a concept that \ntraces from that relationship. It is a doctrine of English common law \nthat you could not sue the king, a common law inherited by the United \nStates upon our Declaration of Independence in 1776, and abandoned, in \nmost part, by the Government of the United States, by the governments \nof varying States, and through them by local governments all across the \nUnited States. One of the most recent statements of a Member of the \nSupreme Court on sovereign immunity is Justice Stevens, in 1991:\n\n       The doctrine of sovereign immunity is founded upon an \n     anachronistic fix. In my opinion, all governments, Federal, \n     State, and tribal, should generally be accountable for their \n     illegal conduct.\n\n  And, of course, Mr. President, we never, under our system of \njudgment, allow the determination of whether or not something is \nillegal to be made by the person accused of illegality. We use an \nindependent court system for that determination. The Supreme Court has \ndealt very specifically with the question of where the authority to \nmake that determination about Indian tribal sovereign immunity is \nlodged.\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist, in 1991, at the end of a series of cases on \nthis subject, wrote:\n\n       Congress has always been at liberty to dispense with such \n     tribal immunity or to limit it.\n\n  It is not a matter contained in any treaty. It is a matter that the \nConstitution of the United States of America lodges right here in the \nCongress of the United States.\n  Now, I have agreed to the amendment that was just accepted because \nthe Senator from Colorado, the Senator from Hawaii, and others have \nalso graciously agreed that a subject that, for all practical purposes, \nhas not previously been taken up by the Committee on Indian Affairs \nwill in fact be taken up.\n  I will, in the next few days or weeks, introduce a bill on sovereign \nimmunity. They have agreed that there will be a series of hearings in \nwhich we will hear from victims of sovereign immunity, like the author \nof this letter, and from many others, and hear the justification of the \nvarious tribes for the retention of this anachronistic concept. They \nhave also agreed that we will have a markup and a vote on such a \nproposal in the committee.\n  My friend, the Senator from New Mexico, who is not here now, who \nvociferously and successfully argued for the removal of this section \nfrom this bill, has said, as he just did a few moments ago, that he \nfeels that there may be real room, in connection with this doctrine, \nfor changes, for some removal of that tribal immunity, even if not a \ntotal abandonment of it. I find that to be a most encouraging \nstatement. I hope he reflects on others of his own view. The particular \nexample that he has used is one that is pretty close to home, because \nas long ago as 1981 when I was attorney general of the State of \nWashington, I was involved in a lawsuit in which the Supreme Court of \nthe United States made the judgment that Indian tribal smoke shops were \nrequired to collect the State's cigarette tax on the sale of cigarettes \nto non-Indians and to remit them to the State. It is curious that now \nwe are debating actively just how much more we should pile on in the \nway of cigarette taxes in order to discourage smoking.\n\n[[Page S9399]]\n\n  But in the 17 years since the Supreme Court made that decision, a \ndecision renewed in another case in the Supreme Court of the United \nStates just a few years ago, Indian tribes have systematically and \nsuccessfully ignored the judgment of the Supreme Court of the United \nStates and have refused to collect those cigarette taxes, and sell \ncheap cigarettes, often to minors, without collecting the State sales \ntax, and to successfully defy the Supreme Court because the smoke shops \nare considered tribal enterprises and the State taxing authorities \ncan't sue to enforce the collection of those taxes because of the \ndoctrine of sovereign immunity. Just what justification we are going to \nget in these hearings for defying decisions of the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States and selling cheap cigarettes in the year 1997 and 1998 I \nam not sure about. I am going to be very interested in listening to \nthat argument. We are talking about fairness here. We are talking about \ntaxes that support the schools to which members of the tribe go. We are \ntalking about a tax system that creates fair competition between \nsellers who hold that tribal immunity and those who do not. And, in a \nthird area, we need to examine whether or not the ordinary forms of \ncontract law ought to allow the enforcement of contracts, as against a \nclaim of tribal immunity preventing a determination as to whether a \ncontract has been violated or not.\n\n  Those are three areas. I don't know that they are necessarily \nexclusive, and probably the considerations in each one of them may be \ndifferent.\n  Should States be allowed to enforce the collection of taxes that the \nSupreme Court says they have lawfully imposed? Should persons alleging \nviolations of contract be able to go into a court to get a fair and \nequitable determination of whether a contract has been violated? Should \nthe victim of negligence, or even an intentional harm in an automobile \naccident, or an assault, or the like, be able to seek redress in the \ncourts of his or her State, or his or her Federal system, against an \nIndian tribe under pretty much the same circumstances in which they can \nseek that redress against any other governmental entity in the United \nStates?\n  The Supreme Court, Mr. President, has said the buck stops here. It is \nup to us to make that decision. We have not even talked about it for \n20, 30, or 40 years.\n  I think it is a major step forward that we will in fact talk about \nit. I suspect that it will still be a controversial issue, though it \nmay be that the Senator from New Mexico has come up with a way for us \nto say, ``Well, perhaps we are not going to go all the way; perhaps we \nwill try to deal with areas which are really quite open and shut, and \nsee whether or not it works to the administration of justice; whether \nor not it does undercut any kind of tribal right of self-\ndetermination.''\n  That offer, as well as the generous statements from the Senator from \nHawaii, and the Senator from Colorado, I greatly welcome. And I think \nwe can deal with this in an orderly fashion of committee hearings and \ncommittee action.\n  I now think perhaps for the first time we have some hope that we may \nnot only be able to talk about the issue but to come to some kind of an \naccommodation in which we meet somewhere in the middle of the road--\nhopefully we will not get hit by a car on the way--and see whether or \nnot we can't move forward on this.\n  So, I agree with the amendment of the Senator from Colorado which has \njust been agreed to. I thank him for his agreement to move forward on \nan issue on which he feels strongly, just as I do. But that, of course, \nis the way in which we deal with controversial issues, and I look \nforward to the next round.\n  Mr. President, I think we have exhausted this subject. With respect \nto the bill as a whole, we will return I believe to the debate over the \nvarious amendments on the National Endowment for the Arts. The majority \nleader informs me that he in the strongest possible terms wishes to \ncomplete all action on this bill by adjournment tomorrow. Once Members \nwho wish to speak to the National Endowment for the Arts, or any other \nissue, come to the floor and do so, we will have a further opportunity \nthis evening.\n  There is an amendment on forest roads to be proposed by Senator Bryan \nof Nevada, which I understand will be proposed early tomorrow, which \nwill be highly controversial. And this will require a vote. The Senator \nfrom Arkansas, Mr. Bumpers, and the other Senator from Nevada, Mr. \nReid, may well have settled the controversy involving them, and others.\n  So I am not certain, on the Bryan amendment and the various \namendments on the National Endowment for the Arts, that there are any \nothers that will require rollcall votes. If there are, I urge Senators, \nor their staffs, to notify us and come to the floor and discuss them.\n  We need to pass this bill. We need to get it into a conference \ncommittee. There are many controversial differences with the House \nbill.\n  With that, Mr. President, and the request of anyone who wants to say \nanything tonight to say it, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, last November, the people of Rhode Island \ngave me the great honor of succeeding one of this Chamber's true \ngiants: Senator Claiborne Pell. Throughout his years of service, \nSenator Pell committed himself to increasing access to education and, \nfittingly, his name has become synonymous with the fight to open the \ndoors of higher education to all of our Nation's citizens, regardless \nof income.\n  Senator Pell also dedicated himself to increasing access to the arts \nfor all Americans, regardless of an individual's or a community's \nwealth. He recognized the power of the arts to inspire people of all \nages, through national and local exhibitions as well as arts education. \nWith his wise and steadfast leadership, Congress made a commitment to \nadvancing these aims, creating a National Endowment for the Arts.\n  I am proud to follow in Senator Pell's footsteps in supporting the \nNEA and a strong Federal commitment to the arts. Across the country and \nin my home State of Rhode Island, the arts enhance our culture and \nstrengthen our economy.\n  The events of recent years in Rhode Island's capital city of \nProvidence are a testament to the power of the arts. The last half \ndecade has seen the revitalization of Providence's downtown area. One \nmajor factor in this rebirth has been the emergence of Waterplace Park, \nwhich uses architecture to take advantage of the Woonasquatucket and \nProvidence Rivers' natural beauty. This summer, with NEA support, the \nWaterFire exhibition was introduced to the park. In the few short \nmonths since its installation, this artistic display has already \nencouraged thousands of Rhode Islanders to rediscover Providence's \ntreasures.\n  The arts have also contributed to Providence's revival in other ways. \nInstitutions like the recently renovated Providence Performance Arts \nCenter and Trinity Repertory Company, both of which receive NEA \nsupport, provide our State's residents with opportunities to see well-\nrenown and innovative theatrical works. In addition, the passage of new \ntax incentives for artists residing in downtown Providence has \nattracted a vibrant and increasingly active artistic community to the \ncity. Taken together, these developments led USA Today to name \nProvidence a ``Renaissance City'' in 1996.\n  The Federal investment in the NEA is minimal. The $100 million this \nbill would provide for the NEA, for which I commend the chairman and \nranking member of the subcommittee, represents less than 40 cents for \neach of our Nation's citizens.\n  But with this tiny investment, the NEA does great things, offering \nour Nation's citizens increased access to all forms of the arts. In my \nState, the NEA supports not only theatrical productions, but also the \nwork of the Children's Museum of Rhode Island, the youth concerts given \nby the Rhode Island Philharmonic Orchestra, and the interactive music \nprogram that Rhode Island Hospital offers to its patients. In my \nhometown of Cranston, the NEA\n\n[[Page S9400]]\n\nsupports the annual Labor and Ethnic Heritage Festival, which brings \npeople of diverse backgrounds together to celebrate and learn about \neach others' traditions and cultures.\n\n  These programs reach a wide range of Rhode Islanders, but even those \nwho choose not to participate in these events benefit from NEA support \nand our State's vibrant arts communities. There is a close relationship \nbetween the arts in Rhode Island and economic growth.\n  Working closely with the NEA, the Rhode Island State Council on the \nArts supports many arts organizations, social service organizations \nconducting arts programs, and arts educators. One of the Rhode Island \nCouncil's funding categories, which supports 26 of the State's largest \narts organizations, is known as general operating support. In 1995-96, \nthe council's grants in this category totaled $355,000, with an average \ngrant size of $10,000.\n  For this investment of $355,000, the State of Rhode Island saw an \nenormous return. The 26 general operating support organizations \ndirectly contributed more than $24 million into the Rhode Island \neconomy. More than 1.1 million people attended these organizations' \nprograms last year, further spurring the economy. Using modest \nDepartment of Commerce multipliers, these figures suggest that the \nactivities of the general operating support organizations alone \ncontributed a total of more than $97 million to Rhode Island's economy \nlast year. The figure for all arts organizations would be even greater.\n  These impressive findings are repeated on a national scale. Recent \nstudies have shown that the national nonprofit arts industry generates \nsome $36.8 billion annually in economic activity; supports 1.3 million \njobs; and produces $790 million in local government revenue and $1.2 \nbillion in State revenue. For each dollar the NEA invests in \ncommunities, there is a twentyfold return in jobs, services, and \ncontracts. Without question, this is a wise investment of our \nresources.\n  We must also recognize the importance of national leadership in the \narts, which only a strong, sufficiently funded National Endowment can \nprovide. As my colleague from Utah, Mr. Bennett, noted yesterday, the \nNEA's seal of approval helps countless organizations across the country \nto raise matching funds from private sources to support the arts.\n  In addition, by identifying arts education and increased access to \nthe arts as its priorities, the NEA has promoted these issues \nnationwide. In recent years, we have seen a resurgence of our \ncommitment to include the arts in elementary and secondary school \ncurricula in Rhode Island, largely spurred by the NEA's emphasis on how \nexposure to the arts helps young people to grow more proficient in all \nsubjects.\n  I am proud to serve on the Labor and Human Resources Committee, which \nhas examined many of these issues. I am also proud to be a cosponsor of \nS. 1020, which the committee passed earlier this year by a bipartisan \n14-to-4 vote. S. 1020 reauthorizes and continues to reform the NEA, \nwhile maintaining a strong Federal commitment to the agency and its \nideals. I look forward to the consideration of this important \nlegislation on the Senate floor.\n  Standing on this floor 32 years ago, Senator Pell observed that ``the \narts throughout history have greatly enriched all truly worthwhile \ncivilizations. The arts can put into tangible form the highest of man's \ncreative ideas, so that they may become permanently memorable.''\n  Today, I wish to echo Senator Pell's wise counsel. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the NEA at the funding level requested by the \nsubcommittee and to preserve a strong Federal commitment to the arts.\n\n\n                          vanishing treasures\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to bring \nan issue to the Senate's attention related to the National Park Service \nand it's new initiative called Vanishing Treasures.\n  In a number of park units throughout the Southwest, the Park Service \nis responsible for maintaining and interpreting numerous ruins and \nhistoric structures, some that date back over 1,000 years.\n  One example of the wonderful ruins that exist in our National Parks \nis the Chetro Ketl kiva found in Chaco Canyon in New Mexico; a \nfascinating structure demonstrating the advanced architectural skills \nof the ancient Anasazi culture.\n  Many of these structures have become unstable and are constantly \nbeing degraded, primarily by the effects of the harsh desert climate. \nFurthermore, the almost artistic skill required in the stabilization \nmethods that are necessary to preserve these structures is being lost \nbecause of the emphasis on other programs within the Park Service.\n  The Vanishing Treasures initiative will provide a 10-year program to \nstabilize these kinds of ruins to the point where they can be preserved \nby routine maintenance activities. Additionally, the initiative will \nplace an emphasis on the training of younger employees, both permanent \nand seasonal, in the skills needed to perform this needed work.\n  In all, over 2,000 prehistoric and historic structures in 41 Park \nService units, and countless numbers of future visitors will benefit \nfrom the work performed under this initiative.\n  The bill before us provides $1.5 million for this program, which is \n$0.5 million more than provided by the House, and $2 million less than \nrequested by the administration.\n  I hope that the chairman will work with me to ensure the Senate level \nis at least maintained in conference, and I look forward to working \nwith him to explore other opportunities to see that this initiative has \nsufficient resources to do this important work.\n  I ask unanimous consent that additional material be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Vanishing Treasures Initiative\n\n       Vanishing Treasures (+$3,500,000; 18 FTE): The initiative \n     proposed here would enable the NPS to reduce threats to \n     ancient prehistoric ruins and historic structures that have \n     grown to serious proportions in recent decades. ``Vanishing \n     Treasures'' will improve the preservation of over 2,000 \n     prehistoric and historic ruins in 41 parks in the arid west, \n     all located within the Intermountain Field Area of the Park \n     Service. The NPS estimates that half of these structures, the \n     remains left by ancient American Indian societies such as the \n     Anasazi, their historic descendants, and later pioneers, are \n     in less than good condition. About 60 percent of these \n     structures are being impacted severely or substantially, \n     mainly by weathering and erosion. The severely impacted \n     structures are at risk of collapse in the near future Others \n     are deteriorating a bit less quickly, but with continued \n     deferred maintenance this process will accelerate. Also of \n     special concern is the poor documentation of these \n     structures, about 60 percent of which are not well recorded \n     and are poorly known.\n       An estimated 20 million visitors annually come to see these \n     prehistoric and historic ruins and to learn about the ancient \n     and historic cultures that created them. This visitation \n     contributes over $1.6 billion to the economies of the States \n     where the parks are located, helping to create over 33,000 \n     jobs there. If the NPS is unable to maintain these \n     structures, they will be lost. There is no Servicewide base \n     funding for this program in FY 1997.\n       ``Vanishing Treasures'' is proposed as a 10-year program to \n     bring NPS capability and the prehistoric and historic \n     structures to a condition in which they will be preserved by \n     routine preservation maintenance activities. The initiative \n     includes: immediate emergency actions to be carried out in \n     the first year; documentation, planning and management of \n     projects to be carried out over the 10-year period of the \n     initiative; a focus on skilled maintenance expert development \n     and training; and provisions for appropriate expertise in \n     other disciplines to make the program successful. Projects \n     will be carried out by parks or centers, depending upon the \n     nature of each project. Following is a summary of the four \n     components of the Vanishing Treasures program:\n       Emergency Needs. Wind, rain, ice, snow, visitor use, site \n     looters and vandals, insects, birds, rodents, and other \n     forces wear down, break up, and deteriorate prehistoric \n     structures unless counteractive steps are taken. Lack of such \n     steps in recent decades has placed some structures in grave \n     danger. In FY 1998, $2.045 million will fund the most acute \n     emergency preservation projects where collapse and permanent \n     loss of irreplaceable resources is imminent. Approximately 18 \n     to 24 projects will be undertaken to meet most of the acute \n     emergency need. A few examples of types of projects to be \n     undertaken include:\n       Wupatki and Walnut Canyon National Monuments: These units \n     include 202 sites that have standing prehistoric \n     architecture, including large interpretive sites as well as \n     smaller sites whose structural conditions have been \n     identified as threatened with imminent loss. Only one \n     position is currently devoted to ruins preservation.\n       Chetro Ketl, Chaco Culture National Historical Park: Large \n     elevated circular kivas are a hallmark of Classic Bonito \n     Phase great\n\n[[Page S9401]]\n\n     house architectural design. Among many, only Kiva G in the \n     Chetro Ketl ruin has been extensively excavated. Kiva G is a \n     series of eight superimposed, independently constructed \n     ancient kivas, representing at least 18 separate prehistoric \n     construction episodes and elevated 35 feet in the central \n     building mass of the ruin. A support system of masonry and \n     wooden piers, wooden sheathing, and steel beams installed \n     more than 60 years ago to preserve the site have rusted, \n     twisted, bowed, fractured, and rotted so that stresses are \n     now transmitted to the prehistoric walls the system was \n     intended to protect. The area is hazardous to the very \n     workers who preserve the walls. Because of the extreme height \n     and mass, collapse would be catastrophic to the kiva and 15 \n     surrounding rooms. Funding would allow a structural/safety \n     evaluation, design plan, and preservation treatment for this \n     important resource.\n       Fort Union National Monument: In late July of 1995 a major \n     architectural feature located in the Quartermaster's Office \n     fell, and in the summer of 1996 another wall gave way to \n     strong winds. Resources needed preservation work at Fort \n     Union include but are not limited to a minimum of 250,872 \n     square feet of adobe, 83,725 cubic feet of rock foundations, \n     25 new and replacement braces, and an undetermined amount of \n     fired brick in over sixty structural remains.\n       Mesa Verde National Park: This park and two associated \n     units protect 5,000 documented prehistoric sites, including \n     585 cliff dwellings and 45 mesa-top towers. Only about 100 of \n     these sites have received treatment over the last ninety \n     years, and structures renowned for their remarkable state of \n     preservation are deteriorating at an alarming rate. \n     Collapsing walls, undermining foundations, sagging roofs, \n     rising damp and eroding mortar all place the integrity of \n     this architecture in danger. Moreover, the recent fires at \n     Mesa Verde National Park revealed as many as 500 new sites \n     that will adds further to the conservation workload.\n       Upper Ruin, Tonto National Monument: Unexcavated Room 15 \n     contains as much as eight feet of dirt fill, creating immense \n     stress between it and adjacent excavated Rooms 7 and 14. \n     Stress is exacerbated as seasonal rains swell the fill with \n     moisture. Walls are bulging and cracking despite various \n     temporary shoring and runoff diversions. Without correction, \n     the inevitable collapse will soon destroy important \n     prehistoric architecture and unstudied archaeological \n     deposits.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the New Mexico Journal, Sept. 2, 1997]\n\n                     Sun, Wind, Rain Crumble Ruins\n\n\n             preservation efforts hindered by lack of funds\n\n                         (By Peter Eichstaedt)\n\n       Chaco Canyon, N.M.--Harsh winds, driving rains, and an \n     unrelenting sun are as common here as the timeless stone and \n     dried mud dwellings of the ancient Anasazi.\n       But wind, rain and sun could spell the end of these \n     mysterious ruins unless measures are taken soon to preserve \n     them, say National Park Service officials.\n       The common notion is ``you don't need to fix them because \n     they're ruins,'' says Dabney Ford, archaeologist at the Chaco \n     Culture National Historic Park.\n       Because most visitors come and go quickly, spending only an \n     hour or two at the parks, they rarely notice the annual \n     deterioration of the ruins, Ford says in a recent interview.\n       ``There are some genuine disasters,'' she says of Chaco and \n     40 other national parks, monuments and historic sites across \n     the West in need of preservation. Walls are falling down and \n     sites are being washed away by flash floods and downpours, \n     she says.\n       To generate public sympathy and federal funds to preserve \n     these ruins, Ford and other national park employees earlier \n     this year launched a drive to secure $3.5 million from \n     Congress.\n       But Congress, scheduled to reconvene this week, is poised \n     to provide less than a third of that request.\n       If approved, the money would begin a 10-year project called \n     the ``Vanishing Treasures Initiative'' to improve and protect \n     more than 2,000 prehistoric and historic ruins in 41 national \n     parks in New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Texas, Utah and \n     Wyoming.\n       The money would also set up a mentor program where the \n     parks' experienced Native American preservationists would \n     train another generation to do the work, Ford says.\n\n\n                           gone with the wind\n\n       As Ford leans into the wind while balanced on the rim of a \n     large round kiva, she points to a bulge in the sandstone \n     masonry work below her feet.\n       The bulge has been caused by underground moisture that has \n     weakened the ancient mud mortar between carefully laid rock. \n     Natural pressure did the rest, she says.\n       The rock must be removed and replaced, she says. ``It takes \n     about one hour to repair one square foot.''\n       The hands-on work is done by Navajos such as Charles \n     Lanell, who began working part-time at Chaco Canyon in 1973 \n     and who uses techniques that preserve the historic integrity \n     of the sites, she says.\n       The parks also face a loss of expertise, Ford says, because \n     the most knowledgeable of the Native American restoration \n     specialists are soon to retire. There are no apprentices \n     to replace them, she says.\n       What repairs are performed on the ruins are dire \n     emergencies, Ford says, and only as much work is done as can \n     be paid out of various park funds.\n       In some cases, the best thing to do for preservation is \n     simply to backfill some of the multi-room stone structures \n     and kivas, Ford says. Burying these ruins protects them from \n     the ravages of rain, wind and sun.\n       ``We haven't been taking care of these things,'' she says. \n     ``There are reasons, and they are mostly fiscal.''\n       The situation at Chaco is not unique. At Aztec Ruins in \n     Aztec, N.M., ancient rock walls are tilting and some have \n     fallen. Some of the country's best-preserved and hand \n     plastered rooms are being washed away by periodic rains that \n     leak through deteriorating chamber roofs, says Barry Cooper, \n     Aztec Ruins' superintendent.\n       Mike Sherris, facility manager at Aztec, was among the \n     three people who launched the preservation program.\n       ``They just were not well-funded for many years,'' Sherris \n     says of preservation work at Aztec and other monuments. \n     ``We're going to lose sites here if we don't maintain them.''\n       A third major ruin in New Mexico also has been \n     deteriorating.\n       Mike Schneegas, facility manager at Salinas Pueblo Missions \n     National Monument, near Mountainair, also helped initiate the \n     program.\n       The preservation needs at Salinas ``were much greater than \n     we thought,'' he says. With just three or four seasonal \n     employees to do the repair work, ``we just can't keep up.''\n       Erosion is the biggest problem at Salinas and threatens the \n     many towering rock walls, he says. Moisture from the soil \n     creeps into the mud mortar and weakens the walls.\n       A little bit of preservation work goes a long way and can \n     save money in the long run, he says. Repairing a \n     deteriorating wall is much cheaper than rebuilding one.\n\n\n                            finding a means\n\n       Like other federal agencies in recent years, the National \n     Park Service suffered deep budget cuts and preservations \n     funds were lost, Ford says.\n       ``We've downsized and it's been for the good,'' she says, \n     but ``money is tight'' and budgets focus on simply keeping \n     the parks open.\n       The House and Senate, in separate measures in July, \n     proposed $1 million and $1.5 million respectively for the \n     Vanishing Treasures program.\n       In addition, another $2 million has been proposed for \n     ``stabilization'' work across the country, only a portion of \n     which would be used by the western parks, says Jerry Rogers, \n     superintendent of the Southwest Office of the Park Service.\n       The $2 million will be available to all 375 parks and \n     historic sites in the country, Rogers says, while the \n     Vanishing Treasures funds are just for the 41 parks in the \n     West.\n       ``The final amount for Vanishing Treasures will presumably \n     be worked out in a conference committee and will be somewhere \n     between $1 million and $1.5 million,'' he says.\n       Rogers says he hopes to get more money in future years, but \n     is happy about any money Congress provides.\n       ``The need for $3.5 million is very real,'' he says. ``We \n     understand the difficulties Congress faces in setting \n     priorities. The National Park Service will make Congress glad \n     it gave us what they did.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1200\n\n (Purpose: Clarifies that funds provided for land acquisition in south \n Florida may be used for acquisitions within Stormwater Treatment Area \n                                  1-E)\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

I would \nlike to take a moment of the Senate's time today to engage the Senator \nfrom Washington in a colloquy.\n  As the chairman well knows, the restoration effort encompasses all of \nsouth Florida, from the Kissimmee River in the north to the Florida \nKeys in the south. I understand that while\n\n[[Page S9402]]\n\nthe $66 million has been allocated for land acquisitions in Everglades \nNational Park, the bill contains language allowing the Secretary to use \nthese funds to purchase lands elsewhere in the south Florida ecosystem. \nIs that correct?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator from Florida is correct. The legislation \nbefore us today allows the Secretary to use this funding to assist the \nState of Florida in acquiring land in Stormwater Treatment Area 1--\nEast, should he determine it appropriate and deemed necessary by the \nSecretary.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I join my colleague from Florida in thanking the chairman \nfor his hard work on behalf of the Everglades. As my friend from \nWashington is aware, the Federal Government--under an agreement \nenshrined in the Everglades Forever Act of the State of Florida--is \ncommitted to purchase land for Stormwater Treatment Area 1--East. This \nland will be used to create a buffer marsh bordering on the Everglades \nagricultural area to help restore water quality. As I understand it, \nnothing in the bill before us today prevents the Secretary from using a \nportion of the Everglades National Park land acquisition funding to \nassist in STA-1E land acquisitions. Is that correct?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator is correct. The Secretary may use the funding \nin this provision to improve and restore the hydrological function of \nthe Everglades watershed. Nothing here prevents the Secretary from \nproviding park acquisition funding to assist the State of Florida in \nthe purchase of land for the project you described.\n  Mr. GRAHAM.

Mr. President, I would like to spend a few moments \ndiscussing the issues pertaining to the National Endowment for the \nArts. There are a number of amendments which are either already filed \nat desk or will be filed between now and, I gather, tomorrow afternoon. \nThere will be further debate on this tomorrow as well. But I wanted to \nadd additional comments, as well as to reiterate some of the points I \nmade yesterday, both in support of the amendment which I have filed, as \nwell as the general issues that have been raised by a number of the \nothers who have spoken with regard to the NEA.\n  Again, I would like to begin as yesterday by pointing out that, like \nmany of the people here in the Senate, I am a strong proponent of the \narts; a supporter. In our State we have a number of outstanding \ninstitutions too numerous to mention without forgetting important ones. \nI will just say in our State we make a major commitment and investment \nin arts activities. There are problems, though, as have been discussed \nat great length in the last day and a half, with the way the National \nEndowment for the Arts has functioned. I don't have specific criticisms \nof individuals, but I do think the results have been ones that have \nraised concerns. They have been concerns I have had since I came to the \nSenate in 1995.\n  The principal concern I have is that the way we have proceeded has \nsort of established an ongoing debate which, on the one hand, has \npeople arguing that the funding of specific types of, either arts \ninstitutions or artists, has meant that, in effect, tax dollars have \nbeen used for unacceptable or, in some cases it is argued, obscene \nactivity. On the other hand, we hear from those who seek to be \nrecipients of NEA grants, the argument that every time we add more \ncontrols here in Congress on the way these dollars are distributed, we \nare in effect performing a type of censorship on art and creativity in \nour country.\n  My fear is that ultimately this leads us in a direction where there \nis a no-win outcome. Everybody loses. I met and discussed this with \nJane Alexander. We have talked. I have outlined to her my concern that \nall it will take is one or two or maybe three more objectionable or \nprovocative grants and we could well see an immediate cessation of \nsupport for the National Endowment or for any concept like it. In my \nState, that would be a bit of a problem because a lot of the \ninstitutions, I think, need lead time before we would totally cease \nsupport.\n  Also, I think if we continue this debate we are really, in many ways, \nundermining the arts themselves. Because every time we have national \nfocus on the problems with respect to artistic activity in this \ncountry, I think if anything it causes people not only to want to see \nfewer tax dollars supporting the NEA, and more strings attached to \nthose tax dollars, but I think it diminishes the overall level of \ninterest in and positive feelings toward arts activities.\n  I also am concerned, and have expressed this before, about the way \nthe NEA makes its decisions. Because, as we have seen in the very \nexcellent presentation by the Senator from Arkansas and the Senator \nfrom Alabama and others, the Senator from Texas as well, the \ndistribution of these dollars has not been in any sense based on any \nkind of ratios based on population or similar criteria, but rather are \nvery disproportionately focused in a small number of communities in our \ncountry. I think a lot of people, at least in my State, probably in \nothers as well, are frustrated, again, with the sort of Washington \nknows best mindset that makes those allocations.\n\n  When I came to the Senate I spent a lot of time trying to decide how \nbest to address the problem. The conclusion I reached in 1995, about \nwhich I have spoken on this floor since, which I worked on when I was a \nmember of the Labor Committee, which I have written about in \neditorials, is that we ought to move in the direction of a private, \nprivately financed, privatized NEA. In my judgment, moving us outside a \nsituation where it is supported with direct tax dollars will allow the \nNational Endowment to retain its independence, to not have to get \nembroiled in this debate between censorship and obscenity; to fund \nprojects that this national entity would decide makes sense, and not \nhave to worry about whether there would be political consequences each \ntime it made said decisions.\n  I believe such an approach is in the best interests of the arts. I \ncertainly think it's in the best interests of the NEA. And I think it's \nin the best interests of the taxpayers who sent us here to make these \ndecisions.\n  Privatization of the NEA cannot happen overnight. So when I was first \nelected to the Senate, I proposed a 5-year plan to slowly reduce the \nFederal Government's support for the NEA, giving that entity the \nopportunity, the time necessary to become privately chartered, to raise \nmoney, to build the kind of support necessary to sustain itself at \nleast at the current levels, and in my judgment it would be sustained \nat a much greater level if it was privately supported.\n  I believe, if we provide a similar kind of timeframe from now forward \nas I originally contemplated--that is through the year 2000, that is \nnow 3 years away--that would be adequate to accomplish this mission.\n  So, first we need time. Second, we would need to provide, I think, \nsome mechanism, some assistance to the NEA to allow it to move to a \nsituation where it was privately supported. As I say, my proposal is \nthat it be phased out over 3 years. That will give organizations who \nare looking to receive support, lead time to make long range plans. It \nwill give the NEA time to build support in the private sector for its \ncontinuance.\n  As a consequence, I am offering an amendment that would set in motion \nthe first year of that 3-year plan, by reducing the budget for the NEA \naccordingly, by approximately one-third. At the same time, I think we \nneed to provide help. Consequently, my amendment would provide the NEA \nwith the authorization to go forward and use some of its dollars to \nbegin the fundraising activities needed for it to be an independent \nentity.\n  In addition, it would be my plan, if my amendment is agreed to, to \nsubsequently introduce a sense-of-the-Senate resolution which would \nencapsulate the full privatization plan that I contemplate. It would \nalso be my plan to work with other interested Members of the Senate to \nprovide additional tools that would make it more feasible for the NEA \nto function in a private sense.\n\n[[Page S9404]]\n\n For example, ideas which we have looked at already would be the \ncreation of a special postage stamp which would be marketed and sold at \na greater amount than 32 cents, with the proceeds being made available \nto the private entity.\n  Other ideas which have been discussed would include such things as a \ntax checkoff on the tax form through which people could direct a small \nnumber of dollars they would otherwise be paying to the NEA. So, in \nfact, the people who really wanted to support it would be given this \nopportunity. There are a variety of other ways that we can do it.\n  The point is, I believe it is very feasible to generate private-level \nsupport at least as great as we are providing currently, at \napproximately $100 million a year. I say that for the following \nreasons. First of all, we already know that in this country the arts \nare supported on an annual basis by approximately $9 billion of \nactivity and support of this type.\n  In addition, we have specific institutions, arts institutions, in \nthis country, such entities as the Lincoln Center, the Metropolitan \nMuseum of Art and many others, that have an annual operating budget \nconsiderably greater than the National Endowment for the Arts. So it is \ncertainly the case that support is out there across this country to \nprovide the kind of resources necessary for the entity to function \nprivately and absolutely would be the case if such funds were available \nif we provided some of the tools that I mentioned earlier.\n  In addition, as I have indicated in previous speeches on this, I \nthink there are a number of other mechanisms that could be available to \nthe National Endowment for the Arts if it became a private entity to \nraise funds. They range from fundraising events, where the artists, the \nvery artists, in fact, who come and knock on our doors urging us to \nsupport the entity, could produce and support fundraising activities on \nbehalf of that private entity.\n  My belief is that such events, whether they are simple dinners or \nthey are concerts and performances of that sort, could generate \nenormous amounts of money. In fact, I was noting the other day that one \nof the artists who has been down to see Members of Congress, Garth \nBrooks, just had a concert in Central Park, NY. Approximately 700,000 \npeople attended that concert. It was broadcast on the HBO network. I am \nsure a huge amount of revenue was generated by the event. Those are the \nkinds of things I would think artists would be available to do in \nsupport of the NEA, especially those artists who have come to us and \nhave said, this is a worthwhile project that ought to be supported.\n  I also believe there could be support generated for special events. \nAs I pointed out in the Labor Committee when I brought a similar \namendment before that committee a couple of years ago, each year during \nthe various televised awards ceremonies celebrating the arts, such as \nthe Oscars, the Emmys, the Tonys, the country and western musical award \nshows, and so on, we hear a great deal of support expressed for the NEA \nby the very performers who attend those events and give away awards. \nThose programs are literally built around the appearance of these pro-\nNEA entertainers, and it is my suspicion that those programs generate \nextraordinarily substantial profits for the networks that broadcast \nthem. Indeed, I believe just a couple of years ago it was estimated \nthat the Academy Awards show drew a worldwide audience of over 500 \nmillion people.\n  Certainly, that is the type of programming that could be turned into \na fundraising opportunity for a private entity supporting the arts. \nIndeed, as I pointed out a couple of years ago, only 5 percent of the \naudience that watched were still willing to pay to watch through a pay-\nper-view broadcast of that type of program. It would generate more \nrevenue, given the rates that one charges for those pay-per-view shows, \nmore revenue than the NEA's current budget.\n  Again, all these are opportunities that I think exist out there, and \nI believe we should move in the direction of providing the NEA with the \nchance to benefit from that type of support.\n  There are others as well: Collaborative efforts of artists ranging \nfrom the kind of support we saw a few years ago for USA for Africa when \nthe ``We Are the World'' recording produced approximately $60 million \nof support for that cause, to similar types of collaboration, or the \npossibility of reimbursements for commercially successful grants and \nevents which the NEA provides the seed money for.\n  In short, Mr. President, a variety of opportunities, I think, exist, \nand I think, therefore, it is feasible for the private entity to at \nleast generate the type of support that we provide annually and, in my \njudgment, probably considerably more support as if it truly was, as I \nbelieve it can be, a national level organization.\n  Another question, of course, that also has been raised by my \namendment is, are there other important American treasures--perhaps \narts related, perhaps not--that we ought to be considering funding? So \nwhat my amendment does, in addition to beginning the process of \nprivatization of the NEA, is to expend the dollars which would be \nreduced from the NEA's budget on the preservation of American \ntreasures, the restoration of national treasures. Let me outline the \nspecifics.\n  First of all, $8 million for the restoration of the Star Spangled \nBanner. The cost to transfer the flag to begin its restoration will be \napproximately $1 million alone. It was recently reported in the media \nthat the total cost could run as high as $15 million. Currently, the \nSmithsonian's calculating this amount will not confirm this number, but \nthe $8 million we would earmark in my amendment represents a \nresponsible amount to begin the preservation effort of the Star \nSpangled Banner itself, the actual flag which prompted Francis Scott \nKey to write America's National Anthem.\n  The amendment would also provide $8 million for the preservation of \nPresidential papers. Our former Presidents were prolific writers, Mr. \nPresident. Their works survive to this date. Private enterprises worked \nfor over 40 years to preserve the works of Jefferson, Adams, Madison, \nFranklin, and other Founding Fathers, and they will not survive another \ntwo centuries.\n\n  The National Archives has focused its resources on preserving modern \nelectronic records of local and State archives. The National Historic \nPublications and Records Commission once provided about one-third of \nthe funding for the preservation of the Presidents' works, but has \nrecently announced that the projects will now have to contend with \nwhatever is left after it has satisfied the local archives proposal.\n  The fact is the preservation of Presidential papers is now at some \nrisk. As a consequence, approximately $8 million of these earmarked \nfunds would go to maintaining active support adequate to maintain our \nPresidents' documents.\n  Two million dollars in this amendment is directed at the restoration \nof Ellis Island, the site of the arrival of so many people in the \nUnited States. On islands 2 and 3, the old hospital ward, the \ncrematorium and housing for immigrants are in desperate condition and \nappear in the same condition as when they were abandoned by the U.S. \nCoast Guard in 1954.\n  The National Trust for Historic Preservation has listed these \nbuildings as 1 of the 11 most endangered historic sites in America. The \n$2 million which my amendment would earmark to Ellis Island restoration \nwould prevent water intrusion and provide the ventilation and other \nsupport services necessary to preserve this national treasure.\n  There are other components, as well, to my amendment, one which would \ngo toward helping to address a serious problem at Mount Rushmore, to \nmaintain that facility in good condition, as well as preservation of \nthe manuscripts and original works of great American composers which \nare at some risk now of being, like the Presidents' papers, \ninadequately supported.\n  In short, my amendment does several things. It sets us on the course \nto privatize the National Endowment for the Arts as opposed to an \nimmediate abolition, a 3-year timeframe in which we would slowly give \nthat entity the opportunity to move in the direction of privatization.\n  Second, it would protect and provide support to protect key national \ntreasures--the Star Spangled Banner, our Presidential papers, the \nmanuscripts and original works of great American\n\n[[Page S9405]]\n\ncomposers, Ellis Island, and Mount Rushmore.\n  Finally, I think it would help end the division that continues to \nexist at all levels with respect to the National Endowment for the \nArts. By making the Endowment a private entity, we will take this \nissue, this very divisive issue, out of the Congress, give the arts the \nopportunity to act and give this entity the opportunity to act in an \nindependent fashion without a lot of strings and a lot of limitations \nand allow us, as a consequence, I think, to move on in other \ndirections.\n  We would still have a national entity. We would still have that \nentity supporting worthwhile projects as it deemed, but we would no \nlonger have the ongoing battle I have outlined between the argument on \nthe one hand that we are too often using taxpayers' dollars for \nobjectionable activities and the argument on the other that every time \nwe apply strings to these dollars, we are engaging in a form of \ncensorship.\n  Mr. President, I think this is the right course to follow because it \nwould accomplish the goals I have set forth, and tomorrow I will be \nspeaking in greater detail on this during the debate time that has been \nset aside.\n  At this point, I yield the floor. I thank the Presiding Officer for \nthe time.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside \nthe pending committee amendments and call up amendment No. 1196.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Hutchinson] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1196.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 152, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following:\n\n             TITLE VII--AMERICAN HERITAGE RIVERS INITIATIVE\n\n     SEC. 701. AMERICAN HERITAGE RIVERS INITIATIVE.\n\n       (a) In General.--During fiscal year 1998 and each fiscal \n     year thereafter, the President and other officers of the \n     executive branch may implement the American Heritage Rivers \n     Initiative under Executive Order 13061 (62 Fed. Reg. 48445) \n     only in accordance with this section.\n       (b) Designation by Congress.--\n       (1) Nominations.--The President, acting through the Chair \n     of the Council on Environmental Quality shall submit to \n     Congress nominations of the 10 rivers that are proposed for \n     designation as American Heritage Rivers.\n       (2) Prioritization.--The nominations shall be subject to \n     the prioritization process established by the Clean Water Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.), the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 300f et seq.), and other applicable Federal law.\n       (3) Consultation with Property Owners.--To ensure the \n     protection of private property owners along a river proposed \n     for nomination, all property owners holding title to land \n     directly abutting river bank shall be consulted and asked to \n     offer letters of support for or opposition to the nomination.\n       (3) Designation.--The American Heritage Rivers Initiative \n     may be implemented only with respect to rivers that are \n     designated as American Heritage Rivers by Act of Congress.\n       (c) Definition of river community.--For the purposes of the \n     American Heritage Rivers Initiative, as used in Executive \n     Order 13061, the term ``river community'' shall include all \n     persons that own property, reside, or regularly conduct \n     business within 10 miles of the river.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, this amendment supports one of our \nmost fundamental rights, the right of property ownership. This \nfundamental right, I believe, is threatened by an Executive order \nsigned by the President on September 11 designating the American \nHeritage Rivers Initiative. This initiative is intended ``to help \ncommunities and protect the river resources in a way that integrates \nnatural resource protection, economic development, and the preservation \nof historic and cultural values.''\n  Who could be opposed to that? That, I think, is a goal that all of us \nshare. However, in the eyes of those who live along these historic \nrivers, this initiative is just another Washington power grab for \nvaluable river front property. It is another Washington intrusion under \nthe guise of a program that has never--has never--been authorized or \nappropriated.\n  This Executive order allows for eight Cabinet Departments--the \nDepartments of Defense, Justice, Transportation, Agriculture, Commerce, \nHousing and Urban Development, Interior, and Energy--along with four \nGovernment agencies--the EPA, the NEA, the NEH, and the Advisory \nCouncil on Historic Preservation--to decide what happens to America's \nrivers. I ask you, what does a Washington bureaucrat know about the \nArkansas River or the White River, or any of the 16 leading candidates \nto be designated as American heritage rivers?\n  I have listened to my constituents, and they want vibrant river front \ncommunities that are reflective of the needs of the values of the local \ncommunity in which they live and work. They want a community-led \nprocess that will make the right decisions for their particular \ncommunity, not a federally dominated process that could dictate to \nproperty owners how they can use their land.\n  The amendment that I offer allows for the river front renaissance \nthat so many of our communities desperately need, while offering \nprotections for the average property owner and members of the community \nthat must live with the decisions that are made.\n  My amendment provides the necessary safeguard for property owners and \ncommunities, while at the same time allowing these river communities to \nbenefit from the Federal funds that are available to improve their \npolluted or damaged river areas and spur economic development.\n  Specifically, my amendment requires that the list of 10 rivers, \nnominated through the American Rivers Heritage Initiative, be submitted \nfor congressional review. It also ensures that the nominations for the \ninitiative will be subject to existing priorities that have been \nestablished by the Clean Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n  Most importantly, this amendment ensures protection of private \nproperty owners who live and own property along the river proposed for \nnomination as an American heritage river. It requires that all property \nowners holding title to land directly abutting the river bank shall be \nconsulted, shall be asked to offer letters of support or letters of \nopposition to the nomination as an American heritage river.\n  This amendment also protects vital community interests by defining \nwhat constitutes a river community. Under the Executive order--a flawed \nExecutive order, indeed--anyone who is so inclined can nominate a river \nor have input into the nomination process without any relationship--\nbusiness, property ownership, any kind of connection--anywhere near the \nriver under consideration.\n  My amendment defines the river community as those persons who own \nproperty, reside, or who regularly conduct business within 10 miles of \nthe river considered for designation. This ensures that the real \ninterest of the community is truly reflected in the development, \ndesign, and operation of a river that receives the designation of an \nAmerican heritage river.\n  This, I think, is an important issue. It is an issue that many of my \nconstituents have been energized about. It has just recently come onto \nthe scene, in one sense, because the Executive order was issued \nSeptember 11, and the President is seeking to implement this. So I \nthink it is appropriate for us on this Interior appropriations bill to \nprovide some safeguards and to ensure that while the initiative moves \nforward, that the right of the property owners along these rivers is \nprotected; that there is a process that is in place to ensure that \nthose who are most vitally affected by the initiative will have input \nin the process, will have some input, have some say as to whether or \nnot that river should be so designated.\n  While it ensures the environmental protections of the Safe Drinking \nWater Act and Clean Water Act, it will also ensure that these \ncommunities, many\n\n[[Page S9406]]\n\ntimes with damaged rivers and polluted waters, will have access to \nvital Federal funds to ensure that those communities can be \nreinvigorated.\n  So I ask my colleagues to join me in support of this amendment as a \nsafeguard for private property and for American communities.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I share many of the sentiments expressed \nby my colleague from Arkansas. I believe that he has brought up an \nimportant issue, an issue that should not be decided simply by fiat \nfrom the President and the President's administration, but one that \nought to be carefully considered here by the Congress.\n  Without having read every word of his amendment, I am inclined to \ntell him that I agree with it. I must tell him at the same time, in \nthis relatively empty Senate Chamber, as he knows, his amendment will \nbe quite controversial. I am certain it will require a rollcall. For \nthat reason, I am particularly happy that he did bring it up tonight so \nthat other Members can consider its provisions so that it can be \ndebated further tomorrow. But while I had said not too long ago that I \ndid not know of a number of other amendments that will require a \nrollcall, I will have to amend that statement and say that I think that \nthe amendment of the Senator from Arkansas will require a rollcall.\n  I do hope that he and others will speak on it tomorrow. I just say \nthat I think the statement he has made is correct, that this is an \nissue in which the Congress should be involved.\n  With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/16/senate-section/article/S9386-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9406-S9407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THEMES FOR BANKRUPTCY REFORM IN THE 105TH CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to address an important \ntopic which will be coming before the Senate in the near future. In \n1994, Congress created the Bankruptcy Review Commission and charged \nthis Commission with developing suggestions for changing the bankruptcy \ncode. As the ranking member of the subcommittee with jurisdiction over \nbankruptcy at that time, I assisted in creating the Commission, When I \nbecame the chairman of the subcommittee after the 1994 elections, I \nfought to ensure that the Commission was funded. The Commission's \nreport is due on October 20, 1997. I will have much to say at that time \nabout the Bankruptcy Review Commission and the way in which it was \nconducted. As some of my colleagues may know, there have been some \ntroubling instances that have come to my attention regarding the way \nthe Commission has operated.\n  For now, however, I simply want to outline my views on the substance \nof bankruptcy reform.\n  I believe that the current bankruptcy system needs to be fixed in \nseveral ways. Under current law, it is just too easy to declare \nbankruptcy. And it is too easy for people who declare bankruptcy to \navoid repaying their debts when they have the ability to do so. Of \ncourse, decades of irresponsible and runaway spending by Washington has \nset a bad example for the American people, so Congress bears some of \nthe responsibility for this new attitude of deficit living that seems \nto push many Americans into bankruptcy.\n  With record numbers of personal bankruptcies in this country, \nAmerican businesses are losing millions of dollars a year to \nbankruptcy. And this results in higher prices for homes, cars and other \nconsumer goods for those Americans who pay their bills on time, and as \nagreed. In other words, those of us who play by the rules are picking \nup the tab for those who don't.\n  I think that Congress needs to tighten the bankruptcy system so that \nbankruptcy is reserved for only those Americans who really need the \nextraordinary protections of the bankruptcy code. At the same time, I'm \nvery aware that creditors can sometimes use abusive tactics. In fact, \nSears was recently forced to pay a multi-million dollar settlement for \nengaging In abusive activity. So, in my opinion, bankruptcy reform \nwhich will help creditors get more of what they are owed should also \ninclude reforms to enhance protections for debtors from harsh or \nabusive conduct.\n\n  Section 707(b) is one example of a situation where the bankruptcy \ncode sends the wrong signal to the American people and may encourage \nirresponsible conduct. Section 707(b) allows a bankruptcy judge to \ndismiss a chapter 7 case only to prevent substantial abuse. In other \nwords, Section 707(b) says that it's OK to abuse the bankruptcy system \nsomewhat, so long as you don't abuse it so much that the abuse becomes \nsubstantial. I think we in Congress ought to change this to say that \ndebtors can't abuse the bankruptcy system at all. The consideration of \nSection 707(b) will be very important when Congress considers reforms \nin the context of consumer bankruptcy.\n  I also believe that chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code needs \nfundamental reform. In hearings before my subcommittee on how \nbankruptcy disrupts funding for education, I learned that many \nbusinesses which attempt to re-organize flounder for too long, thereby \ndeleting the assets of the company. That's less money for creditors and \nemployees of the company. I think that this should change. The \nBankruptcy Review Commission has adopted a proposal to speed things up \nfor small businesses in chapter 11 cases. I look forward to supporting \nthat proposal in the next session of Congress.\n  I believe that Congress needs to look long and hard at the way \nattorneys are compensated in bankruptcy. It seems to me, from the \nreports I receive from around the country, that attorneys are using up \nthe assets of the bankruptcy estate without really contributing very \nmuch. And attorney's fees are paid ahead of--and at the expense of--\nschools, workers and children entitled to child support. I think that's \nsomething we need to change. I'm a little disappointed that the Review \nCommission did not really get into this issue, but it is something that \nI will be pursuing in the bankruptcy reform bill.\n  Another area which needs attention is the effect of the new global \neconomy on bankruptcy. With the increase in international trade, many \ncomplex questions arise when a multinational company declares \nbankruptcy. Right now, international insolvency is an issue where there \nisn't very much international cooperation. The United Nations recently \napproved a model law on international insolvency and bankruptcy and I \nlook forward to considering that model law in the coming year. In the \nUnited States, we put a great deal of emphasis on reorganizing \ncompanies under chapter 11. Chapter 11 protects jobs and creditors. But \nother nations don't put such an emphasis on reorganization. So these \nforeign nations sometimes aren't as respectful of our bankruptcy laws \nas they should be. Of course, the United States has exercised a \nleadership role in the area of international bankruptcies for many \nyears through section 304 of the Bankruptcy Code which recognizes the \nvalidity of foreign bankruptcies. It is time to take the next step and \nmake sure that all companies--wherever they are located--are treated \nfairly when they confront the bankruptcy laws of a foreign nation. If \ncompanies fear that they won't be treated fairly under a foreign \nnation's bankruptcy system, they may be less willing to invest. And \nthat would hamper international trade, which America needs if it is to \nremain a strong and vibrant economy.\n\n  Mr. President, unfortunately there is a very parochial perspective \namong many bankruptcy professionals. The idea has somehow flourished \nthat bankruptcy should be as broad and all-encompassing as possible. I \ndon't share this point of view. I think we have to remember that \nbankruptcy should be a last resort. And that means the bankruptcy laws \nshould be narrow and provide only as much relief as is necessary. The \nso-called automatic stay provides a clear example of the parochial \nattitude of many in the bankruptcy community. The automatic\n\n[[Page S9407]]\n\nstay is a court injunction which automatically arises whenever anyone \ndeclares bankruptcy. Earlier in this Congress, as part of the \nauthorizing legislation for the Chemical Weapons Convention, I authored \nan amendment which gives the Government an exception to the automatic \nstay so that public health and safety regulations can be enforced. So, \nthe philosophical question posed by my amendment is this: Which policy \nshould win out, bankruptcy policy or public health and safety policy? \nFor me, that choice is simple. I want to protect the American people \nfrom unsafe food and unsafe airlines. But many in the bankruptcy \ncommunity believe that Congress should make the opposite choice.\n  When we begin the process of bankruptcy reform, I will be looking to \nfind other instances in which the Bankruptcy Code harms the public so \nthat Congress can make changes to protect the public.\n  The broad themes that I believe will dominate bankruptcy reform in \nthe 105th Congress, include the following: Promoting personal \nresponsibility; protecting consumers, debtors, and the public; \npromoting international commerce; and protecting States' rights where \npossible.\n  I look forward to coming before the Senate next year with a good \nbankruptcy reform bill which promotes these themes. I hope to do that \nin a bipartisan manner. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Last weekend the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina went to \nthe polls to elect municipal governments. These local elections had \nbeen postponed from last year because of tampering with registrations, \nchiefly by the Bosnian Serbs.\n  I am happy to report, Mr. President, that this year's municipal \nelections were a success. Despite dire threats of violence against \nrefugees and displaced persons who wanted to cross over to their former \nhomes to vote, over 2 days not one single incident of serious violence \noccurred in the entire country.\n  Why? Because SFOR, led by recently reinforced American troops, made \nclear to all parties that violence would not be tolerated.\n  Every single time over the past several years when the West has been \nforceful in its behavior, the ultra-nationalists in Bosnia have backed \ndown.\n  The elections were carried out by the Organization for Security and \nCooperation in Europe [OSCE], in which the United States is an active \nmember. The OSCE deserves a great deal of credit for its successful \nlabors.\n  The results of the elections will not be known for several days. \nAlready, however, some encouraging signs are emerging. In Tuzla, the \nMuslim Party for Democratic Action [SDA] conceded defeat by Mayor Selim \nBeslagic's multi-ethnic joint list. I met Mayor Beslagic last month. He \nrepresents just the kind of democratic, tolerant, pragmatic politician \nthat can rebuild Bosnia.\n  Until now the three ethnically based parties that profess to \nrepresent the interests of the Muslims, Serbs, and Croats have \ndominated the airwaves and the patronage system. Tuzla--and perhaps \nother cities in both the federation and the Republika Srprska--show \nthat if SFOR and the international community guarantee equal access, \ntheir monopoly on power can be broken.\n  Moreover, it is likely that thanks to absentee voting and to the \nprotection offered by SFOR to returning refugees, the election may \nreverse the vile ethnic cleansing of the war. For example, the town of \nDrvar in western Herzegovina was 97 percent Serb until the town's \ninhabitants were driven out in the fall of 1995. Last weekend the \nCroats who displaced the Serbs did their best to harass returning Serb \nvoters. International election officials from the OSCE, however, \ninsisted that the Serbs be allowed to vote.\n  Several other towns like Jajce and Srebrenica, site of the largest \ncivilian massacre in Europe since World War II, may see their former \ninhabitants, in these two cases Muslims, forming the governments.\n  The international community is now faced with the stark question of \nwhether it will enforce the results of the elections by guaranteeing \nthat the newly elected councils not remain governments in exile.\n  Enforcing the election results, of course, means that the right of \nrefugees and displaced persons to return must be honored. In most cases \nthat would be able to be accomplished only by the international \ncommunity under the protection of SFOR.\n  Mr. President, I believe we have no choice in this matter. Both for \nmoral and practical reasons we must move rapidly to enforce \nresettlement of refugees. This will be a difficult task, and time is \nshort before the onset of the Balkan winter. Most likely we will have \nto begin with highly visible demonstration returns in one to two \nselected towns. But we must keep the democratic momentum going.\n  Rebuilding shattered Bosnia is an immense undertaking. Now for the \nfirst time in years, there has been a string of successes. The United \nStates has been the prime mover in these, and we must continue our \nvaluable and honorable work.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/16/senate-section/article/S9407-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I join with \nmy colleagues in celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month.\n  Since 1968, we have formally recognized and celebrated the tremendous \ncontributions of Hispanic-Americans to the history, strength, security, \nand development of our great nation. This year, we once again embark on \nthis\n\n[[Page S9408]]\n\nmonth-long celebration. It is right to honor more than five centuries \nof contributions by Hispanics to the development not only of our great \nnation, but of the Western Hemisphere and the world.\n  As I look back on the history of my own State I see the many great \ncontributions Hispanics have made to its development and progress. It \nwas Father Escalante who first chartered the territory of what is now \nUtah and made way for the major trade routes that followed. It was \nthrough the determination, sweat, and dedication of Mexican-Americans \nand other Hispanics, working alongside nonHispancs that our railroads, \ngreat steel plants, and mining industries were established, making our \nState competitive in national and global markets. And our State is home \nto many great Hispanic-Americans, past and present, including Antonio \nAmador, former Vice-chair of the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board; \nJudge Andrew Valdez, Maria Garciaz, the executive director of \nNeighorhood Housing Services, Inc.; and John Medina, chair of Utah's \nCoalition of La Raza.\n  My experience has shown me that Hispanics are a strong and proud \npeople, loyal, patriotic, courageous, and dedicated to their families, \ntheir country, and their communities. Hispanics have a strong work \nethic and tremendous faith in the American dream. They have made great \ncontributions to the advancement of all people in every area, to music, \nthe arts, science, engineering, mathematics, and government.\n  I am thrilled to see so many wonderful Hispanic role models help \nlight the way for Hispanic youth to attain the American Dream.\n  Jaime Escalante, the Garfield High School mathematics teacher, helped \nan unprecedented number of Hispanic students prepare for and pass the \nadvanced placement tests in calculus. And, Amalia V. Betanzos, \npresident of the John V. Lindsay Wilcat Academcy, an alternative high \nschool with tremendous success rates, has helped us all to see what \nfaith and encouragement can do for the soul.\n  Such great recording artists as Los Lobos, the late Selena, Freddy \nFender, and Gloria Estefan have brought joyous latin rhythms into our \nhomes and our hearts. Great authors, like Luis Valdez, Victor \nVillasenor, and Nicholasa Mohr, and great screen artists like the late \nRaul Julia, Andy Garcia, Jimmy Smits, Edward James Olmos, and Rita \nMoreno have entertained while they inspired us. And the leadership and \nforesight of Permanent United Nations Representative and former \nCongressman Bill Richardson, and Carmen Zapata, director and cofounder \nof the Billingual Foundation of the Arts, helps pave the way for our \nchildren as they enter the 21st century.\n  And, of course, Nancy Lopez, Chi Chi Rodriguez, Pedro Morales, Gigi \nFernandez, and Trent Dimas are but five of the great athletes who have \nshared with us the pride and success born of great sacrifice and a \nhunger for perfection. We are proud of their accomplishments. It is \nimportant that, when they win, all America cheers.\n\n  But for all their contributions to the strength of our Nation, many \nHispanics have not yet fully shared in the dream. The national dropout \nfor Hispanics exceeds 30 percent--for nonHispanics the rate is 11 \npercent, and for blacks, the rate is 12 percent--the highest for any \nethnic group, and their educational attainment levels are among the \nlowest for any ethnic group. Hispanic children are most likely to be \namong America's poor, even though Hispanic males have the highest labor \nparticipation rates. Hispanics are most likely to lack health insurance \nand access to regular health care, yet suffer disproportionately from \ncertain diseases. We must do better.\n  As the youngest and fastest growing minority community in the Nation, \nHispanics must share equally in the benefits and opportunities of this \ngreat Nation, so that our country might grow stronger and compete in \nglobal markets.\n  For this reason, in 1987, Senator John Chafee and I established the \nU.S. Senate Republican Conference Task Force on Hispanic Affairs, which \nnow numbers 24 Senators. The task force provides a unique forum for \nHispanic leaders to raise awareness and support on the national level \nfor key issues facing the Hispanic community in the areas of education, \neconomic development, employment, and health. The task force is aided \nby a bipartisan, volunteer advisory committee, for whose service we are \nvery grateful.\n  We have made great strides and we continue to progress. But I long \nfor the day when a task force on Hispanic affairs no longer exists \nbecause there is no longer a need; because Hispanics will have \nsucceeded in full measure in joining the ranks of the public officials, \nthe managers, the CEO's and presidents of corporations, the teachers, \ndoctors, lawyers, the U.S. Senators, Congressmen, and Presidents of the \nUnited States. As we gather this month to celebrate Hispanic Heritage \nMonth, let us celebrate the accomplishments of this year's Hispanic \nHeritage Awards: Andy Garcia, Nancy Lopez, Amalia V. Betanzos, \nNicholasa Mohr, Bill Richardson, and Carmen Zapata.\n  And, let's also give a nod to those many, many other Hispanic-\nAmericans, whose daily contributions often go unrecognized, but whose \nlegacy continues to demonstrate the viability of the American dream.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I join my friend and colleague \nfrom Utah, Senator Hatch, and other colleagues in recognition of \nHispanic Heritage Month and to offer a few remarks regarding the \nHispanic tradition in my home State of Colorado and their many \ncontributions to our great country.\n  To begin with, Colorado is the Spanish word for red, thus we owe the \nname of our State to Hispanics. The town where I live is Ignacio which \nis Spanish for Ignatius, and the county I live in is La Plata which is \nSpanish for silver. To the east you will find Alamosa, San Luis, Monte \nVista, Antonio, Las Animas and La Junta, to name but a few towns in \nColorado.\n  As you can see, Mr. President, in my State it is next to impossible \nto look in any direction without being reminded of Hispanic heritage \nand influence. More than two thirds of the territory of the 48 \ncontiguous States was discovered, settled or governed by Spanish \nspeaking people. The Hispanic tradition in the United States is as new \nas the families who enter every year in search of a better life and as \nold as 1513 when Ponce de Leon landed on the east coast of the \npeninsula he called La Florida.\n  Hispanics have enriched us with their cultural traditions and their \ncommitment to la familia, the family. Their language, art, music, \nliterature and food are today very much part of the American landscape. \nThese contributions help make America stronger.\n  Let us not forget their contributions in defense of our country. \nHispanic blood has been spilled in every conflict and war since the \nCivil War when John Ortega of the U.S. Navy was awarded the \nCongressional Medal of Honor on December 31, 1864, and as late as May \n24, 1970 when it was awarded to Louis Rocco of Albuquerque, NM, for \nservice in Vietnam. In between these two distinguished soldiers, \nHispanics have been awarded 36 more medals making them the most \ndecorated minority in our history proportionate to their numbers. Jose \nP. Martinez of Ault, CO, is also a past recipient of this highest honor \nwe can bestow on our fighting men and women.\n  Equality is a value central to the promise of America, and we must be \nconscious and proactive in insuring that equal opportunity is available \nto all who serve and contribute to the betterment of our country. \nHispanics have fought for the idea and ideals of America and are \ndeserving of an equal share of all of its rewards, not more, not less, \nbut equal. That is the promise of America, and it is the promise we \nmust make, and keep, to America's Hispanics.\n  Mr. President, throughout my life, both personal and public, \nHispanics have honored me with their friendship and support. It is with \ngreat pleasure I honor them here on the floor of the U.S. Senate in \nrecognition of Hispanic Heritage Month.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak today as co-chair of \nthe Senate Republican Task Force on Hispanic Affairs about this month's \nfestivities honoring Hispanic heritage. Although this special month has \nbeen celebrated every year at this time since 1968, Hispanics have been \nmaking\n\n[[Page S9409]]\n\ntremendous contributions to our Nation and to my State of Arizona for \nmany generations.\n  American culture has been enriched by numerous Hispanic influences. \nMany Americans claim Hispanic culture as their own in everything from \nfood to music, and even celebrate their holidays. This month, set aside \nby Presidential proclamation, marks several historical events including \nIndependence Day for Mexico, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, \nHonduras, and Nicaragua and El Dia de la Raza.\n  It is important to recognize the rich variety of backgrounds that \nmake up this burgeoning segment of society. All too often the various \ngroups that make up Hispanics are lumped together and non-Hispanics \nforget the dynamic differences between Mexicans and Puerto Ricans or \nSalvadorans and Cubans, for example. But when Hispanics come together--\ntied by social and cultural similarities--they form a powerful group \nthat we need to listen to closely.\n  With more than 22 million Hispanics living in the United States, \ntheir importance cannot be understated. The number of Hispanic children \nis only exceeded by the number of non-Hispanic white children. This \ngeneration of children will enter all sectors of public and private \nlife and shape the course of the Nation. And our Nation will be a \nbetter place for it.\n  Their contribution to the economy is significant, with studies \nindicating that Hispanic businesses remain the fastest growing segment \nof the small business community. In Arizona alone, the current Hispanic \nbuying power is approximately $6.8 billion with an expected growth of \n2.3 percent annually.\n  While these statistics are compelling, surprisingly, there is much \nmore to be done. The Hispanic dropout rate has hovered around 30 \npercent for the past 20 years, and Hispanics are the minority least \nlikely to have health insurance. The negative reprecussions of these \nconditions are not acceptable and are detrimental to America's future.\n  To further the social and economic well-being of Hispanics we must \naddress their needs with conscientious policy and remember these in all \nour legislative efforts. That is why I am co-chair of the Senate \nRepublican Task Force on Hispanic Affairs. The task force helps ensure \nthat the needs of the Hispanic community are represented in Federal \npolicy. Through meetings and forums, I speak with Hispanics both in \nArizona and from all over the country.\n  Some of the Hispanics we will be hearing from and recognizing this \nmonth include Sandy Ferniza, president of the Arizona Hispanic Chamber \nof Commerce [AHCC], who recently received the Exemplary Leadership \nAward. She is credited with turning AHCC into an agency that provides \ntechnical assistance and training to small businesses across the State. \nAlso there is Mr. William Y. Velez, a mathematics professor at the \nUniversity of Arizona, who this month received the Excellence in \nScience, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring Presidential Award. He \nrecruits Hispanic and native American students to study mathematics. We \nthank them for their contributions to America's future.\n  During Hispanic Heritage Month we will learn about the colorful and \nproud heritage of the Hispanic people who are dedicated to their \nfamilies, communities, and country. And when this month's celebrations \nhave come to a close, let us not forget that the success of Hispanic \nAmericans is critical to the future of the United States.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my colleagues \nhere today in recognizing Hispanic Heritage Month.\n  Americans of Hispanic descent are in this country because they, their \nparents, or grandparents, or great-grandparents, or even more distant \nancestors, made a choice. They were decisive, motivated individuals who \nmade an act of faith in America.\n  They came here, much as my own great-great-grandfather, Denis DeWine, \ndid back in the 1840's--because they wanted a chance at a brighter \nfuture. And in return, they were willing to work hard to build up this \ncountry.\n  That same spirit lives on in today's U.S. Hispanic community--and we \nought to look at that spirit as an inspiration to ensure that America \nremains the kind of place people would want to come to.\n  There's one area of law I'm working on that is especially important \nin this context. I'm talking about the attempts to change America's \nimmigration law and make it more restrictive. I read one article in \nwhich advocates of restriction repeatedly called new Americans \n``aliens''--not ``immigrants'' but ``aliens,'' as if they were a \ndifferent kind of people from us, who come from someplace as strange as \nouter space.\n  I call these people something else. I call them Americans.\n  Now, we all know that there's nothing new about anti-immigrant \nmovements. We've had them again and again, throughout American history. \nBut we have established a proud tradition in this country of overcoming \nthem, of resisting the temptation to turn inward to ourselves--of \nwelcoming new people and new ideas, and choosing hope over fear.\n  When Franklin Roosevelt reminded America that even those who came \nover on the Mayflower were immigrants--when John F. Kennedy wrote a \nbook called ``A Nation of Immigrants''--when Ronald Reagan moved the \nNation with stories about how the light from Liberty's torch was \nkeeping hope alive for millions of people in oppressed countries--they \nwere expressing something truly fundamental about what it means to be \nan American. And make no mistake about it--that same spirit is still \nalive and well in today's America.\n  Ohioans of Hispanic ancestry have helped build the Buckeye State into \nan economic and cultural powerhouse. We are grateful to these fellow \nOhioans, because they took the talents they or their ancestors were \nborn with to a foreign land, and chose to bestow their benefits to us.\n  In fact, next week the Hispanic Youth Foundation [HYF], an \norganization that provides financial assistance to undergraduate and \ngraduate students seeking degrees in areas of political science or \nother fields related to government of public service, will meet in \nWashington, DC, to distribute scholarships to only seven outstanding \nstudents. I am proud to announce that one of the seven students \nreceiving this scholarship award is from the great State of Ohio.\n  I join all my fellow citizens in saying thank you--and saluting \nOhio's Hispanic community on the occasion of Hispanic Heritage Month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/16/senate-section/article/S9407-4", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9409-S9410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    REPORT OF DRAFT LEGISLATION ENTITLED ``THE EXPORT EXPANSION AND \nRECIPROCAL TRADE AGREEMENTS ACT OF 1997''--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--\n                                 PM 65\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Finance.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit a legislative proposal entitled the ``Export \nExpansion and Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1997.'' Also \ntransmitted is a section-by-section analysis.\n  This proposal would renew over 60 years of cooperation between the \nCongress and the executive branch in the negotiation and implementation \nof market-opening trade agreements for the benefit of American workers \nand companies.\n  The sustained, robust performance of our economy over the past 5 \nyears is powerful proof that congressional-executive cooperation works. \nWe have made great strides together. We have invested in education and \nin health care for the American people. We have achieved an historic \nbalanced budget agreement. At the same time, we have put in place trade \nagreements that have lowered barriers to American products and services \naround the world.\n  Our companies, farms, and working people have responded. Our economy \nhas produced more jobs, more growth, and greater economic stability \nthan at any time in decades. It has also generated more exports than \never before. Indeed, America's remarkable economic performance over the \npast 5 years has been fueled in significant part by the strength of our \ndynamic export sector. Fully 96 percent of the world's consumers live \noutside the United States. Many of our greatest economic opportunities \ntoday lie beyond our borders. The future promises still greater \nopportunities.\n\n[[Page S9410]]\n\n  Many foreign markets, especially in the developing world, are growing \nat tremendous rates. Latin American and Asian economies, for example, \nare expected to expand at three times the rate of the U.S. economy over \nthe coming years. Consumers and industries in these countries prize \nAmerican goods, farm products, services, and the many expressions of \nAmerican inventiveness and culture. While America is the world's \ngreatest exporting nation, we need to do more if we want to continue to \nexpand our own economy and produce good, high-wage jobs.\n  We have made real progress in breaking down barriers to American \nproducts around the world. But many of the nations with the highest \ngrowth rates almost invariably impose far higher trade barriers than we \ndo. We need to level the playing field with those countries. They are \nthe nations whose markets hold the greatest potential for American \nworkers, firms, and agricultural producers.\n  Today, the United States is the world's strongest competitor. The \nstrength of the U.S. economy over the past several years is testimony \nto the creativity, productivity, and ingenuity of American firms and \nworkers. We cannot afford to squander our great advantages by \nretreating to the sidelines and watching other countries conclude \npreferential trade deals that shut out our goods and services. Over 20 \nsuch agreements have been concluded in Latin America and Asia alone \nsince 1992. The United States must continue to shape and direct world \ntrading rules that are in America's interest and that foster democracy \nand stability around the globe.\n  I have pledged my Administration to this task, but I cannot fully \nsucceed without the Congress at my side. We must work in partnership, \ntogether with the American people, in securing our country's future. \nThe United States must be united when we sit down at the negotiating \ntable. Our trading partners will only negotiate with one America--not \nfirst with an American President and next with an American Congress.\n  The proposal I am sending you today ensures that the Congress will be \na full partner in setting negotiating objectives, establishing trade \npriorities, and in gaining the greatest possible benefits through our \ntrade agreements. The proposal expands upon previous fast-track \nlegislation to ensure that the Congress is fully apprised and actively \nconsulted throughout the negotiating process. I am convinced that this \ncollaboration will strengthen both America's effectiveness and leverage \nat the bargaining table.\n  Widening the scope of consultations will also help ensure that we \nwill take all of America's vital interests into account. That is \nparticularly important because today our trade agreements address a \nwider range of activities than they once did. As we move forward with \nout trade agenda, we must continue to honor and reinforce the other \nvalues that make America an example for the world. I count chief among \nthese values America's longstanding concern for the rights of workers \nand for protection of the environment. The proposal I am transmitting \nto you recognizes the importance of those concerns. It makes clear that \nthe agreements we conclude should complement and reinforce those \nvalues.\n  Ever since President Franklin Roosevelt proposed and the Congress \nenacted America's first reciprocal trade act in the depths of the Great \nDepression, the Congress and the President have been united, on a \nbipartisan basis, in supporting a fair and open trading system. Our \npredecessors learned from direct experience the path to America's \nprosperity. We owe much of our own prosperity to their wisdom. I urge \nthe Congress to renew our longstanding partnership by approving the \nproposal I have transmitted today.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to \nreauthorize the National Flood Insurance Program; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n        THE NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the National \nFlood Insurance Reauthorization Act of 1997 (NFIRA). This legislation \nprovides for a simple and straightforward 5-year extension of the \nNational Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) which is scheduled to expire on \nSeptember 30, 1997. This legislation will ensure that this important \nprogram is placed on a steady and secure foundation to continue the \ninvaluable protection it provides to flood insurance policyholders and \nthe Federal taxpayers. I am pleased that my colleague, Senator \nSarbanes, the distinguished ranking member of the Banking Committee, \nhas cosponsored this measure.\n  The National Flood Insurance Program, which is administered by the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA], enables over 3.5 million \nAmerican families to insure their homes and possessions. In my home \nState of New York, 85,000 families participate in the NFIP. The NFIP \nallows these families, on Long Island and along the Great Lakes and the \nState's many rivers, to purchase adequate insurance coverage to protect \ntheir homes in the event of a catastrophic flood.\n  The NFIP employs a comprehensive approach to alleviating the risks \nposed by catastrophic floods. Floodplain communities participate in \nFEMA's Community Rating System and are offered incentives to adopt and \nenforce measures to reduce the risk of flood damage and improve flood \nprevention building criteria. To avoid the danger of repetitive losses, \nthe program provides stringent building standards, including increased \nelevation, designed to reduce the risk of future damage. These flood \nprotection standards must be met before any structure which suffers \nsubstantial damage may be rebuilt. In addition, persons who receive \ndisaster assistance and fail to subsequently purchase flood insurance \nare barred from receiving future assistance.\n  Mr. President, the NFIP plays a critical role in reducing the costs \nof Federal disaster relief. Current NFIP policyholders pay \napproximately $1.3 billion annually into the NFIP fund. Without this \npremium income, the Federal Government would likely pay spiraling costs \nin disaster relief. The NFIP has the added benefits of improving State \nand community planning and Federal support for locally driven disaster \nprevention and mitigation activities.\n  Reauthorizing the NFIP is an important step forward in reaffirming \nthe commitment of the Federal Government to help American families \nprotect their homes and to protect the Federal taxpayer from the risks \nof catastrophic floods. Clearly, we must do more. Lenders and private \ninsurers who participate in the NFIP must do more to ensure compliance. \nStates and local communities must improve their disaster planning, \nprevention, and response activities. FEMA must redouble its efforts to \nincrease participation in the program to improve the safety and \nsoundness of the NFIP fund. Also, the Federal Government must do more \nto prevent and mitigate against the losses which will inevitably occur \nfrom future floods.\n  Mr. President, I note that this bill is supported by the \nadministration. I urge my colleagues to support the adoption of this \nlegislation and I look forward to working with the members of the \nBanking Committee to ensure a swift and speedy passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KEMPTHORNE (for himself, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. \n        Reid):\n  S. 1180. A bill to reauthorize the Endangered Species Act; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n              THE ENDANGERED SPECIES RECOVERY ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, 2 years ago, in Lewiston, ID, as \nchairman of the Drinking Water Fisheries and Wildlife Subcommittee, I \nheld a hearing to review the current Endangered Species Act and to \nidentify ways to improve the act. It was clear from the testimony we \nheard that the current law simply is not working. It isn't working for \nspecies and it isn't working for people. That message was loud and \nclear. Senator Chafee was there with us at that meeting.\n  We must do a better job of protecting species without jeopardizing \nour communities. The legislation that I am introducing today with \nSenator Chafee, Senator Baucus, and Senator Reid will do just that. It \nwill bring real and fundamental reform to the Endangered Species Act, \nand it will minimize the social and economic impact of the ESA on the \nlives of ordinary citizens, and it will benefit species. That is the \ncritical point.\n  I want to thank Senators Chafee, Baucus, and Reid, who have worked \ndiligently with me as we have crafted this legislation, which brings \nabout balance and a bipartisan approach to a very sensitive issue.\n  There are over 1,000 species on the endangered species list today but \nfewer than half of them have ever had a recovery plan written for them. \nThe best evidence that the current law isn't working may be the fact \nthat not a single species has recovered as a result of a recovery plan. \nIt is as if you have a recovery room filled with patients and one by \none these patients are brought in, given an examination by the doctor, \nand at the conclusion of the examination the doctor says, ``Yes, you \nare critical. Next.'' ``What do you mean, next, doctor? What is the \nprescription? What is the recovery for this critical condition?\"\n  The emphasis has not been on recovery. It has been on continuing to \nlist, list, list, without the emphasis on recovery.\n\n[[Page S9412]]\n\n  But the law must also have balance. It must recognize the rights of \npeople, too.\n  During our hearings, we heard many compelling stories from people who \nhave had to live with the real life impact of the Endangered Species \nAct. We heard from families in Owyhee County, ID, who cannot get bank \nloans for their homes because the listing of a tiny snail--the Bruneau \nHot Springs snail--has caused their property value to plummet.\n  We heard from a woman in Laramie, WY, who told us that the mosquito \ncontrol program in their community had been suspended because of the \nESA, causing severe health risks for the citizens of Laramie, including \nher son who contracted encephalitis from a mosquito.\n  We heard from a rancher in Joseph, OR, who described how Federal \nregulators, under the threat of lawsuit from environmentalists, tried \nto stop all grazing on forest lands up in the mountains because salmon \nwere spawning in streams that ran through the private land below, but \nin his words, ``The cows were up in the high country as far from the \nspawning habitat as you could get.''\n  And we heard from mill workers who lost their jobs when the ESA all \nbut shut down logging in certain national forests. I think that Ray \nBrady from Grangeville, ID, may have captured best the underlying \nfeeling of frustration and anxieties:\n       We had a choice of moving, of going someplace else. Why \n     should we? I chose to live in a small community like \n     Grangeville. I chose to work there. I worked there for 28 \n     years and somebody else in a different part of the country \n     makes a decision that has cost me my job and occupation and \n     28 years worth of experience. Now I am having to start all \n     over again. I don't have any income. I don't have any \n     insurance for my family or myself; and I attribute it \n     directly to this Endangered Species Act. Somebody has to do \n     something about it. I mean, not in the future, I mean now.\n\n  Ray Brady is right. We need to improve the way that the ESA works, \nand we need to do it right now. We need an ESA that will make advocates \nout of adversaries. As it's administered today, it separates people \nfrom their environment. It invites Federal regulators to become land \nuse managers over some of the best stewards of our environment--our \nfarmers and our ranchers and our landowners. And we need their help if \nwe are truly going to save species. Just remember, well over half of \nour endangered species depend on private property.\n  The ESA must provide more incentives to encourage property owners to \nbecome partners in the conservation of a rare and unique species.\n  The bill we are introducing today will achieve those goals. It will \nmake the law work better. It will reduce unnecessary bureaucracy; it \nwill enhance the recovery of species; and it will treat property owners \nfairly.\n\n  Let me highlight just a few of the significant improvements that we \nhave included in this legislation.\n  The bill will put new emphasis on the need to use good science in \neverything from the listing process through recovery. The Secretary \nwill be required to use the best available science in all of his \ndecisions and to give greater preference to information that is \nempirical and peer reviewed. In addition, all listing and delisting \ndecisions will be subject to independent peer review. That means that \nwe can all have greater confidence in the decisions made under the ESA.\n  The bill will add teeth to the recovery planning process so that \nwe're no longer just running an endangered species emergency room \nwithout also providing the prescription for recovery. For the first \ntime, we will set deadlines for the development of recovery plans for \nevery listed species. Each recovery plan will be developed by a \nrecovery team that includes scientists, economists, and representatives \nof the communities that are affected by the listing of the species. And \nwe establish new substantive requirements for each recovery plan, \nincluding recovery measures, benchmarks to measure progress, and a \nbiological recovery goal that will trigger delisting when it is met. \nWe'll know that the law is working well when species are no longer just \nbeing listed, but when they're also being delisted as a result of a \nsuccessful recovery plan.\n  The bill recognizes that we can reduce bureaucracy and unnecessary \nFederal interference with land management decisions without harming \nspecies. In the consultation process, for example, the fact is that \npeople spend too much time trying to comply with too many regulations \nfrom too many Federal agencies. That cannot only significantly increase \nthe cost of a project, in some cases, it can be deadly.\n  In 1996, in Yuba County, CA, for example, the Corps of Engineers was \nprevented from repairing levees south of the city of Marysville because \nof the impact that the repairs might have on the hibernating garter \nsnake. The work wasn't done and on January 2, a levee failed in \nOlivehurst, CA, killing three people and flooding 500 homes.\n  Under our bill, the Federal action agency, in that case the Corps of \nEngineers, will have the authority to make the initial determination \nthat its repairs would not be likely to adversely affect the species. \nThe levee repair could then proceed, unless the Fish and Wildlife \nService objected to the initial determination within 60 days. This \nsimple procedural fix will allow projects to be completed on time \nwithout jeopardizing endangered species.\n  Perhaps most important, the bill includes a number of incentives for \nproperty owners so that they can become partners in saving species.\n  The key is maximum flexibility and our bill provides that. For \nexample, if you're an individual who wants to clear a few acres of land \nto build your vacation home in red cockaded woodpecker territory, our \nnew low effect conservation plan may be just what you need. On the \nother hand, a county planning its development needs for the next 50 \nyears might choose to enter into a multiple species conservation plan \nto preserve habitat for all of its rare and unique species. State and \nlocal governments can even enter into conservation plans to protect \nunlisted species.\n  All of the conservation plans are backed by a no-surprises provision \nthat gives landowners certainty that their obligations will be defined \nby the plan. They won't be required to pay additional money for \nconservation measures or to further restrict their activities on the \nland covered by the plan.\n  In addition to conservation plans, the bill offers landowners the \noption of entering into separate agreements to manage land for the \nbenefit of species. A small timber company whose lands are suitable \nhabitat for spotted owls might enter into a safe harbor agreement to \nlet the trees grow to attract the owls with the understanding that at \nthe end of some agreed-upon period of time, it can harvest the trees. \nAnd a farmer might agree to set aside buffer strips for a species in \nreturn for compensation under a habitat reserve agreement.\n  Finally, the bill limits the ability of the Federal Government and \nenvironmental groups to restrict otherwise legal activities on private \nlands. Under the law today, the Government and environmental groups \nhave used the take prohibition to try to prohibit logging and \ndevelopment on private lands and a city's pumping of an aquifer for \ndrinking water, even where there was no scientific evidence that the \nactivity would in fact harm an endangered species. Our bill will change \nthat, reaffirming that the Federal Government, or an environmental \ngroup, has the burden of demonstrating that an activity will actually \nharm a species and they must meet that burden using real science, not \njust assumptions or speculation.\n  When we started this process just over 2 years ago, we asked \nourselves the question: Should we make a concerted effort to save \nspecies? The answer was yes.\n  But could we do it without putting people and communities at risk?\n  Today, I think that we've demonstrated that we can. We can save \nspecies with less bureaucracy, using good science, incentives, and \nwhere necessary, public financial resources.\n  Charles Mann and Christopher Plummer wrote in their book ``Noah's \nChoice,'' ``If we truly want to improve the lot of endangered species, \nwe should stop shooting for the stars, because the arrows will fall \nback to our feet. By aiming a little closer, we might shoot farther in \nthe desired direction.''\n  And I will add, and hit the target more often. This bill hits the \ntarget.\n  I would like to use my prerogative to just thank my staff for their \nefforts on this--Buzz Fawcett, Ann Klee, Jim\n\n[[Page S9413]]\n\nTate, and other members of my staff. I know the other Senators feel as \nI do about my staff, that they do a tremendous job. As we stand here \nwith results of 18 months of hard effort, we know of the many hours \nthey have contributed as well in making this a success.\n  Mr. President, we now have a bill that is bipartisan. We have a bill \nthat is scheduled for a hearing 1 week from today and for markup in \ncommittee where amendments will be considered 2 weeks from today. It is \nour full expectation that we will be able to bring this bill to the \nfloor of the Senate for debate and for a vote sometime near the middle \nof October. It has been many months, if not years, in the making, to \ncreate this legislation which improves the Endangered Species Act, so \nthat we can, again, save species and do it without putting people and \ncommunities at risk.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1180\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Conservation measures and exceptions.''.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am proud to sponsor, along with Senators \nKempthorne, Baucus, and Reid, the Endangered Species Recovery Act of \n1997, which reauthorizes the Endangered Species Act, and makes some \nsignificant improvements to the act which are long overdue. The \nEndangered Species Act was enacted into law in 1973 to conserve \nthreatened and endangered species, and the ecosystems upon which they \ndepend. The ESA is our most important law to protect our Nation's \nnatural resources and biological diversity, and has often been referred \nto as the ``crown jewel'' of environmental laws.\n  The ESA has been instrumental in saving some of our country's most \ntreasured species. The bald eagle and the grizzly bear have both \nrebounded from precariously small populations, and the Pacific grey \nwhale and American alligator have both recovered and have been \ndelisted. All told, almost half of the species that fall under the \nact's protection are either stabilized or improving.\n  One can understand better the vital need for the ESA when one \nrealizes what we are up against: of somewhere between 10 and 100 \nmillion species on this planet, we have discovered only some 1.4 \nmillion. Despite this bounty, loss of biological diversity is taking \nplace at a faster rate than ever before. In 1973, Congress offered this \npoignant observation: ``as we homogenize the habitats in which these \nplants and animals evolved . . . we threaten their--and our own--\ngenetic heritage. The value of this genetic heritage, is quite \nliterally, incalculable.'' It was principally for this reason that \nCongress passed the ESA in 1973.\n  Controversy has surrounded the law, however, since its passage. In \nthe mid-1970's, the law became ensnarled in a bitter fight over the \nconstruction of the $900 million Tellico Dam and the dam's impacts on \nthe hapless snail darter. The criticism has grown significantly since \n1992, when the most recent authorization of the ESA expired.\n  Since then, funding for implementing the law has been provided \nthrough annual appropriations, which has left the future of the law on \nuncertain terms, and left the current working of the law subject to \nnumerous appropriations riders, including a moratorium on the listing \nof species, that resulted in more than a year delay in affording \nprotection to hundreds of species endangered with extinction.\n  The bill we introduce today includes many reforms. The last major \namendment to the ESA was in 1988, almost 10 years ago. Since then, we \nhave developed a greater knowledge of the science of biodiversity, a \ngreater understanding of the problems in implementing the law on \nprivate lands, and in this era of shrinking government, a greater need \nfor improved coordination among all levels of government. Our bill \ntakes all this into account by focusing on several key areas: \nemphasizing recovery as the ultimate goal; seeking to prevent further \nlistings; improving the scientific foundation for decisions; increasing \npublic participation and the role of States; facilitating compliance \nby, and providing incentives for, private landowners; and streamlining \ncoordination among government agencies. In making these changes, our \nbill addresses the criticisms leveled against the ESA in recent years.\n\n[[Page S9422]]\n\n  These criticisms have come from all directions. The environmental \ncommunity believes that the law has failed in its fundamental mission \nto recover species to full health, but rather leaves species teetering \non the razor's edge of survival. Statistics bear this out: of the \napproximately 1,000 species currently listed, 41 percent are either \nimproving in status or stabilized, but only 8 percent are actually \nimproving. Furthermore, less than half of the listed species have \napproved recovery plans.\n  Private landowners, on the other hand, believe that the ESA is \nfundamentally flawed in its implementation, with inflexible \nregulations, heavy-handed enforcement, closed-door science, and no \nconsideration of economic costs. This, too, is largely borne out by the \nfacts: the ESA has very few tools, other than enforcement of certain \nprohibitions against taking listed species, with which to protect \nspecies on private lands. This weakness in the law is heightened by the \nfact that more than one-third of all listed species reside entirely on \nprivate lands. Furthermore, species on private lands are faring worse \nthan on public lands.\n  If the ESA is to succeed in its ultimate goal of recovering species, \nthese problems must be addressed. Our bill does just that. Most \nimportantly, it completely overhauls the recovery planning and \nimplementation requirements of the ESA. Previously, recovery plans were \nrequired to be prepared, but with no deadline for doing so. Once \nprepared, they generally sat on the shelves with no requirement or \nincentive to implement them. Furthermore, the scientific findings in \nthe plans were often compromised by political and economic \nconsiderations, nor was there any requirement to actually take cost of \nimplementation into account.\n  This bill requires that recovery plans be completed within a specific \ndeadline. The recovery goal must be developed by scientists, using only \nthe best science available. While economic costs and social impacts \nmust be taken into account, they are considered only in choosing the \nbest method to achieve the biologically based recovery goals. \nSpecifically, measure to achieve the recovery goal must strike an \n``appropriate balance'' among three factors: The effectiveness in \nmeeting the goal; the period of time needed to reach the goal; and the \nsocial and economic impacts.\n  For the first time, the bill provides a requirement that Federal \nagencies enter into recovery implementation agreements, and also \nprovides incentives for private persons to enter into similar \nagreements. These incentives include a waiver of consultation normally \nrequired under section 7 for actions that are described in sufficient \ndetail. They also include a requirement that Federal agencies \nparticipate in the development of an agreement upon the request of a \nprivate person, so that the person will know up-front all relevant \nrequirements in undertaking conservation actions.\n  The bill also improves significantly the law's ability to work on \nprivate lands. Under the current law, the permit process has generally \nbeen inflexible, cumbersome, and consequently rarely used. The Clinton \nadministration recently instituted a number of policies to encourage \nlandowners to apply for permits in order to conduct economic activities \nthat take listed species on their lands. As a result, the number of \npermits issued by the administration has increased from 14 in 1992 to \nmore than 200 in 1997, with an additional 250 being developed. Our bill \nvalidates and expands those policies.\n\n  The bill authorizes permits for multiple species, including both \nlisted and nonlisted species, that depend on the same habitat. New \nbiological standards for nonlisted species ensure that permitted \nactivities do not contribute to the need to list those species in the \nfuture. In order to address the needs of small landowners, a more \nstreamlined, less expensive permit process is established for low \neffect activities. Under this process,the permit can take effect \nautomatically within a certain period, provided that there are no \nsignificant adverse comments.\n  In addition, the bill authorizes several policies and incentives to \nfurther encourage landowners to work with the Federal Government. These \npolicies include a no-surprises guarantee that the Government will not \nseek additional mitigation over time; a safe harbor policy to encourage \nlandowners to protect lands valuable to species without risking \nadditional liability; and a candidate conservation policy, which \nencourages landowners to undertake protections for species before they \nbecome endangered or threatened. The bill also establishes several new \nfunding mechanisms for incentive-based programs, including a habitat \nreserve program, and a habitat conservation planning fund, which acts \nas a revolving loan fund. A program to provide technical assistance to \nlandowners is also created.\n  The bill also makes important changes to the consultation process \namong Federal agencies. It encourages consultations to be consolidated \nif they involve related actions by one agency, or they involve several \nagencies affecting the same species. The consultation process is \nstreamlined by allowing the Federal agency undertaking an action to \nmake the initial determination whether its action affects listed \nspecies, and providing an opportunity for the Fish and Wildlife \nService, or, for marine species, the National Marine Fisheries Service, \nto comment on this determination. The Service has 60 days to object, \nand require a more detailed analysis that it would prepare. This \nprocess is similar to the current practice that is used by the \nagencies.\n  The bill also addresses the relationship between site-specific and \nprogrammatic Federal land management actions. Several recent lawsuits \nenjoined numerous site-specific actions pending completion of the \nconsultation on the overarching programmatic action. The bill \nexplicitly recognizes that consultation is appropriate and required at \nboth levels of decisionmaking, but ensures an orderly process for \ncompleting those consultations. In addition, the bill affords greater \nparticipation in the consultation process for any person who has sought \nauthorization or funding from a Federal agency.\n  The bill goes a long way in improving the scientific basis on which \ndecisions are made. The greatest lack of knowledge is in the status and \ndistribution of rare and declining species. This bill requires an \ninventory of species on Federal lands to fill this critical data gap. \nListing decisions must be peer-reviewed, and petitions to list are \nsubject to certain minimum information requirements. Enforcement \nactions must use scientifically valid principles to establish whether \nthe action caused an unlawful taking of a species. In evaluating \ncomparable data, the Secretary would be required to use peer reviewed, \nfield tested or empirical data.\n\n  As you can see, Mr. President, this bill not only reauthorizes the \nESA, but it also significantly improves the ESA, in order to embrace \nneeded reforms in the law. Numerous attempts to reauthorize the ESA \nhave been made in recent years. The long and arduous effort culminating \nin today's bill began more than 18 months ago, as a bipartisan process \nto address the problems with the current law. When discussions stalled, \nSenator Kempthorne and I spurred the process forward by releasing a \ndiscussion draft, which generated hundreds of comments. Since then, we \nhave negotiated with Senators Baucus and Reid, and the Clinton \nadministration, to reach agreement on a bipartisan bill.\n  Just as the original ESA was passed by a Democratic Congress and \nsigned into law by a Republican President, this bill to reauthorize the \nESA is also a bipartisan product between a Republican Senate and a \nDemocratic administration. To quote one of the foremost \nconservationists of our country, President Teddy Roosevelt, the \nconservation of natural resources is a question ``upon which men of all \nparties and all shades of opinion may be united for the common good.'' \nThe need for a healthy environment, one large enough for all species \nthat inhabit this planet with us, is a need that transcends politics, \nand I firmly believe that the bill we introduce today fulfills that \nneed, as embodied in the original passage of the ESA.\n  I would like to thank my distinguished colleagues, Senators \nKempthorne, Baucus, and Reid, for their tireless work over the months \non this important legislation, and I would like to thank the Secretary \nof the Interior, Bruce Babbitt, as well as his very accomplished staff, \nled by Jaimie Clark, Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, and Don \nBarry, Acting Assistant Secretary for Fish, Wildlife and\n\n[[Page S9423]]\n\nParks, for their willingness to work with us in negotiating a bill that \nthey can support.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today, it is a real pleasure for me to \njoin my colleagues on the Senate Environment and Public Works, Senators \nChafee, Reid, and Kempthorne in introducing the Endangered Species \nRecovery Act of 1997. The bill we are introducing today represents a \nreal victory for bi-partisan, commonsense improvements to the \nEndangered Species Act.\n  The Endangered Species Act has been an important tool in our fight to \nconserve ecosystems and to prevent the extinction of species. But over \nthe years, experience has shown that the act can be improved, both for \nthe species it is designed to protect and for ranchers, farmers, and \nother private landowners.\n  Senators Chafee, Reid, Kempthorne, and I have been working, along \nwith the administration, for the better part of 2 years to find \nagreement on changes that will improve the ESA on the ground, where it \nreally counts.\n  The bill we are introducing today incorporates several major \nimprovements to ESA. Let me just reiterate a few that I think are \nparticularly noteworthy.\n  First, it improves the use of good science in our decisions on \nlisting species. It's important that we elevate the role of scientific \ninformation in our decisions on whether to put species on the \nendangered list. An error at this stage in the process can mean \nextinction for a species.\n  Second, the bill really turns the focus of the ESA to conserving and \nrecovering species. It puts real deadlines on development of recovery \nplans and gives States a greater role in developing those plans. And it \ninsists that we have benchmarks for measuring progress toward \nrecovering the species.\n  Third, the bill opens up the process to the public. More public \nhearings will be held on critical issues, such as whether to list a \nspecies and what actions should be taken to recover the species. And, \nmost important, these hearings can't be just in Washington. They must \nalso be in the States most affected by the issue.\n  Fourth, the bill takes important strides in cooperating with \nlandowners to conserve species. It encourages landowners to take \nvoluntary steps to improve habitat and protect species on their \nproperty. And it seeks to conserve species before they become \nendangered, thereby avoiding the need to list them.\n  The bill also provides landowners with something they have never had \nbefore, technical assistance and financial aid for the new conservation \nagreements that are created by the bill.\n  These are the kind of improvements that will make the ESA work \nbetter. That will better protect species and that will help landowners.\n  It's been a long, hard road to reach this agreement. And I want to \nagain thank Senator Chafee, Senator Reid, Senator Kempthorne and \nSecretary Babbitt for their persistence throughout this process.\n  I look forward to taking this bill to the committee and to the Senate \nfloor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KEMPTHORNE:\n  S. 1181. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nFederal tax incentives to owners of environmentally sensitive lands to \nenter into conservation easements for the protection of endangered \nspecies habitat, to allow a deduction from the gross estate of a \ndecedent in an amount equal to the value of real property subject to an \nendangered species conservation agreement, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n         the endangered species habitat protection act of 1997\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today \nwhich is intended to provide private property owners additional tools \nin their dealings with the Endangered Species Act. For both those who \nwish to participate in the conservation of land for the preservation of \nendangered, threatened, and other species and those whose participation \nis involuntary, this legislation will add to the already substantial \nmeans provided to property owners in the Endangered Species Recovery \nAct of 1997.\n  For too long the Federal Government has used its enforcement \nprocedures and it regulatory authority to dictate conservation in aid \nof endangered and threatened species. This method has failed to produce \nthe kind of results we want. The Endangered Species Act as currently \nwritten is almost all stick and no carrot. I would like to begin to \nchange that today.\n  For 18 months I have negotiated a bill to reauthorize the Endangered \nSpecies Act with the Democrats and the administration. Those \nnegotiations have been successfully completed. We have introduced a \nbill that will provide a variety of incentives to property owners to \npreserve habitat through conservation agreements and plans, prelisting \nagreements and other preservation tools. I also have a number of ideas \non how to provide tax incentives to private property owners to preserve \nhabitat.\n  Let me emphasize that inclusion of these new tax incentives will \ntruly benefit both species and people. I have met with many property \nowners who have said, ``we would be happy to step forward and preserve \nhabitat for species and we would grant a conservation easement if there \nwas an incentive.'' Well with adoption of the ideas included in this \nbill there will be.\n  I have had critics that have said that we should not provide these \nkinds of incentives to private property owners because we will have too \nmany people coming forward and saying, ``I have an endangered species \non my land.'' What is wrong with that? To my mind, that would be a \nwelcome reversal from the current prevailing attitude that some have \nabout the presence of an endangered species on their property. Right \nnow you have a situation that some land owners believe that if they do \nhave an endangered species, or if it's suggested that they might, \nthey're just as likely to try to remove the habitat to avoid a problem \ndown the road. We need to change that attitude if we're going to \nrecover endangered species.\n  We are currently at the crossroads of two systems. One where you have \nGovernment overregulation that tells people what they can and cannot do \non their land, and the other a system that encourages property owners \nto step forward and do something good for species because it's good for \nthem too.\n  We can depend on our property owners to do what's right and what is \ngood for species. I know that our farmers and ranchers know how to be \ninnovative and creative. They know how to help species. And they know \nhow to manage land.\n  The right system is one where we encourage active involvement of \nlandowners through incentives. Certainly, I know that if I were an \nendangered species, I would much rather have a friendly and willing \nlandlord--one that viewed me as an asset--than a reluctant one who \nviewed me as a threat and a liability because of some bureaucrats and \nregulations handed down from Washington, DC.\n  That is what this legislation will do. It is going to make the people \nactive partners.\n  The legislation I am introducing also includes a provision designed \nto safeguard the property rights of individuals. The Endangered Species \nRecovery Act of 1997 will do much to improve and enhance the rights of \nproperty owners. The bill limits the ability of the Federal Government \nand environmental groups to restrict otherwise legal activities on \nprivate lands. Under the law today, the Government and environmental \ngroups have used the take prohibition to try to prohibit logging and \ndevelopment on private lands and a city's pumping of an aquifer for \ndrinking water, even where there was no scientific evidence that the \nactivity would in fact harm an endangered species. Our bill will change \nthat, reaffirming that the Federal Government, or an environmental \ngroup, has the burden of demonstrating that an activity will actually \nharm a species and they must meet that burden using real science, not \njust assumptions or speculation.\n  ESRA '97 will protect the rights of property owners by making them a \npart of the process--a process that has excluded them for years. Now \ncitizens, business people and State and local government \nrepresentatives will be at the table for the development of recovery \nplans. Furthermore, the recovery plans developed will analyze the cost \non the public and private sectors and the impact on jobs and property \nvalues for any recovery plan selected.\n\n[[Page S9424]]\n\n  Under ERSA '97 we will substantially reduce the number of \nconsultations under section 7 of the act. But if a consultation is \nnecessary under the act, property owners will have both a seat at the \ntable and the information they need to meaningfully participate in the \nconsultation.\n  Throughout ERSA '97 we have kept our bond with the property owners of \nIdaho and America. But there is always more that should be done.\n  The Endangered Species Habitat Protection Act contains strong \nproperty rights language. That language was developed in conjunction \nwith some of the best minds in the property rights movement. Private \nproperty rights is a cornerstone of our democracy. As such it is \nincumbent on this Congress to address the issue in this Congress. The \nEndangered Species Habitat Protection Act contains my contribution to \nthe effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1181\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Congressional Budget and Impoundment \nControl Act of 1974 to limit consideration of nonemergency matters in \nemergency legislation and permit matter that is extraneous to \nemergencies to be stricken as provided in the Byrd rule; to the \nCommittee on the Budget and the Committee on Governmental Affairs, \njointly, pursuant to the order of of August 4, 1977, as modified by the \norder of April 11, 1986, with instructions that if one committee \nreports, the other committee have 30 days to report or be discharged.\n\n\n                   THE EMERGENCY SPENDING CONTROL ACT\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwill end a common abuse of the budget process in the Congress: the \nattachment of nonemergency provisions to emergency spending bills. \nSenator Abraham and Senator Gramm are also original sponsors of this \nlegislation.\n  At a time when Congress and the President have come together and \nagreed on a plan to balance the budget by the year 2002, I believe it \nis appropriate that we now seek to ensure that\n\n[[Page S9427]]\n\nall future spending decisions be fully weighed and considered before \nthe tax dollars of hard-working Americans are spent. We must ensure \nthat the costs and benefits of a proposal are thoroughly reviewed \nthrough our carefully structured budget process--not allowed to be \npushed through the Congress with minimal debate and consideration. The \nlegislation I am introducing today would address one of the ways in \nwhich spending programs are pushed through Congress with minimal budget \nscrutiny: the attachment of nonemergency provisions to emergency \nspending bills.\n  Mr. President, as my colleagues know, emergency spending bills have \nbeen afforded special treatment because of the unique problems they \naddress. While the annual budget and appropriations process typically \ntakes months to complete, emergency spending legislation often receives \nspecial, accelerated consideration that can lead to its adoption in \ndays or weeks. This expedited treatment is understandable: When a \nflood, earthquake, or other natural disaster imperils the lives and \nsafety of the American people, Congress and the President should be \nready and able to respond quickly.\n  We have even made special exceptions for emergency spending bills \nwithin our budgetary rules to ensure that disasters and other \nemergencies are quickly addressed. While we generally require that new \nspending be offset to ensure the deficit is not increased, we allow \nthis requirement to be waived if the moneys are being spent on an \nemergency item. In addition, we waive our annual budgetary spending \ncaps if the moneys are being spent to address an emergency or disaster.\n  Because of their expedited treatment and budgetary exceptions, \nemergency spending bills have become a magnet for nonemergency items. \nRather than subject a proposal to the regular budget and appropriations \nprocess, provisions are often attached to emergency spending bills that \nare moving through Congress on a virtual fast track.\n  Although nonemergency items in an emergency spending bill are still \nsubject to the annual spending caps, no offset is required if such \nspending would be below the annual limit. Furthermore, even if a \nnonemergency item is offset in an emergency spending bill, the \nexpedited consideration of that legislation often does not allow for a \nthorough analysis in the broader context of the budget. Rather than \nsubjecting the nonemergency spending provision to the same scrutiny as \nother programs in the budget and weighing its merits accordingly, \nCongress is forced to make a rapid decision. Delaying the process and \ncarefully weighing these nonemergency items would also mean risking the \ntimely delivery of assistance to those who have been affected by an \nemergency or disaster. Such a delay is simply not acceptable.\n  Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today would eliminate this \nproblem and this practice by ensuring that all nonemergency spending \nitems are subject to the same budget scrutiny and same budgetary rules. \nIf my legislation is adopted, emergency spending bills would no longer \nbe a convenient vehicle for spending money on nonemergency items. \nRather, emergency spending bills would be just that: emergency spending \nbills--not Christmas trees with other goodies and presents tucked \nbeneath them.\n  Under my bill, nonemergency provisions in an emergency or disaster \nspending bill would be subject to a new three-fifths majority point of \norder. If a nonemergency item is included in an emergency spending bill \nor related conference report--or is contained in an amendment that is \nbeing offered to such a bill--this new point of order could be raised \nby any Member, and a three-fifths majority vote would be required to \nwaive it.\n  I believe the Members of this body are familiar with the Byrd rule \nand its impact on the reconciliation process, and my new provision \nwould be administered in much the same way. The only difference would \nbe that while the Byrd rule applies to budget reconciliation bills, \nthis rule would apply to emergency spending bills.\n  Mr. President, we must no longer allow nonemergency items to be \nattached to emergency spending bills. We have created an expedited \nprocess for considering emergency spending bills for very sound \nreasons--but providing a vehicle for nonemergency items to be rushed \nthrough Congress was not one of them.\n  As we work toward a balanced budget in the year 2002, I would urge \nthat Congress and the President carefully weigh the merits of every \nspending program and make priorities accordingly. My legislation would \nhelp us achieve this objective by ensuring that nonemergency items are \nnot rushed through Congress while riding on the back of emergency \nspending bills. I urge that my colleagues join me in this effort and \nsupport this legislation.\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 474\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kyl, the name of the Senator from Nevada [Mr. \nReid] was added as a cosponsor of S. 474, a bill to amend sections 1081 \nand 1084 of title 18, United States Code.\n\n\n                                 S. 617\n\n  At the request of Mr. Johnson, the names of the Senator from Idaho \n[Mr. Kempthorne], the Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad], and the \nSenator from Colorado [Mr. Campbell] were added as cosponsors of S. \n617, a bill to amend the Federal Meat Inspection Act to require that \nimported meat, and meat food products containing imported meat, bear a \nlabel identifying the country of origin.\n\n\n                                 S. 766\n\n  At the request of Ms. Snowe, the name of the Senator from New York \n[Mr. Moynihan] was added as a cosponsor of S. 766, a bill to require \nequitable coverage of prescription contraceptive drugs and devices, and \ncontraceptive services under health plans.\n\n\n                                 S. 834\n\n  At the request of Mr. Harkin, the name of the Senator from California \n[Mrs. Boxer] was added as a cosponsor of S. 834, a bill to amend the \nPublic Health Service Act to ensure adequate research and education \nregarding the drug DES.\n\n\n                                 S. 852\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lott, the names of the Senator from New Mexico \n[Mr. Bingaman] and the Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords] were added \nas cosponsors of S. 852, a bill to establish nationally uniform \nrequirements regarding the titling and registration of salvage, \nnonrepairable, and rebuilt vehicles.\n\n\n                                S. 1141\n\n  At the request of Mr. Johnson, the name of the Senator from Missouri \n[Mr. Ashcroft] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1141, a bill to amend the \nEnergy Policy Act of 1992 to take into account newly developed \nrenewable energy-based fuels and to equalize alternative fuel vehicle \nacquisition incentives to increase the flexibility of controlled fleet \nowners and operators, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1173\n\n  At the request of Mr. Warner, the name of the Senator from Colorado \n[Mr. Campbell] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1173, a bill to authorize \nfunds for construction of highways, for highway safety programs, and \nfor mass transit programs, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1178\n\n  At the request of Mr. Akaka, his name was added as a cosponsor of S. \n1178, a bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to extend the \nvisa waiver pilot program, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                         Senate Resolution 116\n\n  At the request of Mr. Levin, the names of the Senator from Hawaii \n[Mr. Inouye] and the Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar] were added as \ncosponsors of Senate Resolution 116, a resolution designating November \n15, 1997, and November 15, 1998, as ``America Recycles Day.''\n\n\n                         Senate Resolution 121\n\n  At the request of Mr. Specter, the names of the Senator from Arkansas \n[Mr. Hutchinson], the Senator from Missouri [Mr. Ashcroft], the Senator \nfrom Alabama [Mr. Shelby], the Senator from New York [Mr. D'Amato], the \nSenator from Ohio [Mr. DeWine], the Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe], \nand the Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Ford] were added as cosponsors of \nSenate Resolution 121, a resolution urging the discontinuance of \nfinancial assistance to the Palestinian Authority unles and until the \nPalestinian Authority demonstrates a 100-percent maximum effort to \ncurtail terrorism.\n\n[[Page S9428]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/16/senate-section/article/S9411-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9411-S9428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. D'AMATO (for himself and Mr. Sarbanes) (by request):\n  S. 1179. A bill to amend the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to \nreauthorize the National Flood Insurance Program; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n        THE NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the National \nFlood Insurance Reauthorization Act of 1997 (NFIRA). This legislation \nprovides for a simple and straightforward 5-year extension of the \nNational Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) which is scheduled to expire on \nSeptember 30, 1997. This legislation will ensure that this important \nprogram is placed on a steady and secure foundation to continue the \ninvaluable protection it provides to flood insurance policyholders and \nthe Federal taxpayers. I am pleased that my colleague, Senator \nSarbanes, the distinguished ranking member of the Banking Committee, \nhas cosponsored this measure.\n  The National Flood Insurance Program, which is administered by the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA], enables over 3.5 million \nAmerican families to insure their homes and possessions. In my home \nState of New York, 85,000 families participate in the NFIP. The NFIP \nallows these families, on Long Island and along the Great Lakes and the \nState's many rivers, to purchase adequate insurance coverage to protect \ntheir homes in the event of a catastrophic flood.\n  The NFIP employs a comprehensive approach to alleviating the risks \nposed by catastrophic floods. Floodplain communities participate in \nFEMA's Community Rating System and are offered incentives to adopt and \nenforce measures to reduce the risk of flood damage and improve flood \nprevention building criteria. To avoid the danger of repetitive losses, \nthe program provides stringent building standards, including increased \nelevation, designed to reduce the risk of future damage. These flood \nprotection standards must be met before any structure which suffers \nsubstantial damage may be rebuilt. In addition, persons who receive \ndisaster assistance and fail to subsequently purchase flood insurance \nare barred from receiving future assistance.\n  Mr. President, the NFIP plays a critical role in reducing the costs \nof Federal disaster relief. Current NFIP policyholders pay \napproximately $1.3 billion annually into the NFIP fund. Without this \npremium income, the Federal Government would likely pay spiraling costs \nin disaster relief. The NFIP has the added benefits of improving State \nand community planning and Federal support for locally driven disaster \nprevention and mitigation activities.\n  Reauthorizing the NFIP is an important step forward in reaffirming \nthe commitment of the Federal Government to help American families \nprotect their homes and to protect the Federal taxpayer from the risks \nof catastrophic floods. Clearly, we must do more. Lenders and private \ninsurers who participate in the NFIP must do more to ensure compliance. \nStates and local communities must improve their disaster planning, \nprevention, and response activities. FEMA must redouble its efforts to \nincrease participation in the program to improve the safety and \nsoundness of the NFIP fund. Also, the Federal Government must do more \nto prevent and mitigate against the losses which will inevitably occur \nfrom future floods.\n  Mr. President, I note that this bill is supported by the \nadministration. I urge my colleagues to support the adoption of this \nlegislation and I look forward to working with the members of the \nBanking Committee to ensure a swift and speedy passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KEMPTHORNE (for himself, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. \n        Reid):\n  S. 1180. A bill to reauthorize the Endangered Species Act; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n              THE ENDANGERED SPECIES RECOVERY ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, 2 years ago, in Lewiston, ID, as \nchairman of the Drinking Water Fisheries and Wildlife Subcommittee, I \nheld a hearing to review the current Endangered Species Act and to \nidentify ways to improve the act. It was clear from the testimony we \nheard that the current law simply is not working. It isn't working for \nspecies and it isn't working for people. That message was loud and \nclear. Senator Chafee was there with us at that meeting.\n  We must do a better job of protecting species without jeopardizing \nour communities. The legislation that I am introducing today with \nSenator Chafee, Senator Baucus, and Senator Reid will do just that. It \nwill bring real and fundamental reform to the Endangered Species Act, \nand it will minimize the social and economic impact of the ESA on the \nlives of ordinary citizens, and it will benefit species. That is the \ncritical point.\n  I want to thank Senators Chafee, Baucus, and Reid, who have worked \ndiligently with me as we have crafted this legislation, which brings \nabout balance and a bipartisan approach to a very sensitive issue.\n  There are over 1,000 species on the endangered species list today but \nfewer than half of them have ever had a recovery plan written for them. \nThe best evidence that the current law isn't working may be the fact \nthat not a single species has recovered as a result of a recovery plan. \nIt is as if you have a recovery room filled with patients and one by \none these patients are brought in, given an examination by the doctor, \nand at the conclusion of the examination the doctor says, ``Yes, you \nare critical. Next.'' ``What do you mean, next, doctor? What is the \nprescription? What is the recovery for this critical condition?\"\n  The emphasis has not been on recovery. It has been on continuing to \nlist, list, list, without the emphasis on recovery.\n\n[[Page S9412]]\n\n  But the law must also have balance. It must recognize the rights of \npeople, too.\n  During our hearings, we heard many compelling stories from people who \nhave had to live with the real life impact of the Endangered Species \nAct. We heard from families in Owyhee County, ID, who cannot get bank \nloans for their homes because the listing of a tiny snail--the Bruneau \nHot Springs snail--has caused their property value to plummet.\n  We heard from a woman in Laramie, WY, who told us that the mosquito \ncontrol program in their community had been suspended because of the \nESA, causing severe health risks for the citizens of Laramie, including \nher son who contracted encephalitis from a mosquito.\n  We heard from a rancher in Joseph, OR, who described how Federal \nregulators, under the threat of lawsuit from environmentalists, tried \nto stop all grazing on forest lands up in the mountains because salmon \nwere spawning in streams that ran through the private land below, but \nin his words, ``The cows were up in the high country as far from the \nspawning habitat as you could get.''\n  And we heard from mill workers who lost their jobs when the ESA all \nbut shut down logging in certain national forests. I think that Ray \nBrady from Grangeville, ID, may have captured best the underlying \nfeeling of frustration and anxieties:\n       We had a choice of moving, of going someplace else. Why \n     should we? I chose to live in a small community like \n     Grangeville. I chose to work there. I worked there for 28 \n     years and somebody else in a different part of the country \n     makes a decision that has cost me my job and occupation and \n     28 years worth of experience. Now I am having to start all \n     over again. I don't have any income. I don't have any \n     insurance for my family or myself; and I attribute it \n     directly to this Endangered Species Act. Somebody has to do \n     something about it. I mean, not in the future, I mean now.\n\n  Ray Brady is right. We need to improve the way that the ESA works, \nand we need to do it right now. We need an ESA that will make advocates \nout of adversaries. As it's administered today, it separates people \nfrom their environment. It invites Federal regulators to become land \nuse managers over some of the best stewards of our environment--our \nfarmers and our ranchers and our landowners. And we need their help if \nwe are truly going to save species. Just remember, well over half of \nour endangered species depend on private property.\n  The ESA must provide more incentives to encourage property owners to \nbecome partners in the conservation of a rare and unique species.\n  The bill we are introducing today will achieve those goals. It will \nmake the law work better. It will reduce unnecessary bureaucracy; it \nwill enhance the recovery of species; and it will treat property owners \nfairly.\n\n  Let me highlight just a few of the significant improvements that we \nhave included in this legislation.\n  The bill will put new emphasis on the need to use good science in \neverything from the listing process through recovery. The Secretary \nwill be required to use the best available science in all of his \ndecisions and to give greater preference to information that is \nempirical and peer reviewed. In addition, all listing and delisting \ndecisions will be subject to independent peer review. That means that \nwe can all have greater confidence in the decisions made under the ESA.\n  The bill will add teeth to the recovery planning process so that \nwe're no longer just running an endangered species emergency room \nwithout also providing the prescription for recovery. For the first \ntime, we will set deadlines for the development of recovery plans for \nevery listed species. Each recovery plan will be developed by a \nrecovery team that includes scientists, economists, and representatives \nof the communities that are affected by the listing of the species. And \nwe establish new substantive requirements for each recovery plan, \nincluding recovery measures, benchmarks to measure progress, and a \nbiological recovery goal that will trigger delisting when it is met. \nWe'll know that the law is working well when species are no longer just \nbeing listed, but when they're also being delisted as a result of a \nsuccessful recovery plan.\n  The bill recognizes that we can reduce bureaucracy and unnecessary \nFederal interference with land management decisions without harming \nspecies. In the consultation process, for example, the fact is that \npeople spend too much time trying to comply with too many regulations \nfrom too many Federal agencies. That cannot only significantly increase \nthe cost of a project, in some cases, it can be deadly.\n  In 1996, in Yuba County, CA, for example, the Corps of Engineers was \nprevented from repairing levees south of the city of Marysville because \nof the impact that the repairs might have on the hibernating garter \nsnake. The work wasn't done and on January 2, a levee failed in \nOlivehurst, CA, killing three people and flooding 500 homes.\n  Under our bill, the Federal action agency, in that case the Corps of \nEngineers, will have the authority to make the initial determination \nthat its repairs would not be likely to adversely affect the species. \nThe levee repair could then proceed, unless the Fish and Wildlife \nService objected to the initial determination within 60 days. This \nsimple procedural fix will allow projects to be completed on time \nwithout jeopardizing endangered species.\n  Perhaps most important, the bill includes a number of incentives for \nproperty owners so that they can become partners in saving species.\n  The key is maximum flexibility and our bill provides that. For \nexample, if you're an individual who wants to clear a few acres of land \nto build your vacation home in red cockaded woodpecker territory, our \nnew low effect conservation plan may be just what you need. On the \nother hand, a county planning its development needs for the next 50 \nyears might choose to enter into a multiple species conservation plan \nto preserve habitat for all of its rare and unique species. State and \nlocal governments can even enter into conservation plans to protect \nunlisted species.\n  All of the conservation plans are backed by a no-surprises provision \nthat gives landowners certainty that their obligations will be defined \nby the plan. They won't be required to pay additional money for \nconservation measures or to further restrict their activities on the \nland covered by the plan.\n  In addition to conservation plans, the bill offers landowners the \noption of entering into separate agreements to manage land for the \nbenefit of species. A small timber company whose lands are suitable \nhabitat for spotted owls might enter into a safe harbor agreement to \nlet the trees grow to attract the owls with the understanding that at \nthe end of some agreed-upon period of time, it can harvest the trees. \nAnd a farmer might agree to set aside buffer strips for a species in \nreturn for compensation under a habitat reserve agreement.\n  Finally, the bill limits the ability of the Federal Government and \nenvironmental groups to restrict otherwise legal activities on private \nlands. Under the law today, the Government and environmental groups \nhave used the take prohibition to try to prohibit logging and \ndevelopment on private lands and a city's pumping of an aquifer for \ndrinking water, even where there was no scientific evidence that the \nactivity would in fact harm an endangered species. Our bill will change \nthat, reaffirming that the Federal Government, or an environmental \ngroup, has the burden of demonstrating that an activity will actually \nharm a species and they must meet that burden using real science, not \njust assumptions or speculation.\n  When we started this process just over 2 years ago, we asked \nourselves the question: Should we make a concerted effort to save \nspecies? The answer was yes.\n  But could we do it without putting people and communities at risk?\n  Today, I think that we've demonstrated that we can. We can save \nspecies with less bureaucracy, using good science, incentives, and \nwhere necessary, public financial resources.\n  Charles Mann and Christopher Plummer wrote in their book ``Noah's \nChoice,'' ``If we truly want to improve the lot of endangered species, \nwe should stop shooting for the stars, because the arrows will fall \nback to our feet. By aiming a little closer, we might shoot farther in \nthe desired direction.''\n  And I will add, and hit the target more often. This bill hits the \ntarget.\n  I would like to use my prerogative to just thank my staff for their \nefforts on this--Buzz Fawcett, Ann Klee, Jim\n\n[[Page S9413]]\n\nTate, and other members of my staff. I know the other Senators feel as \nI do about my staff, that they do a tremendous job. As we stand here \nwith results of 18 months of hard effort, we know of the many hours \nthey have contributed as well in making this a success.\n  Mr. President, we now have a bill that is bipartisan. We have a bill \nthat is scheduled for a hearing 1 week from today and for markup in \ncommittee where amendments will be considered 2 weeks from today. It is \nour full expectation that we will be able to bring this bill to the \nfloor of the Senate for debate and for a vote sometime near the middle \nof October. It has been many months, if not years, in the making, to \ncreate this legislation which improves the Endangered Species Act, so \nthat we can, again, save species and do it without putting people and \ncommunities at risk.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1180\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Conservation measures and exceptions.''.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am proud to sponsor, along with Senators \nKempthorne, Baucus, and Reid, the Endangered Species Recovery Act of \n1997, which reauthorizes the Endangered Species Act, and makes some \nsignificant improvements to the act which are long overdue. The \nEndangered Species Act was enacted into law in 1973 to conserve \nthreatened and endangered species, and the ecosystems upon which they \ndepend. The ESA is our most important law to protect our Nation's \nnatural resources and biological diversity, and has often been referred \nto as the ``crown jewel'' of environmental laws.\n  The ESA has been instrumental in saving some of our country's most \ntreasured species. The bald eagle and the grizzly bear have both \nrebounded from precariously small populations, and the Pacific grey \nwhale and American alligator have both recovered and have been \ndelisted. All told, almost half of the species that fall under the \nact's protection are either stabilized or improving.\n  One can understand better the vital need for the ESA when one \nrealizes what we are up against: of somewhere between 10 and 100 \nmillion species on this planet, we have discovered only some 1.4 \nmillion. Despite this bounty, loss of biological diversity is taking \nplace at a faster rate than ever before. In 1973, Congress offered this \npoignant observation: ``as we homogenize the habitats in which these \nplants and animals evolved . . . we threaten their--and our own--\ngenetic heritage. The value of this genetic heritage, is quite \nliterally, incalculable.'' It was principally for this reason that \nCongress passed the ESA in 1973.\n  Controversy has surrounded the law, however, since its passage. In \nthe mid-1970's, the law became ensnarled in a bitter fight over the \nconstruction of the $900 million Tellico Dam and the dam's impacts on \nthe hapless snail darter. The criticism has grown significantly since \n1992, when the most recent authorization of the ESA expired.\n  Since then, funding for implementing the law has been provided \nthrough annual appropriations, which has left the future of the law on \nuncertain terms, and left the current working of the law subject to \nnumerous appropriations riders, including a moratorium on the listing \nof species, that resulted in more than a year delay in affording \nprotection to hundreds of species endangered with extinction.\n  The bill we introduce today includes many reforms. The last major \namendment to the ESA was in 1988, almost 10 years ago. Since then, we \nhave developed a greater knowledge of the science of biodiversity, a \ngreater understanding of the problems in implementing the law on \nprivate lands, and in this era of shrinking government, a greater need \nfor improved coordination among all levels of government. Our bill \ntakes all this into account by focusing on several key areas: \nemphasizing recovery as the ultimate goal; seeking to prevent further \nlistings; improving the scientific foundation for decisions; increasing \npublic participation and the role of States; facilitating compliance \nby, and providing incentives for, private landowners; and streamlining \ncoordination among government agencies. In making these changes, our \nbill addresses the criticisms leveled against the ESA in recent years.\n\n[[Page S9422]]\n\n  These criticisms have come from all directions. The environmental \ncommunity believes that the law has failed in its fundamental mission \nto recover species to full health, but rather leaves species teetering \non the razor's edge of survival. Statistics bear this out: of the \napproximately 1,000 species currently listed, 41 percent are either \nimproving in status or stabilized, but only 8 percent are actually \nimproving. Furthermore, less than half of the listed species have \napproved recovery plans.\n  Private landowners, on the other hand, believe that the ESA is \nfundamentally flawed in its implementation, with inflexible \nregulations, heavy-handed enforcement, closed-door science, and no \nconsideration of economic costs. This, too, is largely borne out by the \nfacts: the ESA has very few tools, other than enforcement of certain \nprohibitions against taking listed species, with which to protect \nspecies on private lands. This weakness in the law is heightened by the \nfact that more than one-third of all listed species reside entirely on \nprivate lands. Furthermore, species on private lands are faring worse \nthan on public lands.\n  If the ESA is to succeed in its ultimate goal of recovering species, \nthese problems must be addressed. Our bill does just that. Most \nimportantly, it completely overhauls the recovery planning and \nimplementation requirements of the ESA. Previously, recovery plans were \nrequired to be prepared, but with no deadline for doing so. Once \nprepared, they generally sat on the shelves with no requirement or \nincentive to implement them. Furthermore, the scientific findings in \nthe plans were often compromised by political and economic \nconsiderations, nor was there any requirement to actually take cost of \nimplementation into account.\n  This bill requires that recovery plans be completed within a specific \ndeadline. The recovery goal must be developed by scientists, using only \nthe best science available. While economic costs and social impacts \nmust be taken into account, they are considered only in choosing the \nbest method to achieve the biologically based recovery goals. \nSpecifically, measure to achieve the recovery goal must strike an \n``appropriate balance'' among three factors: The effectiveness in \nmeeting the goal; the period of time needed to reach the goal; and the \nsocial and economic impacts.\n  For the first time, the bill provides a requirement that Federal \nagencies enter into recovery implementation agreements, and also \nprovides incentives for private persons to enter into similar \nagreements. These incentives include a waiver of consultation normally \nrequired under section 7 for actions that are described in sufficient \ndetail. They also include a requirement that Federal agencies \nparticipate in the development of an agreement upon the request of a \nprivate person, so that the person will know up-front all relevant \nrequirements in undertaking conservation actions.\n  The bill also improves significantly the law's ability to work on \nprivate lands. Under the current law, the permit process has generally \nbeen inflexible, cumbersome, and consequently rarely used. The Clinton \nadministration recently instituted a number of policies to encourage \nlandowners to apply for permits in order to conduct economic activities \nthat take listed species on their lands. As a result, the number of \npermits issued by the administration has increased from 14 in 1992 to \nmore than 200 in 1997, with an additional 250 being developed. Our bill \nvalidates and expands those policies.\n\n  The bill authorizes permits for multiple species, including both \nlisted and nonlisted species, that depend on the same habitat. New \nbiological standards for nonlisted species ensure that permitted \nactivities do not contribute to the need to list those species in the \nfuture. In order to address the needs of small landowners, a more \nstreamlined, less expensive permit process is established for low \neffect activities. Under this process,the permit can take effect \nautomatically within a certain period, provided that there are no \nsignificant adverse comments.\n  In addition, the bill authorizes several policies and incentives to \nfurther encourage landowners to work with the Federal Government. These \npolicies include a no-surprises guarantee that the Government will not \nseek additional mitigation over time; a safe harbor policy to encourage \nlandowners to protect lands valuable to species without risking \nadditional liability; and a candidate conservation policy, which \nencourages landowners to undertake protections for species before they \nbecome endangered or threatened. The bill also establishes several new \nfunding mechanisms for incentive-based programs, including a habitat \nreserve program, and a habitat conservation planning fund, which acts \nas a revolving loan fund. A program to provide technical assistance to \nlandowners is also created.\n  The bill also makes important changes to the consultation process \namong Federal agencies. It encourages consultations to be consolidated \nif they involve related actions by one agency, or they involve several \nagencies affecting the same species. The consultation process is \nstreamlined by allowing the Federal agency undertaking an action to \nmake the initial determination whether its action affects listed \nspecies, and providing an opportunity for the Fish and Wildlife \nService, or, for marine species, the National Marine Fisheries Service, \nto comment on this determination. The Service has 60 days to object, \nand require a more detailed analysis that it would prepare. This \nprocess is similar to the current practice that is used by the \nagencies.\n  The bill also addresses the relationship between site-specific and \nprogrammatic Federal land management actions. Several recent lawsuits \nenjoined numerous site-specific actions pending completion of the \nconsultation on the overarching programmatic action. The bill \nexplicitly recognizes that consultation is appropriate and required at \nboth levels of decisionmaking, but ensures an orderly process for \ncompleting those consultations. In addition, the bill affords greater \nparticipation in the consultation process for any person who has sought \nauthorization or funding from a Federal agency.\n  The bill goes a long way in improving the scientific basis on which \ndecisions are made. The greatest lack of knowledge is in the status and \ndistribution of rare and declining species. This bill requires an \ninventory of species on Federal lands to fill this critical data gap. \nListing decisions must be peer-reviewed, and petitions to list are \nsubject to certain minimum information requirements. Enforcement \nactions must use scientifically valid principles to establish whether \nthe action caused an unlawful taking of a species. In evaluating \ncomparable data, the Secretary would be required to use peer reviewed, \nfield tested or empirical data.\n\n  As you can see, Mr. President, this bill not only reauthorizes the \nESA, but it also significantly improves the ESA, in order to embrace \nneeded reforms in the law. Numerous attempts to reauthorize the ESA \nhave been made in recent years. The long and arduous effort culminating \nin today's bill began more than 18 months ago, as a bipartisan process \nto address the problems with the current law. When discussions stalled, \nSenator Kempthorne and I spurred the process forward by releasing a \ndiscussion draft, which generated hundreds of comments. Since then, we \nhave negotiated with Senators Baucus and Reid, and the Clinton \nadministration, to reach agreement on a bipartisan bill.\n  Just as the original ESA was passed by a Democratic Congress and \nsigned into law by a Republican President, this bill to reauthorize the \nESA is also a bipartisan product between a Republican Senate and a \nDemocratic administration. To quote one of the foremost \nconservationists of our country, President Teddy Roosevelt, the \nconservation of natural resources is a question ``upon which men of all \nparties and all shades of opinion may be united for the common good.'' \nThe need for a healthy environment, one large enough for all species \nthat inhabit this planet with us, is a need that transcends politics, \nand I firmly believe that the bill we introduce today fulfills that \nneed, as embodied in the original passage of the ESA.\n  I would like to thank my distinguished colleagues, Senators \nKempthorne, Baucus, and Reid, for their tireless work over the months \non this important legislation, and I would like to thank the Secretary \nof the Interior, Bruce Babbitt, as well as his very accomplished staff, \nled by Jaimie Clark, Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, and Don \nBarry, Acting Assistant Secretary for Fish, Wildlife and\n\n[[Page S9423]]\n\nParks, for their willingness to work with us in negotiating a bill that \nthey can support.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today, it is a real pleasure for me to \njoin my colleagues on the Senate Environment and Public Works, Senators \nChafee, Reid, and Kempthorne in introducing the Endangered Species \nRecovery Act of 1997. The bill we are introducing today represents a \nreal victory for bi-partisan, commonsense improvements to the \nEndangered Species Act.\n  The Endangered Species Act has been an important tool in our fight to \nconserve ecosystems and to prevent the extinction of species. But over \nthe years, experience has shown that the act can be improved, both for \nthe species it is designed to protect and for ranchers, farmers, and \nother private landowners.\n  Senators Chafee, Reid, Kempthorne, and I have been working, along \nwith the administration, for the better part of 2 years to find \nagreement on changes that will improve the ESA on the ground, where it \nreally counts.\n  The bill we are introducing today incorporates several major \nimprovements to ESA. Let me just reiterate a few that I think are \nparticularly noteworthy.\n  First, it improves the use of good science in our decisions on \nlisting species. It's important that we elevate the role of scientific \ninformation in our decisions on whether to put species on the \nendangered list. An error at this stage in the process can mean \nextinction for a species.\n  Second, the bill really turns the focus of the ESA to conserving and \nrecovering species. It puts real deadlines on development of recovery \nplans and gives States a greater role in developing those plans. And it \ninsists that we have benchmarks for measuring progress toward \nrecovering the species.\n  Third, the bill opens up the process to the public. More public \nhearings will be held on critical issues, such as whether to list a \nspecies and what actions should be taken to recover the species. And, \nmost important, these hearings can't be just in Washington. They must \nalso be in the States most affected by the issue.\n  Fourth, the bill takes important strides in cooperating with \nlandowners to conserve species. It encourages landowners to take \nvoluntary steps to improve habitat and protect species on their \nproperty. And it seeks to conserve species before they become \nendangered, thereby avoiding the need to list them.\n  The bill also provides landowners with something they have never had \nbefore, technical assistance and financial aid for the new conservation \nagreements that are created by the bill.\n  These are the kind of improvements that will make the ESA work \nbetter. That will better protect species and that will help landowners.\n  It's been a long, hard road to reach this agreement. And I want to \nagain thank Senator Chafee, Senator Reid, Senator Kempthorne and \nSecretary Babbitt for their persistence throughout this process.\n  I look forward to taking this bill to the committee and to the Senate \nfloor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KEMPTHORNE:\n  S. 1181. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nFederal tax incentives to owners of environmentally sensitive lands to \nenter into conservation easements for the protection of endangered \nspecies habitat, to allow a deduction from the gross estate of a \ndecedent in an amount equal to the value of real property subject to an \nendangered species conservation agreement, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n         the endangered species habitat protection act of 1997\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today \nwhich is intended to provide private property owners additional tools \nin their dealings with the Endangered Species Act. For both those who \nwish to participate in the conservation of land for the preservation of \nendangered, threatened, and other species and those whose participation \nis involuntary, this legislation will add to the already substantial \nmeans provided to property owners in the Endangered Species Recovery \nAct of 1997.\n  For too long the Federal Government has used its enforcement \nprocedures and it regulatory authority to dictate conservation in aid \nof endangered and threatened species. This method has failed to produce \nthe kind of results we want. The Endangered Species Act as currently \nwritten is almost all stick and no carrot. I would like to begin to \nchange that today.\n  For 18 months I have negotiated a bill to reauthorize the Endangered \nSpecies Act with the Democrats and the administration. Those \nnegotiations have been successfully completed. We have introduced a \nbill that will provide a variety of incentives to property owners to \npreserve habitat through conservation agreements and plans, prelisting \nagreements and other preservation tools. I also have a number of ideas \non how to provide tax incentives to private property owners to preserve \nhabitat.\n  Let me emphasize that inclusion of these new tax incentives will \ntruly benefit both species and people. I have met with many property \nowners who have said, ``we would be happy to step forward and preserve \nhabitat for species and we would grant a conservation easement if there \nwas an incentive.'' Well with adoption of the ideas included in this \nbill there will be.\n  I have had critics that have said that we should not provide these \nkinds of incentives to private property owners because we will have too \nmany people coming forward and saying, ``I have an endangered species \non my land.'' What is wrong with that? To my mind, that would be a \nwelcome reversal from the current prevailing attitude that some have \nabout the presence of an endangered species on their property. Right \nnow you have a situation that some land owners believe that if they do \nhave an endangered species, or if it's suggested that they might, \nthey're just as likely to try to remove the habitat to avoid a problem \ndown the road. We need to change that attitude if we're going to \nrecover endangered species.\n  We are currently at the crossroads of two systems. One where you have \nGovernment overregulation that tells people what they can and cannot do \non their land, and the other a system that encourages property owners \nto step forward and do something good for species because it's good for \nthem too.\n  We can depend on our property owners to do what's right and what is \ngood for species. I know that our farmers and ranchers know how to be \ninnovative and creative. They know how to help species. And they know \nhow to manage land.\n  The right system is one where we encourage active involvement of \nlandowners through incentives. Certainly, I know that if I were an \nendangered species, I would much rather have a friendly and willing \nlandlord--one that viewed me as an asset--than a reluctant one who \nviewed me as a threat and a liability because of some bureaucrats and \nregulations handed down from Washington, DC.\n  That is what this legislation will do. It is going to make the people \nactive partners.\n  The legislation I am introducing also includes a provision designed \nto safeguard the property rights of individuals. The Endangered Species \nRecovery Act of 1997 will do much to improve and enhance the rights of \nproperty owners. The bill limits the ability of the Federal Government \nand environmental groups to restrict otherwise legal activities on \nprivate lands. Under the law today, the Government and environmental \ngroups have used the take prohibition to try to prohibit logging and \ndevelopment on private lands and a city's pumping of an aquifer for \ndrinking water, even where there was no scientific evidence that the \nactivity would in fact harm an endangered species. Our bill will change \nthat, reaffirming that the Federal Government, or an environmental \ngroup, has the burden of demonstrating that an activity will actually \nharm a species and they must meet that burden using real science, not \njust assumptions or speculation.\n  ESRA '97 will protect the rights of property owners by making them a \npart of the process--a process that has excluded them for years. Now \ncitizens, business people and State and local government \nrepresentatives will be at the table for the development of recovery \nplans. Furthermore, the recovery plans developed will analyze the cost \non the public and private sectors and the impact on jobs and property \nvalues for any recovery plan selected.\n\n[[Page S9424]]\n\n  Under ERSA '97 we will substantially reduce the number of \nconsultations under section 7 of the act. But if a consultation is \nnecessary under the act, property owners will have both a seat at the \ntable and the information they need to meaningfully participate in the \nconsultation.\n  Throughout ERSA '97 we have kept our bond with the property owners of \nIdaho and America. But there is always more that should be done.\n  The Endangered Species Habitat Protection Act contains strong \nproperty rights language. That language was developed in conjunction \nwith some of the best minds in the property rights movement. Private \nproperty rights is a cornerstone of our democracy. As such it is \nincumbent on this Congress to address the issue in this Congress. The \nEndangered Species Habitat Protection Act contains my contribution to \nthe effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1181\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Senate finds and declares the following:\n       (1) The majority of American property owners recognize the \n     importance of protecting the environment, including the \n     habitats upon which endangered and threatened species depend.\n       (2) Current Federal tax laws discourage placement of \n     privately held lands into endangered and threatened species \n     conservation agreements.\n       (3) The Federal Government should assist landowners in the \n     goal of conserving endangered and threatened species and \n     their habitat.\n       (4) If the environment is to be protected and preserved, \n     existing Federal tax laws must be modified or changed to \n     provide tax incentives to landowners to attain the goal of \n     conservation of endangered and threatened species and the \n     habitats on which they depend.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Congressional Budget and Impoundment \nControl Act of 1974 to limit consideration of nonemergency matters in \nemergency legislation and permit matter that is extraneous to \nemergencies to be stricken as provided in the Byrd rule; to the \nCommittee on the Budget and the Committee on Governmental Affairs, \njointly, pursuant to the order of of August 4, 1977, as modified by the \norder of April 11, 1986, with instructions that if one committee \nreports, the other committee have 30 days to report or be discharged.\n\n\n                   THE EMERGENCY SPENDING CONTROL ACT\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwill end a common abuse of the budget process in the Congress: the \nattachment of nonemergency provisions to emergency spending bills. \nSenator Abraham and Senator Gramm are also original sponsors of this \nlegislation.\n  At a time when Congress and the President have come together and \nagreed on a plan to balance the budget by the year 2002, I believe it \nis appropriate that we now seek to ensure that\n\n[[Page S9427]]\n\nall future spending decisions be fully weighed and considered before \nthe tax dollars of hard-working Americans are spent. We must ensure \nthat the costs and benefits of a proposal are thoroughly reviewed \nthrough our carefully structured budget process--not allowed to be \npushed through the Congress with minimal debate and consideration. The \nlegislation I am introducing today would address one of the ways in \nwhich spending programs are pushed through Congress with minimal budget \nscrutiny: the attachment of nonemergency provisions to emergency \nspending bills.\n  Mr. President, as my colleagues know, emergency spending bills have \nbeen afforded special treatment because of the unique problems they \naddress. While the annual budget and appropriations process typically \ntakes months to complete, emergency spending legislation often receives \nspecial, accelerated consideration that can lead to its adoption in \ndays or weeks. This expedited treatment is understandable: When a \nflood, earthquake, or other natural disaster imperils the lives and \nsafety of the American people, Congress and the President should be \nready and able to respond quickly.\n  We have even made special exceptions for emergency spending bills \nwithin our budgetary rules to ensure that disasters and other \nemergencies are quickly addressed. While we generally require that new \nspending be offset to ensure the deficit is not increased, we allow \nthis requirement to be waived if the moneys are being spent on an \nemergency item. In addition, we waive our annual budgetary spending \ncaps if the moneys are being spent to address an emergency or disaster.\n  Because of their expedited treatment and budgetary exceptions, \nemergency spending bills have become a magnet for nonemergency items. \nRather than subject a proposal to the regular budget and appropriations \nprocess, provisions are often attached to emergency spending bills that \nare moving through Congress on a virtual fast track.\n  Although nonemergency items in an emergency spending bill are still \nsubject to the annual spending caps, no offset is required if such \nspending would be below the annual limit. Furthermore, even if a \nnonemergency item is offset in an emergency spending bill, the \nexpedited consideration of that legislation often does not allow for a \nthorough analysis in the broader context of the budget. Rather than \nsubjecting the nonemergency spending provision to the same scrutiny as \nother programs in the budget and weighing its merits accordingly, \nCongress is forced to make a rapid decision. Delaying the process and \ncarefully weighing these nonemergency items would also mean risking the \ntimely delivery of assistance to those who have been affected by an \nemergency or disaster. Such a delay is simply not acceptable.\n  Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today would eliminate this \nproblem and this practice by ensuring that all nonemergency spending \nitems are subject to the same budget scrutiny and same budgetary rules. \nIf my legislation is adopted, emergency spending bills would no longer \nbe a convenient vehicle for spending money on nonemergency items. \nRather, emergency spending bills would be just that: emergency spending \nbills--not Christmas trees with other goodies and presents tucked \nbeneath them.\n  Under my bill, nonemergency provisions in an emergency or disaster \nspending bill would be subject to a new three-fifths majority point of \norder. If a nonemergency item is included in an emergency spending bill \nor related conference report--or is contained in an amendment that is \nbeing offered to such a bill--this new point of order could be raised \nby any Member, and a three-fifths majority vote would be required to \nwaive it.\n  I believe the Members of this body are familiar with the Byrd rule \nand its impact on the reconciliation process, and my new provision \nwould be administered in much the same way. The only difference would \nbe that while the Byrd rule applies to budget reconciliation bills, \nthis rule would apply to emergency spending bills.\n  Mr. President, we must no longer allow nonemergency items to be \nattached to emergency spending bills. We have created an expedited \nprocess for considering emergency spending bills for very sound \nreasons--but providing a vehicle for nonemergency items to be rushed \nthrough Congress was not one of them.\n  As we work toward a balanced budget in the year 2002, I would urge \nthat Congress and the President carefully weigh the merits of every \nspending program and make priorities accordingly. My legislation would \nhelp us achieve this objective by ensuring that nonemergency items are \nnot rushed through Congress while riding on the back of emergency \nspending bills. I urge that my colleagues join me in this effort and \nsupport this legislation.\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 474\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kyl, the name of the Senator from Nevada [Mr. \nReid] was added as a cosponsor of S. 474, a bill to amend sections 1081 \nand 1084 of title 18, United States Code.\n\n\n                                 S. 617\n\n  At the request of Mr. Johnson, the names of the Senator from Idaho \n[Mr. Kempthorne], the Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad], and the \nSenator from Colorado [Mr. Campbell] were added as cosponsors of S. \n617, a bill to amend the Federal Meat Inspection Act to require that \nimported meat, and meat food products containing imported meat, bear a \nlabel identifying the country of origin.\n\n\n                                 S. 766\n\n  At the request of Ms. Snowe, the name of the Senator from New York \n[Mr. Moynihan] was added as a cosponsor of S. 766, a bill to require \nequitable coverage of prescription contraceptive drugs and devices, and \ncontraceptive services under health plans.\n\n\n                                 S. 834\n\n  At the request of Mr. Harkin, the name of the Senator from California \n[Mrs. Boxer] was added as a cosponsor of S. 834, a bill to amend the \nPublic Health Service Act to ensure adequate research and education \nregarding the drug DES.\n\n\n                                 S. 852\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lott, the names of the Senator from New Mexico \n[Mr. Bingaman] and the Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords] were added \nas cosponsors of S. 852, a bill to establish nationally uniform \nrequirements regarding the titling and registration of salvage, \nnonrepairable, and rebuilt vehicles.\n\n\n                                S. 1141\n\n  At the request of Mr. Johnson, the name of the Senator from Missouri \n[Mr. Ashcroft] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1141, a bill to amend the \nEnergy Policy Act of 1992 to take into account newly developed \nrenewable energy-based fuels and to equalize alternative fuel vehicle \nacquisition incentives to increase the flexibility of controlled fleet \nowners and operators, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1173\n\n  At the request of Mr. Warner, the name of the Senator from Colorado \n[Mr. Campbell] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1173, a bill to authorize \nfunds for construction of highways, for highway safety programs, and \nfor mass transit programs, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1178\n\n  At the request of Mr. Akaka, his name was added as a cosponsor of S. \n1178, a bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to extend the \nvisa waiver pilot program, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                         Senate Resolution 116\n\n  At the request of Mr. Levin, the names of the Senator from Hawaii \n[Mr. Inouye] and the Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar] were added as \ncosponsors of Senate Resolution 116, a resolution designating November \n15, 1997, and November 15, 1998, as ``America Recycles Day.''\n\n\n                         Senate Resolution 121\n\n  At the request of Mr. Specter, the names of the Senator from Arkansas \n[Mr. Hutchinson], the Senator from Missouri [Mr. Ashcroft], the Senator \nfrom Alabama [Mr. Shelby], the Senator from New York [Mr. D'Amato], the \nSenator from Ohio [Mr. DeWine], the Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe], \nand the Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Ford] were added as cosponsors of \nSenate Resolution 121, a resolution urging the discontinuance of \nfinancial assistance to the Palestinian Authority unles and until the \nPalestinian Authority demonstrates a 100-percent maximum effort to \ncurtail terrorism.\n\n[[Page S9428]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/16/senate-section/article/S9411-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9428-S9429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION MODERNIZATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT \n    OF 1997 PRESCRIPTION DRUG USERS FEE REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1997\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       KENNEDY AMENDMENT NO. 1190\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill (S. 830) to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and \nthe Public Health Service Act to improve the regulation of food, drugs, \ndevices, and biological products, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       Amend section 406 to read as follows:\n\n     SEC. 406.

Mr. President, tomorrow, the Senate Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works will conduct a markup of S. 1173, the \nIntermodal Transportation Act of 1997. It is time that a bill be \nreported to the Senate for thorough and careful consideration, as the \nexpiration of ISTEA is only 2 weeks away. So far, we have very little \ninformation about the impact of this recently introduced bill. The \ncommittee's report to accompany the bill, and analyses from the U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation, should be very helpful to Senators in \nestimating the bill's merits. I look forward to reviewing that report \nin detail.\n  Some proponents of the bill say that States will be guaranteed 90 \npercent of their contributions into the highway trust fund. There were \nstatements like this just before ISTEA was enacted, and which never \nmaterialized, so my colleagues will understand if I reserve judgment. \nThe committee, with the help of the Federal Highway Administration, \nwill hopefully show us that that 90 percent is actual. For the moment \nhowever, the information available now should concern all donor States.\n  According to technical assistance provided by the U.S. Department of \nTransportation, it seems that paying for a 90 percent of contributions \nguarantee would cause the ITA bill to exceed the amount allotted in the \n5-year budget agreement by approximately $10.059 billion. Yet, \ncommittee staff have indicated that the bill is just within the budget \ntargets. There seems to be a contradiction there somewhere.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                  Fiscal years--\n                                                         -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               1998            1999            2000            2001            2002            2003\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBudg.

It is not yet clear.\n  I would like to support a Transportation authorization bill that \ntreats States fairly. Unfortunately, there is insufficient information \navailable right now to make that assessment. I am concerned about what \nI have learned about the bill. I strongly encourage the committee or \nthe Department to provide Senators, as soon as possible, with charts \nshowing the likely apportionments and allocations that each State can \nexpect for each year for the life of the bill, including information on \nthe actual average return that each State can expect in terms of total \nobligation authority, assuming USDOT's gas tax receipts projections and \nthe balanced budget agreement levels for transportation.\n  Mr. President, though I am generally pleased that the committee is \nproposing to modernize the factors in the basic allocation formula to \ndo away with postal routes and other obsolete factors, I was dismayed \nto learn that S. 1173 would add a convoluted and highly suspect payment \nto States that seem to receive special treatment. I am referring to the \nISTEA transition payments. I strongly urge the committee members to \nstrike this unnecessary and unfair provision during markup.\n  There are many questions that need to be answered about that \nprovision. For instance, are these ISTEA transition payments subject to \nan obligation limitation? Can they grow over time? Shouldn't they phase \nout if they are truly transition payments? Shouldn't the fiscal year \n1997 basis used in calculating these transition payments be the \nauthorized amount and not as amended in a supplemental appropriations \nbill?\n  Mr. President, I would like to support a fair bill to reauthorize our \nNation's transportation systems. This bill holds some promise, but \nthere are too many unanswered questions at this point to make a final \nconclusion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/16/senate-section/article/S9431-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO THE PROCTOR MAPLE RESEARCH CENTER\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS.

It is the oldest maple research \nfacility in the country with a mission that embraces research, \ndemonstration, and education.\n  The center employs basic, as well as, applied research in studying \nvarious aspects of the sugar maple tree, its products and methods to \nimprove syrup production. In addition, the facility monitors long-term \nmeteorogical as well as air pollution data in close cooperation with a \nnumber of State and Federal agencies. Operations on site demonstrate \nthe latest technologies from which the public and industry can learn \nthe best methods available for manufacturing. The center's state-of-\nthe-art laboratory promotes crucial communication among researchers.\n  Over the years, research conducted at the center has provided new \ntechniques for efficient sap collection and evaporation systems. It \nhas, and will continue to play an integral role in the success of our \nregion's maple sugar industry so very critical to the local economy.\n  I am sure that the impact of work completed at the center is realized \nnot only in New England, but across the country, as many have had the \npleasure of tasting the fruits of their labor. As a Vermonter and one \nof millions of Americans that enjoys maple sugar products each year, I \nwould like to extend my best wishes to the Proctor Maple Research \nCenter for many more years of continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/16/senate-section/article/S9432-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  FAREWELL TO HIS EXCELLENCY RAUL ENRIQUE GRANILLO OCAMPO, DEPARTING \n               ARGENTINE AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in order to pay a \nspecial tribute to Ambassador Raul E. Granillo Ocampo, until recently \nthe Government of Argentina's Ambassador to the United States. \nAmbassador Ocampo left Washington last month to return to Buenos Aires \nand another challenging assignment from President Menem.\n  During his nearly 4 years in Washington, Ambassador Ocampo did a \nsuperb job representing his country's interests. He understood well \nwhat it takes to be an effective diplomat in Washington. Not only did \nhe develop close working relationships with the State Department and \nthe White House on matters of mutual concern to the United States and \nArgentina, he also made a special effort to establish close ties with \nthe United States Congress.\n  The United States-Argentine relationship has never been better. I \nbelieve that Ambassador Ocampo can take a good deal of the credit for \nthis. Certainly issues between our two countries would arise from time \nto time. That is only natural. But, thanks to Ambassador Ocampo's \ndiplomatic skills, such issues were never allowed to undermine our \nfundamental friendship and mutual respect.\n  Those of us who had the privilege of knowing Ambassador Ocampo, \nquickly recognized and appreciated his special talents. So too did \nPresident Menem. Hence, it came as no real surprise when in July, \nPresident Menem announced the appointment of Ambassador Ocampo to the \npost of Minister of Justice--a very important position in his Cabinet. \nThat is why Ambassador Ocampo has returned to Argentina.\n  Knowing something about Ambassador Ocampo's background, it makes \nperfect sense to me that he would be selected to become Minister of \nJustice. Not only does he have a law degree from the National \nUniversity of La Plata, a master's degree in Comparative International \nLaw from Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX; and a doctorate in \nlaw from the National University of Buenos Aires. He has also practiced \nlaw extensively, served as a judge on the Superior Court of the \nProvince of La Rioja, and as the president, or chief judge, for that \ncourt for 2 years.\n  I for one am only grateful that I had the opportunity to get to know \nAmbassador Ocampo personally during his tenure in Washington. Thanks to \nhim, I have a much better understanding and appreciation of the \ncomplexities of the relations between our two countries and of \nimportance of working to maintain those close ties.\n  Before the August recess, I was able to personally bid farewell to \nAmbassador Ocampo and his charming wife, Chini. However, I also wanted \nto say a more formal farewell to him as well. I particularly wanted him \nto know that we in the U.S. Senate have been enriched by his presence \nin Washington over these last number of years.\n  Finally, Mr. President, it is only fitting that as we say goodby to \nan old friend, we also prepare to welcome a new one. President Menem \nhas chosen as Ambassador Ocampo's replacement, His Excellency Diego \nRamiro Guelar, who just recently presented his credentials to President \nClinton.\n  Although I have not yet had the opportunity to meet Ambassador \nGuelar, I understand that he is both an experienced diplomat and an \nexperienced politician--he has held a number of ambassadorial posts and \nhas been a Representative in the Argentine Congress. I look forward to \nmeeting Ambassador Guelar in the very near future, and to working with \nhim as I did with his predecessor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/16/senate-section/article/S9432-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9432-S9433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 INTEL\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Intel is the epitome of a good \ncorporate citizen. During the August recess I was able to view the \nexceptional good deed performed by Intel. Intel has a large \nsemiconductor manufacturing plant located in Rio Rancho, NM. It is a \nbig\n\n[[Page S9433]]\n\nemployer and it provides good paying jobs. Rio Rancho didn't have a \nhigh school so Intel decided to build the community one. Some 1,900 \nstudents will attend this beautiful new 30 million-dollar facility. \nThis is exciting for the community because the high schoolers will no \nlonger have to leave Rio Rancho to attend high school. It is a special \nkind of home coming.\n  New Mexico is lucky to have Intel as a member of its community. Rio \nRancho would have eventually built a high school, but Intel made it \nhappen sooner.\n  Also of significance is what will be going on inside this high \nschool. Intel has been very active in working with voc-ed programs so \nthat students are trained for the jobs available at Intel. It starts in \nthe high schools and continues in the technical schools, community \ncolleges, and universities. As job requirements change at Intel, the \ncompany has a rigorous job training program that makes a prime example \nof what lifelong learning is all about.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/16/senate-section/article/S9432-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         GROWING SUPPORT FOR AN OUTSIDE AUTHORITY TO HANDLE Y2K\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, there appears to be some movement \non my idea to appoint a commission--which will act more like a special \ntask force--to oversee the Federal Government's handling of the year \n2000 problem. In this morning's Federal Page of the Washington Post, a \nstory entitled `` `Year 2000' Report Flunks 3 Agencies'' reports that \n``three house Republicans called on President Clinton to appoint a \nspecial aide to tackle the computer problem.'' In July 1996, I wrote \nthe President and proposed the creation of just such a ``Y2K czar.'' \nBut the administration is still confident that the Office of Management \nand Budget can handle the job. Like my House counterparts, I fear OMB \nmay not have the time or the resources to handle this issue.\n  In 1997, fearing the private sector's lagging awareness, I realized \nthat perhaps a task force could increase awareness in the private \nsector while ensuring compliance in the public sector.\n  Thus I introduced a first day bill, S. 22, to address this matter \nthrough a special task force. S. 22 is cosponsored by 16 Senators and \nhas been endorsed by the New York Stock Exchange [NYSE]. The enormity \nof this problem demands a task force of experts to ensure compliance. I \nhope my colleagues agree.\n  I ask that `` `Year 2000' Report Flunks 3 Agencies'' from today's \nWashington Post be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 16, 1997]\n\n``Year 2000'' Report Flunks 3 Agencies--Lawmakers Urge Special Aide to \n                    Handle Looming Computer Problem\n\n                           (By Stephen Barr)\n\n       A congressional report card flunked three federal agencies \n     and faulted several others yesterday for moving too slowly on \n     fixing potential ``year 2000'' computer glitches.\n       Rep. Stephen Horn (R-Calif), who oversees information \n     technology issues in the House, issued the report card at a \n     news briefing, where he was joined by Reps. Thomas M. Davis \n     III (R-Va.) and Constance A. Morella (R-Md.). The three House \n     Republicans called on President Clinton to appoint a special \n     aid to tackle the computer problem.\n       ``Most agencies are behind schedule,'' Horn said. ``The \n     problem, of course, is that we do not know which programs \n     will fail, what problems their failures will create, an how \n     disastrous will be the consequences.''\n       Most large computer systems use a two-digit dating system \n     that assumes 1 and 9 are the first two digits of the year. \n     Without specialized reprogramming, the system will think the \n     year 2000--or 00--is 1900, a glitch that could cause most to \n     go haywire.\n       If government systems are not fixed, malfunctions could \n     jeopardize the tax-processing system, payments to veterans \n     with service-connected disabilities, student loan repayments \n     and perhaps even air traffic control.\n       Horn issued his grades on the same day the Office of \n     Management and Budget delivered to report to Congress that \n     reflected a more aggressive stance by OMB is dealing with the \n     problem. The OMB report said agencies estimate they will \n     spend $3.8 billion fixing the year 2000 problem.\n       OMB put four agencies on notice that they will not be \n     allowed to buy new computer and other information technology \n     systems in fiscal 1999 until they have fixed critical \n     computer systems. The funding restriction, however, will be \n     lifted if agencies can justify the need for new equipment or \n     show sufficient progress on the year 2000 problem.\n       ``I have a high degree of confidence there will not be \n     adverse economic consequences flowing from this decision,'' \n     said Sally Katzen, OMB's administrator for information and \n     regulatory affairs. But, she added, OMB's increased scrutiny \n     will ``reestablish priorities for these agencies.''\n       The agencies on OMB's troubled list are the departments of \n     Agriculture, Transportation and Education and the Agency for \n     International Development. On his report card, Horn flunked \n     Education, Transportation and AID and gave Agriculture a D-\n     minus.\n       Agency officials expressed confidence yesterday that they \n     would make their year 2000 fixes before the Jan. 1, 2000, \n     deadline. The pointed out that the OMB report and Horn's \n     grades represented an August snapshot that does not reflect \n     recent decisions to repair or replace computers.\n       At the Agriculture Department, Secretary Dan Glickman has \n     issued a five-point plan to address year 2000 problems, \n     officials said. An AID official said the agency has narrowed \n     its problem to 28 date fields in a software system that can \n     be ``readily resolved.'' An Education spokesman said the \n     department ``hopes to have most if not all the problems \n     resolved in the coming year.'' And at Transportation, a \n     spokesman said DOT plans to make many of its fixes by early \n     1999.\n       Yesterday, Horn, Davis and Morella urged Clinton to \n     designate a White House official to lead the government \n     effort to fix year 2000 computer bugs. Horn and Davis praised \n     OMB Director Franklin D. Raines but said pressing budget \n     issues rob him of the necessary time to oversee the computer \n     situation. Morella said Katzen, who oversees regulatory \n     affairs across the government, has done a ``good job'' on \n     year 2000 policy but contended ``they need someone for whom \n     this is a full-time job.''\n       Katzen said she ``very respectfully disagreed that a new \n     bureaucracy is the way to go. . . . This is an issue in which \n     the agencies themselves have to do the work and it is to them \n     that we must look to be responsible and accountable.''\n\n                               REPORT CARD\n [Federal agencies were graded on their progress toward addressing year\n   2000 computer problems--and given a place to have the report cards\n                                 signed]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                     Agency                               Grade\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSocial Security Administration.................

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) open space near Grand Teton National Park continues to \n     decline;\n       (2) as the population continues to grow in Teton County, \n     Wyoming, undeveloped land near the park becomes more scarce;\n       (3) the loss of open space around Grand Teton National Park \n     has negative impacts on wildlife migration routes in the area \n     and on visitors to the park, and its repercussions can be \n     felt throughout the entire region;\n       (4) a few ranches make up Teton Valley's remaining open \n     space, and the ranches depend on grazing in Grand Teton \n     National Park for summer range to maintain operations;\n       (5) the Act that created Grand Teton National Park allowed \n     several permittees to continue livestock grazing in the park \n     for the life of a designated heir in the family;\n       (6) some of the last remaining heirs have died, and as a \n     result of the possible termination of ranching, the open \n     space around the park may likely be subdivided and developed;\n       (7) in order to develop the best solution to protect open \n     space immediately adjacent to Grand Teton National Park, the \n     National Park Service should conduct a study of grazing in \n     the area and its impact on open space in the region; and\n       (8) the study should develop workable solutions that are \n     fiscally responsible and acceptable to the National Park \n     Service, the public, local government, and landowners in the \n     area.\n\n     SEC. 2. STUDY OF GRAZING USE AND OPEN SPACE.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Interior (hereinafter \n     referred to as the ``Secretary''), shall conduct a study \n     concerning grazing use and open space in Grand Teton National \n     Park, Wyoming (hereinafter referred to as the ``park''), and \n     associated use of certain agricultural and ranch lands within \n     and adjacent to the park, including--\n       (1) base land having appurtenant grazing privileges within \n     the park, remaining after January 1, 1990, under the Act \n     entitled ``An Act to establish a new Grand Teton National \n     Park in the State of Wyoming, and for other purposes'', \n     approved September 14, 1950 (16 U.S.C. 406-1 et seq.); and\n       (2) any ranch and agricultural land adjacent to the park, \n     the use and disposition of which may affect accomplishment of \n     the purposes of the park's enabling Act.\n       (b) Purpose.--The study shall--\n       (1) assess the significance of the ranching use and \n     pastoral character (including open vistas, wildlife habitat, \n     and other public benefits) of the land;\n       (2) assess the significance of that use and character to \n     the purposes for which the park was established, and identify \n     any need for preservation of, and practicable means of \n     preserving, the land that is necessary to protect that use \n     and character; and\n       (3) recommend a variety of economically feasible and viable \n     tools and techniques to retain the pastoral qualities of the \n     area, and estimate the costs of implementing any \n     recommendations made for the preservation of the land.\n       (c) Participation.--In conducting the study, the Secretary \n     shall consult with the Governor of the State of Wyoming, the \n     Teton County Commissioners, the Secretary of Agriculture, \n     affected landowners, and other interested members of the \n     public.\n       (d) Report.--Not later than 3 years from the date funding \n     is made available, the Secretary shall submit a report to \n     Congress that contains the findings of the study under \n     subsection (a) and makes recommendations to Congress \n     regarding action that may be taken with respect to the land \n     described in subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 3. EXTENSION OF GRAZING PRIVILEGES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subject to subsection (b), the Secretary \n     shall reinstate and extend for the duration of the study \n     described in section 2(a) and until such time as 6 months \n     after the recommendations of the study are submitted, the \n     grazing privileges described in section 2(a)(1), under the \n     same terms and conditions as were in effect prior to the \n     expiration of the privileges.\n       (b) Effect of Change in Land Use.--If, during the period of \n     the study or until 6 months after the recommendations of the \n     study are submitted, any portion of the land described in \n     section 2(a)(1) is disposed of in a manner that would result \n     in the land no longer being used for ranching or other \n     agricultural purposes, the Secretary shall cancel the \n     extension described in subsection (a).\n\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The bill, as amended, was ordered to be engrossed for a third \nreading, read the third time, and passed.\n  The title was amended so as to read: ``A bill to require the \nSecretary of the Interior to conduct a study concerning grazing use and \nopen space of certain land within and adjacent to Grand Teton National \nPark, Wyoming, and to extend temporarily certain grazing privileges.''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/16/senate-section/article/S9433-4", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9434-S9435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n MARJORY STONEMAN DOUGLAS WILDERNESS AND ERNEST F.
