Mr. President, on Monday a good deal of work was done and \nthe predicate was laid for a number of bills to be considered this \nweek. We will begin the morning with morning business until 10 a.m. I \nobserve that there are at least a couple of Senators who wish to take \nadvantage of that.\n  Following morning business, Senator D'Amato will be recognized to \nintroduce a bill regarding patient care for breast cancer. It is hoped \nthat a short time agreement can be reached with the D'Amato bill.\n  At 11 a.m., under a previous order the Senate will proceed to the \nconsideration of the agriculture research conference report. The time \nuntil 12:10 will be divided among several Members for debate on that \nconference report. Following that debate, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the National Science Foundation reauthorization \nbill, again under a short time agreement. A rollcall vote will occur on \npassage of that bill, the National Science Foundation reauthorization, \nat approximately 12:15 or so. Therefore Members should be aware that \nthe first vote of today's session will occur at 12:15. Then the Senate \nwill recess after that vote for the weekly policy caucuses.\n  When the Senate reconvenes at 2:15, Senator Gramm of Texas will be \nrecognized to move to recommit the agriculture research conference \nreport. There will be 1 hour of debate equally divided on the motion. \nAt the conclusion of that debate, the Senate will proceed to vote on or \nin relation to the motion. Following the vote, it is hoped that a short \ntime agreement can be reached with respect to the agriculture research \nconference report. Any of several high-tech bills or other legislative \nor executive items also may be taken up today, if they can be cleared.\n  I did have a good conversation late on Monday afternoon with Senator \nDaschle. I believe we are going to be able to clear at least three of \nthose high-tech bills. All of them are broadly supported and I believe \nwill have an overwhelming vote once we get to a vote. I won't list them \nnow, but we will make some further announcement on that later on today.\n  Finally, as a reminder to all Members, a cloture vote will occur on \nWednesday on the motion to proceed to the missile defense bill. Senator \nCochran handled this debate on the floor on Monday. He has done \nexcellent work on this bill. This is something we should do for the \ndefense of our country. The American people, I find, when I go around \nand talk about missile defense, are shocked to learn that we don't have \na National Missile Defense System in place. So this bill is very \nimportant, I believe. I appreciate the work that has been done by my \ncolleague from Mississippi.\n  The next 2 weeks obviously will be extremely busy as Members attempt \nto complete action on several important pieces of legislation. There \nare a number of conferences that we hope to have completed and voted on \nbefore the Memorial Day recess, including the ISTEA II, the highway \ntransportation bill, the education conference report, the IRS reform \nand restructuring conference report. We also have a vote already agreed \nto with regard to Russia-Iran missile technology transfer, which is a \ncontinuing concern. Progress is not being made sufficiently, and I do \nexpect that there will be a vote on this before the end of the next \nweek.\n\n  There are a number of other very important bills now that Members are \ngetting cleared through committees or that Members are seeking to have \nvoted on. We will try to schedule as many of those as we can. \nObviously, we will need the cooperation of all Members as we try to get \nthrough this process before the end of the May recess for Memorial Day.\n  I again emphasize we do have probably three high-tech bills that we \nhave cleared: we have the agriculture conference report, we have the \nmissile defense bill that Senator Cochran has been working on, and the \nNational Science Foundation reauthorization bill. And we are going to \ntry to clear some Executive Calendar nominations, too.\n  So, again, thank you for your cooperation. These are all very \nimportant\n\n[[Page S4640]]\n\nbills for the American people and I hope we can continue the good \nprogress that we have made over the last 3 weeks. When you look back at \nwhat we have been able to get through the Senate, in terms of \neducation, the NATO treaty enlargement, and also last week the IRS \nreform--if we can have another week and complete the week with the DOD \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill I think we can feel very good \nabout what we have accomplished over the last month.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/12/senate-section/article/S4639-4", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMERICAN MISSILE PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, let me say, first of all, that I \nappreciate very much the majority leader calling up the missile defense \nbill on yesterday. At his authorization and direction, a cloture motion \nwas filed on the motion to proceed to consider that bill when an \nobjection was raised by the ranking Democrat on the Armed Services \nCommittee and the ranking Democrat, Senator Levin, on the International \nSecurity, Proliferation and Federal Services Subcommittee that I chair.\n  Last year, we had a series of hearings looking into the growing \nproliferation problem in the development of weapons of mass destruction \nand missile systems to deliver those weapons by countries that many in \nour Nation probably weren't aware were developing the sophistication in \nlong-range missile systems that were being developed.\n  I think yesterday the announcement in India of the detonation of a \nnuclear device as a test confirms once again what a dangerous \nenvironment we are in, in terms of proliferation of capabilities, of \nhaving nuclear weapons, of having missile systems that can deliver \nthose weapons over a long range. To put that in context yesterday, \nPakistan, just a few weeks ago, tested a new missile that our security \nanalysts and our intelligence agencies weren't aware that they had--\nanother example of how we cannot predict with any degree of certainty \nor accuracy how soon countries are going to develop missile systems, \nnuclear weapons with the capability of delivering those weapons systems \nover long ranges. The Pakistani missile that was tested was a 1,500-\nkilometer range missile--five times greater in capability than a report \nthat was filed by the Defense Department said that Pakistan had in \nNovember of 1997. Think about that.\n  We get an annual report from the Defense Department using the \nintelligence capabilities of our CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, \nNational Security Agency--all of the resources that our country has, to \nput together this report for the Congress. And in November of 1997 they \nsaid that Pakistan had in its inventory a 300-kilometer range missile, \nand then in April they test a 1,500-kilometer range missile. What has \nhappened? They have had assistance from other countries. Some say it \nwas China who provided the technology and wherewithal to come up with \nthis new, longer range missile. Some say it was North Korea. Pakistan \nsays it was developed from within with their own technology, their own \nscientists.\n  Whatever the reason and however this came to be, it is alarming, and \nnow we see India reacting to that new development by testing a nuclear \nweapon that is twice as powerful as the atomic bomb that was used in \nWorld War II by the United States against Japan.\n  The point is, this is a very, very dangerous situation that we see \ndeveloping in that part of the world, but in other countries, too. In \nIran. We have seen demonstrated in Iraq the capacity to almost put a \nsatellite in orbit with a missile launch vehicle 10 years ago. That \nsurprised the United States. That surprised our intelligence-gathering \nagencies.\n  I am hopeful that the Senate will notice that the time has come for \nus to stop playing politics with missile defense and national security \nand work together in a bipartisan way to develop and deploy, as soon as \ntechnology permits, a national missile defense system to protect the \nsecurity of the United States.\n  We will have that vote on cloture, as the majority leader pointed \nout, on Wednesday--cloture on the motion to proceed to consider the \nbill, not on the bill itself. It will still be open for amendment. It \nwill still be open for debate by Senators who want to discuss this \nissue, but I hope the Senate will invoke cloture so that we can proceed \nto consider the bill, to discuss the issue further, particularly in \nview of these developing events that confirm what a dangerous \nproliferation situation we find ourselves in in the world today, and we \nare defenseless against long-range or intercontinental ballistic \nmissiles.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/12/senate-section/article/S4640-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there is no one from the Republican side \nof the aisle on the floor at this moment, so I do not want to propound \nthe request until someone is available. But I do want to put our \ncolleagues on notice that I would like very much to be able to propound \na unanimous consent request within the next few minutes that would do \ntwo things: First, it would ask that Senator D'Amato be recognized to \noffer a bill regarding inpatient hospital care for breast cancer with a \ntime limit of 2 hours for debate on the bill, with no amendments or \nmotions in order thereto, and that when all time is used or yielded \nback, the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the D'Amato bill, and \nthat immediately upon disposition of the D'Amato bill, the Senate then \nproceed to the immediate consideration of the Daschle-Kennedy Patient \nProtection Act with a time limit of 2 hours for debate, with no \namendments or motions in order thereto, and that when all time is used \nor yielded back, the Senate proceed to vote on the passage of the bill \nwith all time equally divided and controlled in the usual form, and \nthat the above occur without intervening action or debate. I would ask \nthat those bills begin to be considered at 11 o'clock.\n  As I said, Mr. President, I will not ask unanimous consent at this \ntime simply in deference to our colleagues. But let me again explain \nwhat it is we are attempting to do here. It is our hope this week, in a \nvery limited timeframe, that we can pass two bills of great concern and \nimportance to this country, first and foremost, a bill that many of us \nhave cosponsored dealing with the need to protect patients in an array \nof different health circumstances that they face. More and more, the \nAmerican people are saying they are victimized, not assisted, by HMOs. \nMore and more, they are saying that managed care is not working as it \nis supposed to. More and more, they are saying that we are facing some \ncritical decisions that we must make if we are going to ensure that \nmanaged care and HMOs work right.\n  Day after day, our caucus has come to the Senate floor recognizing \nthe importance of calling the attention of this country to victims of \nour current managed care system. These victims have lost their health, \nand in some cases, their lives as a result of very critical decisions \nbeing made erroneously by people sitting at computers instead of by \ndoctors and nurses in the hospital rooms and clinics of this country.\n  We have introduced legislation that would provide protections to \npatients. It recognizes that in this HMO, managed care environment we \nhave to do a lot better job of focusing on patients,\n\n[[Page S4641]]\n\nand not on bottom-line calculations that are oftentimes used regardless \nof patients needs. The Patient Protection Act is absolutely essential \nto that effort. We also recognize that there is a need, as part of the \nlegislation, to deal with the problem of premature release of patients \nwhen they have mastectomies.\n  Senator D'Amato and Senator Feinstein and others have made a real \neffort to highlight that particular problem. And we are very supportive \nof that effort. So we hope we can pass both bills. Let us pass the \nPatient Protection Act. Let us pass the Feinstein-D'Amato mastectomy \nbill. Let us do it en bloc. Let us do it: 2 hours and 2 hours. We are \nprepared to do it this morning. We can get on with that and also the \narray of other very important technological bills that we will be \nbringing up. I thank very much the Senator from Montana for affording \nme the opportunity to make my presentation. As I noted, just as soon as \nwe find a Republican colleague on the floor I will pose this unanimous \nconsent request.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as I understand the minority leader, he is \ntalking about the desire to bring to the floor of the Senate for a vote \nthe patients' bill of rights. As the Senator knows, we have every day \nbrought to the floor of the Senate a discussion about the specific \nproblems that patients are encountering out in this country who have \nbeen hurt by managed care institutions or organizations and find that \ntheir health care decisions are all too frequently not made by the \ndoctor in the doctor's office or in the hospital but by some insurance \naccountant someplace 500 or 1,000 miles away. And the result has been \ncatastrophic for some of the patients in this country who have not been \nable to get the health care they need. As I understand it, this piece \nof legislation talks about the ability to get the health care you need \nfrom the doctor you choose, the ability to get to an emergency room \nwhen you need one, and a full range of similar concerns that affect \npatients.\n\n  Is it the request of the minority leader that we have an opportunity \nto vote on that legislation this morning? And if not this morning, at \nleast at a time certain at some point this year? As I understand it, \nthere are some who don't ever want us to have an opportunity to deal \nwith this issue, because the insurance industry and some others, who \ncertainly don't want anybody tampering with the circumstances at all, \nprefer we not vote on this. But the American people understand we have \na serious problem here that needs to be addressed. Is it the intention \nof the Senator to get a vote on this today or at some specific point in \nthe future?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. It is our desire to see if we can find a way to take up \nthis legislation and pass it today. And if not today, at a time \ncertain. If we cannot do it for some reason at 11 o'clock this morning, \nwe are prepared to set a time--perhaps June 15--perhaps right after we \nget back from the Memorial Day recess. If we are doing the tobacco bill \nnext week, and we have technology bills this week, 4 hours today seems \nto me to be a reasonable period of time to debate both of these bills \nand pass them. If we cannot do it today, I think it is incumbent upon \nthe Senate to pass this legislation at a time certain--to agree to a \ndebate at a time certain. I am sure that will happen.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Is it the position of the Senator that this really is \nthe most important health issue that is before the families of America \ntoday? Is it understood that we have been unable to consider this \nlegislation in the Labor and Human Resources Committee, and so this is \nthe only way and only means by which we can have the kind of debate \nthat families across this country want? Is it the opinion of the \nSenator from South Dakota that this really is a compelling issue, \nperhaps the most important health care issue that families in South \nDakota and across this Nation care most deeply about--to make sure that \ndoctors and not insurance agents are going to be making decisions on \nhealth care?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I tell the Senator from Massachusetts \nthat, just last week, a family from South Dakota told me that if there \nis one thing the U.S. Senate should do this year--this year--it is pass \nthe Patient Protection Act. It is to deal with the problems they are \nhaving with managed care. And it is to deal with the recognition that \nthere is a growing problem out there. In poll after poll after poll, \nthe American people are saying: We don't care what else you do, do this \nand do it this year.\n  So I think it is very clear that the intensity level is as high as it \ncan be. People care about this issue, and they recognize the problem. \nPeople know how difficult it is today to face managed care \norganizations that, in large measure, are not addressing these problems \nas they should. So the Senator from Massachusetts raises the right \nquestion. Do the American people want us to address this issue? The \nanswer is not only yes, but yes with an exclamation point.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Democratic leader yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for raising this \nissue. I hope that we put it in context. This is an important procedure \nthat Senators Feinstein and D'Amato bring to the floor. It addresses \nthe issue of mastectomy. It makes certain that women and families have \npeace of mind when they face that procedure. I don't think there is \ngoing to be any opposition to that bill, and there should not be.\n  The Senator from South Dakota makes a point--and I think we should \nmake the point--that in this debate there are many other potential \ninjustices, and injustices in the health care system. One should \nconsider the fact that most Americans say, first and foremost, they \nwant to choose their own doctors, and many women say, ``I want to be \nable to make certain during the course of my pregnancy that I have a \ndoctor, an obstetrician who I can be confident in, and one who will \ngive me advice every time I come in for a visit.'' There are families \nwho worry that when their children are brought into a doctor's office, \nthey will be referred to the right specialist, the one best for that \nchild. They don't want that decision being made by an insurance \ncompany. They want it being made by a doctor.\n\n  The irony here is that we are saying doctors should make that \ndecision. These doctors who have been chosen by the insurance companies \nto be part of their plans should be trusted, and their judgment should \nbe trusted. What the Senator from South Dakota is saying is, let's move \nforward on the Feinstein bill, on this important mastectomy protection; \nbut let's extend this protection to so many other Americans and \nfamilies and women in other circumstances who are being disadvantaged \nby insurance companies and HMOs that are unresponsive to families and \ntheir needs.\n  I think the Senator from South Dakota puts a challenge to the Senate \ntoday. Will we do one small, but important, part? Or will we take a \nlook at the whole picture and make certain that we can return home \nafter this session with the kind of legislation that the American \npeople will support? I hope the Republicans will join us. This ought to \nbe bipartisan. What is the controversy here when we say patients and \ntheir families should come first, and protecting the patients when it \ncomes to important medical decisions?\n  I thank the Senator from South Dakota. I hope we can get the \nassurance from the Republican leadership today that we will not only \nconsider the Feinstein-D'Amato bill, but also the patient protection \nthat Senators Daschle and Kennedy will offer.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for his \nvery good statement. He raises an interesting point that I failed to \nmention. Oftentimes, we talk about this as a matter simply of urgency \nand concern for victims. Indeed, that is the greatest concern--the \ndegree to which victims come to us with stories that they believe call \nout for attention to this matter. But there are now over a hundred \norganizations--organizations of all kinds--our doctors, our nurses, an \narray of working organizations in this country, including education, \nyou name it--organizations that have come\n\n[[Page S4642]]\n\nforward to say that this isn't just a health issue, this is a worker \nissue, this is a quality of life issue. This is an array of \norganizations that rarely come together on any issue. Philosophically, \nthey go from left to right. But the fact is, they care about this issue \nbecause they know how critical it is that we solve it this year.\n  So, as the Senator said, this should not take very long. Indeed, it \nis important that we get on with moving this legislation.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from South Dakota, our \nDemocratic leader, a question. In all of his research on the bill, has \nhe not found that this is a very compelling issue for women and for \nchildren, that there has essentially been a ``moat'' around access to \nmedical treatment and, therefore, leaving it to the Senate or \nlegislative bodies to make corrections, one procedure at a time, like \ndrive-by deliveries, dumping of mastectomy patients? Would it not be \nbetter to take down the ``moat'' around medical treatment and do this \nin a comprehensive way, especially a way that it affects the women and \nchildren? Has the Senator found that?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Maryland is absolutely right. She said \nit very succinctly. That is, in essence, what this legislation will do. \nThis isn't the broad array of health care reforms that we could be \naddressing. This very narrowly focuses on one of the biggest problems \nwe have in health care delivery today. I appreciate very much her \ncalling attention to that fact.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Democratic leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/12/senate-section/article/S4640-4", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 249 AND S. 1890\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, now that we do have a Republican \ncolleague on the floor, let me propound the following unanimous consent \nrequest:\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 11 o'clock on Tuesday, May 12, \nSenator D'Amato be recognized to offer a bill regarding inpatient \nhospital care for breast cancer, with a time limit of 2 hours for \ndebate on the bill, with no amendments or motions in order thereto, \nthat when all time is used or yielded back, the Senate proceed to a \nvote on passage of the bill, and immediately upon disposition of the \nD'Amato bill, the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of the \nDaschle-Kennedy Patients' Bill of Rights bill with a time limit of 2 \nhours for debate, with no amendments or motions in order thereto, and \nthat when all time is used or yielded back, the Senate proceed to vote \non passage of the bill, with all time equally divided and controlled in \nthe usual form, and that the above occur without intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. Mr. \nPresident, let me simply state that tying these two requests together--\nand I appreciate the position of the Senate minority leader--is \nunacceptable for the majority. Therefore, I will object.\n  We can have some discussion as to the merits of attempting to tie the \ntwo together. I know the minority leader has been speaking. I might \neven support the Patients' Bill of Rights, but to tie it together in \nthis way is unacceptable. So I am forced to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Let me just say I am very disappointed. We are not tying \nthem together in any way other than by procedure. We are simply saying, \nlet's debate the D'Amato bill for 2 hours, and then let's debate the \nDaschle-Kennedy bill for 2 hours. They both deal with protections for \npatients. They both deal with the need to confront the array of \nproblems we are facing in managed care today. So I am very disappointed \nthe majority has chosen to take this action, and I hope if we can't do \nit today, perhaps we can do it on the 15th. So let me ask unanimous \nconsent that on a date no later than June 15, both bills be considered \nin the order that I have just described.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, again let \nme say it is one thing to say they are not being tied together, but \nthat is exactly what is taking place. Let me take the time to point \nout, if I might, that the legislation that has been crafted with the \nhelp and consultation of my colleague, Senator Feinstein from \nCalifornia, from the beginning is not controversial, absolutely not \ncontroversial and is necessary. To take a bill that is so \nstraightforward and tie it up in procedural knots--and that is what is \nhappening here--so that the women of America, because of these \nprocedures today, are being denied health care that they need, \nreconstructive surgery, drive-by mastectomies, being put on the streets \nor being told we are not going to pay for more than 24 hours or 48 \nhours or whatever the policy limits may be, regardless of the medical \nnecessity, we are not going to pay for reconstructive surgery because, \nas one plan said and a doctor told me, ``It doesn't serve a bodily \nfunction so therefore we don't have to have reconstructive surgery,'' \nis absolutely wrong.\n  This is an issue that everyone can support and should support, and we \nshould not tie it down with legislation by its very nature that is so \ncomprehensive as the Patients' Bill of Rights that takes in a myriad of \nprograms and projects, et cetera, many of them that have arguments on \nboth sides. To say that we are going to give one 2 hours and the other \n2 hours, which is so complex, is just absolutely using the procedure to \nstifle this straightforward bill which says we will give women the \nright without having to appeal to various boards, et cetera, to \nreconstructive surgery and to know that they are not going to be forced \nto leave a hospital before it is the right time to do so.\n  That is what we are talking about here. So we are forced to object. I \nam sorry that the distinguished leader on the other side is using that \nas a cover for precluding--and by the way, we may have some Members on \nthe Republican side, I might want to add, who will seek to amend this, \nwho are out of line, I believe, and who will hide behind this and do \nnot have the courage to come down here and to vote up or down. And I \nwould like to see them offer amendments because I have had some \ncolleagues--let's be very candid--to say, ``We are going to offer a \nkiller amendment.''\n  Why? Let me give you the argument on the other side. ``We don't want \nmandates.'' Let me give you another one. One of my distinguished \ncolleagues says, ``We shouldn't have legislation by body part.'' Well, \nit is too bad, he is right, that we would have to reach this time and \nthis place that it demands that. How much longer should the women of \nAmerica have to wait? How many years, how many months do we really tie \nit up? And let me say this to you: This Senator is going to go forward. \nI know that my colleagues on the Democrat side, and there are many of \nthem, feel equally passionate, and we are going to go forward and we \nare going to have a vote on this amendment. It is a straightforward \npiece of legislation.\n  I see my colleague, Senator Feinstein, is seeking to speak on this, \nand I am going to----\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, did the Senator from New York object?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I call for regular order, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I now call for regular order with respect to the \ncontinued time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/12/senate-section/article/S4642-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4642-S4643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Finance \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. 249 regarding \ninpatient care for breast cancer, and there be 2 hours for debate \nequally divided with one relevant amendment in order to be offered by \nSenator D'Amato, and following the disposition of the amendment the \nbill be advanced to third reading and a vote occur on its passage, all \nwithout intervening action or debate.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, let me just say how \ndisappointed I am that the Senator from New York continues to persist \nin his erroneous conclusion that somehow these are melded together. I \nwill put forward a new proposal for my colleague and friend from New \nYork. I would propose that we take up the D'Amato bill today, that we \ndebate it as he suggests so long as by June 15, or at any date in June \nthat would be of his choosing, we can take up and debate the Patient \nProtection bill for whatever time it takes. If it is complex, let's \ndebate it. If it ought to be amended, let's debate it. If the Senator \nfrom New York is prepared to give me that opportunity, to say in June \nwe will take up patient protections with amendments, we will have the \ndebate on his bill today and my bill in June. I would make that \nproposal to the Senator from New York, reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I understand that, and let me respond by saying that I \nwish I could and did have the authority to accept that because I would \ndo it, because I think we should have a full debate and a full \ndiscussion on the Patients' Bill of Rights. And I think it will not be \nlimited, should not be limited to 2 hours. I thank my colleague, the \nSenate minority leader, for recognizing the complexity of the bill that \nis, I don't know how many pages. It is voluminous. And it is important.\n  Here it is. I don't know whether it has even had a hearing. It is 109 \npages. It is controversial, to say the least. And there are many parts \nof this bill which I would be supporting. There is absolutely no doubt \nabout it.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. However, we are linking the two together. By suggesting \nthat in order to get this straightforward bill, this legislation that \nsays no more drive-by mastectomies and that women will be guaranteed \nthe right to have reconstructive surgery where there is a radical \nmastectomy, it is linking the two together. I think that is \nunfortunate. I might be willing to come and join my colleagues and \nbattle for a date certain or to fight for hearings at least. I don't \nknow whether we have had hearings. I don't think we have. I see Senator \nKennedy here.\n  But the point of the matter is that we are linking the two. We are \nsaying we are not going to consider whether women should have that \nright. Where I don't believe there is one Senator here who feels they \nshould not have, not one, why should we link the two, with one bill 109 \npages, which 90 percent of the Members have not read, have not studied, \nhave not gone through. Again, it is linkage, and therefore I am \ncompelled to say that notwithstanding the good intents of my friend, it \nis linkage.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Continuing to reserve the right to object, since my \ncolleague from New York did now object to my counterproposal, I am \nflabbergasted. I am absolutely flabbergasted that the Senator from New \nYork would say, since we have not seen action on our bill, we should \ntake up his bill. And why are we taking up his bill under these \ncircumstances? Because the Finance Committee has not acted. That is the \nreason. We are going to go around the Finance Committee to go straight \nto the floor, and he is saying we shouldn't go around the Labor \nCommittee to go straight to the floor for the Patient Protection Act.\n  So let there not be any confusion here as to what is going on. \nEveryone ought to know this. This is as glaring as the lights \nthemselves. Our Republican colleagues, for whatever reason, are denying \nthe opportunity to consider a Patient Protection Act, today, tomorrow \nor any other day. And they are hiding behind the mastectomy bill to do \nit.\n  Well, let's not hide behind any legislation. Let's strip away all the \nrhetoric. They do not want to do it. They simply do not want to do it. \nI don't know why they don't want to do it, given that about 80 or 90 \npercent of the American people are demanding we do it, but they can \nexplain it.\n  No one should be misled here. The problem is not that we are \ncombining the two bills. I have just released them. There isn't any \nconnection anymore. We will take up the Feinstein-D'Amato bill today \nand take up the Patient Protection Act in the next couple of months. \nJust let us take it up. That is all we are asking.\n  So, Mr. President, I am really astounded at that logic and that \nrationale. But I don't think anybody is misled here. They don't want to \ntake up the patient protection legislation, and I am very disappointed, \nand I think the American people would be as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, let's look at this in perspective. I have \nasked staff has there been a hearing with respect to S. 1890, a bill \nthat is over 100 pages, the complexities of which, everyone has to \nadmit, go well beyond a very straightforward, very limited bill which \nwe believe guarantees women a right that I don't think there is one \nperson here who could object to, and that is, length of stay should be \ndetermined by the medical necessity of the procedure; and, second, that \nreconstructive surgery should be a woman's right. She should not have \nto go to appeal to some board or some insurance plan because ERISA \nprevents States from having legislation that would order this.\n  Let me say this. We have had a hearing on S. 249, and we have had two \nvotes to attempt to get it. Senator Feinstein, myself, and others--and \nI might say our bill has broad, bipartisan support. There is not one \nMember on the Patients' Bill of Rights from the Republican Party. You \ncan say that you are not linking, you can say you are not blocking, but \nthat is exactly what has happened. The women of America are being \ndenied a right to something that they should have--that we should enact \ninto law, and we should be proud, and all 100 Senators should come down \nand vote for this and sponsor this--because we want the Patients' Bill \nof Rights to be heard at a particular time and we are linking the two. \nThat is exactly what is happening.\n  I could support various provisions in the Patients' Bill of Rights--\nthe clinical trials. I think we should have them. I want to support \nthem. But to say that we should deny the women of America an \nopportunity to be heard on this and to have a vote on this is \ncounterproductive; it is wrong. It is a shame that the Senate operates \nin this manner.\n  But everyone has a right to be heard. Everyone has a right to make \ntheir objections. I think it is unfortunate. My friend and colleague \nfrom California, Senator Feinstein, has been waiting very patiently. If \nI might--\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I think the unanimous-consent request is \nstill pending. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, let me just say the \nSenator from New York has said on several occasions now that this has \nnot been the subject of any hearings. The Labor Committee has dealt \nwith this issue at more than seven hearings, hearings that have brought \npeople in from around the country, talking about this particular \nproblem and about how serious it is. There has been one meeting in the \nsubcommittee of the Finance Committee on his bill.\n  So let's talk about hearings. Let's talk about the array of people \nwho have come forth and said, ``Why are you waiting? Why aren't you \nmoving ahead with this legislation?'' I don't have an answer to that. \nOur caucus is attempting to promote the opportunity for all people to \nbe heard on this issue.\n  The Senator from New York also made mention of the fact that his bill \ndeals with mastectomy, and it is a very\n\n[[Page S4644]]\n\nimportant contribution. I applaud Senator Feinstein and others for \nmaking the effort, as they have, to get to this point. But his \nlegislation is very, very narrowly focused.\n  He said he supports clinical trials. We want to give him the \nopportunity to vote for it. He says he supports access to specialists. \nWe want to give him the opportunity to vote for it. He wants to protect \nthe information, the records of patients. Let's give him and others a \nchance to vote for it. That is what our bill does. It goes way beyond \nsimply the right, that a woman surely should have, to be more confident \nabout her ability to get the proper treatment when in a situation as \nsensitive as a mastectomy. But let's provide them the protection \nthrough clinical trials. Let's ensure that they can see necessary \nspecialists. Let's ensure that their records are going to be protected. \nLet's do it all. Let's not do half a job, let's do the whole job. That \nis what we are talking about here.\n\n  So I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I call for the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Regular order. I believe under the regular order I \ncontrol up to an hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I make a point of order.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from California, \nfor up to 10 minutes, for a question.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, take charge and give direction to these \nSenators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York has been recognized \nunder the regular order. The Senator from New York does not control the \nfloor. If he seeks to yield time, that requires a unanimous consent.\n  Is there objection to yielding time?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, my colleague from California has a \nquestion. I would like to yield for a question to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York has a right to yield \nfor a question. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to ask the Senator from \nNew York a question.\n  As I recall, we introduced this amendment as a bill on January 30, \n1997. That was 16 months ago. The Patients' Bill of Rights, I believe, \nwas introduced on March 31st of this year. Is that not correct?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Would the Senator----\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. My question about when we introduced this bill, a \nbill that would give a woman and her physician the right to determine \nthe length of a hospital stay when she has a mastectomy, and quite \npossibly a radical mastectomy. The length of stay in the hospital would \nbe the decision of her physician, not the HMO; we introduced this bill \n16 months ago. Correct? The Patients' Bill of Rights was introduced in \nMarch of this year. Is that not correct?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. That is correct. The Senator is correct. We introduced \nthis on January 30, 1997.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. And, am I correct in that the Senate Finance \nCommittee held a hearing on our bill on November 5, 1997?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. That is also correct. And the Senator testified--the \nSenator from California came and gave some very cohesive and forceful \ntestimony as to the need for this legislation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Is it not true that we have filed this bill to be \nconsidered by the Senate two times and you offered it in the Finance \nCommittee two times? On March 16, we filed it as an amendment to H.R. \n2646, the Parent and Students Savings Account Plus Act. Is that not \ncorrect?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Absolutely. The Senator is absolutely correct.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. On May 6, we filed it as an amendment to H.R. 2676, \nthe IRS restructuring bill. Is that not correct?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. That is absolutely correct.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. And on March 31 and on February 10 of this year, did \nmy colleague not offer it as an amendment in the Finance Committee?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I did. I did. My colleague is right. We brought it to a \nvote.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Is it not true that the Senator has been unable to \nget the Finance Committee to move this bill to the floor?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Absolutely true. Again, procedurally this is raised, \njust as an analogy, as is being done here--there they raised \ngermaneness, and, unfortunately, they kept the women of America from \nhaving the opportunity to have this bill considered at that time. That \nis correct.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Is it not true that the D'Amato-Feinstein mastectomy \nbill has 21 cosponsors, including a bipartisan group of women \nSenators--Senators Snowe, Moseley-Braun, Hutchison, Mikulski, and \nBoxer?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Absolutely. It is a bipartisan effort. It has been that \nway. I applaud my colleague from California for her leadership in this \nmatter. We have done this and conducted this in a manner that has \nsought to eliminate politics and think about the women of America and \nthe families of America, because we are talking about a disease and \nprocedures that are hurting, harming the families of America.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would like the Senator from New York to know that I \nam a cosponsor, also, of the Patients' Bill of Rights Act. I understand \nthe importance of this bill. I would very much welcome floor time to \nconsider this bill as well.\n  However, I did indicate in our Democratic caucus that absent that \nopportunity, and because women all across this Nation are going through \nsome of the same events that two women who brought this to my attention \n3 years ago in California went through, and that is to show up to have \na radical mastectomy at 7:30 in the morning, and then to be pushed out \non the street at 4:30 that afternoon with drains in them, the effects \nof anesthetics still upon them, really unable even to walk--is it not \ntrue that what we strive to do is make a simple reform and say that no \nwoman without the permission of her physician will be subject to this \nkind of treatment ever again in the United States of America?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. The Senator from California is absolutely correct.\n  Let me say that we worked long and hard on this. We have many of our \ncolleagues who, because of their commitment to deal with this--it is \ntragic when it hits a family it has so much of an impact--said you have \nto have at least 48 hours. In other words, 72 hours. And we finally \nhave been working with the people in the medical community, and I must \nsay we built a consensus where we recognize that we should not put any \ntime limitation whatsoever.\n  If I might, Mr. President, we have the Senator from Montana who is \nwaiting to make a statement. Might I propound a unanimous consent \nrequest that he be permitted to speak for up to 3 or 4 minutes as if in \nmorning business, and that might we also have an additional 5 minutes \nthen--we started late--so that he could make his statement, and then \nwithout my losing the right to continue and to hold the floor and \ncontinue our discussion with respect to this?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving right to object, I don't want to object. I \nwould like to have a very brief time to be able to respond. I think, as \nI understand it, at 11 o'clock under the consent agreement we are going \nto the agricultural matter.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. That is why I asked for an additional 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would like to see if we could have, say, 15 minutes to \nbe able to respond to that time.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Unfortunately, I am not in a position to agree to that. \nLet me say this to Senator Kennedy. Let's say that in one-half hour we \nwould yield to the Senator from New York 10 minutes. Is that fine?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That would be very generous.\n\n[[Page S4645]]\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Could Senator Baucus' remarks be contained in morning \nbusiness without interrupting the debate for up to 5 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank all Senators very much for \naccommodating me.\n  First of all, I hope that the bill to be offered by the Senator from \nCalifornia and the Senator from New York will be brought up quickly and \npassed. I think every Member of the Senate does. I very much favor it. \nAt the same time, I very strongly believe the Patients' Bill of Rights, \nthe basic protection bill, we have to pass that. It is very \nregrettable, frankly, that we are at loggerheads. We need to get that \nbill passed. I think we should work that out fairly soon. Frankly, it \nis in the interest of the American people we get this passed very \nquickly. But it is not going to be resolved right now.\n  By unanimous consent, the remarks of Mr. Baucus pertaining to \n``Montana Pole Vaulters'' are printed in today's Record under ``Morning \nBusiness.''\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, might I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Johnson from South Dakota be given 3 minutes to speak on this \nissue?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, my \nunderstanding is that the order by unanimous consent at 10 o'clock \nrequired that Senator D'Amato be recognized to propound a unanimous \nconsent request; not that Senator D'Amato be recognized between 10 and \n11 o'clock. I am wondering. Am I correct on that?\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The order provides for the recognition of \nSenator D'Amato of New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I believe I was going to be recognized, and indeed I am \nattempting to accommodate this. I could speak for this 1 hour. I am \nattempting to accommodate the needs of my colleagues. That is why I \nyielded 10 minutes. I am prepared to yield 10 minutes to Senator \nKennedy. The time is clicking off here.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will not object. But my understanding of the UC was \nthat the Senator from New York would be recognized to propound a \nunanimous consent request at which point the floor would be open. I \nguess I understand the Senator from New York intends to retain the \nfloor until 11 and simply by consent allow others to speak for a \ncertain amount of time.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. He certainly has that right. Under the unanimous consent \nagreement he has the right of recognition. So I will not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York and the \nSenator from California for their extraordinary work on this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, frankly, I have to share a great level of frustration, \nand to be candid, anger at where we find ourselves this morning: unable \nto move forward with the breast cancer legislation for which there is \nbroad bipartisan support and little controversy. I have more than \nsimply a public policy concern about this issue. I have a personal \nconcern in my own family, having gone through my wife's breast cancer \nchallenge over the past 2 years. She is doing very well. But we had a \nsituation where she remained in the hospital for one night following \nsurgery. She went home with the drains, and the other complications. We \nwere able to do that all right because we don't have small children at \nhome. We had no complications. But I know of other women in my State of \nSouth Dakota who have small children at home who cannot take a great \namount of time from work, who have no extra help, who have extra \ncomplications, and who have all sorts of matters that are debilitating \nthat cause complications. And 24 hours for many of them is simply not \nadequate. We have an opportunity here to correct that problem. This \ndoesn't correct everything.\n  I share the support of the Senator from California for the Patients' \nBill of Rights. I am frustrated, as well, that we haven't made greater \nprogress there. I hope that before this session is over we will in fact \ndeal with the more comprehensive health care reform legislation.\n  I applaud Senator Daschle's leadership on the Patients' Bill of \nRights legislation. But I do not want to make the perfect the enemy of \nthe good. What we have here is a piece of legislation which we should \nbe able to pass this very day.\n  It is certainly my hope, while we have the continued discussion about \na more comprehensive approach to managed care and ensuring the rights \nof all patients, that before this session of the 105th Congress \nexpires--and we are running out of time quickly--that, in fact, we get \nthis breast cancer bill to the floor and deal with it in an expeditious \nfashion.\n  Again, I simply want to applaud the leadership of the Senators from \nCalifornia and New York on this issue, one that we really should not \nallow to be delayed longer than it already has.\n  I yield my time.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time be \nextended until 11:05, because we did not start nearly on time, and I \nfurther ask unanimous consent that Senator Kennedy be recognized now \nfor up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 7 minutes.\n  Mr. President, let me be clear: I am all in favor of Senator \nD'Amato's bill. Its provisions are included in the Patients' Bill of \nRights. I was an original cosponsor of Senator Daschle's legislation, \nwhich preceded the legislation authored by my colleague from New York, \nthat guaranteed breast cancer patients a minimum length of stay in the \nhospital following a mastectomy. And I worked with the breast cancer \ncommunity--patients and providers--to write and introduce a bill that \nwould require plans that cover mastectomies to also cover \nreconstructive surgery, prostheses and treatment for lymphedema, a \ncomplication of the surgery. In fact, Senator D'Amato modified his \noriginal bill, which covered only reconstructive surgery, to conform it \nmore closely to mine. We share a commitment to this legislation.\n  But his proposal does not include other provisions that are in our \nbill and which are equally important to breast cancer patients, their \nfamilies and their doctors. The following protections, all of which are \nin the Patients' Bill of Rights remain unaddressed in the legislation \nproposed by Senator D'Amato:\n  It does not guarantee access to specialists--provisions that would \nallow an oncologist to act as a cancer patient's care coordinator, or \nwould allow a patient to see an oncologist directly, without first \nmaking an unnecessary visit to a so-called ``gatekeeper.''\n  It does not ensure for a smooth transition between new and existing \ndoctors for breast cancer patients and survivors whose employers change \nplans or whose plans change providers in the network.\n  It does not include access to and coverage of participation in \nclinical trials, which can so often mean the difference between life \nand death for patients with nowhere else to turn.\n  It does not establish the right to an independent and timely appeal--\na critical feature for those times when coverage decisions fall into a \ngrey area.\n  It does not create access to prescription drugs that are not on the \nformulary, if they are medically indicated in the case at hand.\n  It does not guarantee that emergency care will be covered, provided a \nlayperson believed they were in an emergency.\n  With the limited exception for post-mastectomy length-of-stay \ndeterminations, it does not fully restore the doctor-patient \nrelationship by returning treatment decisions to the attending \nphysician.\n  Finally, it does not allow patients to hold health plans accountable \nfor their medical decision-making.\n  Clearly, the problems are not with what is in the bill, but with what \nis not in the bill.\n  We are effectively precluded from including these particular \nprovisions in the D'Amato proposal. And that is why these matters are \nlinked, Mr. President. The items contained in our Patient Protection \nAct are critically important to breast cancer patients and\n\n[[Page S4646]]\n\nsurvivors. Our bill has the broad support from virtually all the \nvarious cancer groups and breast cancer groups. But, if we move forward \non only those included in the D'Amato proposal, we effectively preclude \nmovement on the rest of the provisions.\n  One can say, ``Well, we are still making some progress.'' I \nunderstand, but there is no reason in the world--none, no reason--that \nwe cannot include these particular provisions for women today--none, \nmake no mistake about it.\n  We have had eight hearings on the issues relating to the Patients' \nBill of Rights. I introduced the original legislation on this issue \nmore than a year ago--over a year ago. The President's advisory \ncommission, which included among its members representation from the \nbusiness community and insurance industry, reported unanimously last \nNovember about what ought to be included in a patients' bill of rights. \nWe have incorporated their recommendations in our bill. They are needed \ntoday by women across this country.\n  All we are asking is for the opportunity to have the Senate debate \nand go on record with regard to these kinds of protections. But we are \nforeclosed from acting today. We are denied doing it. We cannot even \nget a reasonable period of time. The Republican leadership is sitting \nsomewhere in this building. They could have listened to the exchange \nthat was done by the Democratic leader and the Senator from New York. \nThey know what is going on on the floor of the U.S. Senate. They can \njust come out here and say, ``All right, you got it, you are going to \nhave an opportunity to debate this issue; we won't have a time \nlimitation, call the roll and let's have a debate on what is the No. 1 \nissue before American families.'' But, no, we are precluded from that.\n  You don't have to be around here a great deal of time to understand \nwhat is going on. We are effectively excluded because of the power of \nthe insurance industry. Do you hear that? We are excluded from having \nan opportunity to debate this because of the power of the insurance \nindustry. That is what is going on here. That is the issue this morning \non the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  The industry does not want to provide patients with the protections \nto which they are entitled and have paid for, and their allies in the \nSenate are holding this up, Mr. President, by using parliamentary \ntechniques to deny us the chance to consider this legislation. We \ncannot get a report out of our Labor and Human Resources Committee. We \ncannot take it up on the floor of the U.S. Senate. It is time for \naction, and we are denied an opportunity, not just today, not just \ntomorrow, not just June, but anytime whatsoever--whatsoever.\n  We are asking the Republican leadership to give us a time. Call the \nDemocratic leader. Bring it up in 2 days. Bring it up in 2 weeks. Bring \nit up in a month. But give us a time to bring this up. That is what \nthis issue is all about, and that is where we are going, Mr. President. \nWe will bring this issue up time in and time out, again and again. We \nmay be foreclosed now, but the American people are going to demand it. \nThose women who have or have had breast cancer are going to understand \nit and demand it as well.\n  I yield the remaining time to the Senator from California.\n  I thank the Senator from New York for granting the time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, I will reserve 2 \nminutes for him.\n  Sometimes we set up false fights, and it is a real false fight \nbetween those who want to ban drive-through mastectomies, which I would \nguess is every single Senator in this Chamber, and those who want to go \neven further and grant patients protections across the board for breast \ncancer patients, prostate cancer patients, children, the elderly, \nanyone who gets sick. There is no fight. Why are we having a fight? We \nare having a fight because, as the Senator from Massachusetts has said, \nwe are unable to make this a broader bill.\n\n  I am very proud to be a sponsor of the D'Amato-Feinstein bill, and I \nam going to be very excited when this bill becomes law, and it will \nbecome law.\n  We need to do more, and there is no reason why the leadership of the \nSenate won't give us that opportunity, except that there are many \nspecial interests who don't want us to do more, who are pocketing--into \ndeep pockets--profits on a HMO system that shortchanges patients, and \nthat is wrong.\n  I was visited by a man named Harry Christie. I have told his story on \nthe Senate floor before. His daughter was diagnosed with a rare tumor \nin her kidney. She was 9 years old. There were two doctors who had \nexperience operating on that type of tumor. His HMO said, ``That's too \nbad, you have to go with a general surgeon.''\n  He said, ``This is my only child.''\n  And they said, ``You're out of luck.''\n  Fortunately, Mr. Christie was able to come up with the $50,000 he \nneeded, and he saved his daughter's life. Six years later, she is alive \nand, yes, the HMO was fined a hefty sum by the State of California. If \nMr. Christie had listened to the HMO, he might not have his daughter \ntoday.\n  All the Senator from Massachusetts and the Democratic leader are \nsaying is we love this mastectomy bill, we want to help you get this \nbill through, but help us, help us do more. We can stop a woman from \nhaving to go through a horrific, outrageous, demeaning, dangerous \ndrive-through mastectomy, and we will with this bill. But what happens \nwhen she is out of hope a couple of years later, and she needs to get \ninto a clinical trial where she can have access to certain drugs \nbecause nothing else is working? The mastectomy bill is narrow, it \ndoesn't address that. The broader patient rights bill addresses it.\n  I want to speak to the issue of the dates when these various bills \nwere put into the hopper, because Senator Feinstein made a good point \non that. However, Senator Kennedy had a bill that was offered before \nthe drive-through mastectomy bill. Others had bills that were offered \nbefore as well. We don't need to have this argument which pits one \nagainst the other. We should be able to pass this bill banning drive-\nthrough mastectomies, and allow it to be amended to take up these \nbroader issues, so that if someone has chest pains and goes to the \nemergency room, they are not going to be told by their HMO that they \ncan't qualify for a payment because, guess what, they didn't actually \ndie and have a heart attack, they actually lived. But it was a prudent \nperson who made that decision to walk into that emergency room. Why \nshould they be penalized?\n  I am very hopeful we will pass this drive-through mastectomy bill, \nbut also a broader Patients' Bill of Rights for breast cancer patients, \nfor prostate cancer patients, for Alzheimer's patients, for all the \npatients, and let's not set up a false argument here. We can do both. \nSomebody once said you should be able to walk and chew gum at the same \ntime. Well, we should be able to do this very narrow bill and then \ndebate a broader bill and give all of our patients the protection they \nso richly deserve.\n  I yield the remaining time to Senator Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my colleague \nfrom California, Senator Feinstein, be recognized for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from New York.\n  I must say that I think what is happening here is unfortunate. I \nthink what we are seeing overwhelmingly all across the United States is \na state of medical care and health insurance in this country that is \nbecoming much more oriented toward business and much less oriented \ntoward medicine. And this is prompting, I think, all across this land a \nterrible situation for physicians and for patients.\n  What prompted me to introduce this bill was two California women who \nwrote to me. I want to read them to you and enter their full statements \nin the Record.\n  One was from a woman in Newark, CA. And she wrote--and this was \nalmost 2\\1/2\\ years ago--that she had a modified radical mastectomy as \nan outpatient at the Fremont Kaiser outpatient clinic. She was operated \non at\n\n[[Page S4647]]\n\n11:30 in the morning and was released at 4:30 that afternoon, with no \nattempt made to see if she could even walk to the bathroom. She was 60 \nyears old. And the discovery of cancer and the subsequent surgery were \nextremely draining both emotionally and psychologically.\n  That is one case. Same day. Let me read you about another case.\n\n       My mastectomy and lymph node removal took place at 7:30 \n     a.m., November 13. I was released at 2:30 p.m. that same day. \n     I received notice, the day before surgery, from my doctor \n     that mastectomy was an outpatient procedure at Kaiser and I'd \n     be released the same day. Shocked by this news, I told my \n     surgeon of my previous complications with anesthesia and the \n     fact that I have a cervical spine condition, which adds an \n     additional consideration for any surgery.\n\n  Then she goes on and she says:\n\n       While in a groggy, postoperative daze, swimming in pain and \n     nausea, I was given some perfunctory instructions on how to \n     empty the two bloody drains attached to my body. I was told \n     to dress myself and go home. My doctor's written chart \n     instructions for a room assignment, if I developed acute \n     nausea or pain, were ignored by the nursing staff.\n\n  This is the problem we are trying to stop right here and now. I \nfrankly am sorry that the bill isn't broader. But this is something \nwhose cost is small--$100 million. We know it can be accommodated. We \nknow we can get the job done.\n  This bill is simple. It requires every insurance plan in the United \nStates of America to cover the hospital length of stay determined by \nthe physician to be medically necessary. It does not prescribe a fixed \nnumber of days. It does not set a minimum. It leaves the length of the \nhospital stay for the mastectomy up to the treating physician.\n  Secondly, it requires health insurance plans to cover breast \nreconstruction following a mastectomy.\n  Thirdly, it requires insurance plans to cover breast prostheses and \ncomplications of mastectomy, including lymphedema.\n  And, finally, it prohibits insurance plans from financially \npenalizing or rewarding a physician for providing medically necessary \ncare or for referring a patient for a second opinion.\n  This is a simple bill. It is a direct bill. It is going to directly \nbenefit the lives of tens of thousands of women. I regret that it isn't \nmore comprehensive. But we know it is doable, we know what it does, and \nwe know women will immediately be better off because of it.\n  So I am very proud to stand here with my colleague from New York and \nwith others in the Senate. The great bulk of women Senators are \nsupporting this. This is tangible; it is doable. We believe it can \nbecome law quickly. And we say, let us seize the moment and let us \naccomplish at least this for women of America.\n  So I thank my colleague from New York for his authorship. I was very \nproud to be an original sponsor on this bill. We did have a hearing. We \nhave tried to get the job done before, but hopefully it will get done \nthis morning.\n  As an original cosponsor of S. 249, the Women's Health and Cancer \nRights Act, I am pleased to sponsor the amendment on mastectomy \nhospital length of stay that Senator D'Amato is urging the Senate to \nconsider. It is time to pass it.\n  Senator D'Amato and I introduced this amendment as a bill on January \n30, 1997, 16 months ago. The Senate Finance Committee held a hearing on \nthe bill, S. 249, on November 5, 1997. We have filed this as an \namendment, to be considered by the Senate, three times:\n  On March 16, we filed it as an amendment to H.R. 2646, the Parent and \nStudent Savings Account PLUS Act.\n  On May 6, we filed it as an amendment to H. R. 2676, the IRS \nrestructuring bill.\n  On March 31 and on February 10 of this year, Senator D'Amato offered \nit as an amendment in the Finance Committee.\n  In sum, we have made numerous efforts to get the Senate to consider \nthis bill.\n  The D'Amato-Feinstein mastectomy bill has 21 cosponsors, including a \nbipartisan group of women Senators: Senators Snowe, Moseley-Braun, Kay \nBailey Hutchison, Mikulski and Boxer.\n  This amendment has four important provisions: For treatment of breast \ncancer:\n\n       1. It requires insurance plans to cover the hospital length \n     of stay determined by the physician to be medically \n     necessary. Importantly, our bill does not prescribe a fixed \n     number of days or set a minimum. It leaves the length of \n     hospital stay up to the treating physician.\n       2. It requires health insurance plans to cover breast \n     reconstruction following a mastectomy.\n       3. It requires insurance plans to cover breast prostheses \n     and complications of mastectomy, including lymphodemas. For \n     treatment of all cancers:\n       4. It prohibits insurance plans from financially penalizing \n     or rewarding a physician for providing medically necessary \n     care or for referring a patient for a second opinion\n\n  Let me share with you two firsthand experiences, two California women \ndescribing their treatment by insurance companies in having a \nmastectomy.\n  Nancy Couchot, age 60, of Newark, California, wrote me that she had a \nmodified radical mastectomy on November 4, 1996, at 11:30 a.m. and was \nreleased by 4:30 p.m. She could not walk and the hospital staff did not \nhelp her ``even walk to the bathroom.'' She says, ``Any woman, under \nthese circumstances, should be able to opt for an overnight stay to \nreceive professional help and strong pain relief.''\n  Victoria Berck, of Los Angeles, wrote that she had a mastectomy and \nlymph node removal at 7:30 a.m. on November 13, 1996, and was released \nfrom the hospital 7 hours later, at 2:30 p.m. Ms. Berck was given \ninstructions on how to empty two drains attached to her body and sent \nhome. She concludes, ``No civilized country in the world has mastectomy \nas an outpatient procedure.''\n  These are but two examples of what, unfortunately, is symptomatic of \na growing trend and a national nightmare--insurance plans interfering \nwith professional medical judgment and arbitrarily reducing care \nwithout a medical basis.\n  Premature discharges for mastectomy, with insurance plans strong-\narming physicians to send women home, are one glaring example of the \ngrowing torrent of abuses faced by patients and physicians who have to \n``battle'' with their HMOs to get coverage of the care that physicians \nbelieve is medically necessary.\n  Increasingly, insurance companies are reducing inpatient hospital \ncoverage and pressuring physicians to discharge patients who have had \nmastectomies. This is beyond the pale. It is unconscionable.\n  The Wall Street Journal on November 6, 1996, reported that ``some \nhealth maintenance organizations are creating an uproar by ordering \nthat mastectomies be performed on an outpatient basis. At a growing \nnumber of HMOs, surgeons must document `medical necessity' to justify \neven a one-night hospital admission.''\n  A July 7, 1997 study by the Connecticut Office of Health Care Access \nfound the average hospital length of stay for breast cancer patients \nundergoing mastectomies decreased from three days in 1991 and 1993 to \ntwo days in 1994 and 1995. This study said, ``The percentage of \nmastectomy patients discharged after one-day stays grew about 700 \npercent from 1991 to 1996.''\n  In the last ten years, the length of overnight hospital stays for \nmastectomies has declined from 4 to 6 days to 2 to 3 days to, in some \ncases, ``no days.'' The average cost of one day in a community hospital \nin 1995 nationwide was $968.00. In California, in 1997, the average \ncost for one day was $1,329.77. When insurance plans refuse to cover a \nhospital stay, most Californians have difficulty coughing up $1,300.00. \nThey are forced to go home.\n\n  In 1997, over 180,000 women (or one in every 8 American women) were \ndiagnosed with invasive breast cancer and 44,000 women died from breast \ncancer. Only lung cancer causes more cancer deaths in American women. \n2.6 million American women are living with breast cancer today.\n  In my state, this year, 19,399 women will be diagnosed with breast \ncancer and 4,585 will die. The San Francisco Bay Area has some of the \nhighest rates of breast cancer in the world. According to the Northern \nCalifornia Cancer Center, San Francisco's 9-county area's rate of \nbreast cancer in 1994 was 50 percent higher than most European \ncountries and 5 times higher than Japan. In September 1997, the \nNorthern California Cancer Center gave us some mixed news: ``The good \nnews is we're seeing the rates go down. The bad news is we don't know \nwhy,'' said Angela Witt\n\n[[Page S4648]]\n\nPrehn. But officials there say, the bottom line is that incidence rates \nare still higher than national rates.\n  After a mastectomy, patients must cope with pain from the surgery, \nwith drainage tubes and with psychological loss--the trauma of an \namputation. These patients need medical care from trained \nprofessionals, medical care that they cannot provide themselves at \nhome.\n  A woman fighting for her life and her dignity should not also be \nsaddled with a battle with her health insurance plan. A physician \ntrying to provide medically necessary care\n  As the National Breast Cancer Coalition wrote me on March 12, 1998: \n``The NBCC applauds this effort and believes this compromise will put \nan end to the dangerous health insurance practices that allow cost and \nnot medical evidence to determine when a woman leaves a hospital after \nbreast cancer surgery.''\n  Insurance plans also refuse to cover breast reconstruction and breast \nprostheses. Our bill requires coverage.\n  Joseph Aita, Executive Vice President and Medical Director of \nLifeGuard, was quoted in the San Jose, California, Mercury News, as \nsaying ``Looking normal is not medically necessary.''\n  Let me contradict Mr. Aita. Looking normal is medically necessary. \nBreast reconstruction is important to recovery. According to Dr. Ronald \nIverson, a Stanford University surgeon, ``Breast reconstruction is a \nreconstructive and not a cosmetic procedure.''\n  He cites a study which found that 84 percent of plastic surgeons \nreported up to 10 patients each who were denied insurance coverage for \nreconstruction of the removed breast. This could mean 40,000 cases per \nyear.\n  Commendably, my state has enacted a law requiring coverage of breast \nreconstruction after a mastectomy. We need a national standard, \ncovering all insurance policies. Let's follow California's need.\n  Finally, our amendment prohibits insurance plans from including \nfinancial or other incentives to influence the care a doctor's \nprovides, similar to a law passed by the California legislature last \nyear. Many physicians have complained that insurance plans include \nfinancial bonuses or other incentives for cutting patient visits or for \nnot referring patients to specialists. Our bill bans financial \nincentives linked to how a doctor provides care. Our intent is to \nrestore medical decision-making to health care.\n  For example, a California physician wrote me, ``Financial incentives \nunder managed care plans often remove access to pediatric specialty \ncare.'' A June 1995 report in the Journal of the National Cancer \nInstitute cited the suit filed by the husband of a 34-year old \nCalifornia woman who died from colon cancer, claiming that HMO \nincentives encouraged her physicians not to order additional tests that \ncould have saved her life.\n  Our amendment today tries to restore professional medical \ndecisionmaking to medical doctors, those whom we trust to take care of \nus. It should not take an act of Congress to guarantee good health \ncare, but unfortunately that is where we are today. As the National \nBreast Cancer Coalition wrote us on March 12, ''. . . until guaranteed \naccess to quality health care coverage and service is available for all \nwomen and their families, there are some very serious patient concerns \nthat must be met. Without meaningful health care reform, market forces \npropel the changes in the health care system and women are at risk of \nbeing forced to pay the price by having inappropriate limits placed on \ntheir access to quality health care.''\n  This amendment is an important protection for millions of Americans \nwho face the fear, the reality and the costs of cancer every day. When \nany cancer strikes, it is not just the victim who suffers. It becomes a \nfamily matter.\n  Today I say, enough is enough. It is time for this Senate, for this \nCongress to send a strong message to insurance companies that we must \nput care back into health care. Medical decisions must be made by \nmedical professionals, not anonymous insurance clerks.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have items I referred to previously \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Newark, CA, November 16, 1996.\n     Senator Feinstein.\n     Senator Boxer.\n       I recently called your office to express my anger at having \n     been forced on Nov. 4 to have a modified radical mastectomy \n     as an outpatient at the Fremont Kaiser Outpatient Clinic. I \n     was operated on at 11:30 am and was released by 4:30 with no \n     attempt made to see if I could even walk to the bathroom.\n       I am 60 years old and the discovery of cancer and the \n     subsequent surgery was extremely draining both emotionally \n     and psychologically. I feel that Kaiser completely \n     disregarded these feelings, along with my fear of coming home \n     so soon with no professional help. We received a call from \n     Kaiser the following morning but visit by a home health \n     nurse.\n       Any woman, under these circumstances, should be able to opt \n     for an overnight stay to receive professional help and strong \n     pain relief.\n       I am interested in your view of this issue. Contact me if \n     you want further details.\n                                                    Nancy Couchot.\n\n       Sorry I am still wobbly writing.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, Nov. 21, 1996]\n\n                     Outpatient Mastectomy Surgery\n\n       My thanks to Ellen Goodman for ``The Latest HMO Outrage: \n     Drive-Thru Mastectomy'' (Commentary, Nov. 18). Last week I \n     became an uninformed victim of this inhumane practice at \n     Kaiser-Permanente, Los Angeles.\n       I want to acquaint women with my firsthand experience of \n     this degradation and urge my fellow HMO patients to contact \n     their Washington legislators.\n       My mastectomy and lymph node removal took place at 7:30 \n     a.m., Nov. 13. I was released at 2:30 p.m. that same day. I \n     received notice, the day before surgery, from my doctor that \n     mastectomy was an outpatient procedure at Kaiser and I'd be \n     released the same day. Shocked by this news, I told my \n     surgeon of my previous complications with anesthesia and the \n     fact that I have a cervical spine condition, which adds an \n     additional consideration for any surgery. The pleasant doctor \n     assured me that I'd be admitted, for the night, if I \n     experienced excessive pain or nausea. This was noted in my \n     chart.\n       In the recovery room and the holding area, I felt like a \n     wounded soldier in a hospital tent during the Civil War. I \n     was surrounded by moaning patients and placed directly next \n     to a screaming infant. When I finally found a voice, I \n     shouted, ``Get me out of here!'' A nurse flitted by, shot me \n     a disapproving glance, and commented, ``Some folks just don't \n     know when to be grateful.'' This was the ultimate \n     humiliation.\n       While in a groggy, postoperative daze, swimming in pain and \n     nausea, I was given some perfunctory instructions on how to \n     empty the two bloody drains attached to my body. I was told \n     to dress myself and go home. My doctor's written chart \n     instructions for a room assignment, if I developed acute \n     nausea or pain, were ignored by the nursing staff. Obviously, \n     the reassurance had been given to placate me at the time of \n     my discussion with the doctor but everyone knew an overnight \n     stay was against Kaiser hospital rules. Everyone knew, except \n     me. I had no time to mourn the loss of my breast or regain a \n     sense of composure.\n       This experience was especially shocking because four years \n     previously, I had undergone a hysterectomy and received \n     excellent treatment and a four-night stay at the very same \n     Kaiser facility.\n       We women can allow ourselves to be discounted or we can \n     demand more from the HMOs. No civilized country in the world \n     has mastectomy as an outpatient procedure.\n                                                   Victoria Berck.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Maine, Senator Snowe, be recognized to speak for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator D'Amato for yielding me such time. I \nwant to applaud him for his leadership on this very important issue for \nwomen in America. And I thank my colleague, Senator Feinstein, for her \nleadership as well and commitment that she has demonstrated on this \nissue.\n  Mr. President, I regret that we have reached a point here where we \ncannot pass one bill because it is being held hostage to another. No \none disagrees with the Senator from Massachusetts in terms of the \nimportance of some of the issues that he has raised with respect to a \nPatients' bill of rights. But this legislation should not be held \nhostage to that legislation.\n  We all know that there are many questions with respect to the \napproach that he has taken--relevant questions, understandable \nconcerns--that should be appropriately discussed and explored in the \ncommittee process and then ultimately here on the floor. But this \nshould not hold up this particular bill. And Senator D'Amato is \nabsolutely correct, we should move forward, because this has strong \nbipartisan support.\n\n[[Page S4649]]\n\n  There is not a Senator on the floor who would not support this \nlegislation. So the women of America should not be held hostage because \nof internal divisions, because of parliamentary maneuvers, because of \nlegislative gridlock.\n  This legislation has the support of Democrats as well as Republicans. \nWe have 180,000 women every year who are diagnosed with breast cancer. \nOne in eight women in their lifetime will be detected with breast \ncancer. We have now discovered that, in many instances, mastectomies \nare being performed on an outpatient basis, and we need to take action \nto prevent that. Mastectomies are very complicated surgical procedures.\n  There is no way that that is a decision that should be made by a \nbureaucrat; but rather, the length of a woman's stay in a hospital, how \nthat procedure will be handled, should be determined by her as well as \nher doctor. Those are the only two individuals who ought to be making \nthat decision. It should not be a bureaucrat's bottom line.\n  We have found time and time again women who have had to endure this \nprocedure on an outpatient basis. The physical scars left by \nmastectomy, which can be complicated and difficult to care for, often \nrequire supervision. Women prematurely released may not have the \ninformation they need, let alone the care. And dangerous complications \nhave arisen hours after the operation. And all of this is occurring \nwithin the context of a traumatic circumstance, and that is having a \nmastectomy. We want to make sure that this decision is made \nappropriately within the confines of medical supervision and medical \nproviders.\n  We have also found that breast reconstructive surgery is considered \ncosmetic surgery. Well, it is not. Forty-three percent of women who \nwant to undergo breast reconstructive surgery cannot because it is \ndeemed cosmetic. And that is wrong. Breast reconstructive surgery is \ndesigned to restore a woman's wholeness. Fortunately, my State has \npassed legislation to guard against that and to require health \ninsurance companies to consider it as breast reconstructive surgery. \nBut unfortunately for those who are employed by those who are self-\ninsured, they do not receive this kind of coverage.\n  That is why this legislation that is offered by Senator D'Amato is so \nessential. We cannot allow women to have to endure this kind of \ndecisionmaking under the most arduous circumstances because of the \nindecision and the difficulties that have arisen here.\n  This legislation had a hearing back in November of 1997 before the \nSenate Finance Committee. We are entitled to get this legislation \nthrough the legislative process. In fact, the President, during his \nState of the Union Address in January of 1997, had a physician in the \ngallery who drew attention to the need to change the guidelines that \nhad encouraged outpatient masectomies. Therefore, he called on Congress \nin January of 1997 to pass this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank Senator D'Amato for his leadership. I urge the \nSenate to move this legislation forward. We will have another day to \nraise the issues raised by the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Alaska be recognized for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Let me commend the chairman on his efforts to bring \nthis to the floor. This is the second or third time he has done it. I \nam certainly pleased to be a cosponsor of the Women's Health and Cancer \nRights Act.\n  In our State of Alaska, we have an effort relative to awareness being \nput on by the Breast Cancer Detection Center of Alaska, which has \nprovided 25,000 women in 81 villages throughout the State an \nopportunity for free mammograms. This has been done not with government \nsupport but with private support. We have raised about $830,000 through \na series of fishing tournaments each year, which some Senators have \nbeen a party to.\n  Mr. President, I think that the significance of this bill, which \nmeans so much to so many, is that it would put an end to the ``drive-\nthrough'' mastectomies, as we know them today. Many of my colleagues \nhave already spoken on this issue. The bill ensures that mastectomy \npatients would have access to reconstruction surgery. Scores of women \nhave been denied this procedure because insurers have deemed this \nprocedure to be ``cosmetic.'' Far too often, breast cancer victims who \nbelieve they have adequate health coverage have become horrified when \nthey learn that reconstruction is not covered.\n  In my State of Alaska, of the 324 mastectomies and lumpectomies \nperformed in Alaska in 1996, reconstruction only occurred on 11 of the \npatients. That means that only 3.4 percent of the women who have a \nbreast removed have reconstructive surgery, compared to the national \naverage of 23 percent.\n  The reason is cost, Mr. President. And if we look at one of the \nphysicians in my State, Dr. Troxel, of Providence Hospital in \nAnchorage, who states:\n\n       Women who are not able to receive reconstructive surgery \n     suffer from depression, a sense of loss, and need more cancer \n     survivor counseling. . . .Additionally, reconstructive \n     surgery can be preventive medicine--women who don't have \n     reconstructive surgery often develop back problems and other \n     difficulties.\n\n  Mr. President, one out of nine American women will suffer the tragedy \nof breast cancer. It is today the leading cause of death for women \nbetween the ages of 35 to 54.\n  Alaskan women are particularly vulnerable to this disease. We have \nthe second highest rate of breast cancer in the nation: 1 in 7 Alaska \nwomen will get breast cancer and tragically it is the Number One cause \nof death among Native Alaskan women.\n  Mr. President, these tragic Alaska deaths are not inevitable. Health \nexperts agree that the best hope for lowering the death rate is early \ndetection and treatment. It is estimated that breast cancer deaths can \nbe reduced by 30 percent if all women avail themselves of regular \nclinical breast examination and mammography.\n  But for many Alaska women, especially native women living in one of \nour 230 remote villages, regular screening and early detection are \noften hopeless dreams.\n  For more than 20 years, my wife Nancy has recognized this problem and \ntried to do something about it. In 1974, she and a group of Fairbanks' \nwomen created the Breast Cancer Detection Center, for the purpose of \noffering mammographies to women in remote areas of Alaska--regardless \nof a woman's ability to pay.\n  Now, the Center uses a small portable mammography unit which can be \nflown to remote areas of Alaska, offering women in the most rural of \nareas easy access to mammographies at no cost. Additionally, the Center \nuses a 43-foot-long, 14-foot-high and 26,000-pound mobile mammography \nvan to travel through rural areas of Alaska. The van makes regular \ntrips, usually by river barge, to remote areas in Interior Alaska such \nas Tanana.\n  Julie Roberts, a 42-year-old woman of Tanana, who receives regular \nmammographies from the mobile mammography van, knows the importance of \nearly screening:\n\n       There's a lot of cancer here (in Tanana)--a lot of cancer. \n     That's why it's important to have the mobile van here . . . I \n     know that if I get checked, I can catch it early and can \n     probably save my life. I have three children and I want to \n     see my grandchildren.\n\n  I am proud to say that the Fairbanks Center now serves about 2,200 \nwomen a year and has provided screenings to more than 25,000 Alaska \nwomen in 81 villages throughout the state. To help fund the efforts of \nthe Fairbanks Center, each year Nancy and I sponsor a fishing \ntournament to raise money for the operation of the van and mobile \nmammography unit. After just three years, donations from the tournament \nhave totalled $830,000.\n  Mr. President, Nancy and I are committed to raising more funds for \nthis important program so that every women in Alaska can benefit from \nthe advances of modern technology and reduce their risk of facing this \nkiller disease.\n  The importance of mammography and screening cannot be stressed \nenough--however, there has long been a tragic result of the disease \nthat Congress has either ignored or failed to recognize--and that is \nthe so-called ``drive-through'' mastectomy.\n\n[[Page S4650]]\n\n  Currently victims of breast cancer who receive mastectomies are being \nforced to get out of their surgery bed and vacate the hospital only \nhours after their surgery. The reason? Because far too often it is the \npractice of insurance companies to treat the procedure of a mastectomy \nas merely an ``out-patient service.''\n  Here's the horror that many insurance companies cause:\n  Nancy Couchot, a 60-year-old woman had a radical mastectomy at 11:30 \na.m. She was released from the hospital only hours later at 4:30 p.m.--\neven though she was not able to walk or use the rest room without \nassistance.\n  Victoria Berck, had a mastectomy and lymph node removal at 7:30 a.m. \nand was released at 2:30 p.m. She was given instructions on how to \nempty two drains attached to her body and sent home. Ms. Berck \nconcludes, ``No civilized country in the world has a mastectomy as an \nout-patient service.''\n  Mr. President that is why I am proud to co-sponsor of S. 249, the \nWomen's Health and Cancer Rights Act. This bill would put an end to the \ndrive-through mastectomies.\n  Specifically, the Act will require health insurance companies to \nallow physicians to determine the length of a mastectomy patient's \nhospital stay according to medical necessity. In other words, the bill \nmakes it illegal to punish a doctor for following good medical judgment \nand sound medical treatment.\n  Another important provision of this bill ensures that mastectomy \npatients will have access to reconstructive surgery. Scores of women \nhave been denied reconstructive surgery following mastectomies because \ninsurers have deemed the procedure to be ``cosmetic'' and, therefore, \nnot medically necessary.\n  Mr. President, far too often breast cancer victims, who believe that \nthey have adequate health care coverage, become horrified when the \nlearn that reconstruction is not covered in their health plan.\n  In Alaska, the problem is even more tragic. Of the 324 mastectomies \nand lumpectomies performed in Alaska in 1996, reconstruction only \noccurred on 11 of the patients. That means that only 3.4% of women who \nhave their breast removed have reconstructive surgery, compared to the \nnational average of 23 percent.\n  The simple reason for this tragically low figure is simple: women \ncan't afford the procedure.\n  Breast reconstruction costs average about $5,000 for just the \nprocedure. If hospital, physician and other costs are included--the \ncost averages around $15,000.\n  Dr. Sarah Troxel, of Providence hospital in Anchorage, states the \nimportance of reconstruction:\n\n       Women who are not able to receive reconstructive surgery \n     suffer from depression, a sense of loss, and need more cancer \n     survivor counseling . . . Additionally, reconstructive \n     surgery can be preventative medicine--women who don't have \n     reconstructive surgery often develop back problems and other \n     difficulties.\n\n  Mr. President, insurance companies commonly provide reconstructive \nsurgery for other types of cancers that alter or disfigure the surface \nof the skin--such as melanomas and all skin cancers.\n  Here is why federal legislation is needed: Thirty-four states, \nincluding Alaska have no state law requiring breast reconstruction \nafter surgery. And in addition, 70 million Americans receive health \nbenefits through federally regulated self-funded ERISA plans which are \nnot covered by state insurance requirements.\n  These issues are not partisan issues. We may have our differences \nregarding managing and financing health reform, but I think we all \nendorse accessible and affordable health care that preserves patient \nchoice and physician discretion. Cancer does not look to see the \npolitics of its victims.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to support the efforts of my \ngood friend Senator D'Amato in his efforts to assure that women who \nneed surgery for breast cancer will be able to do so in the hospital if \nthat's what they desire.\n  I'm disturbed by the recent trend that takes choice away from \npatients and their doctors in the name of cost savings.\n  There are some things we just can't sacrifice. Patient's rights to \nseek care from specialty doctors and have access to cherished healers \nis a basic right we need to protect.\n  Breast cancer is a traumatic enough experience for a woman and her \nfamily to suffer through. These families need our help in gaining as \nmuch support from our medical care system as they can get to bring them \nthrough this terrible time in their lives.\n  This bill is simple. It simply guarantees a woman's right to a proper \nlength of time in the hospital following her surgery. It guarantees the \nright to have a complete reconstruction of her breast to restore her \nbody and sense of self-esteem.\n  The bill gives every person diagnosed with cancer the right to a \nsecond opinion, and would direct the HMO to pay for this second \nopinion. Also, the bill directs HMO's to pay for a specialist even if \nthat doctor happens to be outside the plan.\n  Lastly, and most importantly, this bill prohibits HMO's from paying \ndoctors to reduce or limit their patient care.\n  This is managed care's dirty little secret. They pay doctors to limit \nthe time spent with their patients and pay doctors not to provide care.\n  I've heard from many, many, many constituents and doctors who are \nfrustrated with this situation. If a doctor needs to spend time with a \npatient--time essential to healing--if a woman needs to be supported as \nshe decides what to do for her breast cancer, I say give them all the \ntime they need!\n  I rise to support Senator D'Amato's bill today. We need to support \nour doctors and our women and their families.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I believe my colleague from California \nhas a question.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I have a question for the author, the \nSenator from New York. I believe this bill has strong support and a low \ncost. Its cause is just and correct, and it would be passed by this \nbody overwhelmingly. When might we expect a vote on this bill?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I am glad my colleague raised that \nquestion. Let me say this: It is disingenuous to say that the women of \nAmerica are being denied proper health care here when something so \nbasic and elementary is being tied up by procedures. That is exactly \nwhat is taking place. This legislation would stop the kind of abuse we \nsee taking place every day. I have women calling and saying they are \nbeing denied reconstructive surgery, being denied the kind of health \ncare that everybody agrees on. We have found a methodology of paying \nfor this, and it is not right to tie it to something so comprehensive \nand say, ``unless we get this one, we are not going to get the other.''\n  The women of America are being denied this. I intend to hold hostage, \nwith my colleagues, important legislation that moves through until we \nget a vote on this--whether it is on a defense bill, a tobacco bill, \nappropriations bills. When we come down to the floor and--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President. By \nunanimous consent, yesterday, we were supposed to come up with the \nresearch bill at 11 o'clock. We are up against kind of a time problem \nhere. I would like to have some idea as to how soon that will happen. I \nsee the chairman of the Agriculture Committee is here. We are here to \nbegin our debate. I wonder how much longer can we expect to wait.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I will withdraw my request and ask that I \nbe given just 2 minutes, because I have yielded more time to more \npeople. I want to set the stage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the Senator's request?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. For 2 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. No.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, let me say that we have been thwarted \ntime and time again, procedurally--by both sides, I might say. But now \nI find what\n\n[[Page S4651]]\n\ntook place today absolutely horrendous.\n  Again, it is disingenuous to suggest that we would have to consider \nboth when one is so clear cut, and the need is so necessary, and women \nare being denied. That is what is going on here. It is wrong. So when \nwe have a bill that is going to be acted on, I will come to the floor--\nI hope with a number of my colleagues--to offer this legislation as an \namendment and get a vote. Let the people of America see this. The \npeople are going to be so full of pride that we will not allow \nsomething that is so obviously necessary that they are going to hold it \nhostage, because that is what is taking place with this legislation. It \nhas been held hostage, and it is disingenuous to come down here and say \nyou have to take this great big piece of legislation or we can't even \nlet the women of America have freedom from the fear that they will be \ndenied that which they should have--reconstructive surgery and to stay \nin the hospital until their doctor says now is the time to go home, not \na bean counter, someone who limits you to 24 or 48 hours.\n\n  I hope my colleagues will join with me in this endeavor, making it a \nbipartisan fight to see that the women and families of America get \njustice.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I certainly will. I thank the Senator \nfor his leadership and commitment to this issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/12/senate-section/article/S4644-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4651-S4659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  AGRICULTURE RESEARCH, EXTENSION, AND EDUCATION REFORM ACT OF 1998--\n                           CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the conference report.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the House to the bill (S. \n     1150), have agreed to recommend and do recommend to their \n     respective Houses this report, signed by all of the \n     conferees.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of April 22, 1998.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIndiana is recognized to speak for up to 30 minutes.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I will consume much of my time at this \njuncture, reserve the balance, and yield to other colleagues.\n  I am very pleased that the Senate is now prepared to debate the \nconference report on S. 1150, the Agriculture Research, Extension and \nEducation Reform Act of 1998.\n  I thank especially Senator Tom Harkin, the ranking minority member of \nthe committee, and all committee members for their efforts to work \ntogether to fashion legislation to garner the support of 74 Senators \nand a large host of agricultural, nutrition and religious \norganizations.\n  I point out that we had a good conference with our House colleagues. \nThis is complex legislation. This is not the first time the Congress \nhas had a conference report. It is usual, at least in matters of this \nvariety, for the report to attract less attention. But ours is \nimportant. And I appreciate this opportunity to highlight that \nimportance this morning.\n  Our initiatives will help farmers in this country to produce food for \nthe world's people and to do so at a profit while guarding the \nenvironment of this country and the world. S. 1150 also resolves a \nfunding crisis for the Federal Crop Insurance Program, preventing the \nloss of coverage for farmers in every State. The bill extends an \nimportant initiative from the 1996 farm bill that provides resources \nfor rural development and research priorities. And, finally, S. 1150 \nallows food stamp benefits to be provided to limited groups of the \ndisabled, the elderly, political refugees, and children who immigrated \nto this country legally.\n  Many of our colleagues have called for dramatic increases in funding \nfor Federal scientific research. This advocacy is altogether \nappropriate. Unfortunately, agricultural research has received much \nless attention. Funding has declined in real terms for some years, and \nMr. President, has declined in some areas to a point that we are no \nlonger prepared to resist some of the insect and other disease pests \nthat endanger our food supply.\n  It took visionaries like Nobel Peace Prize winner Dr. Norman Borlaug \nwho came before our committee and eloquently pointed out how \nagricultural research is the future of mankind. It is the basis upon \nwhich mankind will be able to persist by the year 2050. Millions of \npeople are now alive who would have died from malnutrition had it not \nbeen for the food productivity gains from people like Dr. Borlaug, and \nthe thousands of other scientists. Whether it is through the ``Green \nRevolution'' of the 1960s, or today's biotechnology, researchers have \nfound ways to coax more food from each acre, tapping more fully the \npotential of plant and animal food sources.\n  Further gains in output are not only possible but they are essential \nif the food needs of the 21st century are to be met. An increasing \nworld population with rising incomes will require more and better food, \nfeed and fiber. It is estimated, as a matter of fact, that their demand \nwill be three times the demand for food which we now have in this year.\n  Not every farm around the globe is well suited for food production. \nWe have an interest in avoiding the further deforestation and the \nexploitation of rain forests around the world and other sensitive \necosystems that will be farmed only at a terrible environmental price. \nProduction must be trimmed in areas most appropriate for agriculture \nsuch as the United States.\n  An important part of the answer to this global crisis is our bill, S. \n1150. It devotes $600 million over the next 5 years in mandatory \nfunding to the initiative for future agriculture and food systems. \nThese funds will be competitively awarded to scientists who will \nundertake cutting-edge research in priority areas such as genome \nstudies, biotechnology, precision agriculture, and other critical \nfields of work. The new funds will augment the $1.8 billion existing \nannual budget for research within the Department of Agriculture.\n\n  To make certain the existing budget is spent in the most efficient \nway, S. 1150 also makes a number of reforms to the Nation's research \nand extension statutes. These reforms will establish benchmarks and set \nnew requirements for coordination of work among universities, placing \nnew emphasis on activities that cut across several disciplines, involve \nmultiple institutions, and integrate research with public dissemination \nof those results.\n  S. 1150 will provide $200 million per year in mandatory spending to \ncontinue fully funding the Federal Crop Insurance Program. These funds, \nwhich under current law would need to be appropriated from \ndiscretionary accounts, are an integral part of the agreement between \nprivate insurers and the Agriculture Department that allows affordable \ncrop insurance to be afforded to the Nation's farmers. Current caps on \ndiscretionary spending do not take these expenses into account. \nTherefore, if the conference report is not approved soon, Congress will \neither search for discretionary accounts in USDA and other agencies \nthat can be sacrificed to provide the crop insurance funding, or, \nfailing that, contemplate the prospect of insurance policies being \ncanceled for thousands of farmers who annually face the uncertainty of \nhow the weather will affect their crops.\n  S. 1150 offsets about half of these crop insurance costs. For the \nremaining half, the conferees found reforms and spending cuts within \nthe Crop Insurance Program itself that saved the requisite amount of \nmoney. These cuts, such as reducing the level of reimbursement provided \nfor companies' administrative costs, set the stage for further reform \nand improvement of the crop insurance system in the future.\n  The conference report also provides for $100 million in new funding \nfor Funds for Rural America, recognizing the pressing needs of those in \nrural areas and working to improve the quality of life for those living \nin rural America.\n  The conference report restores food stamp benefits to about 250,000 \nlegal immigrants who otherwise would be ineligible for this portion of \nthe Nation's safety net. Generally, the categories of immigrants \ncovered by S. 1150 correspond to those who last year regained access to \nthe Supplemental Security Income--the SSI Program--under separate \nlegislation; namely, the\n\n[[Page S4652]]\n\nbalanced budget amendment. These immigrants, the elderly, the disabled, \npolitical refugees, and seekers of asylum, were either in the United \nStates legally before the passage of the historic 1996 welfare reform \nlaw--and that is the case for the elderly, the children, and the \ndisabled--or in the case of asylees and refugees, were subject to \npolitical persecution for other circumstances that makes their \nresidence here less than fully voluntary. In addition, immigrant \nchildren under 18 who were in the United States legally before the \npassage of welfare reform will also become eligible. There was no \ncorresponding restoration of SSI benefits last year since children are \ngenerally not eligible for SSI.\n  Senate bill 1150 fully offsets all costs. It reduces expenditure of \nmandatory funds for computer acquisition by USDA, a practice generally \nnot available to other departments or even to most agencies within \nUSDA. The bill scales back some recent increases in employment and \ntraining funds within the Food Stamp Program.\n  Finally, the bulk of savings in S. 1150 are achieved by correcting an \nunintentional provision in the welfare reform law which would otherwise \nallow States to be paid twice for the same administrative costs of \nproviding food stamp benefits determining eligibility and performing \nother such functions.\n  S. 1150 is the result of lengthy negotiations, careful thought, and \ndedicated work. It will help our Nation increase its food supply at a \nprofit to our farmers. The bill shores up the crop insurance system in \na timely way, allowing producers to manage risks intelligently. It \ngives access to the Food Stamp Program to vulnerable individuals who \nreside in this country legally.\n  A large coalition of organizations who support this conference report \nare actively seeking Senate passage. Commodity groups, bankers, those \ninvolved in the crop insurance industry, scientific societies, and \nnutrition advocates, religious organizations, and 67 land grant \ncolleges and universities have voiced their support for this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate that many Senators who have written in \nfavor of this legislation by petition or through individual letters to \nthe majority leader have indicated strong support for all of these \nprovisions. But obviously there are Senators--and we shall have a \ndebate this afternoon on the specific question of refugees and asylees \nand food stamps for these persons as legal immigrants.\n  Let me dwell for just a moment on the particulars of that issue.\n  Refugees are immigrants whom the State Department has permitted to \nenter the United States for the purpose of escaping persecution in \ntheir home country based upon their political or religious beliefs.\n  I want to underline that, Mr. President. These are not persons \nseeking access to our country illegally, coming across the Rio Grande \nor the Canadian border or some other nefarious way. They are persons \nwho, by definition, the State Department--and by direction of the \nPresident, working with the Judiciary Committees of Congress--has \npermitted to enter because they are being persecuted for their \nreligious beliefs. Asylees are immigrants who meet the same standards \nas refugees except they have made it to the United States on their own \nand applied for permission to stay to avoid having to return to a \ndangerous situation of jeopardy in their country of origin.\n  It is not easy to gain either category status. In order to gain \nadmission as a refugee or asylee, someone ordinarily must show that he \nor she has ``a well-founded fear of persecution in his or her own \ncountry of origin.'' The mere fact the would-be immigrant's native \ncountry is repressive or enmeshed in civil war is insufficient to \nsupport application for refugee or asylum status. The applicant must be \nable to show individually that he or she is specifically and personally \nat risk. Many people who have not been able to satisfy this strict \nstandard have been imprisoned or killed by oppressive regimes as they \nwent back, sadly enough. The casualty list of those who failed the test \nindividually, a very rigid test, is very long and death occurred to \nmany of these people as they were forced to return.\n  Now, a somewhat more lenient standard currently exists for applicants \nfrom Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia and for Jews and Evangelical \nChristians from the former Soviet Union. Under the Lautenberg \namendment, these persons must only show that they have a ``credible \nbasis'' for their fear of persecution in their homeland. The Lautenberg \namendment liberalized the ability of persons from these countries to \nseek refugee status, but it is scheduled to expire at the end of the \ncurrent fiscal year.\n  Although some Members may wish to extend this amendment, CBO has said \nan extension would have a cost. But I point out that even as we discuss \nthis conference report today, the House of Representatives is about to \ntake up a religious liberty and freedom situation. In the Foreign \nRelations Committee, we will have a hearing on the very same subject \ntoday. And I would just say that those who are rigorous in rooting out \nfood stamps need to consider Jews and Evangelical Christians. \nSpecifically, we are talking about those in other fora. We don't need \nto talk about them in the Chamber. And these are very important issues, \nleaving aside ag research, crop insurance, and whatever brought us to \nthis point.\n  Now, the overwhelming majority of refugees come from just a handful \nof countries, and I want to go through these specifically. Communist \ncountries: Vietnam, Cuba, Laos; countries making difficult, often \nviolent, transitions: The former Soviet Union and Bosnia; brutal \nauthoritarian regimes: Iraq and Iran; and countries where Christians \nare persecuted for their beliefs: Parts of the former Soviet Union and \nSudan; or Somalia where the central government is dissolved and the \nland is ruled by myriad petty warlords.\n  In recognition of the difficult circumstances of their departure from \ntheir home countries and their lack of sponsors in the United States, \nthe Immigration and Nationality Act does not require refugees and \nasylees to refrain from becoming public charges here. Indeed, a \nspecific program of cash and medical assistance is authorized to \nsupport newly arrived refugees. Limited appropriations have forced this \nprogram to serve only as an adjunct to the basic Federal benefit \nprograms such as Medicaid and food stamps.\n\n  As I mentioned before, the agricultural research conference report, \none in which we are involved, did not make all of this up from scratch. \nWe simply have adopted precisely the sections of last year's Balanced \nBudget Act on which we all voted, and at that time at least there was a \nrecognition that people who are in these difficult straits really ought \nto be treated in a humane manner. Among the provisions of the Balanced \nBudget Act that the ag research bill would apply to food stamps--and we \nhave already adopted it once before--is a 2-year extension, from 5 \nyears to 7 years, of the eligibility for benefits of refugees and \nasylees for the food stamp situation.\n  The 1996 welfare law set the exemption for refugees and asylees at 5 \nyears to correspond roughly with the earliest date that most refugees \nand asylees can apply. So, Mr. President, we philosophically already \nhave crossed that bridge in the Welfare Act quite apart from the \nBalanced Budget Act--refugees, the same people, asylees, 5 years. The \nargument is whether that 5 years should become 7 years; it is not \nwhether we should be paying these refugees and asylees support in a \nhumane way.\n  Most refugees and asylees cannot apply to naturalize until they have \nbeen in our country for 4 years and 9 months. That limit soon proved \nunrealistic because of long, long backlogs in Immigration Service \nprocessing and adjudication of applications to naturalize and in \nswearing in successful applicants--no fault of the refugees and the \nasylees, Mr. President, an administrative hassle at INS. In a number of \nINS offices, the backlog exceeds 2 years. If a refugee's and asylee's \neligibility ended after only 5 years in our country, they could be left \nwithout recourse while their applications to naturalize are in the INS \npipeline.\n  The extension of their eligibility for SSI and Medicaid to allow them \nto receive benefits during their first 7 years in the country was not \ncontroversial last year. It was included in all major Republican and \nDemocratic proposals for legal immigrants. I repeat that--all \nDemocratic and Republican proposals. The change was not made applicable \nto food stamps technically, because the money for restoring benefits to \nimmigrants was allocated to the Finance\n\n[[Page S4653]]\n\nCommittee and the Agriculture Committee has jurisdiction over food \nstamps, and on that basis a change that clearly would have \nautomatically flowed did not occur.\n  Finally, Mr. President, it should be noted that this provision does \nnot assure refugees and asylees of receiving 7 years of benefits; it \nonly exempts them from the new restrictions on legal immigrants' \neligibility during their first 7 years. Refugees and asylees will still \nhave to meet all the criteria for everyone else in America to qualify \nfor the benefits. Even refugees and asylees who are self-sufficient for \nmuch of their first 7 years in the country will lose the benefit of \nthat exemption after 7 years. They cannot carry it over in terms of \nmonths of eligibility beyond the 7-year time. By conforming food stamp \nrules to those already adopted for Medicaid last summer, the ag \nresearch bill will avoid imposing multiple inconsistent eligibility \nrules on State and local agencies that finally have the responsibility \nto administer all of this.\n  The number of refugees entering the country is controlled primarily \nby ceilings--ceilings, Mr. President--adopted by the President each \nyear in consultation with the Judiciary Committees prior to the \nbeginning of each fiscal year. These ceilings have been declining and \nare expected to decline to reflect generally improved world conditions \nsince the collapse of the former Soviet Union. For example, in fiscal \nyear 1992, some 114,000 refugees were admitted under the quotas. But by \n1996, this number had declined to just under 75,000.\n  In fiscal year 2000 and thereafter, CBO now estimates the annual \nquota will be 65,000; approximately 15,000 additional people are \ngranted asylum each year. So, Mr. President, this is a total of 80,000 \npersons--or 90,000, as of 1996.\n  Each year, many more people apply for admission as refugees than can \nbe accommodated under the quotas. Thus, an increase of immigrants \nseeking admission as refugees would not increase the number admitted; \nit would merely swell the backlog and the waiting lists. The only \nsignificant exception to these quotas is Cubans escaping Castro's \nregime and admitted under the Cuban Entrant Program. That number has \nfluctuated in recent years from a low of 3,000 in 1991 to a high of \n19,000 in 1996.\n  The number of refugees and asylees coming to the United States is \ncontrolled by Congress and the administration. The major current \nexample of this, as I pointed out, an exception, is the Lautenberg \namendment, which allows the southeast Asians, Jews, and Evangelical \nChristians to gain admission as refugees under more lenient rules than \nthose applied to other applicants. CBO has concluded enactment and \nrepeated extension of this provision has prompted the administration to \nincrease the quota on the number of refugees admitted, and a further \nextension is likely to cause the administration to raise the refugee \nquotas by about 18,000 per year.\n  The number of refugees admitted in the early 1990s as described above \nincludes refugees admitted under the Lautenberg amendment. CBO \nestimates the increased number admitted will increase Federal costs for \nmeans-tested programs, but three-quarters of the cost will come in the \nMedicaid and SSI Program.\n  Let me point out, Mr. President, and there is no way that Members \nwould know this without the research of our committee, but it is \nunlikely that the modest amounts of money available in the food stamp \nbenefits would make, under any circumstances, coming to America more \nappealing for prospective refugees. The average monthly food stamp \nbenefit for these persons will be under $72 per month, less than one-\nfifth of the SSI benefit, which is now estimated by CBO as roughly $411 \nper month. It is estimated the fiscal cost of the refugee situation \nwill be $50 million a year.\n  I conclude this part of the argument by saying the distinguished \noccupant of the Chair, as chair of the House Agriculture Committee, and \nI, worked together on a farm bill which, in conjunction with welfare \nreform, cut food stamp costs by roughly $24 billion. There are many in \nthe Finance Committee who deserve great credit for rearranging the \ncircumstances of welfare. But when it comes to significant changes in \nthe cost of welfare in this country, significant reform of food stamps, \nthere are no persons, in my judgment, better able to address this \nproblem than the distinguished occupant of the Chair and myself. We \nwere there. That was the bill that created the entire framework for \nsavings under welfare reform, created the entire framework for \nfairness, for oversight.\n  I think that simply needs to be said, at a time when we are talking \nabout, at most, 80,000 persons escaping persecution, and as to whether \nthey should be given an extension of 2 more years due to INS hassles \nand administration, to become citizens. I think that is a very serious \npoint.\n  Finally, some have raised the question that this is an entitlement \nprogram. I point out that the proposals we are making do not entitle \nanyone to anything. Essentially, we have several multiyear proposals in \nthe farm bill of 1996. They include the Conservation Reserve Program. \nThey include payments, annually, to farmers who are now leaving various \ncrops, or maybe farming altogether, as the case may be, but without \nregard to planting. In essence, for years we have adopted multiyear \nprograms in farm bills because it was the preference of the Congress \nnot to return to agricultural legislation annually. We are, in this \nbill, mandating that for 5 years we should do something very important, \nat the rate of $120 million per year, and that is try to find out, if \nwe can, how to triple our food supply so our acres are more productive, \nour farmers are more productive, and so the rest of the world will not \nstarve.\n\n  I believe that is a very important undertaking. I hope all Senators \nwill see the wisdom of this and support this humane and farsighted \nmeasure.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nTexas, Mr. Gramm, is recognized to speak for up to 10 minutes.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the pending \nconference report. At 2:15, I will be recognized to offer a motion to \nrecommit. What I would like to do in my limited time today is sort of \noutline how a good bill goes bad through the legislative process.\n  We passed, in the Senate, a bill funding ag research. The House \npassed a bill funding ag research. These were not controversial \nmatters, although the method of funding the Senate bill was to some \ndegree controversial. But what happened is when the two Houses met, a \nsimple bill to fund ag research for $517 million suddenly became a $1.9 \nbillion program. Three brand new mandatory, or entitlement, programs--\ndepending on which term you prefer--were created, and suddenly we are \nvoting in a conference report which is technically unamendable on \nprovisions that were never voted in either House of Congress.\n  One of my predecessors, Lyndon Johnson, used to say, ``I deeply \nresent a deal that I'm not part of.'' And I understand how these things \nhappen, but I simply want to talk about the problems with this bill and \nfocus on the big problem with the bill, which is related to overturning \nwelfare reform.\n  Going back to where we started, we had an ag research bill in the \nHouse, we had an ag research bill in the Senate. We went to conference, \nand we ended up with a bill that funds crop insurance, which was in \nneither original bill, and not only funds it but, for the first time \never, makes it a mandatory program which Congress will not vote on \nagain, funding will be automatic over the next 5 years as a result of \nthis program.\n  The original bill had no hint of food stamps in it. The issue was \nnever debated. I do not believe that a similar provision, if brought to \nthe floor of the Senate under our rules for full debate, could have \npossibly passed. And, yet, in a simple bill on ag research, we now have \n$818 million of funding for food stamps. All of these food stamps go to \nimmigrants who have come to the country and who now have legal status. \nWe had, through the welfare reform bill, eliminated these benefits in a \nbill which passed both Houses of Congress overwhelmingly and, by the \nway, is, in terms of the public's mind, the most popular bill that we \nhave passed in the\n\n[[Page S4654]]\n\nlast 3 years. This bill, in a provision that was voted on in neither \nHouse of Congress, overturns a substantial portion of our welfare \nreform bill and gives $818 million of food stamps to immigrants.\n  The bill also sets up a brand new funding mechanism for the Fund for \nRural America and provides a $100 million entitlement, which spends out \nvery slowly, but it ultimately spends out every penny of $100 million. \nSo we now have four entitlement programs in a simple bill that set out \nto fund ag research. And every program that becomes an entitlement, \nsince we are under a spending cap on discretionary spending--every \npenny that would have been spent on these programs is now free to spend \non other programs. So, in addition to creating four new entitlement \nprograms, we have, in this bill, broken our commitment to limit the \ngrowth of discretionary spending, because we have taken discretionary \nprograms and funded them as entitlements, so that now new spending can \noccur in the discretionary area.\n  The biggest problem with the bill is it puts a great big neon sign on \nthe border of the United States of America, and the neon sign says: \n``Come to America and get welfare. We have a welfare office on every \ncorner.'' That is the biggest problem with this bill.\n  I remind my colleagues that when a Member of the minority tried to \nreduce the level of immigration, I helped lead the effort to kill \nlimiting legal immigration. I believe in legal immigration. I do not \nbelieve America is full. I don't want to tear down the Statue of \nLiberty. The story of the immigrant is the story of America, and I \ndon't think that story is finished telling. I believe that we need to \nlet people with a new vision and new energy come to America as long as \nthey don't violate our laws and they come legally, but I want them to \ncome with their sleeves rolled up ready to go to work, rather than with \ntheir hands held out going on welfare.\n  I will offer a motion to recommit with instructions at 2:15 p.m. That \nis a very simple motion. All it says is one little provision in this \nbill, which I think is a relatively minor cost, because we are scoring \nthe bill over 5 years, but it is clearly the most destructive element \nin this bill, and that is we have an element in this bill that says \nthat no matter how far in the future you come to America, if you come \n75 or 100 years from now, under the provisions of this bill, if you \ncome as a refugee, you can get food stamps for 7 years. That is a new \nprovision of law in place in this conference report.\n  It is a provision where we are moving in exactly the opposite \ndirection of the welfare reform bill, and we now make it permanent law \nthat anyone who comes to America in the future as a refugee can be \nguaranteed they are going to be able to apply for and get almost \nimmediately 7 years of food stamps.\n  Now, look, my concern is adverse selection. My concern is that we are \ngoing to be attracting people to come to America to go on welfare. I \nthink it is a destructive policy to have active enticements to draw \npeople to America for the purpose of going on welfare rather than for \nthe purpose of going to work.\n  I don't have any doubt that this provision will affect the decision \nof people to come to America to try to live off the fruits of someone \nelse's labor. There are millions of people who go to bed every night \ndreaming the American dream. They want to come to America. They want to \nshare what we have shared. Many Members of the Senate are Members whose \ngrandfathers and grandmothers or great grandfathers and great \ngrandmothers came to America looking for opportunity. I don't believe \nthat process should end. But I think it is suicidal for a nation to set \nup procedures that attract people to come to its shores, not with a \ndream of opportunity, not with a dream of achievement, but with a dream \nof benefiting from the fruits of someone else's labor.\n  My wife's grandfather came to this country from Korea. He didn't know \nthe language. He didn't know a single soul here. He certainly did not \ncome here looking for welfare or food stamps. He came here looking for \nopportunity and freedom, and he found both.\n  From the period of the Civil War to the turn of the century, we had \n20 million people come to America, most of them desperately poor. But \nthey came here with willing hands and willing hearts, they rolled up \ntheir sleeves, and they built a great nation in the process.\n  My strong objection to the provisions in this bill really boils down \nto a series of things: Should we be creating four new permanent, \nmandatory entitlement programs? I say no. And secondly, should we be \nchanging the law to say to people all over the world, ``Come to America \nand we will give you 7 years of food stamps\"? I want people to come to \nAmerica, but I want them to come to work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lugar). The time of the Senator from Texas \nhas expired.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 10 minutes under the previous \norder.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I was trying to listen to the remarks of \nthe Senator from Texas. It is hard to know where to begin to correct \nthe mistakes that he made in his statements because there were so many.\n  First of all, I say to the Senator from Texas that this was not a \n$500 million bill when it started. As a matter of fact, when it passed \nthe Senate, it was a $1.3 billion bill and, in fact, it passed \nunanimously, so the Senator from Texas obviously voted for it.\n  Secondly, I also point out that crop insurance has always been a \nmandatory program--always. In 1996, a small portion of it was made \ndiscretionary, but the basis of crop insurance has always been \nmandatory. So this is not some change in that program.\n  Thirdly, I tell the Senator from Texas that food stamps has always \nbeen a part of this bill. It was a part of this bill when it passed our \ncommittee, and it was a part of the bill when it passed the Senate. \nFood stamps was used as an offset to pay for the research portion of \nthe bill. So it was a part of the bill as an offset. The administration \nsaid if we are going to use it as an offset, we had to replace some of \nthe nutrition programs, which I will get to.\n  I also point out that the Senate-passed bill had nutrition provisions \nin it. It was not just a research bill, as the Senator from Texas has \nsaid. It had a provision in there to expand some child nutrition \nprograms with an expanded breakfast grant program. That was taken out \nin conference, but it was in the Senate-passed bill.\n  Lastly, I point out that in terms of the mandatory programs the \nSenator is talking about, the Fund for Rural America was part of the \nbill as passed in October, for which the Senator voted. It was in the \nbill at $300 million. Now it is only $100 million. So if the Senator \nfrom Texas supported it at $300 million, he shouldn't be too upset that \nit is now at $100 million. I wanted to make those corrections in the \nRecord.\n  I made my opening statement yesterday on the bill itself in terms of \nthe important research and crop insurance provisions that are in it. \nAgain, I commend my chairman, Senator Lugar, for all of his hard work \nin getting the whole research program revamped and restructured to meet \nthe needs of the next century. Senator Lugar has been a leader in this \neffort. I was pleased to join him, and, again, I thank Senator Lugar \nfor his close cooperation and for working together to get a really good \nresearch bill passed.\n  I also commend Senator Lugar for his leadership in getting the \nnecessary wherewithal to extend our Crop Insurance Program for the next \n5 years. I daresay, without his strong leadership, we would not have \nthe provisions that our farmers could rely on for their crop insurance \nthis year.\n  Again, if, in fact, this motion to recommit is successful, that is \nthe end of this bill. Make no mistake about it, this is not just some \nmotion to recommit to change a little bit. This is a motion to recommit \nto kill this bill. If this goes back to conference, I don't know that \nthe votes are there to take out the food stamp provisions. Even if they \nare, it will never pass the House of Representatives, and certainly the \nSenator from Texas knows that. This is a careful compromise, a careful \nbalance that was worked out in this bill.\n  Let me get to the issue of the food stamps themselves. The Senator \nsays it is like putting a big neon sign out there, ``Come to \nAmerica.'' Well, let us take a look at that.\n\n[[Page S4655]]\n\n  What are we doing in this bill? What we are saying is that for \nrefugees and asylees from religious persecution and political \npersecution, who cannot exist in their homelands because they are going \nto be tortured or killed, we say to them that if you come to America \nunder a quota--we have a quota every year; not every refugee gets into \nthis country; we have a quota--but if you get in under that quota, \nright now as a refugee you are eligible for food stamps and Medicaid \nand SSI. You are eligible for food stamps for the first 5 years, but \nyou are not after that. And so what it says is that you can come in, \nyou can get Medicaid, you can get SSI for up to 7 years, but you cannot \nget food stamps after 5 years. As a refugee, it takes 4 years and 9 \nmonths to be able to apply for citizenship. We know that, because of \nthe backlog at INS, it takes at least 2 more years, maybe 3 years to \nget full citizenship.\n  Let me also point out something else. These food stamps are not \nautomatic. It does not mean because you are a refugee and you are here \nthat you get food stamps. No. You still have to meet the requirements, \nthe work requirements and the income requirements, to be able to \nqualify for food stamps like anyone else. So we are not talking about \nautomatic food stamps.\n  The 5-year period, the Senator is correct, was set in the welfare \nreform bill. But it did provide an exception for refugees and persons \ngranted asylum. They would be able to receive food stamps for 5 years.\n  In the Balanced Budget Act that we passed last year, we extended that \nfor the elderly, the disabled, and the children of legal immigrants who \nwere here in 1996. And then we looked at what we did. We looked at the \n5-year period and said, this is unrealistic because a refugee who is \nhere, as I said, has to be here 4 years and 9 months--and it takes 3, \nsometimes 4 more years to become a citizen. And it is impossible for a \nrefugee to complete the citizenship process in less than 7 years.\n  As I said, the Balanced Budget Act last year provided that in the \ncase of Medicaid and SSI, refugees and asylees would be eligible to \nreceive benefits for up to 7 years if they qualify. Not automatic. \nThere is no neon sign. It says, if you qualify.\n  There was bipartisan agreement on this point. Food stamps were not \nincluded because that bill came out of the Finance Committee, and food \nstamps is not under the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee. They are \nunder the jurisdiction of the Agriculture Committee. And that is why we \nhad to fix it here.\n  Let me read from a letter from the Council of Jewish Federations that \ncame to our office just today asking that we oppose Senator Gramm's \nmotion. Let me just read one paragraph. It says:\n\n       The welfare law provided a 5 year exemption from the bar on \n     food stamps for refugees and asylees because Congress \n     acknowledged that these individuals typically come to the \n     U.S. with few, if any, resources. They have no sponsors to \n     rely on and may have difficulty working because of \n     disabilities. Those that can work may find that the training \n     and skills they gained in their home countries are inadequate \n     for most jobs here. As a result, many start in low paying \n     jobs [so] they need food stamps to get an adequate diet.\n\n  That is just it. These are refugees and asylees. They do not have \nsponsors. A lot of them come with a shirt on their back. Let me give \nyou one example. Mr. Wang Dan, the young Chinese man who we have all \nbeen reading about, who has now come to this country, came with a shirt \non his back. We know how he was persecuted and imprisoned in China. \nWhat this amendment says to Wang Dan is, OK, up to 5 years, if you fall \non hard times--you have to otherwise qualify; you do not automatically \nget food stamps--but otherwise if you fall on hard times, yes, you can \nget some food stamps. But after 5 years--you have worked here; you have \nworked hard; you have applied for citizenship; it is in the bill; you \nare going to become a citizen in 2 or 3 years--all of a sudden you lose \nyour job, you get sick, you fall on some hard times, sorry, no food \nstamps. Is that a neon sign? Not in any way. Not in any way.\n  That is why, Mr. President, we have this letter from the Council of \nJewish Federations, which I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record, and also a letter from John Cardinal O'Connor, Archbishop \nof New York, also asking us to support the restoration of food stamp \neligibility in this bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Council of Jewish Federations,\n\n                                       New York, NY, May 12, 1998.\n       Dear Senator: This morning, Senator Phil Gramm (R-TX) is \n     expected to offer a motion to recommit the Conference Report \n     on the Agriculture Research, Extension, and Education Reform \n     Act, S. 1150, with instructions to limit the provision \n     extending food stamps for asylees and refugees from 5 to 7 \n     years to only those individuals who were in the country prior \n     to August 22, 1996. On behalf of the Council of Jewish \n     Federations, I am asking that you oppose Senator Gramm's \n     motion.\n       Senator Gramm's motion would impose undue hardship on \n     people who have been forced to flee persecution in their \n     homelands. These are people who were persecuted, and in some \n     cases tortured, for their political or religious beliefs. In \n     their homelands, they were subjected to persecution ranging \n     from harassment to beatings and job loss to having their \n     homes burnt down. The U.S. has a long history of providing a \n     ``safe haven'' to refugees and asylees and Congress has \n     repeatedly stood up in support of this tradition.\n       The welfare law provided a 5 year exemption from the bar on \n     food stamps for refugees and asylees because Congress \n     acknowledged that these individuals typically come to the \n     U.S. with few, if any, resources. They have no sponsors to \n     rely on and may have difficulty working because of \n     disabilities. Those that can work may find that the training \n     and skills they gained in their home countries are inadequate \n     for most jobs here. As a result, many start in low paying \n     jobs where they need food stamps to get an adequate diet.\n       Congress set the exemption at 5 years to correspond roughly \n     with the earliest date that most refugees and asylees can \n     apply to become a U.S. citizen. This time-line has proven to \n     be unrealistic because of the backlog in processing \n     naturalization applications. In many INS offices, it may take \n     over 2 years from the date of application to a person's \n     naturalization ceremony. If refugees and asylees are left \n     without access to food stamps after 5 years, they would be \n     punished and left without any nutritional support because of \n     government inefficiency.\n       For these reasons, I again urge you to oppose Senator \n     Gramm's motion to recommit the S. 1150 to the conference \n     committee.\n       Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                   Diana Aviv,\n\n                                Associate Executive Vice President\n     for Public Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       Office of the Cardinal,\n\n                                     New York, NY, April 29, 1998.\n     Hon. Alfonse M. D'Amato,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator D'Amato: I write to request your support for \n     making legal immigrants once again eligible for food stamps \n     and restoring $818 million in Food Stamp benefits. This would \n     permit 250,000 children, elderly and disabled persons and \n     refugees to seek Food Stamp assistance if they are in need. I \n     am told that the provisions to do this are contained in the \n     conference Report on S. 1150/H.R. 2534, the Agriculture \n     Research, Extension and Education Reauthorization Act of \n     1997.\n       Since 1984, as Archbishop of New York, I have been \n     privileged to assist immigrants from almost every country in \n     the world. These many immigrants have enriched the Catholic \n     Church of New York and other churches, just as they have \n     enriched the New York metropolitan area. (In our Catholic \n     churches alone, every Sunday our Divine Services are held in \n     30 different languages.) From my own experience I know those \n     who migrate to the United States today are essentially no \n     different from our parents and grandparents who came to \n     America fifty or a hundred years ago. The vast majority of \n     immigrants are individuals who come to this country seeking \n     opportunity for themselves and their families. Unfortunately \n     some immigrants--just as those born in this country--fall on \n     hard times.\n       Under the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Act, legal \n     immigrants needing assistance to feed themselves are \n     ineligible for support from the very program their tax \n     dollars help fund. Many are now forced to find emergency and \n     unstable ways to feed themselves and their families. Catholic \n     Charities has been supporting an emergency ecumenical food \n     pantry in the Washington Heights section of New York City--\n     the home and hope of so many newly arriving Dominican \n     immigrants. During the past year, the number of those served \n     at this pantry has doubled--at least in part due to the \n     changes in the 1996 laws. While we try to treat those who \n     come to the pantry with dignity, the availability of food \n     stamps to tide people over the rough times is much more \n     dignified than having mothers and children line up in the \n     street at food pantries and soup kitchens.\n       I urge you to take this opportunity to ameliorate some of \n     the more severe impacts of that 1996 legislation by \n     supporting the restoration of food stamp eligibility for \n     legal immigrants.\n\n[[Page S4656]]\n\n       With gratitude for your consideration, and\n           Faithfully in Christ,\n                                           John Cardinal O'Connor,\n                                           Archbishop of New York.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is the fair and decent thing to do. Let us not kill \nthis bill because of doing the fair and decent thing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is now recognized, \nunder previous order, for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nconference report to the Agricultural Research, Extension, and \nEducation Act of 1998. I would like to associate myself with the \nremarks of the distinguished chairman. This is going to be the most \nimportant bill to be passed in the 105th Congress in relation to \nagriculture. I commend the chairman, the ranking member, and the \nmembers of the conference for their efforts in reaching what I consider \nto be a good and a very bipartisan bill.\n  This bill has been in the making for 2 years. Due to time constraints \nand the need to more thoroughly evaluate the future direction of \nagricultural research, these programs, the research programs, were not \ndealt with in the new farm bill back in 1996. But we promised our \nfarmers and our ranchers, all of us involved in agriculture, all of the \nland grant universities and consumers, that Congress would move to \ncomplete this important piece of the ag policy puzzle as soon as \npossible.\n  After 2 long years, we will soon vote to ``reform'' our agriculture \nresearch programs. We will not only vote to extend these programs and \ncommit funds to feed America, and a very troubled and hungry world, but \nto reform them as well to make them more competitive. We are also going \nto provide important funding for crop insurance and rural development \nand, yes, limited food stamp benefits to a specified group of legal \nimmigrants.\n  The distinguished chairman, the distinguished ranking minority \nmember, and the distinguished Senator from Texas have talked about that \nat length. I am going to try to briefly address the importance of \nfunding in each of these areas.\n  First of all, this bill provides $600 million in new funding for \nagriculture research. Why is that important? Mr. President, in the last \nseveral decades we have seen the population double in this world, and \nyet we continue to feed this country and, as I have said before, a \ntroubled and hungry world on the same amount of ground. That is a \nmodern miracle. People used to get peace prizes for that. And the main \nreason is agriculture research. When we passed that new farm bill, \nproducers were promised that funding would be provided to help develop \nnew crops, higher yields and stronger resistance to disease and pests.\n  In recent weeks, we have heard our colleagues from the northern \nplains discuss the problems caused by wheat scab. This bill provides \nfunding for research on fighting this disease that has ravaged the \nwheat crop in many areas of the northern plains.\n  Let us talk about food safety. We have heard an awful lot of comment \nin the press and concern--understandable concern--about E. coli. This \nbill provides funding for research on the implementation of the Hazard \nAnalysis and Critical Control Point Systems (HACCP). It addresses the \nproblem of E. coli.\n  The bill provides funding for important research into discovering and \nanalyzing trade barriers that prohibit the movement of U.S. ag products \non the world market. With the Asian flu today, and our markets \ndeclining, nothing could be more important. This research will provide \nimportant information to help us move toward these goals in regard to \nbecoming much more market oriented and competitive.\n  Let me talk about the environment. The one thing that agriculture can \ndo through precision agriculture is to contribute to being more and \nbetter stewards of the soil and the environment. Precision agriculture \nwill become one of the most important tools available to producers in \nthe future. It allows them to protect the environment by using \nsatellite technology to determine the proper rates of pesticide and \nfertilizer applications to the square foot. This has implications all \nover the world.\n  I am pleased also that this bill will provide important funding for \nthe Federal Crop Insurance Program. The Crop Insurance Program is \ncurrently facing a $200 million funding shortfall in each of the coming \n5 years.\n  Let me just say that this lack of funding is a ``train wreck'' \nwaiting to happen for American agriculture. Without full funding of \nthis program, farmers could face cancellation of hundreds of thousands \nof crop insurance policies. Let me repeat that. Hundreds of thousands \nof farmers, this spring, are facing the cancellation of their crop \ninsurance. That would be devastating.\n  Obviously, many farmers are required to maintain their crop insurance \ncoverage in order to obtain loans from their rural banks. Without crop \ninsurance policies backing these loans, many loans would be recalled, \nand it could send agriculture into a credit and financing crisis. \nFarmers and ranchers were also promised increased access to viable risk \nmanagement tools with the passage of the 1996 farm bill. Crop insurance \nranks at the top of the list of these important and necessary tools.\n  This bill provides approximately $500 million in new funding for crop \ninsurance over the next 5 years. It also makes internal changes in the \nprogram. This $1 billion in combined funding changes solves the funding \nshortfall in the program and ensures producers access to adequate crop \ninsurance.\n  Are all the changes made that we need to make in regard to crop \ninsurance? No. There are changes and reforms that are still needed in \nthe program. With the most important issue facing us--the funding \nshortfall--now solved, the chairman and I, Senator Kerrey, and others, \nin a bipartisan way, will confront this, and we will work to achieve \nthe needed crop insurance reform in the next session of Congress.\n  Rather than going into the food stamp issue, which the chairman has \naddressed, Senator Gramm expressed his concern, and the distinguished \nranking member, Senator Harkin, has addressed, I will go on and point \nout several other important facts in regard to this bill.\n  Well, let me say this in regard to food stamps. The very first thing \nwe did in the House Agriculture Committee 3 years ago, when we started \nto address the farm bill, was take up the issue of food stamps. That is \nthe first hearing we had. Billions and billions of dollars were being \nspent on food stamps--a program out of control and obviously in need of \nreform. Working with the distinguished chairman of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, and others, we had hearings. We exposed $3 \nbillion to $5 billion in fraud and abuse and organized crime in the \nprogram. We instilled reforms, and we saved $23 billion to $24 billion, \nplus $10 billion in regard to savings with the farm commodity programs. \nThere isn't any other segment of Government that has gone through that \nkind of savings. No member of any committee of this Senate or of the \nHouse previously has ever achieved those kinds of significant cuts and \nreform in the Food Stamp Program or any other program. So the chairman \nis right. We would like to think we know a little bit about it.\n  The 1996 welfare reforms eliminated benefits from 800,000 to 950,000 \nto illegal immigrants. I know that. This bill extends the benefits back \nto children, elderly, and the disabled who were in the country before \nAugust 22 of 1996. It also extends benefits to refugees and asylees who \nmay have entered after the August 22 date. Benefits will be returned to \napproximately 250,000 people--not 900,000, but 250,000 people. The \ntrend line is down in regard to refugees.\n  I point out that a refugee is defined as ``a person who is fleeing \nbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account \nof race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social \ngroup, or political opinion, and who is of special humanitarian concern \nto the United States.''\n  With all due respect, I don't think that is a beacon. I think they \nare fleeing, and I think it is certainly within the boundaries of the \nUnited States and what the Statue of Liberty is all about that we \nconsider that. There is a cap. Most of the European numbers are used \nlargely for Soviet, religious minorities, and Bosnians. The East Asian\n\n[[Page S4657]]\n\nnumbers are for former Vietnamese reeducation camp detainees, and \nLaotians. As I have indicated, these numbers are down. It has gone from \n100,000 in 1980 to 75,000 in 1998.\n\n  In closing, let me say this. This agriculture research bill and this \ncrop insurance bill will likely be the most important piece of \nlegislation we pass for our farmers and ranchers during the 105th \nCongress.\n  During the debate on the 1996 farm bill, we promised our farmers, \nranchers, and researchers, who depend on the markets, a more market-\noriented agriculture. We promised to get the Government out of our \ndecisionmaking, no longer do you put the seed in the ground as dictated \nby Washington. In return for less government support, we said we would \nprovide the research and the risk management tools. That was a promise. \nWe will endanger the significant reforms that we made in the new farm \nbill if this bill is not passed.\n  Let me make one other observation. The amendment by the distinguished \nSenator from Texas to recommit is, in fact, a killer amendment; $1.7 \nbillion in regards to the way that States are administering the \nprogram, based on the reform we passed, will disappear. We do not have \nthe money in the appropriations bill to pay for the research or the \ncrop insurance, and we will face an agriculture crisis.\n  Mr. President, during the debate on the 1996 Farm bill, we promised \nour farmers, ranchers, and researchers that we would pass this bill and \nprovide the tools needed to feed a troubled and hungry world. It is \nunconscionable that at a time when producers are facing low commodity \nprices, reduced international markets due to the Asian Crisis, and new \ncrop diseases, this bill has languished. The tools included in this \nbill allow producers and researchers to directly address these issues.\n  I applaud and thank the Chairman, ranking member, and the greater \nmajority of the members of the Agriculture Committee for their work on \nthis bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I urge my colleagues to oppose the motion to recommit \nand support the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the distinguished \nchairman of the Agriculture Committee, Senator Lugar from Indiana, and \nmy good friend from Kansas, the distinguished Senator who was formerly \nchairman of the House Agriculture Committee, in asking the Senate today \nto support this conference report.\n  Senators may remember that when the 1996 farm bill was written, it \nreauthorized agriculture research programs for only 1 year. There was \nincluded in the committee report a suggestion that there be a thorough \nreevaluation made by the committees of jurisdiction of the way the \nDepartment of Agriculture awarded grants to colleges and universities \naround the country and funded research programs at Agricultural \nResearch Service facilities. That study was undertaken throughout 1997. \nI think it began in March of last year. The committee held a series of \nhearings and reviewed suggestions and options for improving these \nprograms. This conference report is the product of that study and that \ncarefully developed improvement to the Agricultural Research Service \nprograms that are funded by the Department of Agriculture.\n  I am convinced that we will do a better job under this conference \nreport of identifying the priorities in production agriculture, in food \nproduction, and in management of our resources in agriculture than we \never have before under the way we were handling the funding of these \nprograms.\n  That is the driving force behind this conference report. The reason \nit is so important for the Senate to approve this conference report is \nthat it puts this in place now.\n  Mr. President, if that were all this legislation accomplished, some \nmay say that this legislation is unnecessary, but it does more. It also \nprovides $600 million over the next five years for new competitive \nagricultural research grants at federal laboratories and colleges and \nuniversities.\n\n  Our appropriations process is beginning at this point. We have the \njob of allocating, under the discretionary funding allocations that our \nappropriations subcommittee will receive, funds for these agriculture \nresearch programs. With the guidance of this legislation, it will be a \nmuch more coherent process and an orderly process, and I can't \ncontemplate what a mess we would be in if this conference report were \nnot agreed to.\n  Under current law, about $200 million of the delivery expenses for \ncatastrophic crop insurance must be provided annually in the \nagriculture appropriations bill. This legislation would provide full \nmandatory funding for those expenses over the next five years. This \nconversion from discretionary to mandatory spending will ensure that \nfarmers will not have to be concerned with the uncertainty of annual \nfunding bills and whether catastrophic crop insurance protection will \nbe available in the coming growing season.\n  In addition to the support this bill has from the agriculture \ncommunity, it also enjoys support from those interested in the \nprovisions which will bring parity between the Food Stamp Program and \nthe Supplemental Security Income Program for those immigrants legally \nresiding in the United States. This was an important component of the \ncompromise we reached with the House of Representatives.\n  This bill has received support from almost every sector of \nagriculture. I ask unanimous consent that a letter I received from over \n100 organizations, colleges and universities in support of the \nconference agreement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      May 4, 1998.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cochran: We are writing to ask you to vote \n     ``yes'' on the conference report for S. 1150, the \n     Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of \n     1998, when it is considered on the floor. This legislation \n     has succeeded in balancing several competing interests and \n     will help prepare the agriculture and food industries for the \n     challenges in the next Century.\n       This conference report addresses a number of issues that \n     are vitally important to producers, processors, and consumers \n     of food and fiber. The bill provides funding for agricultural \n     research and rural development programs. It provides funding \n     for crop insurance that otherwise will create a severe strain \n     on discretionary budget accounts. Finally, the legislation \n     restores food stamp benefits for some legal immigrants. These \n     funds are fully offset, and the bill is budget neutral.\n       The House and Senate Committees on Agriculture have worked \n     long and diligently developing this much needed legislation. \n     We believe they have done a remarkable job, and we thank them \n     for their accomplishments.\n       We respectfully request your assistance in passage of this \n     important legislation, Its impact on the future of our nation \n     will be significant.\n           Sincerely,\n       Alabama Farmers Federation.\n       American Farm Bureau Federation.\n       American

So, Mr. President, Senators should know it's very \nimportant that the conference report be adopted. It is a good \ncompromise between the Senate and the House. It involves other \nprovisions that have been discussed eloquently and forcefully by my \nfriends who have spoken before me. I urge the Senate to approve this \nconference report.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, when Congress passed the Personal \nResponsibility and Work Responsibility Reconciliation Act of 1996, it \nended public welfare for most aliens who had not worked to earn their \nbenefits.\n  The 1997 Balanced Budget Act reversed some of the provisions of that \nbill by reinstating eligibility for the Supplemental Security Income \n(SSI) program for disabled and elderly immigrants who were in the \ncountry before August 22, 1996, the day the omnibus welfare reform \npackage passed into law. But the act also reinstated SSI for immigrants \nwho were in the country as of August 22, 1996 and become disabled in \nthe future. The SSI program is fraught with fraud. According to the \nGeneral Accounting Office (GAO), the Social Security Administration \nsends out $27 billion in SSI checks annually. Approximately $4 billion \nin checks are sent out erroneously. Immigrants, who make up just 6 \npercent of the population, currently receive over half the cash \nbenefits from the SSI program.\n  The agriculture research bill we are debating today restores food \nstamp eligibility for the elderly and the disabled, and for children, \nas long as they were in the United States before August 22, 1996. But, \nthe agriculture research bill also includes the restoration of food \nstamp benefits for all immigrants who were in the country as of August \n22, 1996, but who become disabled in the future. The Congress is going \nto spend approximately $800 million to restore all of these benefits. \nThe food stamp program, like the SSI program, does not require that an \nindividual have contributed to the Social Security base. And, the food \nstamp program is also susceptible to fraud and abuse--in a just \nreleased GAO report, it is estimated that recipients were overpaid an \nestimated $1.5 billion, or 7 percent of the approximately $22 billion \nfood stamps program. And, that is only the fraud that is quantifiable \nby the government. The GAO believes there are other forms of fraud in \nthe food stamp program that are too difficult to quantify.\n  As a result of the 1997 Budget and this bill, those individuals who \nwere in the country and disabled on August 22, 1996 will continue to be \neligible for SSI and for food stamps. But, the Congress has to draw the \nline somewhere. The sponsors of currently healthy immigrants who \nentered the country before August 22, 1996 should be responsible for \nthose immigrants' care should they fall on hard times. That has always \nbeen the law. In fact, since the early part of the century any \nimmigrant who becomes a public charge can actually be removed from the \nUnited States.\n  For those individuals who do become disabled and for whom there is no \nsponsor support, the Immigration and Naturalization Service already has \nthe authority to waive the normal requirements of becoming a citizen. \nBy becoming a citizen, such individuals would automatically be eligible \nfor SSI and for food stamps should they qualify.\n  Mr. President, now is not the time to reverse our course on welfare \nreform, as such reform applies both to our U.S. citizens and to our \nimmigrants. America is a land of immigrants, yes. But, we must not \nperpetuate dependence on public benefits. Our nation must be one of \nopportunity for our immigrants, not one that skirts the law by \nproviding a loophole for some immigrants to become dependent on public \nassistance in the future. The Senate should remove the provisions of \nthe conference report that continue food stamp benefits for immigrants \nin the future.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, later today, we are voting on a motion by\n\n[[Page S4659]]\n\nSenator Gramm to recommit the conference report on the Agricultural \nResearch bill. I strongly oppose Senator Gramm's motion.\n  The 1996 welfare law allows refugees to receive federal benefits, \nincluding SSI, Medicaid and food stamps, for their first five years in \nthe United States. It made this exception because refugees and asylum-\nseekers generally come to the United States with little more than the \nshirts on their backs after escaping persecution abroad. They have no \nsponsors. The may have disabilities which make it difficult to work. \nThey need time to get on their feet, and begin to recover from the \npersecution they fled in their former country.\n  After five years in the United States, refugees can apply for \ncitizenship. Unfortunately, there are serious backlogs of \nnaturalization applications at INS. In many parts of the country, it \ntakes two years to complete the naturalization process and obtain \ncitizenship--and these backlogs are not expected to go down in the near \nfuture. Often, the earliest a refugee will gain citizenship is after \nseven years in the United States.\n  As we did last year with SSI and Medicaid, the Agricultural Research \nbill extends the time that a refugee can receive food stamps from five \nto seven years. Senator Gramm wants to deny this extension to refugees \nwho entered the United States after the welfare law was enacted.\n  If we do not extend this time limit from five to seven years, \nthousands of refugees who have applied for citizenship could lose food \nstamps as they wait in the naturalization backlog for their \napplications to be processed.\n  This group includes refugees like Dien Nwin, who fled Vietnam in 1992 \nwith his wife and children. Dien fought on the side of the United \nStates during the Vietnam War and was imprisoned in a Communist re-\neducation camp for 9 and-a-half years. He was worked hard and supported \nhis family for over five years. He applied for citizenship, but he's \nstuck in the backlog.\n  Now, Dien and his family have fallen on hard times. In the past two \nyears, Dien has developed nasal cancer and lung cancer. He has been \nunable to work since then, and his family has had to use food stamps to \nsurvive. Dien is lucky. He entered the United States before the passage \nof the welfare bill. Under Senator Gramm's motion to recommit, Dien \nwould be cut off from receiving food stamps after his initial five \nyears in the United States.\n  Last year, over 25,000 refugees came to the United States fleeing \nreligious persecution in the Former Soviet Union. These refugees \nincluded Jews, Evangelical Christians, Mormons and other religious \nminorities fleeing the restriction of their religious liberties. Under \nSenator Gramm's amendment, these refugees will only be eligible for \nfood stamps for their first five years in the United States. Since \nrefugees cannot apply for naturalization until they have lived in the \nUnited States for five years, there will be a gap in their food stamp \neligibility, depending on how long the naturalization backlog is at the \ntime they apply.\n  The naturalization backlog is expected to increase without an \nincrease in INS funding. Record numbers of legal immigrants are \napplying for citzenship--more than a million per year. This number is \nnot expected to decrease.\n  Few actions are a more important part of our time-honored commitment \nto freedom around the world than opening America's doors to those who \nare denied freedom and face persecution in their own lands.\n  Whether it is Vietnamese fleeing communism, Bosnians exiled by ethnic \ncleansing, Jews from the former Soviet Union fleeing anti-semitism, \nBurmese seeking safe haven from oppression, or Africans escaping \npolitical retribution and genocide, our refugee program stands ready to \naid, protect, and resettle those who need our help. Part of such help \nis ensuring that these refugees' needs are met in their new home in \nthis country. Those needs will not be met if their eligibility for food \nstamps is not extended to seven years.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose Senator Gramm's motion.\n  Mr. LUGAR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I want to summarize our debate--which has \nbeen a good one this morning--by saying that it is very important that \nwe act today to pass the conference report. As the distinguished \nSenator from Mississippi stated eloquently and correctly, failure to do \nthat will throw into chaos farmers who are now planting and who count \nupon crop insurance, reformed albeit as we have reformed it, as an \nunderlying safety net in the year of El Nino, remarkable weather \ncircumstances, it is unthinkable simply to kick away that safety net \nthrough our indifference.\n  Secondly, Mr. President, the agriculture research, which has been \ncharacterized as an entitlement, along with crop insurance and other \nprovisions, of course, is a 5-year program, as is our farm bill \nprogram.\n  We have payments to farmers and Conservation Reserve Program payments \nfor the environment. We have designated $120 million for vital research \nwhich we believe is necessary simply to fight back the pest diseases \nthat are now jeopardizing our growth.\n  Mr. President, the yield of wheat in our country has been flat in \nyield per acre over the last 15 years of time. The breakers are not \noccurring, and we must triple and not have a zero gain.\n  Finally, let me simply say that there will not be people lined up all \nover the world trying to get into America to ruin our welfare reform. \nAs a matter of fact, welfare reform has brought about a better America. \nThis bill will help preserve that in a humane way. Provisions that were \nmade under SSI for income for the very persons who are being talked \nabout today--the elderly, the children, the disabled, and those who \nhave come with a well found sense of persecution to escape torture--\nwill, in fact, be aided in a humane way that I believe all Senators \nwould want to support.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/12/senate-section/article/S4651-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4659-S4662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1997\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 10 \nminutes of debate equally divided on S. 1046, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1046) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     years 1998 and 1999 for the National Science Foundation, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2386\n\n(Purpose: To authorize appropriations for fiscal years 1998, 1999, and \n   2000 for the National Science Foundation, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I understand there is a substitute amendment at the \ndesk. I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont (Mr. Jeffords), for Mr. McCain, \n     Mr. Hollings, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Frist, Mr. \n     Rockefeller, and Ms. Collins, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2386.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to the \nS.1046, the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 1998. This \namendment authorizes the National Science Foundation for a period of \nthree fiscal years, 1998, 1999 and 2000.\n  I am very pleased to see that this amendment represents a bi-partisan \neffort by both the Commerce and the Labor Committees. These two \nCommittees share jurisdiction of the National Science Foundation. I \nwould also like to thank the co-sponsors of this amendment, Senators \nJeffords, Hollings, Kennedy, Frist and Rockefeller, for their support \nof this amendment.\n  The National Science Foundation (NSF) plays a critical role in the \ndevelopment of much of this country's science and technology \ninfrastructure. Its efforts cover a variety of issues\n\n[[Page S4660]]\n\nsuch as education--from the kindergarten to the post-doctorate levels--\nresearch and development, and Internet development.\n  Given that half of the new economic growth in the economy is due to \ntechnological advancements, the role of the National Science Foundation \nin basic research is an important one. Many companies in the private \nsector have indicated that they cannot afford to conduct the long term \nbasic research required for many of these technological advances. They \nhave come to rely upon the basic research of the National Science \nFoundation and other government agencies as the basis for many of their \ncommercial products. For it is through the commercialization process of \nthese research results that the government and the American public \nbenefits. From this process, new industries are started, jobs are \ncreated, and many new products are generated to improve our quality of \nlife of all people.\n  Because of the research at the National Science Foundation, we have \nthe Internet today. The growth of the Internet and the role it is \nplaying in electronic commerce today is far beyond anyone's \nexpectations when the project was started. We look forward to the \nNational Science Foundation's involvement in the Next Generation \nInternet project.\n  In a time when we are hearing of the terrible performance of \nAmerica's students in math and science education, it is important that \nwe do our jobs as members of the Senate and authorize agencies' such as \nthe National Science Foundation to ensure that the federal government \nis doing its share to improve upon the lives of all Americans through \neducation and other related research activities.\n  I urge the other members of the Senate to support this amendment and \nthe final passage of the bill. Again, I would like to thank the co-\nsponsors of this amendment for their support and hard work.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I know of no objection to the amendment. \nI urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2386) was agreed to.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it is a great pleasure to come before \nyou today to seek Senate approval of S. 1046, the National Science \nFoundation Authorization Act of 1998. I introduced this legislation, \nalong with my colleagues Senators Kennedy, Frist, and Collins, on July \n22, 1997. The bill was reported unanimously by the Senate Committee on \nLabor and Human Resources on October 15, 1997. This bipartisan proposal \nwill be further enhanced by the manager's package I am bringing to the \nfloor on behalf of my colleagues Senators McCain, Hollings, Kennedy, \nFrist, Rockefeller, and Collins. This package reflects similar \nbipartisan cooperation, builds upon the foundation contained within S. \n1046 and contains improvements proposed by both Committees. This \nlegislation will make an important investment in our nation's \nscientific and technological future.\n  S. 1046, as amended, will authorize more than $9 billion for research \nand development activities, and $2 billion for math and science \neducation activities over the next 3 years. The bill will support more \nthan 19,000 projects at 2,000 colleges, universities, primary, \nelementary, and secondary schools across the Nation.\n  This authorization bill also recognizes that the future of science in \nthis country will be determined by our basic educational policy. Two \nbillion dollars is authorized over the next 3 years for K through 12 \nmath and science systematic reform, undergraduate science education \nactivities, graduate education, and efforts to advance the public \nunderstanding of science. These efforts will continue to contribute to \nimprovements in the education we offer to our children and maintain a \nstrong cadre of scientific leaders needed to remain competitive well \ninto the next century.\n  S. 1046 provides a strong bipartisan response to the research and \nscience education challenges facing the Nation.\n  The strong bipartisan support which NSF enjoys is a reflection of its \nhistoric contribution to both our national security and our economic \ncompetitiveness. The prominent role of science in the American war \neffort during World War II left us with a new appreciation of the \nimportance of research in establishing and preserving economic and \nmilitary security. Federally funded research led to the development of \nradar, sonar, blood plasma, sulfanilamide, penicillin and the atomic \nbomb. In 1944, President Roosevelt charged Vannevar Bush, his chief \nscience adviser, with evaluating the most effective way to harness this \ntechnological infrastructure in peacetime. The Bush report--Science--\nThe Endless Frontier--established a strategy and rationale for Federal \nsupport of basic research. The report argued, and argued correctly, \nthat ``a nation which depends upon others for its new basic scientific \nknowledge will be slow in its industrial progress and weak in its \ncompetitive position in world trade regardless of its mechanical \nskill.'' This report provided the blueprint for creation of the \nNational Science Foundation.\n  NSF was established in 1950 to ``develop and encourage the pursuit of \na national policy for the promotion of basic research and education in \nthe sciences.'' Following the 1957 Soviet launch of the Sputnik \nsatellite, this mission was expanded to provide greater support for \nscience education and literacy. Over the next three decades, NSF became \nthe primary Federal sponsor of basic research in mathematics, physical \nsciences, computer science, engineering and environmental science at \ncolleges and universities. Equally important to the future of our \nNation, NSF became a catalyst for the reform of math and science \neducation.\n  The manager's amendment which we are bringing to the floor authorizes \nmore than $11 billion for research and development activities at NSF \nover the next three years--$3.5 billion in fiscal year 1998, $3.7 \nbillion in fiscal year 1999, and nearly $3.9 billion in fiscal year \n2000. This Federal funding will be very well invested. Although the \nNational Science Foundation's budget accounts for only 4 percent of \nFederal research and development funding, NSF provides 25 percent of \nFederal support to academic institutions for research. NSF grants \nsupport more than 19,000 research and education projects at 2,000 \ncolleges, universities, primary, elementary, and secondary schools, \nbusinesses, and other research institutions. Competition for these \ngrants is fierce. NSF funds only about one-third of the 30,000 \nproposals it reviews annually and the grants that survive this review \nprocess represent the finest proposals that the research community can \nput forward.\n  The importance of this investment in basic research cannot be \nexaggerated. Over the past decade, private sector investment in \nresearch and development has eclipsed Federal investment in public \nscience. However, the Federal investment in basic science is a major \ncontributor to industrial innovation in the United States. A recent \nreview of American industrial patent applications revealed that the \nGovernment or nonprofit foundations supported 75 percent of the main \npapers cited as the foundation for new industrial innovation.\n  A few of NSF's contributions illustrate the importance of our \ninvestment in basic research and development:\n  The Internet--Over the past decade, NSF has transformed the Internet \nfrom a tool used by a handful of researchers at the Department of \nDefense to the backbone of this Nation's university research \ninfrastructure. Today the Internet is on the verge of becoming the \nNation's commercial marketplace.\n  Nanotechnology and ``Thin Film''--50 years ago scientists developed \nthe transistor and ushered in the information revolution. Today 3 \nmillion transistors can fit on a chip no larger than the first \nfingernail-sized individual transistor. NSF's investments in \nnanotechnology and ``thin films'' are expected to generate a further \n1,000-fold reduction in size for semiconductor devices with eventual \ncost-savings of a similar magnitude.\n  Genetics--A great deal of attention is paid to the effort conducted \nby the NIH to map the Human Genome. What is often overlooked; however, \nis the critical role played by NSF in supporting the basic research \nthat leads to the breakthroughs for which NIH justly receives so much \ncredit. Research supported by NSF was key to the development of the \npolymerase chain reaction\n\n[[Page S4661]]\n\nand a great deal of the technology used for sequencing.\n  Magnetic Resonance Imaging--MRI technology is widely utilized to \ndiagnose a wide array of illnesses. The development of this technology \nwas made possible by combining information gained through the study of \nthe spin characteristics of basic matter, research in mathematics, and \nhigh flux magnets. The Next Generation Nuclear Magnetic Resonance \nImager, currently under construction, will allow for the identification \nof the 3-dimensional structures of the 100,000 proteins whose genes are \nbeing sequenced by the HGP.\n  Buckeyballs--One of the most exciting recent discoveries in the world \nof material science was the discovery of carbon-60. Although this \noccurs in nature, its discovery (which won the researchers a Nobel \nprize) was the product of work by astronomers. This in turn led to the \ndiscovery of the nanotube which has been found to be 100 times stronger \nthan steel and a fraction of the weight. Nanotubes may produce cars \nthat weigh no more than 100 pounds.\n\n  CD Players--CD players rely on data compression algorithms that were \ndeveloped using an NSF grant. These algorithms were first used in the \ntransmission of satellite data and now provide the foundation for new \ndevelopments in data storage.\n  Jet Printers--The mathematical equations that describe the behavior \nof fluid under pressure provided the foundation for developing the ink \njet printer.\n  Plant Genome--Research into the genome of a flower plant with no \nprevious commercial value, led to the discovery of ways to increase \ncrop yields, the production of plants with seeds having lower \npolyunsaturated fats and to the development of crops that produce a \nbiodegradable plastic.\n  Artificial Retina--Researchers at North Carolina State University \nhave designed a computer chip that may pave the way for creation of an \nartificial retina. Problems with bio-compatibility have been solved by \nresearchers at Stanford who developed a synthetic cell membrane that \nadheres to both living cells and silicon chips.\n  Cam Corders--Virtually all camcorders and electronic devices using \nelectronic imaging sensors are based on charge-coupled devices. These \ndevices, sensitive to a single photon of light, were developed and \ntransformed by astronomers interested in maximizing their capacity for \nlight gathering.\n  I could go on at length about the many technological advances that we \nenjoy today that are attributable to basic research supported by NSF. \nThese advances would not be possible, however, if we as a nation did \nnot continue to train and support a cadre of the world's most talented \nresearchers. S. 1046 recognizes the importance of maintaining an \ninvestment in human resources and authorizes more than $2 billion for \nthe education and human resources directorate over the next three \nyears. This directorate has primary responsibility for NSF's education \nand training activities. In contrast with the programs of the \nDepartment of Education, NSF science and math education programs are \nexperiments which link learning and discovery. Proposals are selected \nby outside peer review panels on the basis of their potential to \nprovide long-lasting and broad impact. NSF has made notable \ncontributions in the areas of curriculum and instructional material \ndevelopment, professional development, and improved the participation \nin science research and science education of women, minorities, and \nindividuals with disabilities. The legislation before you strengthens \nand enhances these efforts.\n  The Education and Human Resources Directorate also provides funding \nfor the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research. As \nnoted in the Committee report, this program plays an important role in \nensuring that small states, like Vermont, build the capacity to more \nfully participate in NSF's research programs. The program has been \nparticularly successful in developing infrastructure in those states \nwhere a limited research base has made the attraction and retention of \nyoung faculty, equipment purchases, network connections, human resource \ndevelopment, research project development, and technology transfer \ndifficult. Such infrastructure building remains a crucial part of \nguaranteeing that the participating states are competitive and must be \ncontinued.\n  The Foundation has initiated a new co-funding effort which is \ndesigned to integrate the research community in the EPSCoR states more \ncompletely into the larger research community. As research funding for \nNSF increases in general, I expect that the matching requirements for \ncofunding will not result in the displacement of non-EPSCoR NSF funding \nwhich institutions would otherwise receive. I look forward to working \nclosely with the Foundation to ensure continued growth in the co-\nfunding initiative without reducing the amount available for standard \ngrants.\n  And finally, I want to proudly note the partnership that has been \nforged between the National Science Foundation and the State of \nVermont. NSF currently supports over 74 projects in the Green Mountain \nState. Grants have been provided to the Barre Town Elementary School, \nMiddlebury College, Mountshire Museum of Science, Woodbury College, \nCabot School, Charlestown Elementary School, St. Michael's College, \nJohnson State College, Trinity College, and the University of Vermont. \nIn 1992, the Vermont Institute for Science, Math and Technology \nreceived a five-year award of $7.9 million to establish a collaborative \nstatewide education reform effort linking business, higher education, \ngovernment, and community sectors. This year, as a result of the \nsuccess of this collaboration, NSF has elected to extend the award for \nan additional five years. In addition, Trinity College was this year \nawarded $1.2 million to improve the instruction of math and science in \nour primary, secondary, and elementary schools.\n  This legislation builds upon partnerships like that forged with the \nState of Vermont. It provides a strong bipartisan response to the \nresearch and science education challenges facing our Nation. I also \nwant to note that it reflects the hard work of staff for both \nCommittees. I particularly want to express my appreciation for the work \nof Scott Giles of my staff, Danielle Ripich, Marianna Pierce and \nJonathan Halpern of Senator Kennedy's staff, Floyd DesChamps of Senator \nMcCain's staff and Lila Helms of Senator Hollings' staff and I urge all \nmy colleagues to support this package.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this package.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support passage of the \nNational Science Foundation Authorization Act. It is a privilege to \njoin Senator Jeffords, Senator McCain, and Senator Hollings in \nsponsoring this bipartisan legislation, which looks to the future by \nstrengthening our national commitment to research and development. It \nalso ensures the continued success of the teacher training and \nprofessional development programs of the NSF. In addition, it will \nimprove science and math education from kindergarten to graduate \nschool, and help maintain America's competitive edge into the 21st \ncentury.\n  Few federal agencies deliver as much ``bang for the buck'' as the \nNational Science Foundation. It is now funding 20,000 peer-reviewed \nscience and education projects at more than 2,000 colleges, \nuniversities, schools, businesses and research facilities in all parts \nof the United States.\n  Last year, these projects involved 27,000 senior scientists, 21,000 \ngraduate students, 28,000 undergraduates, 110,000 precollege teachers, \nand 14,000 students from kindergarten through the twelfth grade. Almost \n15 million people are affected by NSF activities through museums, \ntelevision programs, videos, journals, and outreach activities.\n  NSF accounts for 4 percent of total federal research and development \nfunding. But it provides 25 percent of basic research support at \nacademic institutions. It provides as much as half of all federal \nfunding for research in fields such as mathematics, computer science, \nenvironmental science, and the social sciences.\n  NSF also plays an important role in training teachers and developing \nmath and science curricula to prepare students for tomorrow's \nchallenges. It promotes innovative education programs in partnerships \nwith colleges, universities, elementary and secondary\n\n[[Page S4662]]\n\nschools, science museums, and state and local governments. These \nprograms encourage the discovery of new knowledge and its application \nto real-world problems.\n  NSF support for basic research and science education has also had an \nimportant role in encouraging economic growth over the last fifty \nyears. According to a recent study, each dollar that the federal \ngovernment spends on basic research contributes 50 cents or more to the \nnational output each year. In other words, investing in NSF pays for \nitself in two years. These benefits are spread throughout the economy, \nenhancing the productivity of the nation's workforce and improving the \nquality of life for all Americans.\n\n  At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for example, NSF funds \nhave enabled scientists to explore the commercial applications of their \nresearch. Technology developed at MIT had a role in the launching of 13 \ncompanies in 1995. They manufacture products ranging from computer \nchips to communication networks. These enterprises have bolstered the \nstate and local economies, and provided jobs and opportunities for many \ncitizens. In fact, a 1997 report by BankBoston found that research and \ndevelopment at MIT has created 125,000 jobs in Massachusetts.\n  In our state, NSF is funding a wide range of other projects on the \ncutting edge of research. NSF grants have been instrumental in building \nthe state's biotechnology industry, mapping the oceans at the Woods \nHole Oceanographic Institute, developing new superconductors at the \nMaterial Research Science and Education Center at Harvard, and creating \ncooperative partnerships with schools, parents, businesses, and \ncommunity organizations to strengthen math and science education.\n  Nationwide, NSF grants cover a broad range of projects from providing \nhealth care to fighting crime to protecting the environment. Specific \ngrants are improving the treatment of arrhythmia, facilitating more \naccurate identification of crime suspects, developing new biotechnology \ntechniques to cleanup hazardous waste sites, enhancing the speed of \nsemiconductors in processing information, and even analyzing the \nAntarctic meteorite to determine whether life existed on Mars.\n  NSF funds benefit the humanities as well. The Next Generation \nInternet Project will give researchers access to information from the \nworld's libraries and museums at rates that are 100 to 1,000 times \nfaster than today's Internet.\n  This authorization Act will put research and development on a more \nsecure footing over the next two years. It will increase NSF funding by \n10 percent in FY1999 and 3 percent in FY2000, which are consistent with \nthe levels recommended in President Clinton's FY1999 budget. The \nincreased funding will provide larger award amounts, so that scientists \ncan undertake longer-range projects.\n  The legislation also strengthens efforts to improve science, \nmathematics, engineering, and technology training for teachers and \nstudents. In addition, it authorizes the Office of Science and \nTechnology Policy in the White House to prepare a report analyzing \nindirect costs, which play a vital but little understood role in \nfederal R spending.\n  The National Science Foundation is doing an outstanding job in \nfulfilling its missions. Passage of this bill will strengthen America's \nleadership in science and technology, and I urge all of my colleagues \nto support this important legislation.\n  I congratulate our chairman for bringing us to this point in the \nlegislative process.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to engage Senator Lott, \nSenate Majority Leader, and Senator Jeffords, Chairman of the Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee, in a colloquy on certain programs within the \nNational Science Foundation.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would be pleased to join Senator McCain and Senator \nJeffords in a colloquy on this subject.\n  Mr. McCAIN. As Chairman of the Commerce Committee, I have noted with \ngreat pleasure the success and impact on the NSF's program to establish \noutstanding research and education centers at colleges and universities \nin partnership with industry. These centers are making great \ncontributions to research, science, and technology education, and the \neconomic development and global competitiveness of our nation.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. As Chairman of the Labor Committee, I too have been a \nstrong supporter of the NSF's efforts to strengthen research and \neducation efforts at colleges and universities across the nation. NSF \nprovides support to over 2000 colleges and universities and nearly \n17,000 researchers nation-wide.\n  Mr. LOTT. A particular success is the Engineering Research Centers \nProgram which has stimulated focused university-industry partnerships \nin research and education, and has served as a catalyst for economic \ndevelopment within the United States. Much success can be attributed to \nthe Foundation's leadership in ensuring each center establishes a clear \nvision and conducts careful strategic planning involving their industry \npartners. Among the impacts of this program are: Next generation \nengineering systems developed from new knowledge discoveries and new \ntechnological developments; Technology transferred to hundreds of \ncompanies and governmental agencies; Technical assistance and training \nprovided for industry and government; Thousands of undergraduate and \ngraduate students involved in the research of the centers and exposed \nto next generation systems research and development; and Outreach to K-\n12 and to underrepresented groups.\n  NSF Science Technology Centers and other NSF university centers have \nlikewise cultivated strong university-industry affiliations with \ncenters focused on specific research areas related to industry needs. \nFor example, the modern Internet browser was developed at the NSF \nNational Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of \nIllinois; a turbomachinery computational model developed at the \nEngineering Research Center for Computational Field Simulation at \nMississippi State University is now used by all jet engine \nmanufacturers; the Center for Molecular Biotechnology at the University \nof Washington is developing tools for industry use to analyze and \ninterpret the information content of biological molecules such as DA \nand proteins, to analyze and interpret the information content to \nbiological molecules; and the Center for High Pressure Research at the \nState University of New York at Stony Brook works with several \ncompanies to develop new ways that industry can use high-pressure \ntechnology to produce exotic materials, such as industrial-grade \ndiamonds. Hundreds of similar contributions can be cited from these and \nother NSF-funded university centers.\n  I believe this program should be greatly expanded and that the NSF \nshould become even more active in ensuring the development of long-term \nvision and strategic planning of each center. Further, NSF should build \non successful centers and seek ways to sustain the investment with \ncontinual support when appropriate. Areas that show great potential for \nthe future include: computation engineering, biotechnology and \nbioengineering, manufacturing, and industrial systems, electronics and \ncommunications systems, materials processing including polymers and \ncomposite materials, manufacturing systems, remote sensing systems and \ntechnologies, and optical systems as well as ship building, \ntelecommunications and super-computing supercomputer technology for \nuniversity research centers.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the distinguished Majority Leader and the Labor \nCommittee Chairman, for their insights into these matters and how \nimportant research and education is to the overall National economy.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. The distinguished Majority Leader should be commended \nfor his strong support for basic scientific and engineering research \nand I look forward to working with him to strengthen the engineering \nresearch centers program.\n  Mr. LOTT. I also would like to thank Senator McCain and Senator \nJeffords for their leadership in these areas of science and technology.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/12/senate-section/article/S4659-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4662-S4664]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I would like to raise an issue that has been brought to my \nattention since the Labor Committee reported this bill in October. It \nrelates to the Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program and I \nwant to\n\n[[Page S4663]]\n\nhighlight the fact that recent NSF decisions may have a negative effect \non this very successful program. I have worked closely on small \nbusiness issues with my friend from Montana, Senator Conrad Burns, who \nalso serves on the Small Business Committee with me. It is not my \nintention to hold up this legislation by offering an amendment at this \ntime, but I want the Chairman, Senator Jeffords, to know that it is a \nvery important issue for me. I would like to yield to Senator Burns for \na minute and ask him to describe the situation.\n  Mr. BURNS. On August 8, 1997, Ms. Linda G. Sundro, Inspector General \nfor the National Science Foundation (NSF) recommended that NSF reduce \ntheir SBIR set-aside by approximately $2.5 million by excluding certain \neducation and training costs, as well as program support overhead costs \nfrom their total extramural R budget. Although funded by the Congress \nas part of their overall R budget, the Inspector General concluded \nthat these costs could be excluded because they do not fit the \nstatutory definition of R as set forth in the Small Business Research \nand Development Enhancement Act of 1992, (Public Law No. 102.564, 15 \nU.S.C. Part 638(e)(5)).\n  The Inspector General's recommendation does not take into \nconsideration the guidance provided by the Congress in determining the \ncalculation. The legislation requires each agency ``which has an \nextramural budget for research or research and development'' (15 U.S.C. \nPart 638(f)(1)) to set-aside a percentage for the SBIR program. The \nlegislation clearly defines extramural budget as ``the sum of the total \nobligations minus amounts obligated for such activities by employees of \nthe agency in or through Government-owned, Government-operated \nfacilities * * *'' (15 U.S.C. Part 638 (e)(1)). Under existing law, the \nonly exclusion from the calculation is for funds dedicated to \nintramural R efforts.\n  In its April 17, 1998 report on the SBIR program, the General \nAccounting Office identified the calculation of the extramural budget \nas an issue for the SBIR program. Their analysis found that each \nparticipating agency was utilizing different methodologies in the \ncalculation. The GAO recommended that the SBA issue guidance to the \nparticipating agencies to ensure consistency across the program. The \nSBA agreed with this recommendation.\n  Accordingly, I believe the NSF Inspector General's recommendation is \ninconsistent with the current law and would ask that the Director of \nthe National Science Foundation hold the recommendation in abeyance \nuntil such time as the SBA issues guidance to the participating SBIR \nagencies.\n  Mr. ENZI. Would the Senator yield for a question? This is clearly a \nvery important issue for members of the Small Business Committee. Would \nthe Senator agree that NSF's coordination with SBA is critical to \nensuring a strong SBIR program?\n  Mr. BURNS. I believe the NSF and all agencies participating in the \nSBIR program should coordinate with the SBA in determining their \nextramural research budgets. This is what the GAO recommend.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Senator from Montana and I thank you, Senator \nJeffords, for considering this important issue.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to encourage my colleagues \nto support passage of S. 1046, the National Science Foundation \nAuthorization Act of 1998. University research continues to be a great \nAmerican success story, and NSF can be proud of its role in helping to \ncreate and sustain this great research enterprise. We continue to ask \nmuch of NSF and our universities because we know what this system has \ncontributed to the Nation in the past, and we know that greater \ncontributions await us in the future.\n  Mr. President, by themselves, universities cannot solve our national \nproblems such as technological competitiveness, the environment, and \nsocial issues like crime, poverty, and education. However, the research \nand trained young people provided by our universities will continue to \nplay a major role in addressing these pressing issues. S. 1046 \nauthorizes the continuation of the vital programs of NSF that support \nthese efforts, including EPSCoR which has helped strengthen science and \ntechnology in many of our smaller states.\n  I would like to take a moment and thank Senator McCain, Senator \nKennedy, and Senator Jeffords for their efforts in getting this bill \npassed. The managers' amendment before the Senate today reflects \nagreement by the Commerce Committee and the Labor Committee on many \nissues relating to NSF's programs and funding. The two committees \nworked well together within the guidelines set forth in the standing \norder of March 3, 1988. Because of this bipartisan effort to address \nissues that are within the jurisdiction of the two committees, this is \na good bill, and I encourage my colleagues to support its passage.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the National \nScience Foundation (NSF) authorization bill, which is before us today. \nPrior to this Congress, when I became chairman of the Communications \nSubcommittee, I served as chairman of the Subcommittee on Science, \nTechnology and Space, which has jurisdiction over the authorizations \nfor the NSF. I conducted several hearings on NSF during that time. I am \nalso a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on VA-HUD \nIndependent Agencies, which funds the NSF. As a result, I have had the \nopportunity to get to know this agency and its program as well.\n  I will have to tell you that when I came to the U.S. Senate, I did \nnot expect to become a champion for the National Science Foundation and \nfor scientific research, education and technology. But, I quickly \nbecame a strong supporter.\n  I have seen what this agency can do, and its importance to the people \nin our states. NSF is about seeking new scientific knowledge and using \nthat knowledge. It is about helping the researchers and teachers in our \ncolleges and universities and helping them to make certain that their \nstudents receive a good education, with scientific, mathematical, \nengineering and technological opportunities. It is about offering \nbetter training and materials for our K-12 teachers. And, it is about \ndeveloping infrastructure, such as advanced telecommunication and \ncomputing opportunities. Such infrastructure is particularly important \nfor rural states, such as Montana.\n  NSF has funded research which led to Montana State University's Jack \nHorner's now famous work on dinosaurs. It has helped us start new \nprogram in computational biology. It has funded an Engineering Research \nCenter, which has undertaken cutting edge research in networking \nconnection and supported other networking and telecommunications \nprograms. There is interest in new research opportunities on life in \nextreme environments, which could include the Yellowstone area, and in \nthe plant genome initiative.\n  I also want to say a few words about a program that is of particular \nimportance to my state--the Experimental Program to Stimulate \nCompetitive Research (EPSCoR). EPSCoR was created to assist states such \nas Montana become more competitive in the federal R arena. \nUnfortunately, federal R funds are highly concentrated in a few \nuniversities in a few states. That is not justifiable. Today's global \neconomy requires that all parts of our nation share in scientific and \ntechnology development if we are to keep our entire nation and its \nindustries and workforce competitive. Today, we know that scientific \nand technological problems and issues in one area of the country are \nlikely to affect people in other areas. And, we know that we cannot \nhave a healthy national science and technology system unless there is \nwidespread support throughout our country for it.\n  The EPSCoR program is the base for much of our rural states' \nscientific and technological activities. It helps Montana and 17 other \nstates develop infrastructure. It helps us develop new programs and \ntake advantage of special opportunities. It has recently been assisting \nour states on participating more fully in other NSF programs. And, it \nwas instrumental in ensuring that the EPSCoR states participate in the \nvBNS connections program and the Next Generation Internet initiative. I \nbelieve in the EPSCoR program, and would like to see the program \nexpanded\n\n[[Page S4664]]\n\nin terms of financial assistance, especially when NSF funding overall \nis increasing and also since the co-founding, which is scheduled to \nincrease in this budget year, should be matched by a similar increase \nin the base EPSCoR program.\n  I know that the report prepared last fall by the Senate Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee endorsed by EPSCoR program, and we on the \nSenate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee are equally \nsupportive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, S. 1046 is deemed \nread a third time, the Labor Committee is discharged from further \nconsideration of H.R. 1273 and the Senate will now proceed to its \nconsideration. Under the previous order, all after the enacting clause \nis stricken, the text of S. 1046, as amended, is inserted in lieu \nthereof, and the bill is deemed read a third time.\n  The bill (H.R. 1273), as amended, was deemed read a third time.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, earlier this morning, some of us were on \nthe floor urging the Senate to bring up the Patients' Bill of Rights, a \nvery important bill that would essentially protect patients from \ndecisions made by accountants and bureaucrats in insurance companies \nand have their health care decisions made by physicians.\n  I was talking with the Senator from North Dakota who has been \npresenting a number of cases that proves our point as to why this \nlegislation is needed, and he shared with me a most extraordinary case \ncoming out of California. I am going to tell the Senate about this \ncase, because we cannot close our eyes to what is happening.\n  I share with you the case of Joyce Ching from Agoura, CA. Joyce Ching \nlived with her husband David and 5-year-old son Justin. In 1992, when \nDavid switched jobs, he was offered an array of plans, but Joyce \nconvinced him to join an HMO because she wanted the entire family to go \nto the same place to get their care.\n  In the summer of 1994, Joyce got sick. She began to suffer from \nsevere abdominal pain and from rectal bleeding. The pain was so \nexcruciating that some days she couldn't even get out of bed to be with \nher son. She visited her HMO doctor and was refused referral to a \nspecialist.\n  I am not a physician, but I know enough people who have had problems, \nand when you have rectal bleeding, that is a sign that something is \namiss. Yet, this HMO did not refer her to a specialist. Do you know \nwhat her doctor in the HMO told her? That her symptoms would be \nalleviated by a change in diet.\n  She changed her diet, and the symptoms were not alleviated. Fearing \nthat her illness could hamper her chances of having a second child, she \ncontinued to complain to the physician that her pain was getting worse, \nand the doctor said, ``Give your diet time,'' and still would not refer \nher to a specialist.\n  Finally, after nearly 3 months and countless visits, she was referred \nto a gastroenterologist, but it was too late. Joyce, 34 years old, was \ndiagnosed in the final stages of colon cancer.\n  What is so shocking about this case is that her doctor never really \nlistened to her concerns and never sent her to a specialist. When you \nfind out why, it will send chills up and down your spine. There was a \ndeal in that HMO. They looked at Joyce's profile and they decided: A \nhealthy woman in her thirties, we can't spend more than $28 a month on \nJoyce.\n  I will conclude with this, Mr. President. The HMO's accountants \ndecided that Joyce should cost the HMO $28 a month, and they told the \ndoctor, ``If she costs you any more than that, your clinic will have to \npay out of its own pocket.'' So there was a deal made to give \nincentives to that clinic not to treat this woman, and she is gone. She \nis gone forever from the lives of her husband and her beautiful son, \nand she died at 34.\n  I have to say, when we stand up here day after day with these cases, \nit is not to hear the sound of our own voices, because there are \nthousands and thousands of stories like this, and people want action. \nThey want decisions made by physicians. They want patients and \nphysicians to be honest with each other. They don't want incentive \npayments to doctors so that they will not be treated. This is a tragedy \nthat you cannot even measure, Mr. President. I call on the leadership \nto allow us to bring up the Patients' Bill of Rights. I yield the \nfloor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/12/senate-section/article/S4664-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4664]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECESS UNTIL 2:15 P.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send a motion to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration. I will have it read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm] moves to recommit the \n     conference report on S. 1150, the Agricultural Research, \n     Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998 to the committee \n     on conference with instructions to the managers on the part \n     of the Senate to insist that the expansion of Food Stamp \n     eligibility in Title V, Subtitle A, section 503 shall only \n     apply to refugees and asylees who were lawfully residing in \n     the United States on August 22, 1996.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, it is clear to me, from the debate we had \nearlier, that it is going to be somewhat difficult to get people to \ndebate this issue. However, let me try by being frank and yet fair to \neverybody. I would like to outline what happened to this bill in \nconference, and why I believe it is important that this motion pass.\n  First of all, let me remind my colleagues that the Senate adopted a \nbill to promote ag research. It is a bill that I would assume 100 \nMembers of the Senate support.\n  My State is a very substantial beneficiary of ag research. The \ninstitution which I love more than anything, other than my family, \nTexas A, is a major ag research institution. Needless to say, no one \nshould be surprised that I am in favor of ag research. In addition, I \nam a supporter of research in general.\n  In 1965, we were spending 5.7 cents out of every dollar we spent in \nthe budget on general research. That is now down to 1.9 percent of the \nbudget on research, because rather than investing money in new \ntechnology, new products, and new science for the next generation, we \nare being driven by politics to invest in the next election by spending \nmoney on programs that have big constituencies in the next election \nrather than beneficiaries in the next generation. Again, I support \nagriculture research. The Senate bill went to conference on a unanimous \nvote, and the House passed a bill that was an ag research bill. \nHowever, the nature of the bill changed in conference, and it changed \ndramatically. Many other provisions were added to the conference report \nthat were never voted on in the Senate and never voted on in the House.\n\n  The major provision that I want to address in this motion to recommit \nwith instruction is the provision having to do with food stamps. My \ncolleagues will remember that while we had a contentious debate on \nwelfare reform, when it came time to call the roll on August 22, 1996, \nwe passed a comprehensive welfare reform bill on an overwhelming \nbipartisan vote. Part of that welfare reform process was setting much \nhigher standards on food stamps and eliminating the attractiveness of \nwelfare in general, and food stamps in particular. We were trying to \nchange the law to eliminate a situation where, over the last 25 years, \nwe had seen a change in the welfare law. People were actually being \nattracted to America not with their sleeves rolled up, but with their \nhands held out seeking benefits paid for by someone else's labor.\n  This bill, unfortunately, takes a major step backward. This bill re-\ninstitutes $818 million worth of food stamps that were eliminated in \nthe welfare reform bill. I remind my colleagues that the Senate did not \nvote on the food stamp provisions in this bill. In addition, the bill, \nas it was voted on in the House, did not contain these food stamp \nprovisions. Yet, in conference, as part of the age-old logrolling \nprocess of putting a bill together to be a grab bag for everybody, a \nprovision was added that provided $818 million worth of food stamps for \nimmigrants. The President was a major supporter of this provision. In \nfact, yesterday, our distinguished ranking member, Senator Harkin, \ncalled this provision a major step toward fulfilling a promise that was \nmade by our President.\n  Well, our President was not for welfare reform when it was debated \nand basically was shamed into signing it. What he said at the time was \nthat he intended to go back and undue major parts of it. This \nprovision, in fact, fulfills part of that commitment.\n  This motion is drafted very, very narrowly. It simply says to not \ntouch the welfare benefits added back for people that were already here \non August 22, 1996. Go ahead and take those provisions, but don't set \nout a provision in law that is giving new food stamps to people who \nmight choose to come in the future.\n  There is a provision in this bill that would give 7 years of \neligibility for food stamps to people who come and who declare \nthemselves refugees in the future. Under the provision in the bill, \nwhether they come next year or 20 years from now, they can come and \ndeclare themselves refugees and qualify for 7 years of food stamps. Mr. \nPresident, I think that is providing the wrong incentive for people to \ncome to America.\n  Let me also say that I am a strong supporter of legal immigration. I \ndon't want to tear down the Statue of Liberty. I don't want to build a \nwall around America. There is still room for hard-working, dedicated \npeople with big dreams to come to America. But I want the dream to be \nof working and succeeding, not getting on welfare and food stamps.\n  What my amendment simply says is that the one provision of this bill \nthat is prospective whereby providing food stamps into the future for \nseven years would be stricken. However, the refugees and asylees who \nare already here on August 22, 1996, would be able to receive food \nstamps for seven years.\n  Our colleagues are going to say that the world is coming to an end if \nwe go back to conference and that somehow this bill will die. Everybody \nin the Senate and everybody in the House knows that ag research is not \ngoing to die. Everybody in the House and everybody in the Senate knows \nthat crop insurance is not going to die.\n  If we send the bill back to conference, we have an opportunity to \nbegin to correct problems with the bill. Both the Speaker and the \nmajority leader of the House have said, in one forum or another, that \nthey are not in favor of this bill being considered in the House. By \nsending it back to conference, we have an opportunity to begin the \nsystem of inducing moderation into the bill, which I believe can speed \nup the day we obtain funding for agriculture research and crop \ninsurance.\n\n  Let me say again that I support agriculture research, and crop \ninsurance. I don't think we should have to pay tribute every time we \nput together a program to try to promote job creation and economic \ngrowth in America. I don't think that every time we have an \nagricultural bill that tries to move us toward a more competitive \nagricultural system, we should have to pay tribute to people who always \nwant an add-on such as the food stamp provisions in this bill. The \nprovision adding food stamps was little more than a tribute for \nallowing this bill to move forward.\n  We can pass this bill without the food stamp provisions, but I am \nsuggesting that we deal with one narrow part of the bill. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this provision, because in this provision we \ndon't take any benefits away from the restoration contained in the bill \nfor immigrants who were here when we passed the welfare bill in 1996. \nCertain legal immigrants who were here when the welfare bill passed \nwill have benefits restored by this provision. This motion, if \ndefeated, would send the signal that we want to create new benefits in \nthe future that would allow you to come to America and can obtain food \nstamps.\n  That, I think, is the wrong signal. It is not a signal I want to \nsend. It is a signal that I think is destructive for those of us who \nbelieve in legal immigration.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this motion to recommit with \ninstructions. I remind my colleagues that the conference has not been \ndischarged. We can go back to conference this afternoon, and this \nprovision can be voted\n\n[[Page S4666]]\n\non. If it is adopted in conference, it can come back to the Senate, and \nit would probably pass unanimously. If it is rejected in conference, we \nat least know there has been a vote in conference.\n  The point is, this bill is not going to die if we adopt this motion. \nI want people to look at this provision and vote on it on its merits. \nIf they will do that, I will be satisfied.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LUGAR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will try to do this in 3 minutes. \nFirst of all, I say to my colleague from Texas, what he is now willing \nto do is hold up, delay, and potentially kill, crop insurance, which is \nextremely important to farmers in Minnesota and across the country, and \nresearch on alternative uses for agriculture products, crop disease, \nand research on scab disease in northwest Minnesota.\n  He is willing to do this because he thinks there is some terrible \nwrong in this bill. I think it is a right. I think we are doing \nsomething that lives up to the very best in America. I say to my \ncolleague and to people in the country, my colleague from Texas wants \nto hold this bill up because he finds it to be an offensive proposition \nthat we should say that for legal immigrants we will make sure there is \nsome assistance for those people who are elderly, disabled, and for \nsmall children.\n  The Physicians for Human Rights released a report this past week \nfinding an alarming amount of hunger and malnutrition among these legal \nimmigrants. Food stuff use is on the rise. In the United States of \nAmerica today at the peak of our economic performance we have people \nwho are hungry and in jeopardy. What we ought to do here is restore \nsome assistance for these legal immigrants. These asylees and refugees \nare people who have fled oppression in countries like Indonesia, China, \nyou name it. They come to our country in the hope that we would be \nwilling to extend a helping hand.\n  My colleague from Texas talks about that as if it is a bad thing to \ndo. I thought that is what we were about--people who fled persecution, \npeople who were legal immigrants. Many of them were parents. My dad \nfled persecution from Russia. For the U.S. Senate to say, ``Look, we \nwant to correct the harshness. We want to make sure there is some \nassistance for you to make sure you don't go hungry if you are elderly, \nif you are disabled, if you are a small child, if you fled persecution \nfrom a country.'' That is the right thing to do. Certainly we ought not \nto be holding up the agriculture research bill, which is so important \nto agriculture in our country and so important to farmers in Minnesota.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROBERTS addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Let me inquire of the distinguished Senator from Kansas. \nDoes the Senator require time at this moment?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I tell my distinguished chairman, if he could yield to \nme maybe 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nKansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I suppose that some of what I am going to \nsay is repetitive in that most of this was discussed during the general \ndebate. But I feel compelled to speak again because of the strong \npersonal interest in this in behalf of myself and many of my colleagues \nwho served on the House Agriculture Committee, and for that matter the \nSenate Agriculture Committee back in 1996.\n  There has been a real success story in regards to the Food Stamp \nProgram and reforms that have been initiated. In 1996, with all due \nrespect to that program and others who supported it, it was a program \nout of control. It couldn't even be audited. The inspector general came \nin, an inspector general from New York--a tough cop, by the way, named \nRoger Viadero, who has done an outstanding job, basically said that the \nFood Stamp Program could not even be audited due to the fraud, abuse, \nand organized crime involvement. As a matter of fact, he had a tape \nthat we showed during the Committee hearings which ended up on 60 \nMinutes. And we know all the stories about the Food Stamp Program, \nabout the waiting in line, people with food stamps exchanging them for \ncash and then buying things that obviously did not represent a \nnutritious market basket of food.\n  They got a new inspector general. We exposed the fraud and abuse on \n60 Minutes and saved $3 billion to $5 billion in regard to the fraud \nand abuse. Then we instituted major reforms. I am talking about the \nSenate Agriculture Committee and the House Agriculture Committee--$24 \nbillion, as the distinguished chairman has pointed out. I just do not \nthink that is a success story that can be equaled.\n  As a matter of fact, as to the person in charge of the Food Stamp \nProgram there were many allegations made in regard to the performance \nof duty. She resigned. It is in better hands. Then we gave these \nreforms to the States. The States have come back with administrative \nsavings. That is where the $1.7 billion comes in that has been referred \nto in terms of entitlement. And that money, I think, should be used for \nagriculture research, and I believe it also should be used for crop \ninsurance and risk management. And, yes, there is some limited \nassistance in regard to food stamps.\n\n  But let me refer to the comments made by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Texas whose concern I share. I certainly don't want any social \nwelfare program, food stamps or otherwise, to be a beacon for people to \ncome to this country when they wouldn't otherwise.\n  But we are talking about refugees, and a refugee is defined as \nfollows: A person who is fleeing because of persecution, or well-\nfounded fear of persecution, on account of race, religion, nationality, \nmembership in a particular social group or political opinion, and who \nis of special humanitarian concern to the United States.\n  I don't think people choose to be a refugee. That is just not the \ncase. People are not fleeing their country to come to the U.S. with a \nbeacon held out there saying ``I am coming because of food stamps.'' \nAnd we have a cap on the number of refugees. It will be 75,000 \nadmissions for the fiscal year as of 1999. Who are these people? The \nEuropean numbers are used largely for Soviet religious minorities and \nBosnians. East Asian numbers are for former Vietnamese, reeducation, \ncamp detainees, and Laotians. I could keep on going down here. \nBasically, refugee admissions have fallen significantly from over \n100,000 per year during fiscal year 1989. Now they are down to 75,000, \nand they are headed further downward.\n  Here is the difference. The agriculture research bill's food stamp \nprovisions mirror the SSI provisions of last year's Balanced Both \nHouses have approved that.\n  Let's go back to the original food stamp reform that was passed in \n1996 that I just talked about. These welfare reforms eliminated the \nbenefits for anywhere from 800,000 to 950,000 noncitizens. This bill \nextends those benefits back to the children, the elderly, and the \ndisabled who were in the country before August 22. That is the day of \nenactment of the bill. And, yes, it does also extend the benefits to \nrefugees and asylees who may have entered after the August 22, 1996, \ndebate. That means the total of the benefits will be restored to \n250,000 people, not 900,000. I do not think this represents a step back \nfrom the far-reaching food stamp reforms that were passed back in 1996.\n  I think if you take a hard look at these people, I don't think the \nFood Stamp Program represents a beacon in regard to any kind of a \nreason that they would come to the United States. I have already read \nthe definition.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman for yielding me this time.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I thank especially the \nchairman of our committee.\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the research bill that we \nhave before us. It has the title of ``agricultural research.'' I think \nthat is really somewhat misleading because this bill has a lot more in \nit than agricultural\n\n[[Page S4667]]\n\nresearch, although agricultural research is critically important. Some \nwho are not in agriculture may wonder: ``Why is it so important?'' Let \nme just give them an example from my home State of North Dakota, one of \nthe most agricultural States in the Nation, traditionally one of the \nlargest wheat producers, one of the largest barley producers, one of \nthe largest sunflower and sugar beet-producing States in the Nation, \nand the State that produces the vast majority of the durum wheat that \ngoes to make pasta which is enjoyed by all of America.\n  Last year, we lost a third of the crop in North Dakota to a disease. \nThat disease is called scab. Scab is a fungus. In North Dakota we have \nhad 5 years of extremely wet conditions. People may recall that last \nyear we had an extraordinary set of disasters in North Dakota. That is \njust the continuation of a very severe weather pattern. Because of \nthose overly wet conditions this fungus is growing in the crops of \nNorth Dakota; this scab. It destroyed a third of the crop last year. \nThat is stunning. That is a loss of $1.1 billion just in my little \nState of North Dakota in 1 year.\n  In this bill there is a provision to provide $26 million over 5 years \non scab research so we can attack this problem. That is a reason that \nthis bill is important. That is not the only reason.\n  There are many other important agricultural research priorities to \nkeep America on the cutting edge and on the leading edge of production \nagriculture. It is very important for our people to understand that our \nchief competitors are spending far more supporting their producers than \nwe are spending supporting ours. In Europe they are spending about $47 \nbillion a year to support their producers. We are spending about $5 \nbillion.\n  So we are asking our farmers to go out and compete against their \nfarmers with their farmers having a substantial competitive edge.\n  It is critically important that we not take everything away that our \nfarmers are using to try to stay ahead of the competition.\n  In addition, in this bill is the money to shore up the crop insurance \nsystem, also critically important to those areas that are experiencing \nlosses as a result of these unusual weather patterns we are \nexperiencing. Here on the east coast we have had, I think it is now, 13 \ndays of rain. We have already had 50 percent more rain at this time of \nthe year than is normal. And that is affecting crops as well, because \njust like overly dry conditions have an adverse effect, so do overly \nwet conditions. That is what we are seeing, a very odd weather pattern \nacross America this year. The crop insurance system needs to be \nstrengthened and preserved. The funds to do it are in this bill.\n  Now, our colleague from Texas comes along and he tells all of us, ``I \nwant to send this bill back to committee. I want to get some changes \nmade. It won't really endanger the legislation at all.''\n  That is not true. Those of us who are on the Budget Committee \nunderstand what is at stake here. We understand that there is a budget \nresolution that has already passed this Chamber and is over in the \nother Chamber, and it takes a big chunk of the savings that are from \nthe Agriculture Committee and uses them for another purpose. If this \nbill does not get passed and get passed quickly, we may lose these \nfunds from agriculture altogether, and that would be a tragedy.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nConference Report on S. 1150, the Agricultural, Research, Extension, \nand Education Reform Act of 1998. Certainly, there are a number of \nimportant issues addressed in this bill, but none more critical than \nthe provisions that would restore food stamp benefits to many elderly, \nchildren, and disabled legal immigrants.\n  While I am pleased that over 70 Senators joined the effort to bring \nthis Conference Report to the floor, I am disappointed that action on \nsuch an important and bipartisan bill has been needlessly delayed. My \ncolleagues have demonstrated overwhelming support for this Conference \nReport.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I was deeply concerned about provisions \nof the 1996 welfare reform law which denied benefits to legal \nimmigrants, particularly children, the disabled, and the elderly. The \nwelfare reform law was necessary to help people move from dependency to \nwork, but it was not perfect. That is why we worked to restore \nSupplemental Security Income and Medicaid to legal immigrants in last \nyear's balanced budget agreement.\n  With the Agricultural Research Conference Report, we take another \nimportant step to address the needs of our most vulnerable legal \nimmigrants. Some states, including my home state of Rhode Island, have \nprovided temporary benefits to fill the void created by the welfare \nreform law, but a permanent and uniform federal solution is needed for \nthis group of immigrants.\n  Under the Conference Report, food stamp benefits would be restored to \nthose legal immigrants who were in the United States when the welfare \nreform law went into effect on August 22, 1996, if they met certain \nconditions such as: (1) they are or become disabled; (2) they are \nchildren; or (3) they were over 65 years old at the time the welfare \nreform law was enacted. In addition, the Conference Report restores \nfood stamp eligibility to Hmong immigrants. While this Conference \nReport does not restore benefits to all legal immigrants, it is a \npositive and essential first step.\n  Mr. President, our nation has prospered from the tremendous \ncontributions of immigrants who have strengthened our economy and \nbrought vitality to our communities. Today, we have the opportunity to \nrestore benefits to children, elderly, and disabled legal immigrants--\nmany of whom have worked and paid U.S. taxes. I urge my colleagues to \noppose the motion to recommit and support the Conference Report on S. \n1150.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the conference \nreport to accompany S. 1150, the Agricultural Research, Extension, and \nEducation Reform Act of 1998. This legislation contains very important \nprovisions that will help improve the delivery of safe, healthy, and \nvalue-added agricultural products to the American and world \nmarketplace, and keep rural America strong.\n  The conference report contains a provision very similar to one in S. \n1597, a measure I introduced as a companion to a bill introduced in the \nHouse by Congresswoman Stabenow. This provision directs the Department \nof Agriculture to assemble FEMA-like Crisis Management Teams to respond \nto emergencies, like threats to human health from food-borne pathogens. \nAnd, USDA must work with other agencies to ensure coordinated \ninformation and actions in the event of such a crisis. This is a very \nimportant and non-regulatory way for the Federal government to \nidentify, correct, and prevent future food supply contamination.\n  S. 1150 contains a host of other important provisions, not the least \nof which is a funding mechanism to ensure that these new authorizations \nare paid for. USDA will be the site of a new Food Safety Research \nInformation Office that will centralize and make public research and \nscientific data on food safety issues. Wheat scab, which has been a \nmulti-billion problem in Michigan and in other barley and wheat \nproducing states in the North Central region, will be the subject of a \nnew research initiative. The crop insurance system will be made \nsolvent. Precision agriculture, which uses high technology to reduce \ninputs like fertilizer and pesticides, will get new emphasis. And, USDA \nwill conduct focused research to help diversify the crops that make up \nour main food supply, so that it will be less vulnerable to disruptions \ndue to weather, pests or disease.\n  Mr. President, this is an important bill and I hope my colleagues \nwill not vote to recommit the conference report. That would send the \nwrong message to a major sector of our economy and call into question \nCongress' commitment to a safe and abundant food supply.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield myself 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized for 7 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the report with regard to the conferees on \nagriculture reform is supported by 17 out of the 18 members of our \ncommittee. I make that point because the 17 have written to our leader \nasking him for this debate. They are grateful for that opportunity. The \n18th was predictably our colleague and a very valued\n\n[[Page S4668]]\n\nmember of the committee, the Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, who objects \nto the conference report and has offered this recommittal motion as a \nway, in my judgment, of defeating the conference report.\n  Let me just offer a word of clarification. As the chairman of the \nconference and one of the conferees, along with Senator Cochran and \nSenator Coverdell on the Republican side, we supported the conference \nreport after meeting with House colleagues who had very considerable \nenthusiasms of their own. This is not the first time that the Senate \nand House have met in a conference and have had to wrestle with issues \nthat were distinctly different in the bills and have come to a \ncompromise which, in my judgment, is a sound one, which was supported \nimmediately by all the conferees in the House and the Senate in both \nparties and by 74 United States Senators who have written to the \nmajority leader supporting this conference report. They do so because \nit is extremely timely. There are farmers in the field now dependent \nupon the crop insurance provisions.\n  If we are not successful today, of course, we will return to the \nconference, but I have already turned to the conferees and they are \nunanimous that we should proceed with the same bill and we will be back \nin the Chamber delayed by days or weeks as the case may be. The Senate \nmay then pass the conference report. Perhaps the distinguished Senator \nfrom Texas is correct that this is going to pass by a very large \nmajority. But is it any more certain that this same conference report \nwill pass days and weeks hence, if we can get floor time, than today? I \ndoubt it.\n  Now, the reason why conferees will not change the conference report \nis that the distinguished Senator from Texas has asked for a very \nnarrow change that does not make a lot of sense. Let me review, Mr. \nPresident, respectfully, why I make that comment.\n  Before welfare reform, all legal aliens were eligible for food \nstamps, for SSI, the Social Security income payments, and for Medicaid. \nBefore welfare reform, all of these persons were eligible. With the \npassage of welfare reform, most legal aliens became ineligible until \nsuch time as they became citizens.\n  But, Mr. President, follow carefully if you will. Refugees and \nasylees continued under welfare reform to be eligible for SSI, for food \nstamps, and for Medicaid. No new entitlement here. Welfare reform \nsimply continued their eligibility from the pre-welfare reform days.\n  Now, the balanced budget amendment restored Social Security to some \nof the legal aliens; namely, to children, elderly, the disabled who \nwere in this country on August 22, 1996, when we passed welfare reform. \nAnd it made asylees and refugees who already had benefits, who retained \nthose, eligible now for 7 years of Social Security income and Medicaid.\n  Mr. President, you might ask, while we were at it we all passed this \nbill, the balanced budget amendment with enthusiasm. Why did we not \nchange the food stamp provision from 5 years, which the refugees and \nasylees had, to 7 years to conform with what we were doing on income \nand the rest? Well, we did not because the Finance Committee had \njurisdiction over that particular money. The Agriculture Committee has \njurisdiction over food stamps. We were not in the picture. We are \ntoday. The intent of the motion of the Senator from Texas is in essence \nover the idea that the 5 years the refugees and asylees already had \nshould not go to 7 years, and we should go back to conference to \napparently knock back the 7 to 5. It is something which most Members \nfind incomprehensible.\n  The distinguished Senator has a larger point, I believe, in his \nmotion. He believes that however you phrase the food stamp situation, \nit is a beacon of hope for persons to come to our country, as he says, \nfor years, for decades. Well, perhaps, but the asylees and the refugees \nare not swarming across our borders. They are people one by one who \nmust present themselves and say and affirm: I am a potential victim of \npersecution, well-founded, and they have to prove that. If they do not \nprove it, they do not get in. And frequently people who had not gotten \nin went back and were killed. There are consequences to those \ndecisions.\n  The people presenting themselves are Evangelical Christians; they are \nJews from the former Soviet Union; they are Cubans who have tried to \nescape Castro; they are people who have fled from Somalia and from \nracial persecution in Bosnia recently. These are tough cases, and we \nrecognized that in the welfare reform bill. We said keep them with a \nsafety net because they do not have sponsors. They come with the shirts \non their backs. And we have done so because we are a humane people. \nWhat sort of people are we to think about denying persons who have come \nin these circumstances to our shores? This is not a neon sign \nadvertisement. It is simply a fact of the kind of country we are.\n  To send all of this back to conference over the fact that 5 years of \neligibility these people now have should be changed to 7 seems to me to \nbe an item the Senate should reject and do so decisively.\n  Finally, let me just simply say that Larry Craig, the distinguished \nSenator from Idaho, has said:\n\n       This is more than just a reauthorization bill. Legislation \n     before the Senate today is an investment in the future and \n     represents our commitment to America's farm families. By \n     providing the technical assistance and extension activities \n     that help expand farm income, improve resource management, \n     and develop new crop varieties, federally funded agricultural \n     research assures that our Nation will continue to lead the \n     world in farm production and help bolster the stability of \n     our rural areas.\n\n  I concur with that. This is not a question of an entitlement. It is \nthe question of our commitment in the farm bill.\n  We committed to America's farmers, for a 7-year period of time, a \nproposition--freedom to farm, the idea to manage your own land and \nplant for the future. And American farmers have responded to that. They \nhave planted over 10 million more acres. They have raised their income. \nThey have raised exports for America. But we said there will be a \nsafety net in this transition from the old days of supply management. \nIt includes payments to farmers that decrease over the next 5 years. It \nincludes the CRP, the Conservation Reserve Program, that tries to \nprotect the environment for a 5-year period of time. We believe it \nneeds to include farm research during this same period of the next 5 \nyears, and crop insurance with those guarantees. The argument is, it \ncould be done year by year, but this is not of great assurance to our \nfarmers.\n  So, for all these reasons, I ask the Gramm amendment be defeated and \nwe move on, then, to prompt passage of the conference report. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me explain why the amendment does make \nsense. And let me do it by going back to our welfare reform bill. I \nwould like to remind my colleagues, not that public popularity is the \nbe-all and end-all--it can often be misleading in the short term--but I \nam sure many of my colleagues are aware that when asked what action by \nCongress in the last 4 years they most approved of, the American \npeople, in a set of polls taken last month, said ``welfare reform.'' \nWhat we did in welfare reform is, we set higher standards for welfare \nand we defined work as the norm, and we defined welfare programs as \ntemporary programs to help people help themselves.\n  When we wrote the welfare reform bill in 1996, and I was active in it \nand was a conferee, this provision with regard to refugees was a hard-\nfought provision. Prior to the 1996 bill, there was no limit on the \namount of time that a refugee could get food stamps. Many people, \nincluding myself, wanted to set a strict limit on it, again with the \nidea that we were talking about transitional help, but we wanted people \nto come to America, as millions have come--and millions of Americans \nhave come as refugees; millions of Americans have come as refugees \nsince World War II.\n  We know that many of these refugees are really economic refugees but \nthey claim to be political refugees, and often it is very difficult to \ntell the difference because countries that have bad political systems \nnormally have bad economic systems.\n  So, after a real battle in conference, endless days of negotiations, \nwe settled\n\n[[Page S4669]]\n\non a 5-year limit. Now, in this bill, in a bill that, when it was \nconsidered in the Senate where it was amendable, there was no food \nstamp provision, there was no debate on this issue. When it was \nconsidered in the House, there was no provision expanding food stamps, \nno debate, no ability to amend it. Now we have a conference agreement \nthat adds $818 million back in food stamps that were denied as part of \nwelfare reform. This bill is a major step toward overturning the \nwelfare reform bill.\n  I have singled out this provision because I think it is critically \nimportant. Whenever proponents of the provision in the bill debate it, \nthey always like to talk about children, disabled, and elderly--and \ndon't we all?--because, obviously, that is where we can focus our \nconcern. But the provision that I am trying to deal with here has \nnothing to do with children, disabled, elderly, who were in the country \non the day we passed the welfare reform bill. The provision that I am \ntrying to deal with is the prospective provision which simply tries to \ndraw a line and says that we passed a welfare reform bill, we \nnegotiated this out, and here we are, 2 years after it went into \neffect, raising the number of years that you can be on food stamps \nunder the new welfare bill as an immigrant by an additional 2 years.\n  Why are we doing it? To quote one of the proponents, ``It provides \nseamless protections so people can come, get food stamps, become \ncitizens, and continue to get food stamps.''\n  I want people to come to America to go to work. I want our assistance \nprogram not to be a way of life. We debated this issue 3 years ago, and \nthose who believe that welfare should not be a way of life won on an \noverwhelming vote. Yet, over and over and over again, in little parts \nand parcels, we are undoing one of the major legislative activities \nthat we have undertaken in this decade. This bill is such an activity.\n\n  So, I am not for the food stamp provision, but I am not asking my \ncolleagues to strike it out. I am asking my colleagues to ask the \nconference to reconvene and to remove the prospective provision which \nsays that anyone coming in the future can qualify as a refugee and get \n7 years of food stamps. I believe that we are, through this provision, \ntaking a step to go back to the days, which we have recently put behind \nus, where we were asking people to come to America, not with their \nsleeves rolled up ready to go to work, but with their hand held out \nready to go on welfare.\n  This is a little issue. We are not talking about big amounts of \nmoney, but we are talking about a big principle: What do you want the \nbeacon drawing people to America to be? Do you want the beacon to be \nwelfare and food stamps? Or do you want the beacon to be the \nopportunity to live and work in the greatest country in the history of \nthe world?\n  So, to some people this may look like a small issue. We are not \ntalking about much money, because this bill is a 5-year bill. \nObviously, there are very few people--since you can get food stamps now \nfor 5 years, extending it to 7 will affect only a few people in the \nlast year of the bill. But the principle is a big principle, and the \nprinciple is, ``what kind of America do you want, and what kind of \nAmerican do you want?'' I want people from all over the world, from all \nkinds of backgrounds, who share one thing--a dream of having the \nopportunity to come to America and work and build their dream and the \nAmerican dream. That is what I am for. That is what this provision is \nabout.\n  I would like now, Mr. President, to yield 5 minutes to the Senator \nfrom North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Presiding Officer will inform Senators \nthat the Senator from Texas has 12 minutes 10 seconds remaining on his \ntime. The Senator from Indiana has 8 minutes.\n  The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I have few superlatives that I can \nclaim as a Member of the Senate, but one of them is that I have spent \n52 years in active agriculture, farming, and in all phases of it. I \nwould be hard pressed to find the crop or the livestock interest that I \nhave not, at one time or another, been involved in.\n  North Carolina is home to some of the most productive and largest \nfarms in the Nation and the finest agricultural research universities, \nby far, in the Nation. I don't think that I play second fiddle to any \nSenator in support for reauthorization of the agricultural extension \nbill. It is critical to the farmers of this country and to the \nuniversities and the ag research universities. But the bill also makes \nimportant reforms to the Crop Insurance Program that will benefit \nfarmers and taxpayers. Planting season is here, and we need to get it \nsettled, and I am ready and anxious to do it.\n  However, despite what I have just said, let me add, I don't play \nsecond fiddle to any Senator in my support of real welfare reform. \nWorkfare, not welfare, was the platform I ran on for the Senate in \n1992. The 1996 welfare reform bill, although watered down, was a real \naccomplishment for the 104th Congress. I preferred the first two bills \nthat were vetoed by the President, but the third was still a good bill. \nThat is why I am so disturbed that we are gutting the welfare reform \nand doing it in an agricultural research bill.\n  This bill restores food stamps for 250,000 immigrants. We sit here \nand say very nicely, ``But it doesn't amount to much; it is only 2 \nyears on to 5, so let the 2 years go.'' Will next year be at 10? In the \nfollowing session of Congress, do we go to infinity? That is the reason \nwe have a $5.5 trillion debt today, because 2 years wasn't very much, \nbut 3 would be fine, and we kept going.\n  In effect, it says,\n\n       Welcome to America. Come on, you don't have to be \n     productive. You know when you leave where you are and come to \n     this country that you are going to be eligible for food \n     stamps for 7 years, and by the time you get settled in, we \n     will change the law where you will be eligible and you won't \n     ever have to work because we will feed you.\n\n  We already restored SI payments. Now we are throwing food stamps for \nanother $80 million.\n  We also said that the welfare reform bill ended welfare as we know \nit. Unfortunately, this agricultural research bill is welfare reform as \nwe did it. These changes to the welfare reform law come at the \ninsistence of President Clinton. He vetoed the first two welfare reform \nbills, and he has succeeded in rewriting the one that he signed. If he \nwas going to start trying to rewrite it before the ink dried on it, he \nnever should have signed it.\n  I want the agricultural research bill without the food stamp \nprovision to pass. Nobody is more in support of agricultural research \nand the whole agricultural bill than I am. It is critical to North \nCarolina, but the food stamp provision is a another step toward \nreversal of the welfare reform bill.\n  Mr. President, the Statue of Liberty holds a torch of freedom, not a \nbook of food stamps and a lifetime right to not to have to work. That \nis the flag we are waving to people coming into this country: ``Sit \ndown, relax, you are home free.'' The Senator from Texas is doing the \nright thing, and I am proud to support him. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). Who yields time?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the conference \nreport and urge my colleagues to oppose the motion to recommit. For \nthose in agriculture, it is critical that we move this in a prompt and \nexpedited fashion and avoid any additional delay. The time for passage \nis now.\n  I congratulate Chairman Lugar, Senator Harkin and their staffs who \nhave labored for months to bring this legislation before us. Simply \nput, agriculture needs this now. Included in it are urgent reforms and \nfunding necessary to avoid a crisis which would undermine the viability \nof crop insurance--a safety net that farmers in my State and across the \ncountry cannot do without. This legislation is fully offset and paid \nfor and is supported by a united agriculture industry. After months of \ncareful and deliberate negotiations, a bipartisan agreement with the \nadministration has been developed. It was an agreement with the \nadministration and it takes into account the need to get the \nPresident's signature on it. I believe the work of the conferees should \nbe applauded and endorsed with our support today.\n\n[[Page S4670]]\n\n  I am particularly interested in the research title. We expect to see \nthe world's population double in the next 30 years. The demand for food \nis expected to triple in the next 50 years. The world's population \nwants more food, cheaper food, more nutritious food, safer food, food \nthat is easier to prepare and they want it produced on less land with \nfewer chemicals and in a more environmentally sensitive manner.\n  Those individuals who produce food and fiber for this world today--\nencumbered with what otherwise would be conflicting mandates--have \nnever faced a greater challenge. Technology is the answer.\n  Remarkably, plant technology in this half-century has helped make it \npossible for the farmer, who in 1940 fed 19 people, to feed 129 people \ntoday.\n  Nobel prize-winning chemist Robert F. Curl of Rice University \nproclaimed that: ``* * * it is clear that the 21st will be the century \nof biology.'' The March 27 article in Science Magazine entitled: ``A \nThird Technological Revolution,''--after the Industrial and Computer-\nbased revolutions--contends that: ``Ultimately, the world will obtain \nmost of its food, fuel, fiber, chemicals and some of its \npharmaceuticals from genetically altered vegetation and trees.''\n  The possibilities are breathtaking and the U.S. is poised to lead the \nthird technological revolution as we unlock the secrets plant-by-plant \nand now, genome-by-genome.\n  Simply put, this research is about meeting the world's growing \nnutritional needs, protecting U.S. jobs and preserving the environment.\n  The legislation before us looks ahead to the challenges of the 21st \ncentury by providing additional funding on what all of us back home say \nis a priority; research. It provides $600 million for the Initiative \nfor Future Agriculture and Food Systems. This will augment our federal \ncommitment to undertake cutting-edge research in priority areas such as \ngenome studies, biotechnology, food safety, precision agriculture and \nnew use development.\n  I cite as an example, the University of Missouri has just tested a \nnew hybrid corn which when fed to swine reduces phosphorous in manure \nby a whopping 37 percent. The Monsanto Company, in my State, is using \nbiotechnology to produce cotton plants with genes that produce colors \nto reduce the need for chemical dyeing. From the corn plant, they have \nproduced a human-like antibody that holds promise for allowing cancer \npatients to tolerate more frequent doses of a tumor-shrinking drug. The \npossibilities are breathtaking and the U.S. is leading the charge.\n  Let me say one thing to those who represent agriculture states. \nAlmost 70 percent of the USDA budget is not for research or export \npromotion or conservation or for subsidies to farmers--it is for food \nand nutrition programs, primarily the food stamp program. For those who \nhave watched over the years as a greater and greater percentage of USDA \nfunds have gone to welfare, often at the expense of programs that \nassist farmers and conservation, this legislation moves $1 billion back \nto agriculture.\n  While I understand that some here today would like to see less money \nfor food stamps for legal immigrants, others would like to see more. I \nrecall that the Administration proposed in their budget that all this \nadministrative savings go for legal immigrants and have threatened to \nveto crop insurance and research if it didn't also include funding for \nfood stamps for legal immigrants.\n  The food stamp provisions of this act are an essential step to \nproviding much needed assistance to certain legal immigrants. Attempts \nto undo this carefully-crafted bipartisan compromise will result in \ndelay and ultimately undermine the entire bill.\n  The bipartisan leaders have worked hard to craft a bill that the \nPresident will accept. There should be no further delay and I urge my \ncolleagues to reject the motion to recommit and move swiftly to final \nadoption of the conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I don't have any time, but I ask if somebody will give \nme a couple minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from New \nMexico?\n  Mr. GRAMM. How much time do we have on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has 6 minutes, 47 \nseconds; the Senator from Indiana has 4 minutes, 43 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Do we have a time certain to vote, or when the time \nexpires?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote will occur when all debate time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator might have 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I won't \nobject, but I hope if we are going to go down this path that the other \nside be afforded equal opportunity to have additional time, if so \nrequested. I don't request it, but in case somebody does request it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Indiana, what \ndoes he think about this? Does he want 5 minutes himself if I get 5?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes, Mr. President. Can we amend the request that there be \nan additional 5 minutes for me to speak?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, the Senator is not going to speak on behalf \nof my amendment; he just wants to speak on the bill itself.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator give me 2 minutes, and that will be \nenough.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me repeat my request. Since the Senator is not going \nto engage in the debate before us, but has relevant comments about the \nbill before us, and we hope, obviously another motion, infinite number \nof motions are in order, but we hope this will settle the order, I make \na unanimous consent request that the Senator have 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Reserving the right to object, I renew my request that \nSenator Domenici have 5 additional minutes and I have 5 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I would like 5 additional minutes, then, as well.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Alabama 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am very, very reluctant to rise in \nopposition to this conference report as it is presently constituted, \nand in support of the motion to return this legislation to the \nconference committee. I believe, however, that returning this \nlegislation to the conference committee is the proper and appropriate \nthing to do. Having said that, I feel that there are some marvelous \nprovisions contained within this bill. For example, agricultural \nresearch is very important, and this legislation will strengthen and \nimprove the work being done to advance this field. Similarly, crop \ninsurance will be made sound under this legislation. Both are matters \nof critical importance to me.\n  I do not believe that sending the legislation back to the conference \ncommittee to fix this bill's entitlement expansion in the Food Stamp \nProgram will kill this bill or extraordinarily delay it or in any way \njeopardize the fundamental reforms that are contained in it. Sending \nthe bill back to conference simply reflects routine business practices \nin this Senate.\n  Under this legislation's expansion of the food stamp entitlement, \n250,000 new people will be added to the food stamp rolls. In my last \ncampaign, I talked about the fact that the President had committed to \nundermining the welfare reform bill that was passed several years ago. \nThese provisions have proven that statement to be true. This bill\n\n[[Page S4671]]\n\nexpands from 5 to 7 years the amount of time noncitizens can draw food \nstamps. It is an expansion of that policy, and it is the kind of \nexpansion I think is not justified. Will we next year come back for 10 \nyears? Will it be 15 years? What will be the next revision?\n  There will always be pressure for us to expand and expand and expand. \nI think we have to show some integrity and some fortitude on this \nissue. And so, with great reluctance, I have to say to the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee and the members of that \ncommittee that I cannot vote for this bill. I cannot vote for it \nbecause I told the people of Alabama I was not coming up here and \nvoting for the undermining of the welfare bill that was passed last \ntime. I cannot justify this expansion of the Food Stamp Program. So if \nwe cannot send it back, I will be forced to vote no. I will hate to \nhave to do that. I think supporting this motion to recommit the bill is \nthe best way to address this issue.\n  I thank the Senator from Texas for his leadership and courage in \nraising this important issue, because we have to get to a point in this \ncountry where we can contain our spending tendencies, and if we do not, \nwe will never maintain a balanced budget.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the ranking member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my colleague and compliment him on his leadership \non this bill and all aspects of the bill, on research on crop insurance \nand food stamps.\n  I listened with some amusement to my friend and colleague from Texas \ntalking about this issue, saying that it is principle, that he is doing \nthis on principle. I know we passed the Balanced Budget Act last year \nin the Senate. That extended from 5 to 7 years Medicaid and SSI to the \nsame refugees and asylees we are talking about. I do not recall the \nSenator from Texas then offering an amendment to strike it out of the \nBalanced Budget Act.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I voted no, I would like the Senator to be aware of that.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I believe the Record will show the Senator from Texas \nvoted when the Balanced Budget Act passed the Senate.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I did. And I voted no.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I believe the Senator voted aye when the Balanced Budget \nAct passed the Senate--maybe not on the conference report but when it \npassed the Senate. And that provision was in the Senate bill to extend \nit to 7 years.\n  Secondly, the Senator from Texas may be philosophically opposed to \nfood stamps. That is fine. That is his position--that may be his \nposition. That is another debate for another time. We settled that in \nwelfare reform, and we settled it in the Balanced Budget Act last year.\n  All we are doing now is making food stamps compatible with Medicaid \nand SSI. So I hope the Senator would not hold our farmers hostage, \nbecause that is what is happening. We know full well, if this goes back \nto conference, it is dead. We have hundreds of thousands of farmers who \nneed crop insurance this summer. Over 106,000 winter wheat policies \nright now will be up on September 30. Farmers all over the plains \nStates will not be able to renew their policies. Many farmers use their \ncrop insurance policies as collateral in order to secure an operating \nloan. So if we do not have that, thousands of farmers will not have \naccess to the credit they need to get the crop in. That is why we need \nto pass this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LUGAR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana has 2 minutes 40 \nseconds.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I yield myself that time.\n  Mr. President, let me make as clear as I can the parliamentary \nsituation. We have tried, in the Ag Committee since last fall, to pass \na sound research bill. We succeeded last fall. The House did not act \nfinally until the end of the session and did not appoint conferees \nuntil a short time ago.\n  It has been a very difficult conference--not the first time such a \nthing has occurred. Conferences in the Congress have occurred \nfrequently. Compromises are made.\n  Mr. President, to suggest glibly that we can go back to conference if \nthe motion made by the Senator from Texas passes, simply excise what he \nwishes, and return to the Senate with a bill, is inaccurate. I have \ntested the conferees, and they will not change. The Senator from Texas \nmay not change. Furthermore, if changes are made, the Secretary of \nAgriculture has written to the committee that he will recommend the \nPresident veto the bill. Now we can all estimate, Is the President \nbluffing? Is the Secretary accurate? Will somebody weaken on the House \nside--maybe many people--and suddenly see the light? Conceivably, Mr. \nPresident. And I pledge I will try. Patiently, for 6 months, I have \ntried, and if need be, I will continue to do that.\n  My prediction is, there will be a considerable delay with regard to \ncrop insurance, probably a year or 2 delay in terms of research, and in \ndue course I have no idea what will happen on the food stamp issue.\n  But, Mr. President, let me simply say, we have a remarkable \npossibility for achievement here today that I hope will not be defeated \non a very narrow point. I understand the objections of our colleagues, \nbut I understand an overwhelming majority, 74 Senators, expressed \nthemselves in writing that this is their will. I hope we will have an \nopportunity to manifest it in passage of the report.\n  I yield back our remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has 3 minutes 23 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n2 minutes.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank Senator Gramm.\n  I did not really think my few words would be this controversial, but \nI want to share with the Senate a concern. It is not just about this \nbill. But it seems to me that every day or so we are talking about an \napproach here in the U.S. Senate which essentially wipes out last \nyear's budget agreement. The cornerstone to last year's budget \nagreement was the caps we placed on discretionary spending, both \ndefense and domestic. That means, written in the law are numbers that \nwe said we will not violate; that we will not exceed this level of \nspending.\n  Everybody who is getting anything from Government would like to turn \nthose discretionary programs into mandatory programs, so they are not \nsubject to the caps. Everybody would like to have a guarantee that \ntheir program is going to get funded. That is what we call an \nentitlement or a mandatory program. We are talking about that in this \nbill. We are talking about that in the tobacco bill in a very big way.\n  What is happening now is that we are absolutely breaking the \nagreement we made, which was so solemn, about getting our budget under \ncontrol. Every time the budget bites and it squeals a little because a \ndecision is tough, we find a way to avoid it and spend the money in \nanother way. It is money nonetheless, and it is adding to the size of \nGovernment nonetheless.\n  Frankly, I do not agree with Senator Gramm's position on this bill in \nterms of the food stamps provisions. But I, frankly, do not believe we \nought to shut our eyes to a tendency that could become a very big \nstream. We are forgetting about appropriated accounts and caps, \nunderstandings and agreements, and finding brand new ways to fund \nprograms that will be on automatic pilot.\n  I submit to you, from the taxpayers' standpoint, there is absolutely \nno difference. If you are using a dollar of taxpayers' money to break \nthe caps that we agreed upon or if you are spending a dollar for a new \nentitlement program, it is the same effect.\n  I hate to make this statement on this bill because I am not \nnecessarily saying the bill should go down to defeat. But I want to \nwarn the Senate--and I am going to warn the Senate on every bill that \ncircumvents the caps--that this is not the way we got to balance.\n\n[[Page S4672]]\n\n This is not what we promised the American people and the marketplace \nin terms of where we were going as a Congress, and I plan to call that \nto everyone's attention on a regular basis.\n  I yield the floor and thank the Senator for time.\n  Mr. GRAMM. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think Senator Lugar put his finger on the \nsituation when he said that the President would veto the agriculture \nresearch bill and crop insurance if the bill didn't contain $818 \nmillion worth of new food stamps adding 250,000 people to the food \nstamp rolls. I believe that is piracy. I do not believe the President \nwould veto this bill. Further, I am confident that we would override \nhis veto, and I think it is imperative that we start standing up and \ndefending the major actions we take, and welfare is one of those \nactions.\n  This bill is going to effectively raise the level of spending in the \nFederal Government by $1.86 billion, because we are going to pay for \nfour entitlement programs in this bill, and we are going to free up \n$1.86 billion to be spent on discretionary spending. I intend to oppose \nthe bill. I hope my colleagues will vote for this motion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having expired, the question occurs \non the motion to recommit the conference report to the committee on \nconference with instructions offered by the Senator from Texas, Mr. \nGramm.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 23, nays 77, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 128 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--23\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Gramm\n     Gregg\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     McCain\n     Nickles\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Snowe\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n\n                                NAYS--77\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Smith (OR)\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The motion was rejected.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LUGAR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I have requests from other Senators wanting \nto speak on other subjects. I would ask the Chair, is it possible we \ncould move to disposition of the business before us?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the conference \nreport?\n  Is there further debate on the conference report?\n  Mr. KOHL. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nAgriculture Research conference report. A great deal of thanks and \nappreciation is due to Senators Lugar and Harkin for their hard work \nand efforts to reform and prioritize USDA's agriculture research, \nextension and education activities.\n  This conference report is extremely important to the agricultural \ncommunity. It invests $1.7 billion in agricultural research to develop \nthe new technology that will be used by farms in the next five to ten \nyears, to solve the projected shortfall in crop insurance funding, and \nto support the Fund for Rural America.\n  The nation's Land-Grant Universities work with the USDA on issues \nranging from the international competitiveness of our family farms, to \nnew food borne illness problems, to ground water contamination. We need \nto support their efforts with a robust research budget in line with \nother agencies' research budgets. This bill puts us on the track to do \nthat, and I support it.\n  I am also pleased to speak in strong support of the provisions of \nthis bill restoring food stamps to legal immigrants.\n  Mr. President, I supported the 1996 welfare reform law. The time had \nclearly come for radical change. We rightly concluded that nothing \nerodes the human spirit more readily than dependence on handouts, and \nwe instituted reforms based upon the principles of personal \nresponsibility and hard work.\n  But in some cases, a helping hand is truly necessary, and sometimes \nso much help is needed that only the Federal government is capable of \nproviding it. This is clearly the case with respect to certain classes \nof legal immigrants. The welfare law provisions restricting legal \nimmigrant access to food stamps went too far.\n  Legal immigrants pay taxes and serve in our armed forces. They are \nnot granted all the privileges of U.S. citizenship, but are expected to \nfulfill most of the responsibilities of citizenship. The ban on food \nstamps for elderly, disabled and other needy legal immigrants from food \nstamps was harsh and unfair.\n  While myself and others argued that point during debate on the \nwelfare bill in 1996, the majority of us have learned it since then. In \nany case, we should all feel confident that we are doing the right \nthing today by voting for this bill.\n  Mr. President, my support for the food stamps restoration is \nparticularly heart-felt due to my concern for the Hmong and other legal \nimmigrants from Laos and their families. As my colleagues may know, the \nHmong fought along side our American men and women in the Vietnam War. \nThey risked their lives on behalf of all that we hold dear in this \ncountry--freedom from oppression, democracy and the pursuit of \nhappiness--and fled to the United States following the War out of fear \nof persecution. To them, we truly owe a debt of gratitude.\n  There are 250,000 Hmong and Lao people living in the United States, \napproximately 40,000 of whom live in Wisconsin. Of those 40,000, \nroughly 7000 lost eligibility for food stamps under the welfare law. \nAnd 75 percent of those individuals who have lost food stamps in \nWisconsin live in households with children.\n  The Hmong and highland people have enriched our country and enriched \nWisconsin. They have worked hard to support their families and give \nback to their communities. Simply put, we are thankful for all they did \nand thankful for the contributions they continue to make.\n  Last year, we took steps to restore SSI benefits to the Hmong and \nother worthy immigrants, and today we are right to take this step with \nrespect to food stamps.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the conference \nreport?\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the importance of \npassing the Conference Report on the Agricultural Research Bill, S. \n1150.\n  This bill has the overwhelming support of over 70 Senators, yet we \nhave continued to struggle here in the Senate to get this critically \nimportant legislation passed.\n  In recent years, American agriculture has greatly changed. Because of \nthe 1996 Farm Bill, our producers rely greatly on the crop insurance \nprogram to protect them from production risk. The reforms in \nagricultural research programs included in S. 1150\n\n[[Page S4673]]\n\nprovide a roadmap for the future of agriculture. As importantly, it \nincludes a funding stream to fund important new investments in \nagricultural research and rural development by creating and funding The \nInitiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems and by extending the \nFund for Rural America.\n  And yes, to the chagrin of some, this legislation reinstates food \nstamp benefits for our most vulnerable legal immigrants. I would hasten \nto point out that these provisions are modeled on sections of last \nyear's Balanced Budget Act that restored eligibility for Supplemental \nSecurity Income and Medicaid to some legal immigrants.\n  I applaud the Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee and \nSenator Harkin for their leadership in crafting the balanced compromise \ninherent in this legislation. Attempts to derail this compromise put at \nrisk the important investments in agriculture and the sound research \nand crop insurance reforms included in the bill.\n  Living in a state like South Dakota, I know first hand, and as most \nof you saw during last year's disaster, what continual flooding can do \nto our precious farm land. Again, this year, eight counties in \nnortheastern South Dakota are again experiencing severe flooding \nconditions.\n  Without a strong safety net, crop insurance remains as the only \nsafety net for producers to protect them from the vagaries of nature. \nThis bill provides nearly $500 million for partial funding for this \nimportant risk management tool.\n  I have been informed by several crop insurance agents in South Dakota \nthat the Agricultural Research Bill must be passed soon or many \nproducers face the possible cancellation of their policies. Keep in \nmind, these policies, are in many cases, the only protection producers \nhave from disasters which are not of their acts of mismanagement but as \nacts of nature.\n  The bill covers all facets of federally funded agricultural research, \nincluding: the Agriculture Research Service of USDA; the Cooperative \nExtension Service; Land Grant Universities such as South Dakota State \nUniversity and competitive research and extension programs open to \nother entities.\n  S. 1150 includes comprehensive research provisions for our nation's \nland grant universities. For example, South Dakota State University \n(SDSU) and other small state schools are protected in this bill by \nallowing a great deal of flexibility in how SDSU will meet new \nrequirements that direct a percentage of all research and extension \nfunds toward multi-state, disciplinary, and integrated research and \nextension activities. For example, if SDSU is working on a project that \nmay need expertise from the University of South Dakota, they will be \nable to include that toward meeting the multi-state research component.\n  I am also pleased that the conferees have agreed to authorize a \ncompetitive research program for tribal colleges, otherwise known as \nthe 1994 institutions.\n  Unlike the significant research programs that have existed for \ndecades for 1862 and 1890 land-grant institutions, the 1994 \ninstitutions currently do not have authorization for an agriculture \nresearch program, and thus are not full partners in the land-grant \nsystem.\n  This legislation mitigates this inequity by establishing a modest, \ncompetitive research program for the 1994 institutions. Funded research \nwould address high priority concerns of local tribal, national, and \nmulti-state significance and would be conducted through cooperative \nagreement with 1862 and 1890 land-grant institutions.\n  Although it is true that some tribal colleges are not yet ready to \nconduct research, many of them have the capability. Some current \nresearch includes:\n  (1) Water quality research: Conducted through contracts with Indian \nTribes, which are required to meet certain standards under the federal \nClean Water Act.\n  (2) Wildlife research: Conducted by a handful of tribal colleges to \nevaluate and find solutions for the adverse impact of pesticides on \nlocal wild bird and deer populations, and to research problems \nassociated with amphibians and irrigation project lines.\n  (3) Native plant research: Conducted because new development on and \nnear tribal lands is taking a serious toll on wetland areas. This \nimpacts the niche environment of native plants, which are traditionally \nused for medicinal and other purposes. This is an example of the kind \nof research that most larger institutions would not focus on because it \nwill not lead to large-scale production agriculture. Without the \nresearch currently being conducted at Salish Kootenai College in Pablo, \nMontana, the nation risks losing some of our native plants.\n  (4) Range cattle research: Currently underway at several tribal \ncolleges, to address problems of range cattle traversing streams and \nimpacting water quality (and possibly impacting native trout and other \nfish populations). In addition, one tribal college is conducting \nresearch and development on a new strain of more rigorous cattle.\n  This is just a sampling of the kind of research currently ongoing at \nthe tribal colleges. The primary focus of this research is on the use \nof niche products to develop and expand reservation economies; the \npreservation and cultivation of land; and the strengthening of families \nand communities.\n  The tribal colleges have not asked for millions and millions of \ndollars to conduct costly basic research. Rather, they ask for research \nauthority to protect and improve the earth on which they live and to \nensure the viability of the plants and animals with which they co-\nexist.\n  Another provision of this legislation addresses an inequity in the \n1994 land-grant extension program. Under the reauthorization, 1994 \ninstitutions would be permitted to enter into cooperative agreements \nwith any 1862 or 1890 institution in the United States, rather than \nbeing limited to agreements with only the 1862 in their state.\n  This provision is important to the effort to create productive, cost-\nefficient extension programs in Indian Country. Under current law, to \nparticipate in extension programs, 1994 institutions are required to \nenter into cooperative agreements with the 1862 institution in their \nstate, and funding for the program goes to the 1862 institutions rather \nthan the 1994 institutions.\n  In the case of Sitting Bull College, which straddles the border of \nNorth and South Dakota, and Din College, which has campuses in Arizona \nand New Mexico, this restrictive language could seriously hamper \nefforts to create the most productive extension program possible for \nthe relevant service area.\n  This clarification simply makes good business sense. Why should a \n1994 or an 1862 institution be prohibited, for fiscal or bureaucratic \nreasons, from partnering with an institution that has the expertise and \nresources that are most beneficial to the students and communities the \ninstitution serves?\n  To correct this problem, the legislation states that 1994 \ninstitutions may enter into cooperative agreements with any 1862 or \n1890 institution in the United States, rather than being limited to an \nagreement with only the 1862 in their state. Further, the bill directs \nthe Secretary of Agriculture to fund the 1994 institutions directly, \nrather than passing the funding through mainstream institutions.\n  Again, Mr. President, passage of the Agricultural Research Bill is \ncrucial to the future of American agriculture. Our Nation's farmers and \nranchers work hard each and every day. Not only do they produce an \nabundant supply of food, they produce it at the most inexpensive price \nto consumers in the entire world.\n  With the support of over 70 Senators, this bill has enough support to \npass with wide-ranging support. This bill enjoys the support of \nconstituencies--both urban and rural, both--nutritional advocates and \ncrop insurers. It would be a great travesty to allow this bill to fall \nvictim to the philosophical ideologies of a very few.\n  If we do not act on this immediately, it will show our lack of \nleadership to help some of our most valuable as well as our most \nvulnerable members of our society.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass this bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate the efforts of the chairman of \nthe Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, Senator Lugar and \nthe Ranking Member, Senator Harkin, on the research conference report.\n  I want to highlight that over 70 Senators--including myself--signed a \nletter to the majority leader urging him to give us an opportunity to \nvote on\n\n[[Page S4674]]\n\nthis conference report as soon as possible.\n  The conference agreements we worked out represent a very good package \nwith four major components: crop insurance funding, agricultural \nresearch funding, rural development initiatives and food stamp \nassistance for legal immigrants.\n  I know that farmers who need crop insurance are very worried--and \nwith good reason--that crop insurance policies will be canceled if this \nreport does not pass.\n  I know that the agricultural research community, with its Land Grant \nUniversity system, very strongly supports this research funding so that \nAmerica can be more competitive in world markets.\n  In addition to benefiting farmers and the agricultural research \ncommunity, the report benefits all rural residents thorough its rural \ndevelopment programs.\n  Sometimes it is forgotten that most rural Americans are not farmers--\nthis effort benefits both farmers and other rural Americans.\n  I also want to speak briefly on the food stamp changes. The food \nstamp changes simply restore benefits for certain level immigrants. The \nchanges are modeled on last year's Balanced Budget Act that restored \neligibility for SSI and Medicaid to some legal immigrants.\n  For example, the conference report would apply the provisions in the \nBalance Budget Act--that extended benefits from 5 years, to 7 years, \nfor refugees and asylum seekers for SSI and Medicaid--to the food stamp \nprogram.\n  The 1996 welfare law made an exception for these types of refugees \nbecause they typically come to this country with very little after \nescaping persecution abroad. They often have no sponsors.\n  In the past many of them fought along with U.S. troops against our \ncommon enemies. Some may have escaped from enemy prisoner of war camps.\n  That 5-year limit proved unrealistic because of long backlogs at the \nINS. In a number of INS offices, these backlogs exceeded two years. If \nthe eligibility of these refugees ended after five years in the \ncountry, they could be left without recourse while their applications \nto naturalize were in the INS ``pipeline.''\n  The extension of eligibility for SSI and Medicaid to allow them to \nreceive benefits during their first seven years in this country was not \ncontroversial last year: it was included in all major Republican and \nDemocratic proposals for legal immigrants.\n  It should not be controversial this year.\n  It should be noted that this provision does not assure that these \nrefugees will receive benefits for two more years--they still have to \nbe otherwise eligible for food stamps.\n  Refugees and asylum seekers still would have to meet the same \ncriteria that all other people have to meet to qualify for benefits.\n  By conforming food stamp rules to those already adopted for Medicaid \nlast summer, the Agricultural Research Conference Report would avoid \nimposing multiple inconsistent eligibility rules on state and local \nagencies that administer both programs.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Senator Lugar and Senator Harkin in \ntheir efforts to get the agricultural research conference report passed \nas quickly as possible. America's rural areas, its farmers and the \nresearch community are eagerly awaiting passage of this report.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Conference \nAgreement on S. 1150, the Agricultural Research, Extension, and \nEducation Reform Act of 1998. This measure will solidify the financial \nfoundation for crop insurance and agriculture research well into the \nnext century. Agriculture research and crop insurance are vital to \nAmerica's farming and ranching livelihood.\n  Research, crop insurance, regulatory relief, and expanded markets \nplay a vital role in moving federal farm policy away from government \nintrusion and toward a free market through the Federal Agriculture \nImprovement and Reform Act of 1996. Farmers and ranchers now have \ngreater flexibility in their crop and livestock production efforts. \nCrop insurance and research efforts are both tools that will help farm \nproducers become more competitive as they move toward a greater \nreliance on the free market and less upon the federal treasury.\n  No country in the world can match America's efficiency in \nagricultural production. Not only is this a result of American \ningenuity and hard work, it's also the result of our investment in \ncutting edge research. Our research efforts have led to more efficient \nproduction, better products, new uses for our products--all of which \nhave led to new markets where we can sell our products. S. 1150 \nprovides 600 million dollars for the Initiative for Future Agriculture \nand Food Systems.\n  The global demand for our agricultural goods will continue to grow as \nthe world's population increases and as more nations achieve higher \nstandards of living, resulting in a demand for better diets. Research \nallows American agriculture to meet the world's demand for food and \nfiber. Under S. 1150, research dollars will go toward new and \nalternative uses of agricultural commodities and products, agricultural \nbiotechnology, agricultural genome research, natural resource \nmanagement, precision agriculture, food safety, and food technology and \nhuman nutrition. These dollars will help our agriculture research \nfacilities, such as the University of Nebraska, to continue to lead the \nworld in crop and livestock production sciences.\n  Expanded markets and increased trade are a clear byproduct of \nagricultural research. Research will lead American agriculture into the \nnext century and keep American farmers and ranchers at the forefront of \nglobal food and fiber production. Research, global food production, \nglobal trade and farming profits are all connected.\n  Crop insurance is also vital to the long-term health of American \nagriculture. Farming and ranching involves risk. That's a fact of life \nin American agriculture. Crop insurance provides a very important \nmanagement tool for our agricultural producers to withstand \nfluctuations in the market and changes in weather and production \nconditions.\n  For example, in recent years, severe weather conditions have forced \nsome Nebraska farmers to face the loss of their crops and livestock. \nProtecting farmers and the agri-businesses that depend on them from \nsuffering major losses is what crop insurance alternatives do for \nAmerica's producers. Comprehensive crop insurance plans will minimize \nlosses for many agricultural producers so that the economic damage from \ndiminished crop yields is not overwhelming for our rural towns and \ncommunities. This conference report provides 500 million dollars to \npartially fund crop insurance delivery expenses.\n  Research and crop insurance are interconnected with agricultural \nproduction and basic farm and ranch income. Research keeps American \nagriculture on the leading edge of production technology. Crop \ninsurance minimizes the many risks involved with producing food and \nfiber for the world's growing population.\n  I strongly support S. 1150 and urge my colleagues to support its \nadoption.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for the \nAgriculture Research Reauthorization bill.\n  This bill reaffirms our commitment to American agriculture in a \nnumber of ways. It reauthorizes existing research programs at our land \ngrant universities and goes one step further in creating a new, \ncompetitive research initiative to study some of the most cutting edge \nagricultural issues of the day: food safety, agricultural \nbiotechnology, precision agriculture and the competitiveness of small \nand medium sized farms.\n  As well, it maintains our commitment to the federal crop insurance \nprogram, perhaps the most successful public-private partnership our \ngovernment has to boast of.\n  And just as importantly, it restores our commitment to legal \nimmigrants who are elderly, disabled, or children. Restoring food stamp \nbenefits to these groups of people is simply the right thing to do.\n  But while I commend the conferees for their work in satisfying many \nparties with their work on this bill, I rise to say it does not go far \nenough.\n  We have perhaps no more important research need than that of \nagricultural research. It represents 2% of the total federal research \nbudget. Yet, between\n\n[[Page S4675]]\n\ntoday and thirty years from now, we are going to add 5 billion people \nto the planet. And all those people are going to need to be fed. And \nthey are likely to be fed on less acres, not more.\n  The caloric requirement to feed those additional 5 billion people \nwill be more than the caloric consumption for the past 10,000 years. It \nis a huge increase in consumption requirements. And our research is the \nkey to solving that problem. There is a tremendous amount at stake here \nfor those who worry about peace and prosperity.\n  We take this agricultural research for granted. Indeed, we take all \nof agriculture too much for granted. But agricultural research has \nadded so much value to our productive capacities, as well as to the \nquality of our lives, that it is ridiculous to be struggling to pay for \nit as we are right now.\n  At the same time, we are going to double the funding for the National \nInstitute of Health, and double the funding for the National Science \nFoundation. I support both of those things. But it won't do us any good \nat all to live longer through NIH investments if we short agricultural \nresearch and we aren't able to feed ourselves. And that's precisely \nwhat will happen if we don't come up with some satisfactory way to \nguarantee a long-term funding of ag research at higher levels than we \nhave provided in the past.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support \nof the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of \n1998. The conference report before us reauthorizes various agriculture \nresearch programs at land-grant colleges and universities through 2002. \nIn addition, it provides for $600 million over five years for a new \ncompetitive grants program for research in key areas such as \nagricultural genome, food safety, nutrition, new and alternative uses \nof agricultural commodities and products, biotechnology, natural \nresource management, and farm efficiency. This bill also contains \nimportant provisions which authorize funding for crop insurance, rural \ndevelopment, and to restore food stamps to certain legal immigrants.\n  The critics of S. 1150 most often question the costs of the various \nprovisions included in the conference report. However, it is important \nto note that our investment in agricultural research provides a \ntremendous return to our economy, generating economic growth and tax \nrevenue through increased agricultural productivity. This return is \nestimated to be between 35% and 50% nationwide--and even greater in \nOregon. Additionally, in terms of constant dollars, federal spending on \nagriculture research has declined over the last ten years while other \nnon-defense research spending in such areas as health, space \nexploration, and the environment has increased. As an added assurance \nthat these funds will be spent in the most efficient way possible, the \nconference report contains provisions which increase the accountability \nof these research projects, making them subject to competition, \nrequiring more stakeholder input, peer and merit review, and greater \ncollaboration amongst the research institutions involved. Further, the \nbenefits of other important provisions contained in this bill, such as \nfunding for crop insurance, rural development, and restoration of food \nstamps to certain legal immigrants, far outweigh the arguments against \nthis legislation. I am especially pleased with the food stamp provision \nwhich allows the resources of private charitable groups, such as the \nOregon Food Bank, to reach a wider spectrum of our communities. What \nbetter way to use these funds than to enhance our food production, feed \nour nation's hungry, and protect America's farmland?\n  Currently, some of the most important work in the area of agriculture \nresearch is being done in my state, where more than 140,000 jobs are \ntied to farm production, In just one example, research at Oregon State \nUniversity facilities on wheat strains and diseases has resulted in an \nestimated $8 million in increased wheat productivity per year. Results \nof their studies are shared with other states like Idaho, Montana, \nUtah, Kansas, and Colorado, presented at national and international \nsymposiums, published in scientific journals, and communicated through \nindustry newsletters. Again, this is just one of the many valuable \nresearch projects undertaken in my state by OSU through this \npartnership of federal and state funds.\n  Agriculture in my state is diverse--reflecting the varied geography, \nsoil, an climate types of Oregon's beautiful mountains, valleys, \ncoastline, deserts, and forests. There really is no such thing as an \naverage farmer in my state. He or she may be a large scale wheat \ngrower, a small orchardist, a producer of high quality nursery plants, \nor a family farmer maintaining cranberry bogs. Despite the varied \nbackgrounds of Oregon's farmers, all of them, and I think this would \napply to farmers across the country as well, are working hard to \nmaintain America's leadership in agricultural production despite \nunrelenting pressure from all sides--pressure to continue to produse \nthe world's safest food supply while competing with imports that may be \nheavily subsidized, produced with pesticides illegal in the U.S., or \neven, as was widely reported in the media just yesterday, not even \nmeeting our food safety standards.\n  For the small family farmer, who still exists in my state, this \npressure is compounded by the struggle to maintain the way of life \nwhich fed our grandparents and their parents before them. Everyday they \ndefend their farm, perhaps part of their family for generations, for \nencroaching development, inheritance taxes, and complicated and ever \nincreasing governmental regulations. Breakthroughs brought about as a \ndirect result of the research dollars we will be voting on today may \nmean that family farmers in Southern Oregon may be able to squeeze \nenough productivity out of their land to hold onto their farms for a \nfew more seasons. Or it may mean that a grass seed farmer in the \nWillamette Valley can export more grass straw to Japan due to a quality \nassurance program. Or it may mean a farmer in the Columbia Basin can \nuse fewer pesticides on pea plants due to new, more pest resistant \nstrains or new growing techniques. For them, the components of this \nbill represent the American research and technological know-how that \nhas kept them ahead of the curve--and hopefully, with your support \ntoday, will continue to do so into the future.\n  Let's give our farmers the tools they need to continue to produce a \nsafe and bountiful food supply for our families. The conference report \nbefore us reaffirms the traditionally strong Congressional support for \nAmerican agricultural leadership. This legislation enjoys overwhelming \nbipartisan support and I urge my colleagues to join me in casting a \nvote in favor of S. 1150.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, at long last, we are about to pass the \nAgricultural Research, Extension and Education Reform Act conference \nreport. I support all its provisions, but I want to speak briefly about \none of the most important--the restoration of food stamps for legal \nimmigrants whose benefits were unfairly eliminated by the harsh 1996 \nwelfare law. Although the amount in this conference report is less than \nhalf of the $2 billion proposed in the President's budget, it is at \nleast a down-payment toward restoring food stamps to the nation's \nneediest legal immigrants.\n  The food stamp program was cut by $25 billion over 5 years in the \n1996 law. That reduction was clearly unfair. According to the \nDepartment of Agriculture, at least 935,000 low-income legal immigrants \nlost their federal food stamps as a result of the 1996 welfare law. \nNearly two-thirds are families with children. Two years later, we are \nfinally remedying a significant part of this injustice.\n  This bill restores food stamps only to the most needy legal \nimmigrants--refugees, the disabled, and some poor children. It helps \nonly 250,000 out of the 935,000 immigrants cut off from the food stamp \nrolls. No one should think our work is done with the passage of this \nbill.\n  The effect of the food stamp terminations is not limited to \nimmigrants. Their children born here are American citizens, but they \ntoo are facing sharp reductions in their food stamps. These children \nremain eligible for food stamps themselves, but the removal of their \nparents from the program means that, as a practical matter, the food \nstamp benefits for their families have been cut by 50 to 70 percent in \nmany cases. 600,000 poor children who are American citizens live in \nfamilies\n\n[[Page S4676]]\n\nwhere food stamp benefits have been unfairly lost. These children will \nnot be helped by this bill.\n  Many elderly immigrants will also receive no assistance from this \nbill. We cannot forget about their plight. We can and must do more in \nthe future. It is unconscionable that their benefits continue to be \ndenied.\n  So I regard this legislation as an important step, but only a first \nstep.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the Agricultural \nResearch, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998. This legislation \nprovides funding for the federal crop insurance program, important \nagricultural research programs and the restoration of food stamp \nbenefits to approximately 250,000 legal immigrants.\n  I have long been a strong supporter of federal nutrition programs \nthat help to combat hunger. On November 24, 1997, Senator Harkin and I \nsent a letter to Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman and Director of \nthe Office of Management and Budget Franklin Raines, which was signed \nby forty-five of our Senate colleagues. Our letter urged the \nAdministration to provide funding for food stamp benefits for some of \nthe most vulnerable members of our society: legal immigrants who are \nchildren, elderly, or disabled.\n  As the Agricultural Research bill was sent to conference, I joined \nwith four of my colleagues in a March 23, 1998 letter urging the \nconferees to provide relief to poor legal immigrants and refugees who \npreviously were eligible but had lost federal food stamps under the \n1996 welfare law. I am pleased that the final conference report \nrestores these benefits. I also joined seventy of my colleagues in an \nApril 24, 1998 letter urging that the conference report be brought to \nthe floor for a vote as soon as possible.\n  Besides providing food stamp benefits to vulnerable legal immigrants, \nthis bill also provides critical funding for the federal crop insurance \nprogram, which will allow affordable crop insurance to be offered to \nour nation's farmers. Agriculture is Pennsylvania's number one \nindustry, and it is vital that we provide insurance to our farmers who \nwork so hard to provide our country and the world with a stable food \nsupply. The legislation will also provide $600 million over the next \nfive years in funding for agricultural research programs, which are \ncritical to our country's efforts to produce enough food for an ever-\nincreasing world population.\n  The Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act is an \nimportant piece of legislation, for legal immigrants, our nation's \nagricultural community, and the nation as a whole. I am therefore \npleased to support this legislation.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nsupport of the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform \nAct of 1998. At long last, this important piece of legislation is \nbefore the Senate for consideration and passage of the Conference \nReport.\n  This Act is the result of more than a year of hard work and can boast \nbroad bipartisan support. By providing $1.7 billion in agricultural \nresearch and extension activities at institutions of higher learning \nacross the nation, this Act commits the U.S. government to supporting a \nstrong future for agriculture in Montana and across the nation.\n  I would like to recognize four areas that affect Montana:\n  The Montana State University Agriculture Extension Service. We have \none of the finest examples of an ag extension service in the country, \ncentered at Montana State University in Bozeman, Montana. The College \nof Agriculture, led by Dean Tom McCoy, has produced numerous innovative \nprojects worthy of recognition. Research at Montana State University \nhas led to more pest-resistant, higher yielding varieties of barley and \nwheat. MSU scientists have improved the value of barley as a feedstock \nfor cattle. And they are using the remarkable power of biotechnology to \ndevelop the answers to the ag challenges of the next century. The \nagriculture research bill provides the funding necessary for our \nscientists to carry out, continue and build upon their mission to serve \nour agriculture industry.\n  This bill will also continue funding for the good work demonstrated \nby our country extension agents. Their efforts on behalf of Montana's \nagricultural industry go above and beyond to provide resources that \nhelp our producers meet their bottom line, improve their yield, and \nenhance their competitiveness in the world marketplace.\n  Crop Insurance. Today, while we debate the passage of this bill, \nseveral counties in Montana are under severe drought and fire alert. \nFarmers have waited helplessly for rain while their crops wither and \ndie. This is surely a make it or break it year due to low prices, a dry \nwinter, and unfair grain dumping from our foreign competitors. The mere \nthreat of crop insurers canceling policies is an obstacle that many \nproducers simply cannot overcome. For that reason, I am pleased that \nthis Act contains provisions to strengthen crop insurance--just when \nour producers need it most. Clearly, we must take the final step and \npass this conference report.\n  Food Animal Residue Avoidance Database. I would like to thank \nChairman Lugar for including my bill, the Food Animal Residue Avoidance \nDatabase, more commonly known as FARAD, in this Act. I am pleased that \nthe Conference report authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to make \nthree-year grants to colleges and universities to operate the FARAD \nprogram. FARAD is critical in our food-safety regime. Its database \nprovides invaluable information about dangerous residues that affect \nour food supply. The FARAD program successfully links producers, \nveterinarians and the general public to an informational resource \nnetwork that enables us to produce the safest food in the world.\n  Agricultural Research Service. I am most proud of the work conducted \nat the Agricultural Research Service stations in Sidney, Montana and \nFort Keogh at Miles City. I strongly believe that their efforts are of \ntremendous importance to our food industry as well as our agricultural \ntrade. The future of agriculture is in their very capable hands. They \nenjoy strong support from the agricultural community because they are a \npart of that community. Whenever I am in these towns, I stop by and \nvisit these facilities because the people that work there, and the \ncommunity that supports them, are very proud of the great work that \nthey do for our ag industry. This bill will continue the critical work \nat these locations.\n  I would also like to recognize that this bill supports many other \nworthy projects, including the National Food Genome Strategy, an \nassistive technology program for farmers with disabilities, the \nimportant Fund for Rural America, Precision Agricultural research, and \nresearch of wheat and barley diseases caused by scab.\n  This Act is worthy of our immediate action. I urge my colleagues to \npass the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of \n1998 and recommend that President Clinton sign it without hesitation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Agricultural \nResearch Conference Report. The bill, S. 1150 reauthorizes our \nagricultural research programs and provides $600 million in funding on \na competitive grant basis for new and alternative uses of agricultural \ncommodities and products, natural resources management, farm efficiency \nand profitability, agriculture biotechnology, and food safety, \ntechnology and nutrition.\n  This is good news for our scientists and the agriculture community in \nMaine. They know their chances of receiving more competitive research \nfunding are excellent because they know they can compete head to head \nwith agriculture researchers from all around the country. This bill \ngives them that opportunity.\n  As the Chairman of the Committee is aware, I do have some concerns \nwith provisions in this conference report that were not part of either \nthe House or Senate passed bills. In addition to the food stamp \nprovisions, which have been widely discussed on the floor today, I am \nconcerned with addition of the research title of the Northern Forest \nStewardship Act that was included in conference. I voted to recommit \nthe report to the conference committee in hopes that these two \nprovisions, which are unrelated to the important agricultural research, \nwould be removed from the report. Since the vote to recommit failed, I \nwill vote for the report, and\n\n[[Page S4677]]\n\nwill continue to work with Chairman Lugar to address my concerns.\n  I have been working with the Chairman and Subcommittee Chairman \nSantorum to obtain a field hearing in Maine on the Northern Forest \nStewardship Act (NFSA) before any action was taken by the full Senate. \nI requested this hearing because many people in Maine are both \ninterested and concerned with the potential impact of this bill on the \neconomies of their rural communities.\n  I was dismayed, therefore, when I learned that the research title \nfrom the NFSA bill was included in the Agriculture Research conference \nreport. Also the language inserted in the report does not include the \nprovision which requires that a governor's request is required before \nfederal assistance can be made available to the state. This language is \nfundamental because it involves an elected state official in the \nprocess, ensuring that the state controls its land use decisions. I \nwill be working to restore the role of the states in making the request \nfor federal assistance, and I thank the Chairman of the Agriculture \nCommittee for his offer of assistance in this matter.\n  Historically, our state has been defined by our agriculture--from the \nnatural resources of its extensive forests, to the potatoes crops of \nAroostook County and to the Wild blueberries of the Down East area of \nMaine. The Wild lowbush blueberry is unique to Maine, and one of only \nthree berries native to the U.S. that are utilized commercially.\n  Virtually all of the commercial U.S. lowbush blueberries are produced \nin our state, with 99 percent of the blueberries being processed and \nused as a nutritious ingredient in many food products throughout the \ncountry. The industry is concentrated in the Down East region of Maine, \nwhich is an economically depressed region that relies heavily on \nnatural resource based jobs, such as those in the Wild blueberry \nindustry.\n  An increase in competitive research grants funding will help to \ncontinue a series of research projects that target critical aspects of \nlowbush blueberry culture and processing challenges, and transferring \nresearch solutions to the growers and processors. Much of the research \ncompleted to date provides techniques for a sustainable approach to \nproduction with environmental benefits.\n  Research objectives include implementation of a research program that \nis designed to ensure a consistently productive, high quality, low \ninput crop that is successfully marketed in the U.S. and worldwide, \nwith ongoing projects for such as pesticide reduction/efficacy, \npollination alternatives, effects and reduction of low temperature \ninjury, micro nutrient fertility requirements, and fruit quality \nimprovements.\n  The bill also funds the federal crop insurance program that will give \na healthy measure of peace of mind to Maine's wild blueberry industry, \nwho, until recently, could not participate in the program. This report \nwill allow the wild blueberry industry to renew their contracts for \ncrop insurance, giving them protection against an economically \ndevastating total crop loss caused by circumstances beyond their \ncontrol.\n  Research for the potato industry is being conducted on new chemical-\nresistant strains of late blight, now detected in virtually every major \npotato growing state, and the last blight fungus is quickly developing \ninto the most serious threat to potato production in the United States. \nHistory reminds of us the great potato famine in Ireland in the last \ncentury caused by late blight, and today's research helps us to never \nagain realize such an devastating experience.\n  In Maine, late blight has already resulted in millions of dollars in \ncrop losses since 1993, which is not only a concern for our largest \nagriculture industry, but for potato states throughout the eastern U.S. \nsince Maine is the primary source of seed potatoes for these states.\n  Comprehensive late blight Integrated Pest Management research \nprograms through current grants and future competitive research grants \noffered in the bill before us today will continue to prevent a full-\nscale epidemic from occurring in our region. Needless to say, this is \none initiative in which a modest federal investment will help prevent a \nvery costly crop disaster.\n  The Hatch Act and the McIntire-Stennis Act are the cornerstones of \nthe cooperative/federal/state research effort that has made the U.S. \nagriculture and forestry industries the world's leaders. Under these \nprograms, and under broad federal guidelines, states can continue to \nfurther identify their local research priorities.\n  Additional competitive research grants for the McIntire-Stennis \nProgram will provide continued funding to 62 universities nationwide, \nincluding the University of Maine, that conduct research, teaching, and \nextension programs in forestry and related natural resource areas. The \nresearch focuses on the biology of forest organisms, forest ecosystem \nhealth, management of forests for wood, and forest product development. \nEach dollar of McIntire-Stennis funding is now matched with five \ndollars from nonfederal sources for these university programs.\n  Wood utilization research contributes to research at six land-grant \nRegional Research Centers, including Maine. The work conducted at these \nuniversities specializes in the efficient use of wood resources, \ndeveloping new structural applications for wood, exploiting wood \nchemical extractives for safer and less expensive alternatives to \ncurrent pesticides, preservatives, and adhesives, and exploring the \npharmacological properties of trees. Wood utilization research is \nparticularly important to forest-based economies in rural areas. In \nMaine, the annual total contribution in forest products manufacturing \nis over $5 billion.\n  Mr. President, our agricultural communities, some of the best \nstewards of our land, produce the safest, the most nutritious and \nreasonably priced food products in the entire world. Furthering the \ncompetitive grants research system through the Agricultural Research \nbill before us will go a long way towards the continued improvement of \nour nation's bountiful harvests and the continued health and \nproductivity of our nation's forests.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Conference Report \nto accompany S. 1150, the Agricultural, Research, Extension, and \nEducation Act of 1998. For the purposes of this debate, I will focus on \nonly the research and federal crop insurance provisions contained in \nthis conference report. These are two of the primary issues important \nto farmers and those involved in agriculture.\n  Among the important research provisions provided for in this \nconference report is funding for Fusarium Head Blight, or Scab, \nresearch. This disease has had a devastating impact on producers in \nMinnesota and North Dakota and has caused severe economic losses over \nthe past five years. The conference report now before us is an \nimportant step in continuing the public/private partnership that has \nevolved as we attempt to find a scab-resistant variety of wheat.\n  Also contained within this report is funding for genome research. \nThis is important in mapping specific traits of corn and other \ncommodities. Isolating those traits which are resistant to drought and \nother natural enemies could maximize yields and enhance producer \nefficiency. The flexibility it provides to research is reason enough to \npass this legislation in a timely manner.\n  However, some of my colleagues have expressed concern over the \nfederal crop insurance provisions contained in this conference \nagreement. While I certainly understand their point, it is important \nthat we look at the ``big picture.'' Currently, there is a budget \nshortfall in the program which jeopardizes the ability of farmers and \nagriculture lenders to make management decisions for the upcoming year. \nI have spoken with hundreds of individuals involved in agriculture who \nhave urged me to support this funding fix, and I am confident they will \nbe just as forthcoming as we explore options to provide producers with \ngreater risk-management tools. It is important to remember that the \nconference report does not contain any major program reforms. It allows \nfor five years of mandatory funding while market-orientated reforms are \nphased-in. Once the crop insurance budget issue is resolved, we can \nbegin the process of achieving substantive reform of the federal crop \ninsurance program.\n  Mr. President, we must design alternatives that encourage innovation \nand\n\n[[Page S4678]]\n\ncompetition among insurers with an eye towards moving crop insurance in \nthe direction of privately developed policies. I have already begun \nthis process with agriculture leaders in Minnesota. I look forward to \nworking with Senator Lugar and my colleagues in crafting a program \nwhich benefits all taxpayers, while providing farmers the opportunity \nto craft a risk-management policy that fits their operation.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nlegislation and I look forward to its immediate passage.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Agricultural \nResearch, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998. As a member of \nthe Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, I have \nworked with Chairman Lugar and the Committee for two years to see this \nAct crafted and passed. I am pleased that the Leader has allowed it to \ncome to the floor and encourage my colleagues to support its adoption.\n  Mr. President, the bill reforms and reauthorizes discretionary \nagricultural research programs that play an important role in keeping \nour nation's farmers competitive in the ever expanding world market. \nThese programs and extension activities have experienced dramatic \nreturns--in the form of better land management, environmentally sound \nfarm practices, increased crop yield, improved crop varieties, and \ncountless other ways--and represent a sound investment in the future. \nThe bill's reforms will ensure more collaboration and efficiency in \nfederally funded research and provide for greater accountability to the \nAmerican taxpayers.\n  The bill also provides $600 million over the next five years in \nmandatory funding to the Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food \nSystems. This new mandatory spending will provide $120 million per year \non a competitive grant basis for six high priority mission areas: \nagricultural genome research; food safety, food technology, and human \nnutrition; new and alternative uses of agricultural commodities and \nproducts; agricultural biotechnology; natural resource management, \nincluding precision agriculture; and farm efficiency and profitability.\n  In addition, the bill addresses the immediate concerns facing all \nthose who rely on federal crop insurance, provides for the Fund for \nRural America, and funds food stamps for the elderly, disabled, and \nchildren of the nation's poorest immigrants.\n  Mr. President, more than just a reauthorization bill, the legislation \nbefore the Senate today is an investment in the future and represents \nour commitment to America's farm families. By providing the technical \nresearch and extension activities that help expand farm income, improve \nresource management, and develop new crop varieties, federally funded \nagricultural research assures that our nation will continue to lead the \nworld in farm production and help bolster the stability of our rural \nareas.\n  I encourage all my colleagues to support its adoption.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to express my strong support for \nthe Conference Report on S. 1150, the Agricultural Research, Extension, \nand Education Reform Act of 1998, and to thank Senator Lugar and \nSenator Harkin for the tremendous effort they have devoted to this \nimportant legislation.\n  Immediate passage of the conference report is critical for \nagriculture research funding, crop insurance, and nutrition funding for \nlegal immigrants. The legislation represents desperately needed \ninvestment in agricultural research, essential to the continuing \nproduction of safe, plentiful, diverse, and affordable food and fiber. \nFurthermore, failure to pass this legislation will result in massive \nreductions in crop insurance delivery around the country, especially in \nhigh risk areas such as the Northern Great Plains.\n  Not only will terminated policies expose farmers to tremendous risk \nof crop loss due to events beyond their control, such as weather, but \nwithout crop insurance, producers will not be able to take out \noperating loans essential to planting crops. This will hit young, \nbeginning farmers hardest, which is terrible for agriculture--losing \nthese young producers truly threatens the future of the industry.\n  When the last farm bill was passed, farmers nationwide were promised \nincreased access to risk management tools. This promise was made in \nexchange for the elimination of a wide range of commodity and disaster \nprograms that had, until then, provided producers some protection \nagainst the potentially devastating shocks that occur in agriculture.\n  Last year, the Dakotas were devastated by extended below freezing \ntemperatures, winter storms that dumped record levels of snow, and \nspring flooding worse than anyone living had ever seen. Even with the \nbenefit of crop insurance we lost hundreds of producers and farms that \nhad been in families for over 100 years. I cannot imagine what would be \nleft of the agriculture industry in South Dakota today had we not at \nleast had the benefit of crop insurance last year.\n  The northeast region of South Dakota is currently experiencing severe \nflooding that is not likely to subside for some time. This is in an \narea that has been characterized by good farm land for as long as \nanyone can remember. No one could have anticipated that the farms in \nthese counties and so many of the roads that connect them would be \nunder water today. A strong and affordable crop insurance program will \nbe critical to producers in this area who are struggling to stay in \nbusiness. Without it, there would be an exodus from this part of my \nstate, which would destroy the economy of the entire region. It is in \nall of our interest to provide our nation's agriculture producers with \nthe means to insulate their businesses and the local economies of which \nthey are an essential part against conditions like those we experienced \nstatewide last year, and that our northeast corner is fighting now.\n  I also want to stress the tremendous importance of the research \nreauthorization in this conference report. We owe much of the credit \nfor this country's agricultural success to our network of land grant \ninstitutions, state agriculture experiment stations, USDA's \nAgricultural Research Service, and hundreds of county extension \noffices. These entities work together in a wide range of ways to \nproduce cutting-edge research and then convert it into improved \npractices and technology meaningful to producers. This report places \nincreased emphasis on collaboration among institutions and disciplines, \nand encourages pursuit of goals benefiting more than one region or \nstate.\n  The land grant university in my state, South Dakota State University, \ncurrently has a highly regarded record of strong interdisciplinary and \nmulti-state cooperative work. I am extremely proud of the fine research \nand extension SDSU produces, and I am pleased that this legislation \nwill foster their efforts. It helps level the playing field for small \nschools competing for limited research funds, and it is sensitive to \nthe relative importance of formula funds for institutions in agrarian \nstates with low populations.\n  I am pleased that this legislation preserves existing programs that \ntarget emerging and critical issues such as the Fund for Rural America. \nThe Fund for Rural America was designed to provide immediate, flexible, \nand applied research and support to people in rural areas who are \nadjusting to rapid changes in the agricultural sector since the last \nfarm bill.\n  The Fund also promotes value-added processing, which is vital to \nsuccessful rural economic development. Our rural communities must \ncapture more of the revenue their locally produced commodities \nultimately generate. Value-added processing keeps that revenue local, \nwhich will be critical to the future of those communities.\n  In conclusion, I cannot overemphasize the importance of this \nlegislation and its prompt passage. If we are to maintain our place in \nthe world as a leader in agriculture production and technology, we \nabsolutely must invest in agriculture research today. If we are to have \na vital and diverse agriculture sector in the future, we also must \nensure producers have access to reliable and affordable risk management \ntools like the federal crop insurance program.\n  The overwhelming bipartisan support for the agriculture conference \nreport is a tribute to the commitment Senator Lugar and Senator Harkin \nhave made\n\n[[Page S4679]]\n\nto assuring passage of this critical legislation. I urge my colleagues \nto approve the report in its current form.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I intend to vote for this conference \nagreement.\n  For the most part, the bill provides funding to address legitimate \nneeds of farmers and the agriculture industry for crop insurance, \nresearch, and extension and education programs. I applaud the conferees \nfor including provisions throughout the bill which establish \ncompetitive, merit-based, or peer-reviewed selection procedures for \nawarding grants and contracts and allocating funds for various \nprograms.\n  The bill also requires most recipients of funds to contribute \nmatching amounts from non-federal sources. It also broadens the scope \nof many established programs to require a national, regional, or multi-\nstate focus or benefit.\n  While the bill contains language regarding the establishment or \ncontinuation of several specific programs, it does not require the \nSecretary of Agriculture to comply with the direction in the bill, in \nmost cases. For example, the bill authorizes, but does not require, the \nSecretary of Agriculture to acquire and operate the National Swine \nResearch Center in Ames, Iowa--an institution which has received \nearmarked funds in appropriations bills for as long as I can remember. \nI would hope that the Secretary would exercise the discretion provided \nin this bill and resist the temptation to expand the federal \nbureaucracy to include this wholly unnecessary swine research facility.\n  Let me also take a moment to express my support for the provisions in \nTitle V of the bill that make food stamps available to certain \ncategories of legal immigrants who may fall on hard times. These \nprovisions simply restore eligibility for food stamps to certain \ncategories of immigrants who were eligible for assistance prior to \nAugust 22, 1996, when sweeping welfare reform legislation was enacted. \nOnly refugees and asylees, disabled and elderly immigrants, children of \nlegal immigrants, certain Indians, and certain Hmong and Highland \nLaotians, all of whom had to be lawfully residing in the United States \non August 22, 1996, are again eligible for food stamps.\n  In these times of economic prosperity, Americans can certainly afford \nto be compassionate to our most vulnerable immigrants. Last year, the \nCongress restored to these same categories of immigrants eligibility \nfor Supplemental Security Income and Medicaid. Finally, it should be \nnoted that the cost of providing assistance to an estimated 250,000 \nindividuals is offset in its entirety by reductions in the \nadministrative expenses of the food stamp program and other programs.\n  Again, I thank the conferees for including these many excellent \nprovisions in this bill.\n  However, as usual, there are a number of glaring exceptions to the \notherwise good-government approach taken by the conferees.\n  Mr. President, most disturbing among the objectionable provisions in \nthis bill is Section 401, which establishes a new entitlement program, \ncalled the Initiative for Future Agricultural and Food Systems, which \nis funded at $120 million per year for five years. Although the grants \nunder this new program will be competitively awarded and recipients \nmust provide matching funds, I am concerned that the conferees would \nfind it advisable to establish a brand new mandatory spending program \nwithout regard to its effect on other high-priority agriculture \nprograms.\n  Clearly, this new entitlement is intended to bypass the spending caps \nthat limit how much is spent on agriculture program grants in the \nannual appropriations process. It violates the spirit and intent of the \nbudget process that has resulted, finally, in a projected federal \nbudget surplus for this year.\n  Mr. President, I intend to take a very careful look at the \nappropriations bill for agriculture programs this year. If, as in \nprevious years, another $100 million or more is allocated for the same \nprograms that are to be funded under this new entitlement program, I \nwill be offering an amendment to remove that duplicative funding from \nthe appropriations bill. I hope to have my colleagues' support to \nprevent this effort to circumvent the budget prioritization process and \nessentially double the funding for these types of programs.\n  Other objectionable provisions in the bill establish new \nbureaucracies and boards to coordinate activities which should be \nwithin the capabilities of the existing Department of Agriculture \nbureaucracy. One such provision establishes a Thomas Jefferson \nInitiative for Crop Diversification, a program coordinated by a \nnonprofit center to coordinate cooperative research by public and \nprivate entities on new and non-traditional crops. Another is the \nprovision authorizing a grant program for precision agriculture \nprograms and establishing precision agriculture partnerships. Other \nprovisions include the establishment of an Office of Pest Management \nPolicy and a Food Safety Research Information Office, and a mandate to \ncontinue the operation of the Food Animal Residue Avoidance Database \nprogram.\n  Funding for these new programs is subject to future appropriations \nand participants are required to provide non-federal matching funds. \nHowever, the parameters and criteria specified in the bill will require \nnew regulations and bureaucracies for implementation. These efforts \nhave both monetary costs and potentially negative effects on other \nagriculture priorities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of objectionable \nprovisions in the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Objectional Spending Provisions in S. 1150, Agricultural Research, \n              Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998\n\n       Section 241 requires the Secretary of Agriculture to \n     establish an Agricultural Genome Initiative to study the \n     genetic makeup of crops.\n       Section 242 directs the Secretary of Agriculture to study \n     the control, management, and eradication of imported fire \n     ants, and establishes high priority for 26 specific research \n     and extension programs, including potato blight, ethanol, \n     deer tick ecology, grain sorghum ergot, prickly pear, wood, \n     wild pampas, sheep scrapie, and tomato spotted wilt.\n       Section 245 directs the Secretary of Agriculture to cede \n     responsibility for awarding grants to develop an agriculture \n     telecommunications network to a consortium called A*DEC, \n     which is made up of private universities and land grant \n     colleges and unspecified international members, with language \n     specifying that grants are to be awarded competitively \n     regardless of the grant seeker's membership in A*DEC.\n       Section 252 requires $60 million each year for five years \n     to be transferred to the Fund for Rural America.\n       Section 401 establishes a new entitlement program, the \n     Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems, to \n     provide agriculture research grants at a level of $120 \n     million annually for five years.\n       Section 405 directs the Secretary of Agriculture to \n     establish the Thomas Jefferson Initiative for Crop \n     Diversification, to coordinate public and private research \n     and promotion of new and non-traditional agricultural \n     products.\n       Section 604 directs the Secretary of Agriculture to \n     continue the operation of the Food Animal Residue Avoidance \n     Database Program through a program of grants to colleges and \n     universities.\n       Section 614 directs the Secretary of Agriculture to \n     establish an Office of Pest Management Policy to coordinate \n     pest research and use of management tools.\n       Section 615 orders the Secretary of Agriculture to \n     establish a Food Safety Research Information Office at the \n     National Agricultural Library, with the direction that the \n     office sponsor a national conference on food safety research \n     priorities within 120 days of enactment of the bill and every \n     year thereafter for four years.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Because of the inclusion of these low priority, \nunnecessary, and wasteful programs, I voted in favor of Senator Gramm's \nmotion to recommit the bill to conference so that these provisions \ncould be addressed again and, hopefully, deleted from the bill or \nrevised to prevent the waste of taxpayer dollars.\n  Unfortunately, the motion to recommit was defeated by a wide margin. \nHowever, since I believe the many positive aspects of this bill \noutweigh these onerous provisions, I intend to support the conference \nagreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the conference \nreport?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, let me just wrap up by again thanking \nSenators for the overwhelming vote that we just had. I think that vote \nwill send\n\n[[Page S4680]]\n\na clear signal to the House to move very rapidly on the bill. We will \nget it down to the President and hopefully get this important \nconference report signed in very short order.\n  I can just tell you, there will be a giant sigh of relief among the \nagriculture community from coast to coast and border to border as soon \nas this bill gets signed, because then we can get on to the business of \ngetting our crop insurance policies renewed around the country and we \ncan get on with the business of revamping, revising, and strengthening \nagricultural research throughout America. But the most important and \nmost vital aspect of the bill in the immediate future is the Crop \nInsurance Program. Farmers will be assured right away that they will be \nable to continue their protection against disaster losses.\n  Mr. President, let me again compliment and thank my chairman, Senator \nLugar, first for his leadership on the ag research provisions of the \nbill. He has said many times that, entering the new century, we need to \nhave a new approach, and new ways of doing our research in agriculture. \nHe is absolutely right. I was happy and proud to support him in those \nefforts. It took quite a while to get the bill worked through the \nhearing processes, through negotiations in conference, getting all the \nissues worked out on research, but it was done, and we had good, \nbipartisan support.\n  I believe the chairman has fashioned an Ag research bill that is \nreally going to help us move ahead in the next century in producing new \nkinds of crops, new products from and uses for crops, in biotechnology, \nin improving agricultural productivity and natural resource protection. \nSo I believe we will see a whole new focus and revitalization of our \nagricultural research. It is long overdue, but this bill will move us \nin that direction.\n  I thank the chairman also for his leadership on crop insurance, in \nmaking sure that we addressed this need to provide that critical \nelement of a safety net for farmers, because, as we all know, they need \nthis crop insurance, both to cover disasters over which they have no \ncontrol and also to make sure they have the collateral they need for \nobtaining financing for their farming operations. Farmers rely on crop \ninsurance, and agricultural lenders rely on it.\n  So, this provision is going to be very, very meaningful to make sure \nthat farmers, and we here in Congress, do not have to be worrying every \nsingle year how we will find funding to continue crop insurance--and \nwhether in fact farmers will have crop insurance. That is going to be a \ngreat relief to our farming community all over America.\n  Finally, on the food stamp provisions, again, I thank the chairman \nfor his great leadership in making sure we produced a sound bill and \nheld together our coalition encompassing agricultural and nutrition \nmatters.\n  I also thank all the staff who worked very hard for a long time, for \nwell over a year now, to get us to this point: Randy Green, our staff \ndirector; and Dave Johnson, chief counsel; Ms. Terri Nintemann on the \nmajority side; on the minority side, Dan Smith, Mark Halverson, Phil \nSchwab and Richard Bender. There are a number of other staff. These are \nour leaders. They did a great job of pulling this bill together, \nkeeping us on course and making sure we got to conference and got it \nall wrapped up. We are very blessed with a very good and very capable \nstaff. I thank them for all the long hours and hard work they put in.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the ranking member, Senator Harkin, was \ncharacteristically gracious and generous, and I appreciate his \ncomments. I want to tell him how much I have appreciated working with \nhim and with all of our colleagues on what I believe is a monumental \nadvance for not only American agriculture, but for feeding the world in \nthe next 50 years, as well as the assurance of our farmers immediately \nin crop insurance and humane measures with regard to nutrition \nprograms.\n  I simply mention, Mr. President, that Dave Johnson and Terri \nNintemann have been mentioned. Of course, our distinguished Randy \nGreen, who does so much on the majority side in likewise guiding all of \nthe committee staff efforts. But I also will mention Marcia Asquith, \nBeth Johnson, Andy Morton, Michael Knipe, Bob Sturm, Debbie Schwertner, \nCarol Dubard, Kate Wallem, Kathryn Boots, Chris Salisbury, Danny \nSpellacy, Terri Snow, Whitney Mueller, and Jennifer Cutshall, because \nthis has been a 2-year effort on the part of all of these individuals \nand they have contributed highly.\n  I have consulted with the distinguished majority leader, Trent Lott, \nand with the distinguished ranking member, Tom Harkin, and it will be \nour request that there be a final rollcall vote. I alert colleagues \nthat that will be coming, hopefully soon.\n\n  I appreciate very much the leader working with us to make this time \npossible and this opportunity to debate. I mention specifically the \nimportance of the contribution of Senator Gramm, who is a member of our \ncommittee, who argued well a point of view that did not prevail but, at \nthe same time, sharpened the focus of all of us on those things we \nbelieve are important in this legislation.\n  Finally, I mention Senator Domenici, who had only a very small speech \nbut an important one with regard to caps and entitlements in the budget \nand overall considerations. We are mindful of what he had to say and \ngrateful for his support ultimately of our effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Is there further debate?\n  Mr. LUGAR. I ask for the yeas and nays on the conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the conference \nreport? If not, the question is on agreeing to the conference report. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I understand that the Senate is not on any \nlegislation right now. I would like to take just a few minutes of the \nSenate's time to talk about the disturbing events that happened in \nSouth Asia yesterday.\n  Mr. President, to paraphrase a speech that President Roosevelt gave \n57 years ago in the House Chamber, yesterday is a day that will live in \ninfamy, for the Nation of India. At a time when world\n\n[[Page S4681]]\n\ntensions are being reduced, when the cold war is over, when nuclear \narsenals are being reduced, at a time when we are on the threshold of \nsigning a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the Nation of India \ndeliberately and provocatively, with total disregard for world opinion \nand total disregard for regional stability in South Asia, detonated \nthree nuclear weapons. And to make matters even worse, they were \ndetonated near the border with Pakistan.\n  These tests were conducted without advance warning to the \ninternational community. They clearly work against the goals of \nnonproliferation and international stability. Indian's Prime Minister's \nprincipal secretary said afterwards that with the test, ``India has a \nproven capability for a weaponized nuclear program.''\n  Mr. President, India's behavior is clearly unacceptable. These \nunderground tests could well trigger a nuclear arms race in the region.\n  I believe that the United States should be prepared to exercise the \nfull range and depth of sanctions available under law. For example, the \nNuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994 requires the President to \ncut off almost all U.S. Government aid to India, bar American banks \nfrom making loans to the Government, stop exports of American products \nwith military uses such as machine tools and computers, and, most \nimportantly, oppose aid to India by the World Bank and the \nInternational Monetary Fund.\n  An article that appeared this morning in the New York Times pointed \nout that, ``India is the world's largest borrower from the World Bank, \nwith more than $44 billion in loans; it is expecting about $3 billion \nin loans and credits this year.''\n  Well, I think it is time for the United States to exercise its voice \nand vote in the World Bank, and let India know that no longer can it \ncome and get that kind of money if all it is going to do is spend its \nmoney on developing and testing not only fission weapons but yesterday \na thermonuclear weapon, a hydrogen bomb.\n  Further quoting from this article, Monday's tests ``came as a \ncomplete shock, a bolt out of the blue'' to the White House, one senior \nadministration official said. ``It's a fork in the road.'' ``Will India \nand Pakistan be locked in a nuclear arms race? Will the Chinese resume \nnuclear testing now?''\n  What is also disturbing is that our intelligence agencies obviously \ndid not pick up any signs that the tests were imminent and reported \nthat activities at the test site appeared to be routine.\n  Let's see now. How much did we spend on our intelligence agencies \nlast year? About thirty billion dollars? And they can't even tell us \nwhen one of the largest nations on Earth is going to explode nuclear \nweapons? You wonder what that $30 billion is going for. I think a \nthorough review needs to be made of our intelligence operation.\n  Back to the point, Senator John Glenn, our colleague, who is the \nauthor of the law, is quoted as saying, ``Those sanctions are \nmandatory,'' and the only way to delay them is if the President tells \nCongress that their immediate imposition would harm national security. \nAnd that delay can only last 30 days. Congress can only remove the \nsanctions by passing a law or joint resolution.\n  ``It would be hard to avoid the possibility of sanctions,'' a senior \nState Department official said. ``There is no wiggle room in the law.''\n  Further quoting our colleague, who is quoted again in the New York \nTimes this morning, Senator Glenn called the tests ``the triumph of \nfear over prudence, a monumental setback for efforts to halt the global \nspread of nuclear weapons.''\n  Mr. President, the Nation of India is no longer the nation of \nMohandas Gandhi, I am sorry to say. The Nation of India has embarked on \na new and dangerous course in South Asia, one that I think has ominous \nforeboding for all of their neighbors in that area, and also for us \nhere in the United States.\n  Of course, it is my fervent hope that India's neighbors will show \nrestraint. It is my hope and my desire that Pakistan and China and \nother nations in that region will recognize the importance of caution \ndespite this dangerous, inflammatory and provocative move by India. \nAgain, they should not follow the lead of India but recognize the \nimportance of restraining a nuclear arms race.\n  I believe that this Senate should also press for appropriate action \nby the international community. The international community should join \nwith the United States in bringing to bear whatever sanctions it can, \nespecially in the World Bank to cut off all loans to India.\n  Again, what India has done underscores the need for a nuclear test \nban treaty. But now it becomes clear why, in August of 1996, after \nyears of difficult negotiations, we finally got a final treaty \nsupported by all countries for a comprehensive test ban, India refused \nto sign. Maybe now we know why.\n  The treaty was endorsed by a 158-to-3 margin at the United Nations. \nHowever, India walked out and said they weren't going to sign.\n  We cannot give up. We cannot let this action by the Government in \nIndia deter us from our goal of a comprehensive test ban.\n  I do not in any way mean my remarks today to implicate all of the \nwonderful people of India, many of whom I have counted as my friends, \nmany of whom worked very hard on the issues of human rights, social \njustice, ending child labor. But I do wish by my remarks today to \nimplicate and condemn in the strongest possible language permitted in \nthis body the actions by the Government of India. This was its \ndecision. This was its deliberate decision to conduct these tests in \nclear disregard for the opinion of the world.\n  So the Government of India bears a heavy responsibility for what \nfollows. I hope they do not, although my hopes seem to be feint in \nlight of what the Government of India said yesterday, intend to \nweaponize their nuclear program. Not only have they tested these \nweapons, they seem to have sent a clear signal that they are going to \nincorporate these weapons in their military arsenal both for short-\nrange, medium- and obviously perhaps even for long-range purposes.\n  At a time when India needs to invest in education, when it needs to \ninvest in its infrastructure, at a time when India really needs to \nreach peaceful agreements with its neighbor, Pakistan, on the issue of \nKashmir, which is still a volatile issue. At a time when China and \nIndia need to get together to discuss their roles in South Asia in the \nfuture, India has thumbed its nose at its neighbors. When the \nGovernment of Pakistan came to power under the Prime Minister Nawaz \nSharif, it reached out to India, to the previous government. Prime \nMinister Sharif held out the olive branch. He asked that talks be \nconducted, that they take steps to reduce the tensions in the region.\n  Those talks proceeded, tensions were reduced, and then elections were \nheld in India and a new government was elected. The hopes and the \ndreams, the actions taken by the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Nawaz \nSharif, and others in the region are now dashed and doomed if India \ndoesn't make a quick U-turn in its policies. But India has already \ntaken its actions, and its actions, I am afraid, will have very serious \nrepercussions.\n  But, again, we cannot give up. I know that Pakistan several times \ncalled for restraint, to call for talks.\n  Well, I call on Pakistan and the other nations of the region not give \nup on their efforts to pursue a peaceful path, to again reach out to \nIndia to begin the long and arduous task of negotiations to reduce \ntensions and to reduce the nuclear arsenal in that area of the world.\n  I remain fearful not only because of Pakistan but because of China. \nWhat will China do now? Will China believe that it must now proceed to \nfurther test its nuclear weapons to show India that it is not going to \nbe intimidated? No, Mr. President, what India did yesterday will live \nin infamy, and it is sad because India has made great progress in the \nlast 50 years. I note at this time the President has recalled our \nambassador to India. I compliment him for that action.\n  Quite frankly, I hope this sends another strong signal to India that \nit is not going to be business as usual with the U.S. Government \nbecause of what they did yesterday. It cannot be said too strongly that \nIndia took a terrible, terrible step yesterday and only India can undo \nit. I hope they will. But their words and their actions indicate to me \nthey may and probably will not. I feel sorry for India. I feel sorry \nfor the people of India. I feel sorry for the kids\n\n[[Page S4682]]\n\nthat are working in the plants and the factories and the carpet looms \nwho want a better future and a better education. I feel sorry for the \nmillions of people in poverty who want a little bit better life in \nIndia but are now going to have to struggle because more and more of \ntheir money is going into their weapons and their nuclear arsenal. And \nI feel sorry for the people of Pakistan, too, again, who have made \ngreat strides in the last 50 years to build a nation, to build an \ninfrastructure that will allow for a moderate Islamic State to exist in \nthat area, and I feel sorry for the people of China. What is its \nGovernment going to do now?\n  Mr. President, we can only hope and pray that South Asia will now see \nthis as a sign that they must get together and sign a comprehensive \ntest ban treaty now, stop nuclear testing now, stop the arms race now; \nthat India and China and Pakistan must get together and work out their \nproblems through serious peaceful negotiations and not through the \nbluster of provocative actions taken by India yesterday to increase the \narms race, especially the nuclear arms race.\n  Mr. President, I call on India to disavow what they did yesterday, to \nadmit they made a mistake, to reach out to their neighbors in a serious \nattempt to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and to stop this \nmadness once and for all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to ask everyone to take a \nmoment to look at the most important stamp ever issued in our history, \nand that is the one we have the painting of here on the easel. I joined \nthe U.S. Postal Service in unveiling this stamp in Chapel Hill, NC, \nyesterday, the day after Mother's Day, as my colleague, Senator \nFeinstein, did the day before in Los Angeles, CA.\n  For the first time in U.S. history, the public will be able to play a \nmore direct role in funding medical research and setting research \npriorities because of this stamp.\n  This may look like a regular first-class postage stamp, but it is \nnot. It is a semi-postal stamp, the first of its kind ever issued in \nthis country. It took an Act of Congress to create it, and we did just \nthat. It was done to raise money for breast cancer research.\n  Incidentally, the United States is the only Nation around the world \nthat has not issued semi-postal stamps before, but this stamp is \ndifferent because part of the proceeds of this stamp will go directly \nto the NIH and the Department of Defense to pay for breast cancer \nresearch.\n  My colleague from California, Dianne Feinstein, introduced this \nlegislation here in the Senate as Congressman Vic Fazio did in the \nHouse of Representatives. While popular, the bill needed a vehicle to \nget it passed. I decided that if the Post Office could sell a Bugs \nBunny stamp, they could sell a stamp to raise money for breast cancer \nresearch. I was able to add the proposal to an appropriations bill, \nand, along with the support of the majority of my colleagues here in \nthe Senate and the House, the stamp now is born and in existence.\n  The Postal Service was not excited about doing this stamp, and they \nwere concerned that other groups sponsoring other diseases would be \npushing for a similar stamp. I find no problem with that. I just \ncosponsored a bill introduced by Senator Snowe and Senator Burns that \nwould create a semi-postal stamp to raise money for prostate cancer \nresearch. I think this is a great way to let the public play a much \nlarger role in helping fund medical research, and the effort should be \nencouraged. In fact, the Postal Service Board of Governors met today \nand selected an old friend and fellow North Carolinian, Bill Henderson, \nto serve as the next Postmaster General. Let me be the first to \ncongratulate an old friend.\n  I have asked each member of the Postal Service Board to contribute an \nadditional amount to this effort by turning over what would normally be \ncollected for administrative costs to the cancer research fund. In \nother words, all of the gross money would go to cancer research. This \nis especially important in light of the fact that the Postal Rate \nCommission has just recommended that we raise the price of a first-\nclass stamp by 1 cent.\n  If only 20 percent of first-class stamp buyers decide to buy this \npostal stamp--only 20 percent, one-fifth--we will raise $120 million \nannually. That is the same amount of funding increase we fought for in \nlast year's budget for the National Cancer Institute. The stamp will be \nsold for 40 cents when it goes on sale in August. The difference in \nprice from 32 cents or 33 cents required to send a first-class letter, \neither the 7 cents or 8 cents, will go directly to the NIH and the \nDepartment of Defense for their breast cancer research studies.\n  If I could turn this into a ``Home Shopping Channel'' for a moment \nand address all the folks who may be watching: Please, I ask that they \nthemselves buy and urge their friends to buy the stamp when it goes on \nsale this August. It is a wonderful gift, and when so giving it, when \nyou make a gift, No. 1, you are sure the gift will be used, and you \nencourage the recipients of the gift to in turn buy the stamp \nthemselves after the gift supply has been exhausted.\n  There may be some confusion because about a year ago the post office \nreleased a breast cancer awareness stamp. This was a nice gesture, but \nit provided no money. This stamp will raise money for all the women and \nfamilies afflicted by this dread disease. Let's prove the post office \nwrong and make the sale of this stamp a record-setting event.\n  I thank all my colleagues, and especially Senator Feinstein, for \ntheir help in making this semi-postal stamp a reality. I urge you to \njoin with the Postal Service, corporate sponsors, and breast cancer \ngroups to plan events to launch the sale of this stamp completely \naround the country and in all the States. It has to be a success.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggested the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask to speak up to 3 minutes as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Senator Harkin from Iowa recently spoke \non the floor about the terrible occurrence recently happening in India, \nthe explosion of three nuclear devices, which has been roundly \ncondemned around the world. It is very destabilizing in the Indian \nsubcontinent and is going to trigger a set of automatic sanctions.\n  In the Foreign Relations Committee, at 2 p.m. tomorrow afternoon, we \nwill be holding a hearing about the actions taken by the Indian \nGovernment, its consequences on the U.S.-Indian relationship, and its \nconsequences throughout that subcontinent. I certainly invite all the \nMembers of the U.S. Senate and others interested to watch these \nhearings and to follow those, because this is a significant event that \nhas occurred. It has significant ramifications on U.S.-India \nrelationships and is an action that is happening in one of the most \nvolatile regions of the world.\n  I think we all advise and advocate strongly, for our allies and other \nfriends of ours in the neighborhood, for there to be a calm, stable \nresponse to this and that there not be further testing to take place. \nWe will explore these issues in the Foreign Relations Committee \ntomorrow at 2 o'clock.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/12/senate-section/article/S4682-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4682-S4683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             HIGH-TECH WEEK\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate will be \nconsidering a series of bills that truly impact\n\n[[Page S4683]]\n\nand shape our lives in this age of ever-changing technology.\n  Many of us in this chamber can remember a time when the words \n``Internet'' and ``intellectual property'' had no meaning in our day-\nto-day activities. That is changing. Rapidly changing. New, competitive \nmarkets are emerging, and exploding, thanks to continuing technological \nadvancements and innovations.\n  The potential benefits of such unprecedented growth is exciting. \nBesides transforming the structure of the communications industry, high \ntechnology is literally changing the way millions of us live and do \nbusiness.\n  I would like to share a good Samaritan story about how wireless \ntechnology does impact, and possibly save, lives.\n  Mrs. Debbie Sanders, one of my constituents from the small town of \nEnid, Mississippi, is the 1998 recipient of the VITA Wireless Samaritan \nAward for her act of heroism. On her way home from a long day at work \nas a store's assistant manager, Debbie saw a car flipped upside down in \na water-filled ditch. She used her wireless phone to call for help and \npulled the victim from the vehicle. Not sure of her exact location on \nthis lonely stretch of deserted, rural road, Debbie had to remain on \nthe phone for over one hour with emergency personnel until she and the \nvictim could be reached.\n  Mr. President, this is only one example of how high technology can \nenhance our world.\n  There will be boundless opportunity in the next century for new \ntechnological applications to evolve. With that opportunity will come \nan absolute necessity for a highly skilled labor work force to ensure \nAmerica's competitive standing and high-technology leadership. Our \nvibrant economy is directly tied to this cutting-edge technology. Bills \nthat advance our country's ability to compete will strengthen our \nfuture and our children's future.\n  Several measures will be considered, but I want to particularly \nmention the Consumer Anti-Slamming Protection Act. We need a public \npolicy to crack down on slamming. We need to protect the telephone \nconsumer. The world indeed is shrinking, and we all have come to depend \nupon long distance service, not as a luxury but as a necessity. We want \nto talk to those closest to our hearts, wherever they may be.\n  The practice of ``slamming''--unauthorized switching of long distance \ntelephone service carriers by competing service providers--must stop. \nIt is abusive to the consumer, and has become much too frequent and too \ndisruptive. Our colleagues have told us horror stories in the past, and \ntoday we will hear even more illustrations of slamming abuses. With \nthis statute, I join my colleagues in urging the FCC to strengthen its \nenforcement program to stop this unscrupulous practice. Tougher \npenalties against companies that intentionally slam will be an \neffective solution.\n  I want to thank my Senate colleagues for their diligent leadership \nand keen focus on tackling these legislative challenges. Their \nwillingness and commitment to work in a bipartisan manner is the reason \nwe are here today. Although some of the issues may be fundamentally \nnoncontroversial, I know the issues are complex, and I appreciate their \nefforts.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to the debate. It is also my hope that \nprogress will be continued, and consensus achieved, on other critical \npieces of legislation to address a variety of high-technology related \nconcerns shared by many in this Chamber.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/12/senate-section/article/S4682-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4683-S4709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONSUMER ANTI-SCAMMING ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today the Senate begins consideration of a \nseries of bills dealing with critical issues raised by the \ntransformation and rapid growth of the telecommunications industry.\n  This transformation in telecommunications is being driven by constant \nchanges in telecommunications technology. The small mass media universe \nof fifty years ago, occupied by a few large AM radio stations, has \ngiven way to an electronic marketplace teeming with alternative sources \nof information and entertainment. FM radio, TV, cable and satellite \ntelevision, and the Internet have become sometimes competing, and \nsometimes complementary, mass media outlets. In the world of \ntelecommunications, the days of Ma Bell were numbered by the advent of \nmicrowave radio and satellite technology. First there was competition \nfor long-distance service; then wireless services appeared and \nexploded. Cellular radio, paging, and now personal communications \nservices--all are now an indispensable part of everyday American life.\n  For those of you old enough to remember back twenty years--and I \nthink the Presiding Officer can do that--think of how different your \nlife is today than it was then. Most of these changes were due to the \ngrowth of telecommunications. For those of you too young to remember \nthat far back, I can assure you that twenty years from now, you will \nlook back on today and marvel at the changes you will have seen.\n  Today the driving force in telecommunications is digital technology. \nDigital technology has not only made some of today's new services \npossible--it is also causing formerly different services to converge, \nand it is promising Americans new and exciting services in the future. \nThe convergence of your television and your computer is on the horizon. \nSo also is a telephone that can simultaneously translate conversations \nheld in different languages.\n  We need no longer talk about the Information Age in the future tense. \nIt's here and now, and it's reshaping our world.\n  As telecommunications technology changes the way we live, our laws \nmust change to keep pace. The growth of competition in the long-\ndistance industry now gives consumers over 500 companies to choose \nfrom. Because of that competition, the consumer is better off. But the \ngrowth in long-distance competition has also given rise to cut-throat \nmarketing practices.\n  The first bill we will consider and debate today is S. 1618, the \nConsumer Anti-Slamming Act of 1998. It is offered by myself and my good \nfriend and distinguished colleague Senator Fritz Hollings of South \nCarolina, the distinguished Ranking Democrat on the Commerce Committee. \nJoining us as cosponsors are the distinguished Majority Leader, Senator \nLott, and Senators Frist, Bryan, Johnson, Kerry, Abraham, Shelby, \nSnowe, Feingold, and Bob Smith.\n  The Consumer Anti-Slamming Act is designed to put a stop, once and \nfor all, to inexcusable marketing tactics that lead to a consumers' \nlong-distance telephone company being switched without consent. Right \nnow two consumers are ``slammed'' every minute of every day, which \nmakes slamming far and away the most pervasive consumer problem in \ntelecommunications today.\n  We will then shift our focus to Internet-related issues. The \ninformation technology industry is estimated to account for one-third \nof our real economic growth. Currently, electronic commerce is in the \nneighborhood of several billion dollars per year, but that figure is \nexpected to skyrocket into hundreds of billions in only a few years \nmore.\n  The growth and continued expansion of the information technology \nindustry has vastly increased the need for highly-skilled individuals \nto work in this industry. We need these workers, and their skills, to \nretain our nation's leadership in Information Age technology. \nUnfortunately, however, our country isn't producing them in the numbers \nneeded. Therefore, temporary solutions must be found to enable our \nhigh-tech industries to remain competitive, while we address problems \nin the educational system that have led to our inability to produce the \nneeded workforce in this country.\n  S. 1723, The American Competitiveness Act of 1998, will increase the \nyearly cap on H-1B immigration visas for skilled workers, while \ncreating new educational opportunities for Americans to join the \ninformation technology workforce that is now so critically short of the \nskilled personnel we need.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of this measure. I \ncommend my colleague, Senator Abraham, for his leadership on this \nissue, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill in company with \nSenators Hatch, DeWine, Specter, Grams, Brownback, Ashcroft, Hagel, \nBennett, Mack, Coverdell, Lieberman, Burns, Senator Bob Graham of \nFlorida, and Senator Gordon Smith of Oregon. I would also like to \ncompliment Senator Feinstein for her efforts at reaching a consensus on \nthis issue with her fellow members of the Judiciary Committee.\n\n  Should we fail to pass this measure, our industry will not be able to \naccess the wealth of talent not currently available here at home. This \nreality will have a quantifiable negative impact on American jobs and \nAmerican industry. Without passage of this bill, we are forcing \ncompanies to shift jobs overseas.\n  A letter signed by the CEOs of fourteen leading companies, including \nMicrosoft's Bill Gates, Netscape's James Barksdale, and Texas \nInstruments' Thomas Engibous, put this point well:\n\n       Failure to increase the H-1B cap and the limits that will \n     place on the ability of American companies to grow and \n     innovate will also limit the growth of jobs available to \n     American workers * * * Failure to raise the H-1B cap will aid \n     our foreign competitors by limiting the growth and innovation \n     potential of U.S. companies while pushing talented people \n     away from our shores * * * [this] could mean a loss of \n     America's high technology leadership in the world.\n\n  Mr. President, our competitors abroad are waiting for the opportunity \nto surpass us. They can only do this if we allow them to. We cannot \nallow our high-tech industries to be hamstrung by an arbitrary cap on \nimmigration of skilled workers.\n  The Internet has provided widespread access to enormous quantities of \ninformation. This in turn has made it necessary to update our copyright \nlaws to protect the rights of copyright holders in the Information Age.\n  S. 2037, The Digital Millennium Copyright Act, is aptly named. As \ndigitization of commerce, education, entertainment, and a host of other \nonline applications proceeds, international copyright agreements have \nto be maintained and updated. In addition, the rights of copyright \nowners need to be assured as technology progresses. That not only \nsafeguards the copyright holder's rights, but also assures that new \nmaterial will be freely produced and made available to all Internet \nusers.\n  Finally, Mr. President, while information technology has opened up \nwhole new avenues for commerce, learning, and education, it has also \nopened up whole new approaches to shady dealings and unfair business \npractices, and the public should be protected from these. And while we \ncontinue to work to prevent these occurrences, we must also work to \nensure that existing consumer protection laws function as they were \nintended, and do not produce unintended or unfair results against \neither consumers or companies.\n  My colleague, Senator Gramm, has taken a keen interest in these \nissues as they are embodied in the Private Security Litigation Reform \nAct signed into law during the 104th Congress. Senator Gramm has led \nthe Securities Subcommittee in reviewing the effectiveness of this law, \nand he and his fellow Subcommittee members have found it to be \ninsufficient in some areas dealing with class-action suits, \nparticularly those brought in state rather than federal courts, and \nthose in which a valid cause of action has been fraudulently or \ninadequately presented.\n  Although frivolous security class actions are a particular problem \nfor the high-tech industry, to the extent consumers have been harmed \nthe industry must be held accountable. Therefore, the issue of \nsecurities reform is deserving of debate in the Senate.\n\n[[Page S4686]]\n\n  Mr. President, these four bills, although apparently so different, do \nhave a unifying thread just as old and new methods of communicating are \nunited by a common concern. Whether we are talking about telephones or \nadvanced computer technology, analog or digital, data or video, our \nlaws must be sure that all segments of the telecommunications industry \nrespond to the consumers' needs, respect consumers' rights, and provide \nthe services America needs to take us into the unimaginably exciting \nand challenging future that lies before us.\n  These bills are the first of a series of legislative initiatives the \nSenate will consider this session that together are intended to achieve \nthese goals.\n  Mr. President, with that, I conclude the overview of these four \nbills.\n  Mr. President, concerning S. 1618, the Consumer Anti-Slamming Act, \nconsumers across the country are unfortunately all too familiar with a \npractice known as ``slamming.'' Slamming is the unauthorized changing \nof a consumer's long-distance telephone company. It is a problem that \ncontinues to harm consumers despite efforts at the Federal and State \nlevel to fight it. That is why we need to ensure the passage of the \nslamming legislation that I have introduced. The distinguished Senator \nfrom South Carolina, Senator Hollings, who serves as the ranking member \nof the Senate Commerce Committee, joins me in cosponsoring this bill. I \nthank him for his invaluable assistance in developing this important \npiece of legislation to restore and safeguard consumer rights. I also \nthank the other cosponsors of this bill: Senators Lott, Snowe, Reed, \nFrist, Bryan, Dorgan, Johnson, Harkin, Kerry, Inouye, Abraham, Baucus, \nSmith, and Bob Smith, for joining me in this effort.\n  Mr. President, slamming isn't just persisting, it is increasing. \nSlamming complaints are the fastest growing category of complaints \nreported to the Federal Communications Commission, having more than \ntripled in numbers since 1994. Last year, 44,000 consumers filed \nslamming complaints with the FCC. That is a 175 percent increase from \nthe 16,000 complaints the FCC received in 1996.\n  The extent of the slamming problem is even worse than indicated by \nthe number of complaints filed at the FCC. According to the National \nAssociation of State Utility Consumer Advocates, slamming is now the \nmost common consumer complaint received by many State consumer \nadvocates. It has been estimated that as many as 1 million consumers \nare switched annually to a different long-distance telephone company \nwithout their consent. The severity of the slamming problem was \nexemplified just days ago by a new report that 4,800 residents of one \nsmall town in Washington State, about 70 percent of the town, were \nslammed at one time.\n  For several years, the FCC has attempted unsuccessfully to deter \nslamming, yet aggressive long-distance telemarketers continue to \nmislead consumers.\n  On April 21st, the Federal Communications Commission imposed a $5.7 \nmillion fine on a small long-distance company that had been slamming \nconsumers for years. While this is by far the largest fine the FCC has \never levied for this offense, the FCC took action only after receiving \nover 1,400 complaints about this company over the course of 2 years, \nand by now the slammer has disappeared. This instance shows yet again \nthat the FCC's current rules are completely ineffective in preventing \nslamming.\n  S. 1618 is a bill designed to stop slamming once and for all. This \nlegislation establishes stringent antislamming safeguards as well as \nstringent civil and criminal penalties that will discourage this \npractice. It prescribes definitive procedures for carriers to follow \nwhen making carrier changes, provides a menu of remedies for consumers \nthat have been slammed and gives Federal and State authorities the \npower to impose tough sanctions, including high fines and compensatory \npunitive damages.\n  Mr. President, these measures, in addition to those that the States \nmay develop, will ensure that consumers are afforded adequate \nprotection against slamming. In light of the seriousness and scope of \nthe slamming problem, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the AARP, \nalong with a Monday, May 11 article in USA Today be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                         AARP,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 11, 1998.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: The American Association of Retired \n     Persons (AARP) commends you for introducing S. 1618, a bill \n     to improve the protection of consumers against the \n     unauthorized switching of long distance telephone service \n     providers. According to the FCC, this practice known as \n     ``slamming,'' is the fastest growing consumer complaint in \n     telecommunications. We believe that the provisions in your \n     bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to curtail \n     ``slamming'' are good for consumers.\n       S. 1618 includes most of the elements necessary to close \n     off loopholes in the existing law that make telephone \n     subscribers vulnerable to fraudulent or deceptive practices. \n     Key provisions would:\n       Define switching verification procedures--requiring the \n     telecommunications carrier to receive a series of \n     affirmations from the subscriber prior to verifying the \n     switch;\n       Preclude the use of negative option marketing--ending this \n     onerous practice of switching subscribers for failure to tell \n     the carrier that they are not interested;\n       Require a detailed, written notice of change to \n     subscriber--notify the subscriber in writing, within 15 days \n     after the change, of the change, the date on which the change \n     was effected and the name of the individual who authorized \n     the change;\n       Award treble damages to wronged parties--providing the FCC \n     with authority in resolving a complaint to increase the \n     amount of the original award times three; and\n       Punish violating carriers with severe first and second \n     offense fines--imposing fines of not less than $40,000 for \n     the first offense and not less than $150,000 for each \n     subsequent offense, a substantial deterrent to violating \n     carriers.\n       AARP believes that, as competition develops throughout the \n     telecommunications industry, all telephone carriers should be \n     subject to provisions similar to these. We also believe that \n     the issues attendant to the practice of ``cramming'' need to \n     be addressed in the near future. We look forward to working \n     with you toward that goal. In the meantime, the provisions of \n     this bill move consumer protections in the right direction. \n     The Association stands ready to work with you as you seek \n     final passage of this important piece of legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Horace B. Deets,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     [From USA TODAY, May 11, 1998]\n\n                   Callers Fall Victim to Telcom War\n\n\n            complaints of slamming, phony charges skyrocket\n\n                          (By Steve Rosenbush)\n\n       New York.--Jean Franklin, a Salem, Ore., homemaker, was \n     billed last year for several hundred dollars worth of adult-\n     chat phone calls.\n       American Billing & Collection sent the invoices to her \n     home, but the calls--which eventually totaled $1,100--were \n     billed to a telephone number she and her husband, Kenneth, \n     canceled years earlier when they moved.\n       She'd been ``crammed''--billed for a phone service she \n     never bought.\n       ``I was surprised, but I thought it was a mistake that \n     could be easily corrected,'' Franklin says. Instead, American \n     Billing, which declined to comment for this story, eventually \n     turned the matter over to a collection agency.\n       Her credit report marred by reported bad debt, Franklin \n     complained to the California attorney general's office and \n     the Federal Trade Commission. Last month, regulators filed \n     charges in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles accusing \n     American Billing and two other phone companies of using \n     deceptive and unfair practices to bill people for adult-chat \n     services. But the bad debt is still on Franklin's record.\n       It's a tale from the trenches of the telecom wars, where \n     millions of consumers like Franklin are suffering the \n     collateral damage. Armies of companies have poured into the \n     increasingly deregulated $200 billion U.S. market, \n     overwhelming the limited resources of regulators with \n     aggressive and sometimes illegal practices.\n       Desperate for a tactical advantage, other companies are \n     rushing to market with innovative products and services that \n     sometimes don't work. Make an evening phone call on a \n     congested network, such as the one in Los Angeles, and seven \n     times out of 100 it won't go through on the first attempt, \n     says Bellcore, a telecommunications research company. AT \n     says users of its directory assistance get the number they \n     ask for only nine out of 10 times. Buy a prepaid calling \n     card, and there's a good chance the call won't go through. \n     Many of the basic services and products that people took for \n     granted in the monopoly era simply don't work--or don't work \n     well--today. Annual telephone-related complaints and \n     inquiries have soared more than tenfold since 1990; the \n     Federal Communications Commission logged 44,035 in 1997 \n     alone.\n\n[[Page S4687]]\n\n       ``Here is the dark side of competition and choice,'' says \n     FCC Chairman William Kennard. ``Sure, life was easier when \n     they had no choice,'' Kennard says. ``But that is not what \n     consumers want.''\n       Or is it?\n       Long-distance rates have fallen 60% since the 1984 \n     dismantling of AT, and consumers can choose from hundreds \n     of new carriers. ``But it was a lot easier to use the phone \n     before they broke up AT And I don't think you really save \n     that much money now because companies charge you for other \n     things,'' says Alan Kohn of Woodbridge, N.J., who was \n     dismayed when he couldn't find a pay phone that accepted his \n     calling card.\n       Statistics from phone companies, consumer advocates and \n     state and federal regulators don't begin to capture the depth \n     of consumer frustration with phone services.\n\n\n                          headaches everywhere\n\n       Directory assistance costs more, often requires a wait, and \n     increasingly provides wrong numbers. The toll on callers is \n     more than $50 million a year if just 5% of the 1.5 billion \n     long-distance information calls are inaccurate. Not to \n     mention the frustration of dealing with computer-generated \n     voices instead of operators. Carriers like AT blame local \n     phone companies that won't share their databases of names and \n     phone numbers.\n       Prepaid calling cards, ``On the whole, they are worth it,'' \n     says Dan Singhani, 45, a newsstand owner in Manhattan who \n     uses them several times a week to call relatives in India and \n     Hong Kong. ``But some cards don't work. . . . Or you are \n     talking and the line is disconnected.''\n       Pay phone charges. Muriel Flore thought she was using her \n     calling card when she stopped during an interstate trip to \n     call her vet and check on her sick cat. She was stunned \n     several weeks later when Oncor Communications billed her more \n     than $12 for the five-minute call. Oncor agreed to cancel the \n     bill after Flore complained to the FCC. The company did not \n     return phone calls for this story.\n       Fragile phones. A micro-processor-driven telephone ruined \n     by just a drop of water that seeps through the keypad.\n\n\n                              ``slammed''\n\n       By far, the bulk of consumer complaints to the FCC are \n     about slamming: switching a customer's long-distance service \n     without permission. Last year, the FCC received more than \n     20,000 complaints. But the actual incidence of slamming is \n     much higher. AT alone says 500,000 of its 80 million \n     residential customers were slammed last year.\n       ``I resented the fact that I had been changed without \n     notice,'' says Jim Pringle of Pittsboro, N.C. ``But what I \n     resented almost more was that somebody benefited from the lag \n     between when it occurred and when I realized it.''\n       Ronald J. Carboni thinks a disgruntled neighbor, playing a \n     prank, switched his phone service from Sprint to National \n     Telephone & Communications. Carboni, 52, was charged $8.92, a \n     fee National immediately dropped once notified of the \n     problem. Records show someone had forged Carboni's name as \n     ``Batboni.'' National never confirmed the order.\n       Lawmakers and regulators are cracking down, though slamming \n     complaints represent only a fraction of the 50 million \n     changes that consumers made in their long-distance service \n     last year. Last month the FCC levied the biggest slamming \n     fine in history, a $5.7 million penalty against the Fletcher \n     Cos., run by a 30-year-old fugitive named Daniel Fletcher. \n     The FCC has vowed to increase penalties and force companies \n     to return money they collect from slamming victims. In \n     California, a new law requires long-distance carriers to hire \n     a third party to authenticate every request for service \n     changes.\n       The phone companies are policing themselves, too. AT \n     filed lawsuits in March against three independent sales \n     agents it suspected of the problem. AT says agents who \n     account for less than 5% of the company's consumer long-\n     distance sales were responsible for about two-thirds of \n     slamming complaints against AT\n\n\n                           billed and bilked\n\n       Scams are multiplying as deregulation spreads. Complaints \n     of cramming--cases like that of Jean Franklin--are the newest \n     twists, and they are soaring.\n       A host of small, independent companies are billing \n     customers--sometimes on their local phone bills--for \n     information services, such as horoscopes and sports scores, \n     that they didn't order. Some people are billed at random; \n     others are the victims of carelessness and error by carriers \n     and billing companies.\n       The FCC has processed 1,123 complaints of cramming since it \n     began tracking them last December. And last week, Bell \n     Atlantic cracked down on cramming, in effect saying that it \n     would no longer allow 20 smaller companies to place their \n     charges on Bell Atlantic bills.\n       The company, which serves more than 41 million customers \n     from Virginia to Maine, said it is receiving hundreds of \n     complaints a day and that more than 80% are legitimate.\n       Floyd Brown's cramming case is typical. Brown, 76, of \n     Carlsbad, Calif., said American billing charged his mother \n     earlier this year for $44.55 worth of information services it \n     said she had purchased over the phone. ``She had been dead \n     for a year and a half,'' Brown says.\n       And Franklin and her husband are still struggling to \n     resolve their dispute with the company. The bad debt remains \n     on their credit reports, and shame has kept them from \n     applying for loans to buy a new car and a new house. ``It's \n     not going to be over until that item is removed from our \n     credit report,'' Franklin says.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. The AARP writes:\n\n       The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) commends \n     you for introducing S. 1618, a bill to improve the protection \n     of consumers against the unauthorized switching of long \n     distance telephone service providers. According to the FCC, \n     this practice, known as ``slamming'' is the fastest growing \n     consumer complaint in telecommunications. We believe that the \n     provisions in your bill to amend the Communications Act of \n     1934 to curtail ``slamming'' are good for consumers.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       AARP believes that, as competition develops throughout the \n     telecommunications industry, all telephone carriers should be \n     subject to provisions similar to these. We also believe that \n     the issues attendant the practice of ``cramming'' need to be \n     addressed in the near future. We look forward to working with \n     you toward that goal. In the meantime, the provisions of this \n     bill move consumer protections in the right direction. The \n     Association stands ready to work with you as you seek final \n     passage of this important piece of legislation.\n\n  Mr. President, yesterday there was an article in the USA Today which \nis included in the Record, and it says: ``Callers fall victim to \ntelecom war, complaints of slamming, phony charges skyrocket.''\n\n       Jean Franklin, a Salem, Ore., homemaker, was billed last \n     year for several hundred dollars worth of adult-chat phone \n     calls.\n       American Billing & Collection sent the invoices to her \n     home, but the calls--which eventually totaled $1,100--were \n     billed to a telephone number she and her husband, Kenneth, \n     canceled years earlier when they moved.\n       She'd been ``crammed''--billed for a phone service she \n     never bought.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Long-distance rates have fallen 60% since the 1984 \n     dismantling of AT, and consumers can choose from hundreds \n     of new carriers. ``But it was a lot easier to use the phone \n     before they broke up AT . . .,'' says Allan Kohn . . . who \n     was dismayed when he couldn't find a pay phone that accepted \n     his calling card.\n\n  Mr. President, by far the bulk of consumer complaints at the FCC are \nabout slamming, switching consumers long-distance service without \npermission. And it goes on to talk about the 20,000 complaints.\n  AT alone says 500,000 of its 80 million residential customers were \nslammed last year.\n\n       ``I resented the fact that I had been changed without \n     notice,'' says Jim Pringle of Pittsboro, N.C. ``But what I \n     resented almost more was that somebody benefited from the lag \n     between when it occurred and when I realized it.''\n\n  Mr. President, I recognize on the floor Senator Collins who has been \nheavily involved in this issue. And after Senator Dorgan speaks, I \nthink she will seek to address her amendment. But I want to thank her \nfor her involvement in this issue, the hearings that she held in her \nsubcommittee and the enormous contributions she has made in causing \nthis bill to progress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me add my congratulations to Senator \nCollins on the work that she has done, and certainly to the Senator \nfrom Arizona, Senator McCain, and Senator Hollings. Senator Hollings \nhas asked me to be present for him. He is tending to other Senate \nbusiness at the moment.\n  This is an important piece of legislation. We appreciate very much \nthe bipartisan work that was done to bring it to the floor of the \nSenate.\n  I would like to just, for a couple of moments, give an overview of \nwhere we are and then bring it to this piece of legislation--and I will \nbe rather brief--after which I will be interested in hearing from the \nSenator from Maine as well.\n  The breathtaking changes in telecommunications and in the \ntelecommunications industry in recent years have been quite remarkable. \nNo one could have anticipated what we would see in technology and in \nopportunities that exist from the changing technology.\n  I, in a speech some while ago, held up a vacuum tube, a small vacuum \ntube that we are all familiar with, and then I held up next to it a \nlittle computer\n\n[[Page S4688]]\n\nchip that was about one-half the size of my little fingernail, and I \nsaid, ``The little computer chip equals 5 million vacuum tubes.'' \nSometimes we forget to equate what is happening in these little chips \nand in their power and in their capability, but it is really quite \nremarkable what has happened to speed, storage density, memory and all \nthe other things that relate to these breakthroughs.\n  The CEO of one of the large companies, IBM as a matter of fact, in a \nreport to the annual meeting that I had read, I guess, about 6 or 8 \nmonths ago, talked about the research they are doing in the area of \nstorage density, which kind of relates to all this technology. And I \nwas struck by what he said. He said we were on the verge of a \nbreakthrough with respect to storage density, such that the time was \nnear, he thought, when we would be able to store all of the volumes of \nwork at the Library of Congress, which represents the largest volume of \nrecorded human history anywhere on Earth--we would be able to store all \nof that, 14 million volumes of work, on a wafer the size of a penny.\n\n  Think of that--carrying around in your pocket to slip into a laptop a \nwafer the size of a penny that contains 14 million volumes of work. \nUnthinkable? No. It is where technology is heading.\n  In my little high school, where I graduated in a class of nine, we \nhad a library the size of a coat closet. That high school now has \naccess to the largest libraries in the world through the Internet. All \nof this is made possible by the breakthroughs in technology and the \ntelecommunications industry and the development of the information \nsuperhighway. Many of us are very concerned, as public policy develops \nin all of these areas, that we make certain that the benefits of all of \nthis are available to all Americans, that the on-ramps and off-ramps \nfor the information superhighway, yes, stop even in my hometown, in my \nsmall county.\n  So as we develop legislation such as the Telecommunications Act, \nwhich Congress passed a couple years ago, and try to evaluate what \nkinds of policy guidance we can give as this industry grows, it is very \nimportant that we do this right.\n  I might say, as I begin, that I am concerned about universal service, \nabout the availability of universal service--especially in telephone \nservice--in the years ahead, in the high-cost areas and rural areas of \nour country. I hope very much that the Federal Communications \nCommission will make a U-turn with respect to some of the policy \ndecisions they have made which I think threaten universal service in \nthe future. There is still time for them to make some recalculations \nand some different policy judgments. I have met with Chairman Kennard \nand others, and I hope very much that they will make some different \njudgments than what we saw from the previous Chairman of the FCC, which \nI think will implement the Telecommunications Act, which is very \ndetrimental to high-cost areas and rural areas of the country. We are \ngoing to debate that more in the months and years ahead.\n  Let me talk specifically about the telecommunications area that does \nwork and works well. One of the areas that works and provides the \nfruits and benefits of competition to virtually every American is the \ncompetition in long-distance telephone service. This is an area--long-\ndistance telephone service--in which there is robust, aggressive \ncompetition. Anywhere you look, you will find a telephone company \nengaged in selling long-distance service. If you don't think so, just \nsit down for dinner some night, and somebody will give you a cold call \nfrom an office somewhere in a State far away, and they will be trying \nto sell you their long-distance service. They apparently only dial at \nmealtime--at least into our home. But I think every American is \nfamiliar with these telephone calls--``Won't you take our long-distance \nservice?'' As I indicated, up to 500 companies are robustly competing \nfor the consumer dollar. What has happened to the cost of long-distance \nservice? It has gone down, down, down. That represents the fruit and \nthe benefit of good competition.\n  But one other thing has happened with respect to this competition. As \nis the case where there is robust competition, there are also some bad \nactors. In this case, ``bad actors'' means that people get involved in \nthis business of trying to sell a long-distance service to a customer \nthat already has a long-distance provider but decides they are going to \nsell it the shortcut way--they are not even going to ask the consumer \nwhether they want to change providers. Through sleight of hand, they \nare going to engage in a technological stealing of sorts; they are \ngoing to switch someone's long-distance service and not tell them about \nit. That is, in fact, stealing; that is, in fact, a criminal act. One \nmight ask, is that happening a lot? Yes, it is happening a lot.\n  Here is a story about the king of slammers. I was trying to evaluate \nwhere this word ``slammer'' came from. Frankly, nobody knows where the \nword ``slammer'' came from. But the definition of ``slammer,'' as it is \nused in this context, is someone who goes in and changes someone else's \nlong-distance carrier without telling them and without authorization. \nIt is stealing. It is criminal.\n  The king of slammers is Daniel Fletcher. Let me cite him as an \nexample. The head of the FCC, William Kennard, said, ``This is truly a \nbad actor. He is a felon who clearly had intent to violate the FCC's \nrules, and we're hitting him hard.'' But not too hard, because they \nhaven't found him. He changed a half-million people's long-distance \ncarrier, and he, apparently, made $20 million. Is that stealing? Yes. \nIs that petty cash? No; that is grand theft. The fact is, that goes on \nacross the country all too often.\n  Yesterday, Mr. President, on the floor, I held a clipping from the \nnewspaper in North Dakota. It just so happened that, coincidentally, \nthe North Dakota papers had a story that said that the North Dakota \nAttorney General had been the victim of slamming. Someone had decided \nto change the attorney general's long-distance carrier without asking \nher.\n\n  Now, am I suggesting that slammers are stupid? Well, not always. They \ncertainly seem to steal a lot of money. But is it a stupid slammer that \ndecides they are going to change the long-distance service of an \nattorney general of a State without telling them? Yes, that is pretty \nstupid. But this is not about being stupid or funny, it is about \nstealing. The hearings that were held by Senator Collins, and others, \nand the work done has been to respond to a very real problem that is \nsignificant.\n  Now, the FCC complaints about this slamming--the unauthorized change \nof a long-distance service--increased from 2,000 five years ago, to \n20,000 last year. The FCC indicates that there is a substantial amount \nof slamming going on, evidenced by the complaints to the FCC. The GAO \ndid a report that, in fact, was rather critical of the FCC's \nenforcement on these slamming issues, saying that the antislamming \nmeasures ``do little to protect the consumers from slamming.''\n  We have a problem; yet, we are not able to solve that problem with \nthe regulatory agency, either because it is not doing what it ought to \ndo, it doesn't exert enough energy, or perhaps it doesn't have enough \nauthority. But whatever the reason--and it might be a combination of \nall of those reasons --this problem is not going away; it is growing \nmuch, much worse.\n  In 1997, with 20,000 complaints, the FCC obtained only 9 consent \ndecrees from companies nationwide that paid a total of $1.2 million in \nfines because of slamming. In the same year, California, by comparison, \nsuspended one firm for 3 years because of slamming, and fined it $2 \nmillion, and ordered it to repay another $2 million to its customers. \nOne State, the State of California, did far more than the FCC. I hope \nthat this piece of legislation we will pass will give the FCC the \nauthority, energy, and resources to join us and do what we must do to \nrespond to this slamming.\n  Now, let me read what the legislation does. It strengthens the \nantislamming laws and requires the FCC to establish the following \nconsumer protections:\n  One, it prohibits a carrier from changing a local subscriber's long-\ndistance service, unless the carrier follows the minimum verification \nprocedures prescribed by the FCC--sets up specific procedures that must \nbe followed.\n  Two, it requires carriers to keep an oral, written, or electronic \nrecord of a subscriber authorizing a change in their carrier.\n\n[[Page S4689]]\n\n  Three, it requires a carrier to send a written notification to the \nconsumer informing them of the changed service within 15 days of the \nchange in service.\n  Four, it requires carriers to provide consumers with the information \nand procedures necessary to file a complaint at the FCC.\n  Five, it requires carriers to provide slammed customers with any \nevidence that authorized that change.\n  It allows the complaint process to impose stiff penalties, up to \n$150,000, and a range of other important issues that I think will give \nus much more enforcement against this slamming process and the slamming \npractice across the country.\n  Once again, let me conclude by saying that this is not some minor \nnuisance issue; this is an issue in which some have taken advantage of \nconsumers who are the victims. It is true that the company that has \nbeen changed is also a victim, a company that was serving a customer \nand is now not serving the customer.\n  But the ultimate victim here are the consumers who only understand \nlater after they have taken a look at a bill somewhere and discover \nthey are the ones that have been victimized.\n  This bill also, incidentally, would prohibit some other practices \nthat are deceptive. There are a whole range of practices that have \nallowed people or persuaded people to sign a coupon in exchange for \nhaving an opportunity or a chance to get something, or get a free door \nprize, or get some sort of free gift. So you sign this little coupon. \nOn the bottom in tiny little script it tells you that despite the fact \nthat you have never read it, you have just signed away and changed your \nlong-distance carrier. That is cheating. Where I come from, and I think \nwhere all of us come from, when you cheat and steal, somebody ought to \nbe after you to get you.\n  That is exactly what we want to have happen with respect to the \nenforcement against this kind of behavior and practice that is making \nvictims of millions of Americans all across the country.\n  This one fellow took one-half million households, changed their long-\ndistance carrier, got $20 million into an income stream into shell \ncorporations that he set up, and now he is gone. What does this mean? \nIt means that one-half million Americans were cheated. This fellow \nstole from not only the companies but especially the Americans who \nexpected to have a long-distance service they had contracted for and \ndiscovered someone else changed it.\n  Let me again, as I began, say thank you to Senator Collins to Senator \nMcCain, and to Senator Hollings and so many other. I am a cosponsor of \nthis, as are a good number of our colleagues in the Senate, because it \nis good legislation and will do the right thing for consumers in this \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Dorgan for his kind \nremarks but also for his very clear and concise depiction of the issue \nthat we are addressing. I think it is important that the record reflect \nthe entirety of his remarks.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending committee \namendments be agreed to and considered as original text for purpose of \nfurther amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendments were agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of legislation \nthat is necessary to stem the tide of one of the most annoying anti-\nconsumer practices, known as slamming. Slamming occurs when a preferred \ntelecommunications service provider of the consumer is changed without \nthe consent of the consumer. This legislation enhances the verification \nand other procedures that carriers must use to ensure that the consumer \nconsents to the change in its service provider. It also enhances the \nenforcement authority of the FCC, the Department of Justice, and the \nState attorneys general and imposes greater penalties and fines to \naddress the problem of slamming.\n  Slamming is not a new problem. Many consumers have been victims of \nslamming, suddenly discovering that their phone service is no longer \nbeing provided by their carrier of choice. Instead, it is being \nprovided by an unauthorized carrier. We've all had the sales calls \ninterrupt us at the dinner table. Regardless of what the FCC does, the \nproblem persists.\n  In a recent USA TODAY article, the FCC said it received 12,000 \nconsumer complaints about slamming during the first half of 1997. In \n1996, it received more than 16,000 total slamming complaints. In its \nFall 1996 Common Carrier Scorecard, the FCC stated that slamming was \nthe top consumer complaint category handled by the Enforcement \nDivision's Consumer Protection Branch. It also stated that slamming \ncomplaints were the fastest-growing category of complaints, increasing \nmore than six-fold between 1993 and 1995. In its 1997 Common Carrier \nScorecard, the FCC indicated that nine companies accused of slamming \nhave entered into consent decrees and have agreed to make payments to \nthe United States Treasury totaling $1,245,000. The FCC has also issued \ntwo Notices of Forfeitures with combined forfeiture penalties of \n$160,000. Nonetheless, slamming continues to be a significant problem.\n  The provisions we introduce today will hopefully stop this practice \nof slamming once and for all. The legislation places new \nresponsibilities on carriers for the benefit of consumers. For example, \noften times, a consumer is slammed and does not know it until the next \ntelephone bill arrives. Sometimes, unscrupulous carriers provide \nservice to slammed customers for a considerable time before the \ncustomer becomes aware of the unauthorized switch. To prevent this, the \nlegislation requires that whenever there is a change in the \nsubscriber's carrier, the carrier must notify the subscriber of the \nchange within 15 days. A carrier has 120 days to resolve a slamming \ncomplaint. If the carrier is unable to resolve the complaint within the \nrequired timeframe, then the carrier must notify the consumer of his or \nher right to file a complaint with the FCC. The FCC is required to \nresolve a slamming complaint it receives within 150 days.\n\n  The bill also requires a carrier to retain evidence of the consumer's \nauthorization to switch carriers and to inform the consumer of their \nrights to pursue a resolution of the matter with the Federal \nCommunications Commission and with State authorities. Requiring \ncarriers to store information will make it easier to resolve slamming \ndisputes that arise between the consumer and the carrier. Armed with \ninformation on how to resolve slamming disputes, we hope that consumers \nwill pursue their available recourse and help us hold carriers \naccountable for their illegal actions.\n  In addition, the bill creates a variety of causes of actions and \nimposes still penalties on carriers. If a carrier violates FCC rules, \nthe FCC can award the greater of actual damages or $500 and has the \ndiscretion to award treble damages. If there are no mitigating \ncircumstances, the FCC is required to impose on the carrier a \nforfeiture of $40,000 or more for the first offense and not less than \n$150,000 for each subsequent offense. If a company fails to pay a \nforfeiture, the FCC can limit, deny, or revoke the company's operating \nauthority. Where the slammer's actions have been willful, the \nDepartment of Justice can bring an action to impose fines in accordance \nwith Title 18, United States Code and imprison the person who submits \nor executes a change in willful violation of Section 258. In addition, \nState attorneys general can bring actions in federal court to: impose \ncriminal sanctions and penalties under Title 18 U.S. Code; recover \nactual damages or $500 in damages; and recover fines of $40,000 or more \nfor first offenses and not less than $150,000 for subsequent offenses \nunless there are mitigating circumstances. Finally, this bill gives the \nFCC authority to pursue billing agents when they place charges on a \nconsumers bill that they know the consumer has not authorized.\n  Slamming is a troublesome problem. Slamming eliminates a consumer's \nability to chose his or her service provider. It distorts \ntelecommunications markets by enabling companies engaged in misleading \npractices to increase their customer base, revenues,\n\n[[Page S4690]]\n\nand profitability through illegal means. Today hundreds of long \ndistance carriers compete for a consumer's business. If slamming is not \naddressed effectively today, it could become much more worrisome. The \nchanges in the telecommunications industry will probably result in a \nfuture in which local and long distance phone services are provided by \nan even greater number of carriers.\n  It is therefore important that we eliminate the practice of slamming. \nConsumers have the right to choose their own phone companies when they \nchoose. A consumer's choice should not be curtailed by the illegal \nactions of bad industry actors and a consumer should not have to spend \na significant amount of time addressing issues of slamming. I expect \nthat requirements placed by this bill will help to eliminate slamming. \nMy actions with respect to slamming reflect my continued efforts to \nprotect consumers as I have in the past supported legislation which \nsuccessfully addressed the problem of junk fax and ensure that \ncompanies engage in proper telemarketing practices.\n  I welcome my colleagues in joining Senator McCain and I as we address \nthe problem of slamming and ensure that no one is allowed to curtail a \nconsumer's choice of phone service provider.\n  Ms. COLLINS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield such time to the Senator from Maine as she may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I want to start by complimenting the \nchairman of the Commerce Committee for his outstanding leadership in \ndealing with a very important consumer issue, and that is telephone \nslamming.\n  I also want to commend the Senator from North Dakota for his very \neloquent explanation of the problem and the solutions.\n  Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for S. 1618, \nlegislation that will provide America's consumers with much needed \nprotection against a fraudulent practice known as slamming--the \nunauthorized switching of a customer's telephone service provider. I \nwant to commend Senator McCain and Hollings for taking steps to attack \nthis rapidly growing problem.\n  Telephone slamming is spreading like wildfire. In Maine, complaints \nincreased by 100 percent from 1996 to 1997. Nationwide, slamming is the \nnumber one telephone-related complaint. While the FCC received more \nthan 20,000 slamming complaints in 1997, a significant increase over \nthe previous year, estimates from phone companies indicate that as many \nas one million people were slammed during that 12-month period.\n  Last fall, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I \nchair, undertook an extensive investigation of this problem. At a field \nhearing this past February in Portland, Maine, at which I was joined by \nSenator Durbin, one of the leaders in the fight against slamming, we \nheard from several consumers who were victimized by this practice. \nTheir words reflect the public attitude toward the intentional slammer, \nas they described what happened to them as ``stealing,'' ``criminal,'' \nand ``break-in.''\n  My Subcommittee recently held a second hearing, which revealed that a \nnumber of what are known as switchless resellers were responsible for a \nlarge percentage of the intentional slamming incidents. These \noperations use deceptive marketing practices and outright fraud to \nswitch consumers' long distance service without their consent.\n  One recent victim was a hospital in western Maine. This demonstrates \nthat no one is immune from this despicable practice.\n  Mr. President, our hearings presented a case that dramatically shows \nthe need for tougher sanctions to deal with this problem. I refer to an \nindividual by the name of Daniel Fletcher, who fraudulently operated as \na long distance reseller under at least eight different company names, \nslamming thousands of consumers, and billing them for at least $20 \nmillion in long distance charges. While we were struck by the ease with \nwhich Mr. Fletcher carried out his activities and evaded detection, we \nwere shocked to learn about the absence of adequate criminal sanctions \nto deal with his activities.\n\n  Mr. Fletcher bilked America's telephone customers out of millions of \ndollars by charging them for services they did not authorize and \nobtaining from them money to which he was not entitled. Yet, we lack a \nstatute that expressly makes intentional slamming a crime, and unless \nthat is corrected, we can expect many more Fletchers. Mr. President, \nthe time has come for the United States Congress to disconnect the \ntelephone slammers.\n  Given our concern about this problem, Senator Durbin and I introduced \nslamming legislation, and I want to thank Senators McCain and Hollings \nfor agreeing to incorporate its three main provisions into a Manager's \nAmendment to their bill. These additions will help make a good bill \neven better.\n  The first of these provisions will get tough with the outright scam \nartists by establishing new criminal penalties for intentional \nslamming. I should emphasize that these penalties will apply only to \nthose who know that they are acting without the customer's \nauthorization and not to those who make an honest mistake or even act \ncarelessly. It's time we sent the deliberate slammer to the slammer. In \naddition, anyone convicted of intentional slamming will be disqualified \nfrom being a telecommunications service provider, thereby enabling us \nnot only to punish past conduct but also to prevent future violations.\n  The second provision is designed to remove the financial incentive \nfor companies to engage in slamming by giving slammed customers the \noption to pay their original carrier at their previous rate. Under \ncurrent law, it appears that customers are obligated to pay the slammer \neven after they discover they have been switched without their consent. \nThat hardly acts as a deterrent, something that must be changed.\n  The third provision will improve enforcement by requiring all \ntelecommunications carriers to report slamming violations on a \nquarterly basis to the FCC. To avoid putting a burden on the carriers, \nthe report need only be summary in nature, but it will enable the FCC \nto identify and move against the frequent slammer.\n  Deregulation of the telephone industry may produce many benefits for \nconsumers but it also has given rise to fraud where it did not \npreviously exist. It was Congress who decided to deregulate the \nindustry, and it is Congress that must act to stop this fraud. Senate \nbill 1618 will move us in that direction by putting a big dent in \ntelephone slamming and by protecting the right of the American people \nto choose with whom they wish to do business.\n  Again, I very much appreciate the cooperation of the distinguished \nchairman of the Commerce Committee and his willingness to accept the \nCollins-Durbin amendments.\n  I thank the Senator, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Collins again. We look \nforward to working with her on other issues that are as \nnoncontroversial as these, as opposed to campaign finance reform which \ngenerated much more concern. But I seriously want to note the hard work \nthat Senator Collins devoted in her subcommittee to this issue. It was \nvery important. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2389\n\n   (Purpose: To provide a substitute that incorporates the Committee \n   amendments and additional changes in the bill as reported by the \n                               committee)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for the incorporation at this time \nof the managers' amendment to S. 1618. I ask unanimous consent that it \nbe adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCAIN], for himself and Mr. \n     Hollings, proposes an amendment numbered 2389.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment (No. 2389) is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr President, this amendment defines ``subscriber'' in a \nway that allows the person named on the billing statement or account, \nor\n\n[[Page S4691]]\n\nthose authorized by such a person, to consent to carrier changes.\n  It clarifies that the time period the FCC prescribes for a carrier to \nresolve a slamming complaint, which is not to exceed 120 days, applies \nwhen a carrier receives notice directly from the subscriber of the \ncomplaint.\n  It makes clear that if a carrier does not resolve a complaint within \nthe period prescribed by the Commission, it must notify the subscriber \nin writing of the subscriber's rights and remedies only under Section \n258 of the Communications Act, not under any other law.\n  It clarifies that the FCC may dispose of a slamming complaint within \nthe 150-day period established in the bill by issuing a ``decision or \nruling.'' The FCC will not be required to issue a formal ``order'' each \ntime it resolves a complaint. It also clarifies that the 150-day period \nin the bill is intended to be used by the FCC to determine if slamming \nhas occurred, and if slamming has occurred, the FCC has another 90 \ndays, if such additional time is necessary, to determine what damages \nand penalties should be assessed.\n  In discussing the amount of damages that may be awarded by the FCC, \nthe original bill referred to the FCC as ``resolving a complaint.'' \nThis change removes that language and the implication that ``resolving \na complaint'' requires a finding of a violation of the slamming rules. \nIt states that the FCC may award damages only if slamming has occurred.\n  It allows state Attorneys General to bring an action for each alleged \nslamming violation to enjoin unauthorized changes and to recover \ndamages, to bring an action to seek criminal sanctions for willful \nviolations, and to bring an action to seek a penalty of not less than \n$40,000 for the first slamming offense and not less than $150,000 for \neach subsequent offense. A court may reduce the amount of these \npenalties if it determines that there are mitigating circumstances \ninvolved. The district courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction over \nall of these actions.\n  It clarifies that states are not preempted from imposing more \nrestrictive requirements, regulations, damages, and penalties on \nunauthorized changes in a subscriber's telephone exchange service or \ntelephone toll service provider than are imposed under Section 258 of \nthe Communication Act, as amended by this bill.\n  It clarifies that when the FCC is resolving slamming complaints, it \nis not instituting a ``civil action.'' In addition, while a particular \nslamming compliant involving a particular carrier is pending before the \nFCC, no state may institute a civil action against the same carrier for \nthe same alleged violation.\n  It allows the FCC to use the fact of a carrier's nonpayment of a \nforfeiture for a slamming or billing violation as a basis for revoking, \ndenying or limiting that carrier's operating authority.\n  It imposes duties on all billing agents, both those that are \ntelecommunications carriers that render bills to consumers and those \nthat operate as billing clearinghouses for carriers. It requires any \nbilling agent that issues telephone bills to follow a certain format \nfor the bill. The bill must list telecommunications services separately \nfrom other services and must identify the names of each provider and \nthe services they have provided. Billing agents also must provide \ninformation to enable a consumer to contact a service provider about a \nbilling dispute. This provision also prohibits billing agents from \nsubmitting charges for a consumer's bill if they know or should know \nthat the consumer did not authorize such charges or if the charges are \notherwise improper.\n  It given the Commission jurisdiction over billing agents that are not \ntelecommunications carriers but provide billing services for such \ncarriers or for other companies whose charges appear on telephone \nbills.\n  It instructs the FCC to include in the report required by Section 6 \nof the bill an examination of telemarketing and other solicitation \npractices, such as contests and sweepstakes, used by carriers to obtain \ncarrier changes. The FCC also is required to study whether a third \nparty should verify carrier changes and whether an independent third \nparty should administer carrier changes. This provision will address \nconcerns about the possibility of anti-competitive behavior by the \nlocal phone companies once they start to provide long-distance service. \nEnforcement of slamming rules will remain the responsibility of the \nFCC.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send, on behalf of Senator Feingold, an \namendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2390) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as we take up this important anti-\nslamming bill, which of course deals with consumer problems with \ntelephone service,\n\n[[Page S4692]]\n\nI am pleased that the Senate has agreed to this amendment to provide a \npractical solution to the all too common problem of interference with \nresidential home electronic equipment caused by unlawful use of \ncitizens band [CB] radios. I want to thank the Chairman of the \nCommittee, Senator McCain, and the ranking member, Senator Hollings, \nfor agreeing to include this amendment in the slamming bill.\n  The problem of CB radio interference can be extremely distressing for \nresidents who cannot have a telephone conversation, watch television, \nor listen to the radio without being interrupted by a neighbor's \nillegal use of a CB radio. Unfortunately, under the current law, those \nresidents have little recourse. The amendment I offered today will \nprovide those residents with a practical solution to this problem.\n  Up until recently, the FCC has enforced its rules outlining what \nequipment may or may not be used for CB radio transmissions, how long \ntransmissions may be broadcast, what channels may be used, as well as \nmany other technical requirements. FCC also investigated complaints \nthat a CB radio enthusiast's transmissions interfered with a neighbor's \nuse of home electronic and telephone equipment. FCC receives thousands \nof such complaints annually.\n  For the past 3 years, I have worked with constituents who have been \nbothered by persistent interference of nearby CB radio transmissions in \nsome cases caused by unlawful use of radio equipment. In each case, the \nconstituents have sought my help in securing an FCC investigation of \nthe complaint. And in each case, the FCC indicated that due to a lack \nof resources, the Commission no longer investigates radio frequency \ninterference complaints. Instead of investigation and enforcement, the \nFCC is able to provide only self-help information which the consumer \nmay use to limit the interference on their own.\n  I suppose this situation is understandable given the rising number of \ncomplaints for things like slamming. The resources of the FCC are \nlimited, and there is only so much they can do to address complaints of \nradio interference.\n  Nonetheless, this problem is extremely annoying and frustrating to \nthose who experience it. In many cases, residents implement the self-\nhelp measures recommended by FCC such as installing filtering devices \nto prevent the unwanted interference, working with their telephone \ncompany, or attempting to work with the neighbor they believe is \ncausing the interference. In many cases these self-help measures are \neffective.\n  However, in some cases filters and other technical solutions fail to \nsolve the problem because the interference is caused by unlawful use of \nCB radio equipment such as unauthorized linear amplifiers.\n  Municipal residents, after being denied investigative or enforcement \nassistance from the FCC, frequently contact their city or town \ngovernment and ask them to police the interference. However, the \nCommunications Act of 1934 provides exclusive authority to the Federal \nGovernment for the regulation of radio, preempting municipal ordinances \nor State laws to regulate radio frequency interference caused by \nunlawful use of CB radio equipment. This has created an interesting \ndilemma for municipal governments. They can neither pass their own \nordinances to control CB radio interference, nor can they rely on the \nagency with exclusive jurisdiction over interference to enforce the \nvery Federal law which preempts them.\n  Let me give an example of the kind of frustrations people have \nexperienced in attempting to deal with these problems. Shannon Ladwig, \na resident of Beloit, WI has been fighting to end CB interference with \nher home electronic equipment that has been plaguing her family for \nover a year. Shannon worked within the existing system, asking for an \nFCC investigation, installing filtering equipment on her telephone, \nattempting to work with the neighbor causing the interference, and so \non. Nothing has been effective.\n  Here are some of the annoyances Shannon has experienced. Her \nanswering machine picks up calls for which there is no audible ring, \nand at times records ghost messages. Often, she cannot get a dial tone \nwhen she or her family members wish to place an outgoing call. During \ntelephone conversations, the content of the nearby CB transmission can \nfrequently be heard and on occasion, her phone conversations are \ninexplicably cut off. Ms. Ladwig's TV transmits audio from the CB \ntransmission rather than the television program her family is watching. \nShannon never knows if the TV program she taped with her VCR will \nactually record the intended program or whether it will contain \nprofanity from a nearby CB radio conversation.\n  Shannon did everything she could to solve the problem and a year \nlater she still feels like a prisoner in her home, unable to escape the \nbroadcasting whims of a CB operator using illegal equipment with \nimpunity. Shannon even went to her city council to demand action. The \nBeloit City Council responded by passing an ordinance allowing local \nlaw enforcement to enforce FCC regulations--an ordinance the council \nknows is preempted by Federal law. Last year, the Beloit City Council \npassed a resolution supporting legislation I introduced, S. 608, on \nwhich my amendment is modeled, which will allow at least part of that \nordinance to stand.\n  The problems experienced by Beloit residents are by no means isolated \nincidents. I have received very similar complaints from at least 10 \nother Wisconsin communities in the last several years in which whole \nneighborhoods are experiencing persistent radio frequency interference. \nSince I have begun working on this issue, my staff has also been \ncontacted by a number of other congressional offices who are also \nlooking for a solution to the problem of radio frequency interference \nin their States or districts caused by unlawful CB use. The city of \nGrand Rapids, MI, in particular, has contacted me about this \nlegislation because they face a persistent interference problem very \nsimilar to that in Beloit. In all, FCC receives more than 30,000 radio \nfrequency interference complaints annually--most of which are caused by \nCB radios. Unfortunately, FCC no longer has the staff, resources, or \nthe field capability to investigate these complaints and localities are \nblocked from exercising any jurisdiction to provide relief to their \nresidents.\n\n  My amendment attempts to resolve this Catch-22, by allowing States \nand localities to enforce existing FCC regulations regarding authorized \nCB equipment and frequencies while maintaining exclusive Federal \njurisdiction over the regulation of radio services. It is a commonsense \nsolution to a very frustrating and real problem which cannot be \naddressed under existing law. Residents should not be held hostage to a \nFederal law which purports to protect them but which cannot be \nenforced.\n  Now this amendment is by no means a panacea for the problem of radio \nfrequency interference. It is intended only to help localities solve \nthe most egregious and persistent problems of interference--those \ncaused by unauthorized use of CB radio equipment and frequencies. In \ncases where interference is caused by the legal and licensed operation \nof any radio service, residents will need to resolve the interference \nusing FCC self-help measures that I mentioned earlier.\n  In many cases, interference can result from inadequate home \nelectronic equipment immunity from radio frequency interference. Those \nproblems can only be resolved by installing filtering equipment and by \nimproving the manufacturing standards of home telecommunications \nequipment.\n  The electronic equipment manufacturing industry, represented by the \nTelecommunications Industry Association and the Electronics Industry \nAssociation, working with the Federal Communications Commission, has \nadopted voluntary standards to improve the immunity of telephones from \ninterference. Those standards were adopted by the American National \nStandards Institute last year. Manufacturers of electronic equipment \nshould be encouraged to adopt these new ANSI standards. Consumers have \na right to expect that the telephones they purchase will operate as \nexpected without excessive levels of interference from legal radio \ntransmissions. Of course, Mr. President, these standards assume legal \noperation of radio equipment and cannot protect residents from \ninterference from illegal operation of CB equipment.\n  This amendment also does not address interference caused by other\n\n[[Page S4693]]\n\nradio services, such as commercial stations or amateur stations. Mr. \nPresident, last year, I introduced S. 2025, a bill with intent similar \nto that of the amendment I am offering today. The American Radio Relay \nLeague [ARRL], an organization representing amateur radio operators, \nfrequently referred to as ``ham'' operators, raised a number of \nconcerns about that legislation. ARRL was concerned that while the bill \nwas intended to cover only illegal use of CB equipment, FCC-licensed \namateur radio operators might inadvertently be targeted and prosecuted \nby local law enforcement. ARRL also expressed concern that local law \nenforcement might not have the technical abilities to distinguish \nbetween ham stations and CB stations and might not be able to determine \nwhat CB equipment was FCC-authorized and what equipment is illegal.\n  I have worked with the ARRL and amateur operators from Wisconsin to \naddress these concerns. As a result of those discussions, this \namendment incorporates a number of provisions suggested by the league. \nFirst, the amendment makes clear that the limited enforcement authority \nprovided to localities in no way diminishes or affects FCC's exclusive \njurisdiction over the regulation of radio. Second, the amendment \nclarifies that possession of an FCC license to operate a radio service \nfor the operation at issue, such as an amateur station, is a complete \nprotection against any local law enforcement action authorized by this \namendment. Amateur radio enthusiasts are not only individually licensed \nby FCC, unlike CB operators, but they also self-regulate. The ARRL is \nvery involved in resolving interference concerns both among their own \nmembers and between ham operators and residents experiencing problems.\n  Third, the amendment also provides for an FCC appeal process by any \nradio operator who is adversely affected by a local law enforcement \naction under this amendment. FCC will make determinations as to whether \nthe locality acted properly within the limited jurisdiction this \nlegislation provides. The FCC will have the power to reverse the action \nof the locality if local law enforcement acted improperly. And fourth, \nmy legislation requires FCC to provide States and localities with \ntechnical guidance on how to determine whether a CB operator is acting \nwithin the law.\n  Again, Mr. President, my amendment is narrowly targeted to resolve \npersistent interference with home electronic equipment caused by \nillegal CB operation. Under my amendment, localities cannot establish \ntheir own regulations on CB use. They may only enforce existing FCC \nregulations on authorized CB equipment and frequencies. This amendment \nwill not resolve all interference problems and it is not intended to do \nso. Some interference problems need to continue to be addressed by the \nFCC, the telecommunications manufacturing industry, and radio service \noperators. This amendment merely provides localities with the tools \nthey need to protect their residents while preserving FCC's exclusive \nregulatory jurisdiction over the regulation of radio services.\n  I am very pleased that this amendment has been accepted, and I hope \nit will become law along with the anti-slamming bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we have, according to my understanding, an \namendment by Senator Feinstein, that Senator Dorgan has not had a \nchance to look at but I will ask that he review, which is acceptable. \nAnd I understand we have an amendment by Senator Rockefeller. I do not \nbelieve that there are any other amendments that we need to consider \nbecause we have dispensed with, according to the unanimous consent \nagreement, the Collins-Durbin amendment. We have dispensed with the \nReed amendment, the Levin amendments, Feingold amendment, and McCain \namendment, a Hollings amendment, a Harkin amendment, which leaves us \nwith the Rockefeller amendment after we dispense with the Feinstein \namendment.\n  So I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nRhode Island, Mr. Reed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Chair.\n  I rise in strong support of S. 1618, the Consumer Anti-Slamming Act \nof 1998, and I particularly commend Chairman McCain and ranking member \nHollings for the bipartisan and professional manner in which they have \nconsidered this legislation. I am pleased to have been part of this \nprocess, and I thank them very much for considering my suggestions to \nimprove this legislation.\n  Last July 24, again with the assistance of Senators McCain and \nHollings, I offered a sense-of-the-Senate resolution which outlined the \nissue involving slamming and proposed several suggested solutions. That \nresolution passed unanimously. Today, I support S. 1681 because it goes \nforward from that resolution to incorporate very pragmatic resolutions \nto the problem of slamming that is confronting so many consumers across \nthis country.\n  I would also like to thank the National Association of Attorneys \nGeneral as well as the National Association of Regulatory Utilities \nCommissioners for their assistance. These organizations and their \nmembers are fighting this epidemic of slamming at the State level. They \nare doing a remarkable job, and they were very helpful to me in \npreparing my legislation and helping me understand the scope of this \nproblem.\n  We have taken great strides in our economy by deregulating many of \nour formerly regulated utilities, particularly the telephone companies, \nbut all of that deregulation is for naught if we cannot give consumers \nreal valid choice. And the problem with slamming is it denies consumers \nreal choice. In effect, it tricks them into making choices that are not \nbeneficial to them or collectively to our society and our economy. We \nhave to do something about it.\n  I am very pleased that this legislation takes very pragmatic and \neffective steps to stop this curse of slamming, the illegal switching \nof telephone services. And this is an enormous problem throughout our \neconomy. It threatens to rob many, many consumers of the benefits of \nderegulation and of a free market for services like telephone service. \nThe Federal Communications Commission indicates that slamming is their \nNo. 1 reported fraud. In my home State of Rhode Island, it is the top \nconsumer issue in terms of telephone service and other consumer issues.\n\n  Yet all of these very impressive statistics may be just the tip of \nthe iceberg, because press reports indicate that many, many more people \nare victims of slamming, but they do not have either the knowledge or \nthe inclination under present rules and regulations to report these \ncases of slamming. Indeed, one regional telephone carrier estimated \nthat 1 in 20 changes of telephone service is a result of fraud. \nSlamming is a multimillion-dollar fraud problem, and today, under the \nleadership of Senator McCain and Senator Hollings, we are addressing \nthis problem head on.\n  One of the aspects of the issue is that there are numerous consumers \nwho are unaware of the fact that they are victims. Forty-one percent of \nthese individuals, of those who have been affected by slamming, do not \nreport the incidents to regulatory authorities or anyone. When a \ncomplaint is logged, it is usually logged with a local telephone \ncarrier; in my case, in upper Rhode Island, it is Bell Atlantic. Now, \nthese local carriers do try to resolve the problem, but often they do \nnot have the tools or the ability to do so, and as a result, the \nconsumer is left a victim of the slammer.\n  When consumers do report these problems and try to take action, under \nthe present regime it is usually a long and frustrating process to get \nany relief, if you get any relief at all.\n  Now, State attorneys general and public utility commissions \nthroughout this country are annually receiving hundreds of thousands of \ncomplaints. More than half the State attorneys general have tried to \ntake steps to go to court to bring to justice these slammers using the \nfraud laws of their State. Unfortunately, these legal actions are \ncumbersome, lengthy, and often do not really reach the heart of the \nmatter and bring the culprits to justice.\n  A smaller percentage of victims of slamming will seek relief not at \nthe State level but they will go to the Federal Communications \nCommission. Last year, 44,000 individuals brought slamming complaints \nto the FCC. That is a 175 percent increase over complaints in 1996. You \ncan see this is an\n\n[[Page S4694]]\n\nepidemic that needs to be dealt with decisively, and I am pleased that \nwe are doing that.\n  Now, the FCC does investigate these complaints, but they are hampered \nby a lack of proof concerning slamming. They are hampered by not having \nthe kind of record that is necessary to prove definitively that an \nindividual has been a victim of slamming. This legislation goes a long \nway to ensure that all of our regulatory authorities at every level of \nGovernment have the tools to ensure that they can root out slamming in \nour economy.\n  First, this legislation places a more stringent requirement on phone \ncompanies before they can switch a consumer's service. The bill \nrequires verification that the consumer, first, understands service \nwill be changed; second, the consumer affirms his or her intent to \nchange service and also indicates that he or she is authorized to \nswitch service.\n  We have heard lots of evidence of phone companies--slammers, really--\ncalling up, finding a 12- or 13-year-old child in the house, and \ntalking to that child and using that as what they claim is appropriate \nauthorization to switch service. Under this legislation, those types of \npractices will not be allowed. Also, the legislation requires that the \nentire verification process must be recorded and also provided to the \nconsumer upon request, so that if it is a 12-year-old in the house that \nis giving the OK to switch, the parent can quickly determine that from \nthe recorded record and make a correction.\n  Now, the other protection that is provided here is that the bill \nrequires that carriers inform a consumer in clear and unambiguous \nlanguage within 15 days that a switch has been authorized. Many times, \nconsumers do not realize their phone service has been switched until \nthey get, 30 days later, a bill from a company that they have never \nheard of claiming that they are now their primary telephone carrier.\n  Now, this whole verification process will go a very long way in \npreventing the abuses that we have seen. No longer can slammers use \nambiguous or fraudulent verification scripts, essentially tricking \nconsumers into agreeing. Additionally, slammers can't go ahead and \nconjure up and splice together different bits of pieces of an \nauthorization or conversation to say, ``That is the proof you agreed to \nswitch your service.'' Because of the requirement for a recorded \nrecord, that will not be possible.\n  This bill clearly says and makes as a clear standard that without \nproper verification, without a record, the carrier is in violation of \nlaw if they switch services and there cannot be any more assertions by \nthese carriers that, ``Well, someone told us it was OK in the house, \nbut we don't have the record. Someone authorized it, but we don't know \nwho it was.'' They are now in a position where they have to show \nclearly that they have the verification.\n  Also, this legislation provides for avenues of redress for consumers. \nFirst, the consumer can take the issue up with the unauthorized \ncarrier, and they are required to respond appropriately, within at \nleast 4 months, in terms of justifying the switch or making some type \nof amends to the consumer. Second, a slamming victim can take their \ncase to the Federal Communications Commission. Now, the FCC has \nadditional authority to fine and to penalize slamming. Finally, a \nconsumer who is frustrated can, once again, take his petition under \nState law to State commissions. Indeed, one aspect of the legislation \nthat is very positive is, there is no preemption of State laws. We \nrecognize that attorneys general and utility commissioners can and must \nhave the ability to work hand and hand with the Federal Government to \nroot out this problem of slamming.\n  Altogether, this is very important legislation that provides the \nnecessary consumer protections, that makes the goal and objective of \nderegulation in a market where consumers choose a reality, and puts up \nstrong barriers against those who would trick consumers and rob them of \nthe choice that deregulation offers, the choice of the best service for \nthem, their free choice.\n  Once again, let me commend Chairman McCain and ranking member \nHollings for their work on this. I am hopeful that we can move \nexpeditiously to passage and that this bill will shortly be law and we \ncan protect the American consumer against slamming.\n  I yield my time.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield myself 1 minute.\n  Senator Hollings and I incorporated an amendment in the managers' \namendment on behalf of Senator Snowe.\n  This amendment prevents the FCC from taking any actions that would \njeopardize the current ability of consumers to ``freeze'' their long-\ndistance carrier in place. Once the consumer elects to use a freeze, \nthe long-distance carrier of choice can only be changed by the express \nauthorization of the consumer to the local phone company.\n  Long-distance carriers are concerned about how this amendment might \naffect their marketing efforts. But reports now show that two consumers \nare slammed every minute. Given the severity of the slamming problem, \nthe interest we have in preserving safeguards that will project \nconsumers against any unauthorized carrier changes certainly overrides \nany concerns the industry may have about their marketing efforts.\n\n  I thank Senator Snowe for her amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2391\n\n      (Purpose: To modify the exception to the prohibition on the \ninterception of wire, oral or electronic communications to require that \n all parties to communications with health insurance providers consent \n                         to their interception)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Feinstein, I send an \namendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. MODIFICATION OF EXCEPTION TO PROHIBITION ON \n                   INTERCEPTION OF COMMUNICATIONS.\n\n       (a) Modification.--Section 2511(2)(d) of title 18, United \n     States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following: \n     ``Notwithstanding the previous sentence, it shall not be \n     unlawful under this chapter for a person not acting under the \n     color of law to intercept a wire, oral, or electronic \n     communication between a health insurance issuer or health \n     plan and a subscriber of such issuer or plan, or between a \n     health care provider and a patient, only if all of the \n     parties to the communication have given prior express consent \n     to such interception. For purposes of the preceding sentence, \n     the term `health insurance issuer' has the meaning given that \n     term in section 733 of the Employee Retirement Income \n     Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1191b), the term `health \n     plan' means a group health plan, as defined in such section \n     of such Act, an individual or self-insured health plan, the \n     medicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.), the medicaid program under title \n     XIX of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.), the State \n     children's health insurance program under title XXI of such \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 1397aa et seq.), and the Civilian Health and \n     Medical Program of the Uniformed Services under chapter 55 of \n     title 10, and the term `health care provider' means a \n     physician or other health care professional.''.\n       (b) Recording and Monitoring of Communications With Health \n     Insurers.--\n       (1) Communication without recording or monitoring.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a health \n     insurance issuer, health plan, or health care provider that \n     notifies any customer of its intent to record or monitor any \n     communication with such customer shall provide the customer \n     the option to conduct the communication without being \n     recorded or monitored by the health insurance issuer, health \n     plan, or health care provider.\n       (2) Definitions.--In this subsection:\n       (A) Health care provider.--The term ``health care \n     provider'' means a physician or other health care \n     professional.\n       (B) Health insurance issuer.--The term ``health insurance \n     issuer'' has the meaning given that term in section 733 of \n     the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 \n     U.S.C. 1191b).\n       (C) Health plan.--The term ``health plan'' means--\n       (i) a group health plan, as defined in section 733 of the \n     Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. \n     1191b);\n\n[[Page S4695]]\n\n       (ii) an individual or self-insured health plan;\n       (iii) the medicare program under title XVIII of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.);\n       (iv) the medicaid program under title XIX of such Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1396 et seq.);\n       (v) the State children's health insurance program under \n     title XXI of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1397aa et seq.); and\n       (vi) the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the \n     Uniformed Services under chapter 55 of title 10, United \n     States Code.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I offer a very simple amendment to S. \n1618 that will protect the critical area of consumer health care \nprivacy. This amendment provides that in communications with health \ncare insurers or providers, patients have the right not to have their \nconfidential conversations recorded or monitored.\n  This amendment fills a loophole in existing law. Federal law \ncurrently provides that at least one party must consent to the taping \nor monitoring of a private conversation. The federal law allows states \nto provide even more stringent restrictions, and require that all \nparties to a conversation must consent to their taping or monitoring.\n  However, this law provides no protection to patients against \nunauthorized taping or monitoring. Even when, as in my State of \nCalifornia, the state law requires all parties to consent for taping or \nmonitoring, the law fails to protect them. Patients are construed to \nconsent to taping or monitoring, whether they expressly consent or not, \nif they are informed of the taping or monitoring. This is most often \naccomplished by a recording at the beginning of the telephone call. If \npatients refuse to have their calls monitored, they are told to simply \ntake their business elsewhere. But there is nowhere else to go.\n  The confidentiality of details about our health is one of the most \nsensitive topics imaginable. Physician-patient confidentiality is a \nbedrock principle that goes back literally thousands of years.\n  Not only is this an ethical issue, it is a health imperative. In \nfact, it can be a matter of life and death. Anything less than full \nconfidentiality compromises the willingness of patients to provide the \nfull information that treating physicians need to treat them properly. \nIt can literally jeopardize their health and their life.\n  We naturally assume that intimate details that we share with our \ndoctor and health care professionals are strictly confidential. But \nthey are not. Today, any communication we have with a health care \nprofessional may be taped and monitored.\n  This problem is exacerbated by the rising role of health insurance \ncompanies in treatment. Oftentimes, it is a health insurance company, \nrather than a trusted doctor, with whom the patient must share intimate \npersonal health details. That health insurance company may not have the \nsame ethical and legal confidentiality obligations as the patient's \ntreating physician.\n  When my office contacted the top 100 health insurance providers in \nthis country, we learned that most health insurance companies who \nresponded tape or monitor calls from patients.\n  I want to share briefly some of the responses we received. Kaiser \nPermanente is a health insurance provider that operates in 19 states \nand the District of Columbia, and provides care to more than 9 million \nmembers. Its practices vary from state to state, depending on \napplicable state laws.\n  Among other things, Kaiser Permanente may: Monitor randomly selected \ncalls, in which case it may or may not notify patients in advance; or \ntape record all or randomly selected calls, in which case it may or may \nnot notify patients in advance.\n  United HealthCare wrote that they did not believe that recording or \nmonitoring calls presented a privacy issue. Their rationale was that \nthey only randomly record calls and only after advising the caller that \nthe call may be recorded.\n  Great-West responded that a patient has the option of communicating \nin writing if the patient does not want to be recorded. Well, let me \nsay simply--that's not good enough for me.\n  Despite the two-party consent rule in my own State of California, NYL \nCare Health Plans, Inc., responded that no violation of California law \noccurs in the absence of a ``confidential communication.'' Under \nCalifornia law, the definition of a ``confidential communication'' does \nnot include communications where the parties may reasonably expect that \nthe call may be recorded. NYL Care asserted that, since patients were \ntold that their call could be monitored, their calls were not \nconfidential calls.\n  In my view, NYL Care's interpretation of ``confidentiality'' turns \nits commonly understood meaning on its head. In fact, I doubt whether \nany of my colleagues would agree that communications about one's own \nhealth problems are not confidential.\n  Finger Lakes Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Upstate New York randomly \ntapes records calls from patients and is in the process of implementing \na front-end message to patients.\n  In the case of Blue Cross Blue Shield of the National Capital Area, a \npatient receives no notice that the call may be monitored. Their \nAssociate General Counsel stated that in both Maryland and the District \nof Columbia, no consent was required.\n  Not only is unauthorized taping or monitoring of telephone calls just \nplain wrong, it is simply unnecessary. None of the health insurers who \nresponded to my office could provide a valid reason for monitoring or \ntaping incoming calls from patients.\n  The standard response I received from health insurers was that they \nmonitored or tape recorded calls for ``quality control.'' Yet no one \ncould explain how the health insurer's record of the information \ndiscussed protects the patient. It's easy to see, I think, how the \nindustry's practice leaves the patient disadvantaged.\n  My amendment is simple. First, it requires express consent from \npatients in order to be taped or monitored by health insurance \ncompanies or health care providers.\n  Second, it requires health insurance companies or health care \nproviders to give patients the option not to be taped or monitored.\n  Third, it applies only to health insurance companies or health care \nproviders. It does not affect the remaining companies that tape or \nmonitor customer communications.\n  Mr. President, this amendment simply ensures a basic right that most \npatients believe they already enjoy. I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding is the amendment has been \ncleared on both sides. I urge the amendment be agreed to.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2391) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Illinois, Senator \nDurbin.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from North Dakota. I thank my \ncolleague, the Senator from Arizona, for cosponsoring this bill with \nSenator Hollings.\n  A little over a year ago, I received a letter in my Senatorial office \nin Illinois from a young woman who owned a business right outside the \nCity of Chicago. She told a story of having her long-distance carrier \nchanged without her permission, how it ended up costing her over \n$1,000, and she came to learn there was virtually nothing she could do \nabout it. The recourse under the law currently available was not \npractical--that she would somehow hire an attorney and go to Federal \ncourt over $1,000. That wasn't going to happen. She asked me what could \nwe do about it, so I prepared a piece of legislation, and a large part \nof it has been incorporated in this good bill, and I am happy to \nsupport this bill.\n  Since then, I have come to learn that hers was not an isolated \nexample. Any group of people you talk to, regardless of their walk of \nlife, who have a telephone at home, will generally tell you that they \nknow somebody or they personally have been victims of slamming. How do \nthey end up having their long-distance carrier changed? Some of them \nmight have been unsuspecting. They went to a carnival or county fair or \nneighborhood picnic, and they had a little thing handed to them. It \nsaid, ``Win a free trip to Hawaii. Fill in your name and address and \ncheck the box in\n\n[[Page S4696]]\n\nthe bottom.'' They didn't flip it over to see the other side that said, \n``You just changed your long-distance carrier.''\n\n  It would happen time and time again. Folks would get these \ninterminable telephone calls at night saying, ``Would you consider \nmoving to this new service?'' They say, ``No, no, there is no way.'' It \nturns out they were being taped. People were splicing together the \ntapes. When it was all said and done, they took the spliced tapes, and \nsaid the person said ``yes'' when they asked about the long-distance \nservice, but the person said ``yes'' when they asked about the name.\n  It turns out a lot of people were being defrauded, and it cost a lot \nof money, not just for the lady who came to see me and her business, \nbut many others. This is theft. This is stealing. This is not gaming we \nare dealing with here; it is a situation where a lot of people are \nmaking money without the permission of those whose long-distance \nservice is being changed.\n  I went up to the State of Maine with my colleague, Senator Collins, \nwho spoke earlier on the floor, for a hearing on the subject and found \nit was literally a national problem. From the coast of Maine to \nCalifornia and everything in between, people were going through this \nand we didn't have the laws in place to protect the consumers. That is \nwhy this bill is so important--because this bill finally gives to the \nconsumer an opportunity to say to the person who is slamming them, \n``You are not going to get away with it.''\n  One of the amendments which Senator McCain was nice enough to adopt \nand make part of the bill was offered by Senator Collins and myself. It \nsaid you will never be charged more than what your original long \ndistance carrier would have charged you. So if somebody comes along and \ndoubles your rate without your permission, you still don't have to pay \nanything more than what was in the original rate structure with your \noriginal long-distance carrier. I think that makes sense. I think it is \nonly fair.\n  The other amendment which we pushed for, the second amendment, \ncreates criminal penalties which are necessary for the most egregious \nslammers. These are not little companies with little ideas; these are \ndevious groups with a network of information which are trying to set up \na network of people across the United States who will be changed to \ntheir long-distance service just long enough for them to make some \nmoney.\n  You should have seen the hearing that Senator Collins had before the \nGovernment Affairs Committee, where she presented a bill from one of \nthese companies to the Chairman of the Federal Communications \nCommission. She posted it up on the board, and she said to the \nChairman: ``Take a look at this long-distance bill from a slamming \ncompany and tell me one thing. What is the name of the company?''\n  The Chairman took a look at it, and he said, ``I don't see any name \nof the company up there.'' You know what? The name of the company was \nLong Distance Charges. So, when you are going through your telephone \nbill and you are looking at your local carrier who sent it to you, and \nyou get to a page which reads ``Long Distance Charges,'' it never dawns \non you that you are no longer receiving long-distance service from your \nold carrier. You have a new carrier called Long Distance Charges, and \nyou didn't notice that your long-distance bill just went up. That is \nthe kind of chicanery and trickery these people are guilty of. They \nmake millions of dollars at it. As a consequence, we have to treat them \nwith the criminal penalty which is included in this bill.\n  I want to make an additional point about the criminal penalties \namendment. Creating a criminal statute for slamming in no way lessens \nthe applicability of existing laws such as wire fraud or mail fraud \nthat can help combat slamming, too. Rather, this criminal statute for \nslamming will make it easier for prosecutors, because it applies \nspecifically to this crime.\n  Finally, a third amendment agreed to by Senator McCain will require \ntelecommunications carriers to report the number of slamming complaints \nthey receive about each company to the FCC. We know the incidence of \nslamming is on the rise. We have no way of tracking them. This will \nestablish it. Slamming has already caused telephone customers to become \nangry and disillusioned with the entire telecommunications industry. \nThese consumers have voiced their concerns to their local phone \ncompanies, to their State regulatory bodies, to the FCC. But they feel \ntheir complaints have not been heard.\n  With this legislation, we can begin to restore confidence in the \nindustry and assure consumers that the deceptive practice of slamming \nwill be stopped. Long-distance telephone consumers should be able to \nstand up for themselves and fight back against slammers, to let them \nknow their actions will not pay.\n  You have heard, during the course of this debate, lengthy statistics \nabout the nature of the problem. I will not repeat them, only to tell \nyou that it is a serious problem addressed in a serious way by this \nlegislation.\n  In closing, one small footnote: The outrage of slamming has now been \nreplaced in complaints to my office by the outrage of cramming. It \nturns out in the lengthy telephone bill you received there may be an \nitem which looks innocent enough for two or three dollars for something \nyou never ordered. Who is going to go through the telephone bill and \nanalyze every line? But unless you do, you may find yourself in a \npredicament where they are cramming in charges you never asked for.\n  You are paying three bucks a month every month of the year for \nsomething you didn't ask for. How are you going to find it? You have to \ntake the time to read through it. We want to make sure we address that \nabuse as well.\n  Today, though, we are addressing in a responsible way a very serious \nproblem that affects consumers across America. I salute Senator McCain, \nas well as Senator Hollings, who have joined me in this effort through \ninvestigations, as well as in preparation of amendments to this very \ngood bill. I am happy to support it. I yield back the remainder of my \ntime.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I want to express my support for \nthe Consumer Anti-Slamming Act, S. 1618, which addresses the \nunauthorized switching of telephone service carriers by competing \nservice providers. This abusive practice has become an increasing \nproblem in my home state of Colorado where slamming has grown at an \nalarming rate. Last October, Chairman Burns of the Communications \nSubcommittee of the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee \nheld a field hearing in Denver on this issue. In addition to this \nhearing, anti-slamming legislation has recently passed the Colorado \nState Legislature. With Colorado as one of the nation's top five states \nin complaints-per-million customers, I intend to vote for this anti-\nslamming legislation.\n  I also am pleased that S. 1618 incorporates provisions from my Anti-\nSlamming Bill, S. 1051 which I introduced on July 22, 1997. This \nlanguage requires that the FCC annually report to Congress the ``Top \nTen'' slammers for each year, as well as carriers assessed fines or \npenalties during the same period. The ``Top Ten'' list identifies those \ncarriers subject to the highest number of subscriber slamming \ncomplaints compared to the total number of subscribers they serve. This \nratio approach ensures that large companies are not automatically \nsingled out by virtue of having a large customer base. The focus of my \n``Top Ten'' amendment is on those companies with the highest percentage \nof slamming complaints relative to their total customer base.\n  This ``Top Ten'' list will give Congress an annual opportunity to \nreview and publicly comment on this serious problem known as \n``slamming''. I am convinced that this approach coupled with the \nlanguage in S. 1618, will prove valuable in deterring carriers from \nengaging in illegal tactics.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \nlegislation now before the Senate--S. 1618, the Consumer Anti-Slamming \nAct--and to urge for its adoption and enactment.\n  This legislation--which was crafted by the distinguished Chairman of \nthe Commerce Committee, John McCain, and the Ranking Member of the \nCommittee, Ernest Hollings--will help eliminate a reprehensible \npractice of unscrupulous telephone companies, and I congratulate them \nfor their leadership on this issue. As a member of the Senate Commerce \nCommittee, I am pleased that my friend and colleague,\n\n[[Page S4697]]\n\nChairman McCain, has moved rapidly to address the slamming epidemic \nthat is occurring in Maine by bringing this legislation to the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  In addition, I would also like to thank my colleague from Maine, \nSenator Collins, for highlighting this issue by holding oversight \nhearings in her capacity as Chair of the Governmental Affairs \nSubcommittee on Permanent Investigations, including a recent hearing in \nthe State of Maine--and she has also offered legislation that is \ndesigned to combat slamming. In case there is any doubt about the \nimportance of this issue in Maine, the involvement of both Senators \nshould put that to rest!\n  Mr. President, as many of my colleagues are aware, ``slamming'' is a \nterm that has been used to describe any practice that changes a \nconsumer's long-distance carrier without the consumer's knowledge or \nconsent. A variety of tactics and techniques can be used to accomplish \nthis goal, including vague or inaccurate phone solicitations; \nunsolicited ``welcome packages'' that look like an advertisement but \nautomatically lead to a consumer changing phone companies unless the \nindividual returns a rejection card; and ``drawings'' for giveaways \nthat also serve as a means of unwittingly changing services.\n  Regardless of the tactic used to slam a customer, the bottom line is \nthat it's an unfair and illegal practice--and it's one that must be \nbrought to a halt.\n  Mr. President, phone customers expect high-quality phone service for \na fair price. If a phone company is going to ``reach out and touch \nsomeone,'' it must be done legally and with fairness to the customer. \nConsumers who are slammed often receive lower-quality service or higher \nrates, and sometimes they are not even aware that they have been \nslammed until they get their bills. This is an outrageous practice and \nI think we can all agree that its demise is long overdue.\n  Last year, in my home state of Maine, the number of slamming \ncomplaints doubled to a total of 1,000 between 1996 and 1997. \nNationwide, more than 20,000 consumers filed slamming complaints with \nthe FCC, the largest category of complaints the agency received. In \n1996, it received more than 16,000 total slamming complaints. As a \nresult of these complaints, the FCC has taken enforcement action \nagainst 15 companies for slamming violations over the past two years, \nwhile assessing more than $1 million in forfeitures and consent decrees \nwith another $500,000 in additional penalties pending.\n  Mr. President, as these numbers clearly indicate, this is a serious \nproblem that is only going to get worse. In particular, the threat \nexists that--as competition develops in other communications markets--\nslamming could extend into new services and become an even more onerous \nconsumer problem if it is left unchecked.\n  As has been indicated, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) \nalready has the authority to combat this practice by assessing fines \nagainst telephone carriers that slam. But with a 25 percent increase in \nthe number of slamming complaints that were filed in just the past \nyear--and even with the level of fines and penalties that have already \nbeen imposed on companies--it is obvious that the FCC's current \napproach is not working. And it is for this reason that the legislation \nbefore this body is so critical.\n  Mr. President, S. 1618 will put this reprehensible practice to an end \nby providing definitive procedures for telephone companies to follow in \nchanging a customers's telephone service; giving federal and non-\nfederal authorities the power to impose tough sanctions on companies \nthat are guilty of slamming; and providing measures to ensure that \nslamming victims are fully-compensated.\n  Specifically, to ensure that changes in phone service are made in a \nverifiable manner, the bill requires phone companies to obtain written, \nverbal, or electronic verification from a consumer who is changing \nproviders.\n  To ensure that customer complaints are dealt with in a timely manner, \ncarriers accused of slamming will be required to defend their actions \nin no more than 120 days, and the FCC will have no more than 150 days \nto resolve any outstanding disputes.\n  If slamming has occurred, the bill gives the FCC the authority to \nprovide compensatory or punitive damages to consumers that companies \nwould be required to pay within 90 days. In addition, provide a strong \ndisincentive to potential slammers, the FCC would be required to impose \nfines on phone companies that are guilty of slamming of at least \n$40,000 for a first-time offense and $150,000 for repeat offenses. And \nIf a company refuses to pay these fines, the bill provides that the FCC \nwill also have the authority to prosecute slammers.\n  Finally, if a consumer wishes to pursue redress through means other \nthan the FCC, this bill allows consumers to pursue their grievances in \ncourt through state class-action lawsuits instead of through the FCC. \nAnd in the event a specific state does not believe these penalties are \nstrong enough, the bill specifically retains the rights of each state \nto impose stiffer sanctions.\n  This bill and the provisions it contains are based on common sense \nand good policy, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.\n  Mr. President, while this bill is a very sound approach to addressing \nthe slamming epidemic, there is one additional technique that consumers \nalready have at their disposal to prevent slamming from occurring, and \nI believe we should seek to fully-protect this consumer option in this \nbill.\n  Specifically, if customers are concerned that they will be \nunwittingly tricked--or unknowingly forced--into changing their phone \ncompany, they can now ``freeze'' into place the long distance carrier \nof their choice at the local phone company. As a result, no order to \nchange phone companies can be completed without the express, direct \nauthorization of the customer to the local phone company.\n  To ensure that this option is in no way impeded in the future, I have \nprepared an amendment that would ensure that no subsequent action by \nthe FCC can be undertaken to restrict or impede the customer's ability \nto ``freeze'' in place the carrier of their choice. I understand that \nthis amendment is acceptable to the manager's of the bill, and has now \nbeen included in the manager's amendment. Therefore, I would like to \nthank the Chairman and Ranking member for addressing this issue and \naccepting my provision.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is, slamming is a serious crime, and \nthis is a serious solution. Companies engaged in slamming will no \nlonger be able to hide behind the anonymity of the phone lines. Phone \ncompanies and their customers should reach agreements on phone \nservices, but slamming destroys that relationship. Therefore, this bill \nwill restore an element of trust that has been lost through this \nabhorrent practice.\n  Mr. President, slamming is nothing less than high-tech extortion, and \nthe law must be changed to deal with this new criminal threat, and I \nhope my colleagues will join me in supporting this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, every year thousands of Americans are \nvictimized by fraudulent telemarketing promotions. And, unfortunately, \nthese scam artists prey most often on our senior citizens. The losses \nevery year are estimated to be in the billions of dollars. My amendment \nwill help law enforcement to more effectively combat these abuses.\n  Today, its all too easy for telemarketing rip-off artists to profit \nfrom the current system. How do these rip-offs occur? Advertisements \nregarding sweepstakes, contests, loans, credit reports and other \npromotions appear in newspapers, magazines, and other direct mail and \ntelephone solicitations. The operators of many of these phoney \npromotions set up a telephone boiler room for a few months in which a \nnumber of phones are operated to receive calls responding to their ads. \nThey steal thousands--even millions--of dollars from innocent victims \nand then they simply disappear. They take the money and run--moving on \nto another location to start all over again.\n  Here's just one example. Not too long ago, 30,000 Iowans received \npostcards from an organization calling itself Sweepstakes \nInternational, Inc. The postcard enticed recipients to call a 900-\nnumber and they were charged $9.95 on their phone bill.\n  Based on a Postal Service investigation, civil action was initiated \nin U.S. District Court in Iowa. As a result, the promotion was halted \nand $1.7 million was frozen. This represented just one\n\n[[Page S4698]]\n\nand a half month's revenue from the scam!\n  My amendment will protect telemarketing victims by providing law \nenforcement the authority to more quickly obtain the name, address, and \nphysical location of businesses suspected of telemarketing fraud. Phone \ncompanies would have to provide law enforcement officials only the \nname, address and physical location of a telemarketing business holding \na phone number if the officials submitted a formal written request for \nthis information relevant to a legitimate law enforcement \ninvestigation. It will make it easier for officers to identify and \nlocate these operations. This is similar to the procedure that is \nalready in place for post office box investigations.\n  Mr. President, it is necessary to crack down on serious consumer \nfraud. With this change, we will have many more successful efforts to \nshut down these rip-offs artists like several recent cases in my home \nstate of Iowa.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I rise to speak in support of the \nanti-slamming bill, S. 1618. I want to commend Senator McCain, Senator \nHollings, and the rest of the Commerce Committee for bringing this bill \nto the floor, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of the bill.\n  Slamming is an important and widespread consumer problem, and it is \nhigh time that the Congress takes action to stop it. Slamming, as most \npeople now know, is a practice carried out by some telecommunications \ncompanies to switch a consumer's long distance or local exchange \ncarrier without the consumer's knowledge or consent. Only a few years \nago this practice, while persistent and frustrating for some consumers, \nappeared limited in scope. However, in more recent years this type of \nconsumer fraud appears to have grown into a common profit-making scheme \nof some telecommunications companies carried out at the consumer's \nexpense.\n  The rise in slamming complaints has been absolutely astonishing. The \nFederal Communications Commission reports that the 11,000 slamming \ncomplaints they received in 1995 represented a sixfold increase in the \nnumber of complaints received in 1993. By 1996, slamming complaints \nrose by an additional 42 percent over 1995, with the FCC receiving more \nthan 16,000 complaints. And in 1997, the FCC received 44,000 complaints \nfrom consumers, nearly triple the 1996 total.\n  But these numbers only begin to tell the story. In Wisconsin, \nslamming is the number one telecommunications complaint, and \ntelecommunications is the single largest category of consumer \ncomplaints that the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and \nConsumer Protection received last year. That agency reports that \nslamming complaints were up 400 percent in 1997. The National \nAssociation of State Utility Consumer Advocates estimates that as many \nas one million consumers each year have their long distance carrier or \nlocal provider switched without consent.\n  In September of 1997, the National Consumers League polled \ntelecommunications consumers in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Chicago, \nIllinois, and Detroit/Grand Rapids, Michigan. The poll showed that of \nthe 1500 individuals surveyed, three out of 10 reported that they, or \nsomeone they know, had been slammed. In Milwaukee, of those who said \nthey had experience with slamming, 41% said their own telephone carrier \nhad been changed without their consent. Even more disturbing, the \nsurvey provided evidence that slammers appear to be targeting consumers \nwho have high long distance bills, raising privacy concerns regarding \nbilling information.\n  Mr. President, this is consumer fraud of monstrous proportions. It \ncauses extra cost and inconvenience to consumers, and it also distorts \ntelecommunications markets and discourages legitimate competitive \npractices. The prevalence of slamming and the lack of any strong \ndisincentives against it rewards companies that use this fraudulent \npractice and penalizes those that seek new customers through legitimate \nand honest means.\n  The 1996 Telecommunications Act recognized the slamming problem and \nbroadened the scope of FCC's regulatory authority over slamming to \ncover all telecommunications carriers rather than just long distance \nservice providers. The Act also provided that a carrier that violates \nthe FCC's verification requirements is liable to the customer's \noriginal carrier for all charges paid by the customer after he or she \nhad been slammed.\n  The FCC now has rules prohibiting slamming and requires companies to \nverify the customer's authorization of any switch in carriers, but \nthese rules obviously haven't done the trick. For one thing, the \npenalties for slamming just aren't tough enough. While the FCC has \ntaken enforcement action against a number of telecommunications \ncompanies, the tremendous profit opportunities from slamming overwhelm \nthe threat of FCC enforcement.\n  The Consumer Anti-Slamming Act should be an effective antidote to \nthis problem. It establishes minimum verification requirements for \nsubmitting changes in local or long distance telephone service. The \nrequirements apply when service is first requested as well. The bill \nalso bans so-called ``negative option'' marketing--this is where a \ncompany sends you a letter that says your service will be switched \nunless you send back a reply card to say no. With all the junk mail \nthat people now receive, this is a particularly reprehensible business \npractice, and I am pleased that this bill outlaws it.\n  The bill also addresses the problem that many people do not even know \nthat when they have been slammed by requiring the new \ntelecommunications company to notify a consumer within 15 days of a \nchange in service. The notification must indicate the name of the \nperson who requested the change and inform the consumer that he or she \nmay request further information about when and how the change was \nauthorized. It must also contain information about how to pursue a \ncomplaint if the customer believes he or she has been slammed.\n  Penalties are also significantly increased in this bill. The FCC may \naward damages of $500 or the actual damages incurred, whichever is \ngreater, directly to the consumer. And the FCC can fine carriers who \nviolate the anti-slamming regulations $40,000 for a first offence and \n$150,000 for additional offences. These significant penalties should \neliminate the economic incentives to engage in these illegal practices.\n  Mr. President, the information age has now arrived. Technological \nadvances hold out great promise for making our daily lives easier and \nmore enjoyable. Competition is the driving force in bringing those \nadvances to the consumer at ever more affordable prices. Allowing \nconsumers to choose between competing long distance and local service \nproviders should improve service and lower prices. But when \nirresponsible or even criminal elements seek to take advantage of \nunsuspecting consumers through activities like slamming, forceful \nregulation is necessary.\n  The unethical and illegal practices of companies who seek to \nvictimize consumers to enhance their own profits must not be tolerated. \nProtecting consumers from those who engage in these practices is one of \nmy most important responsibilities as a United States Senator. I \nbelieve that this bill gives the FCC the tools it needs to crack down \non the slamming problem once and for all. I am proud to vote for it.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, S. 1618 is a well-crafted bill that is \ndesigned to prevent the unauthorized transferring of a customer's phone \ncarrier. This is accomplished through a variety of provisions, \nincluding the threat of strong penalties on telephone companies that \nengage in slamming.\n  While I strongly believe that the penalties established in this \nlegislation should be fully-enforced, I would like to clarify the type \nof conduct that these penalties are being targeted to address. \nSpecifically, is it the Chairman's intent that the significant \nfinancial penalties contained in Section 1(f) be imposed for all cases \nof unauthorized carrier changes, including changes that are accidental \nor innocent mistakes, such as when an order to change service providers \nin improperly keyed-in by a customer service agent? Or are these \npenalties designed to address cases of slamming that involve willful or \nintentional misconduct on the part of companies?\n  Mr. McCain. I appreciate the questions of the Senator from Maine, and\n\n[[Page S4699]]\n\nbelieve it is important that the intent of this legislation be fully \nunderstood. This bill is designed to ensure that companies are deterred \nfrom the reprehensible practice of slamming, and that harsh penalties \nare imposed as a form of punishment if the practice is undertaken by an \nunscrupulous company. However, the penalties in this bill are not \nintended to be used for cases of innocent or accidental changes of \ncarriers, such as the situation described by my colleague, Senator \nSnowe--and the language of this bill has been crafted accordingly. \nSpecifically, the bill provides that the Commission can waive the \nminimum penalties if they determine that there are mitigating \ncircumstances, which would include cases of innocent or accidental \nchanges of carriers.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Chairman for clarifying this important issue \nand for crafting language that reflects this intent. I am very \nappreciative for your leadership and efforts to curb the practice of \nslamming, and commend the Senator for crafting legislation that will \nforcefully attack this growing problem.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise to support the Consumer Anti-\nSlamming Act, as it addresses a severe problem that has arisen as an \nunintended consequence of additional competition in the \ntelecommunications marketplace: the unauthorized switching of \ncustomers' telephone service providers. I also understand that the \nmanagers' amendment of the bill includes language that addresses \nanother serious, unintended problem posed by the growth of information \ntechnology: the explosion of junk e-mail, or ``spamming.''\n  I congratulate Senators Murkowski and Torricelli for their hard work \non dealing with the issue of spamming. S. 1618 as amended includes \nlanguage that would require commercial e-mailers to identify \nthemselves. This language is simply a ``Truth in Advertising \nAmendment.'' As any of us who use e-mail are finding out, millions of \njunk e-mails are sent out with fake e-mail addresses which prevent \ncitizens from requesting that they not be sent any further clutter from \nthe same sources. The amendment also requires that a junk e-mailer must \nhonor requests from individuals to be deleted from mailing lists.\n  I should add that the problem of junk e-mail is particularly \nimportant to customers in rural areas such as Montana. Often, rural \nresidents must pay long distance charges to receive these unwanted \nsolicitations, many of which contain fraudulent messages. ``Spamming'' \nis truly the bane of the information age. This problem has become so \npervasive that entire new networks have had to be constructed to deal \nwith it, when resources would be far better spent on educational or \ncommercial needs. I welcome the inclusion of this language as a much-\nneeded step forward in dealing with this increasingly serious problem.\n  I would now like to speak on an issue involving more traditional \ncommunications, that of slamming. I have held two field hearings in the \nCommunications Subcommittee on this important topic, one in Billings \nlast August and one in Denver last October.\n  During the field hearing in Billings, I heard from consumers, \nindustry representatives and regulators on a variety of slamming \nissues. I learned in Billings that slamming is not confined to big \ncities. It is reaching every part of our country. Consumers are falling \nprey every day to companies that intentionally mislead and deceive. \nToday, I look forward to building on the record we started in Montana.\n  I should also recognize that Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell has \nshown real leadership on this issue through his introduction of an \nanti-slamming bill, particularly at the field hearing in Denver, which \nhe attended. The bill before the Chamber today, S. 1618, incorporates \nlanguage from S. 1051, Senator Campbell's slamming bill. The amendment \nincluding Senator Campbell's language was passed unanimously out of the \nCommerce Committee on March 12 of this year.\n  This language requires that the FCC will annually report to Congress \nthe ``Top Ten'' slammers for that year, as well as carriers assessed \nfines or penalties during the same period. The ``Top Ten'' list would \nidentify those carriers subject to the highest number of subscriber \nslamming complaints compared to the total number of subscribers they \nserve. This ratio approach ensures that large companies are not \nautomatically singled out by virtue of having a large customer base. \nThe focus is on those companies with the highest percentage of slamming \ncomplaints relative to their total customer base.\n  This ``Top Ten'' list represents the core of Senator Campbell's anti-\nslamming bill. Having held two field hearings in the Communications \nSubcommittee on this important topic, I am convinced that Senator \nCampbell's approach will prove very valuable in deterring carriers from \nengaging in illegal tactics.\n  As competition develops in new communications markets, we could see \nslamming migrate to new areas and become an even bigger problem. \nClearly, something must be done soon to protect consumers and to \nprotect good, clean competition.\n  I am confident that the Consumer Anti-Slamming Act as amended will \naccomplish this goal and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the mangers' amendment included two \namendments to S. 1618 which I authored and which I appreciate the \nmanagers of the bill accepting. I am joined in offering these \namendments by cosponsors Senator Glenn and Senator Durbin.\n  These amendments are the product of hearings held on slamming in the \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), chaired by Senator \nCollins. Slamming, the practice of changing a consumer's long distance \ncarrier without the consumer's knowledge and express consent, is the \nnumber one complaint received by the Federal Communications Commission \n(FCC). And those FCC slamming complaints are on the rise--increasing \nalmost 50% from 1995 through 1997. Slamming is also the number one \ncomplaint received by the Michigan Public Service Commission. And, \nMichigan has the unfortunate distinction of being in the top ten \nstates, nationwide, for the number of consumers who have been slammed. \nA Louis Harris survey taken in September 1997 ranked Detroit and Grand \nRapids among the hardest hit cities in the country. About 25% of \ntelephone customers in Detroit and Grand Rapids have either had their \ntelephone carrier switched without their permission or know someone who \nwas illegally switched.\n  Slamming leaves consumers feeling vulnerable and angry. Consumers \nhave the right to use any long distance carrier they choose and to \nchange carriers whenever they wish. But they want to be in control. \nSlamming takes choices away from consumers without their knowledge, and \nrewards companies that engage in deceptive and misleading marketing \npractices.\n  Slammers use deceptive marketing practices such as getting \nsubscribers to sign a misleading authorization form, falsifying tape \nrecordings to make it appear that the consumer has verbally agreed to \nthe change, or posing as the subscriber's currently authorized carrier. \nUnscrupulous carriers have been known to forge letters of authorization \nor even pull subscribers' numbers from a telephone book and submit them \nto the local exchange carrier for a long distance carrier change. \nUnscrupulous resellers generally bill higher rates once the subscriber \nis switched.\n  In one case in Michigan, the slammer used the device of a contest--\nthe opportunity to win a trip or a car--to get consumers to sign a card \nthat would then be used to change the long distance service. The \nMichigan consumer who filed a complaint with the Michigan Attorney \nGeneral reported that her 14 year old daughter was approached several \ntimes in a shopping mall to sign the card under the auspices of \nparticipating in the contest. The daughter kept trying to resist--\ntelling the slammer that she was underage for the contest. The slammer \nfinally prevailed, and the 14 year old daughter entered what she \nthought to be a contest or drawing. However, a week or so later, this \nconstituent was notified that her long distance carrier had been \nchanged--unbeknownst to her. She wrote in her letter to the Attorney \nGeneral: ``I am very upset that this is happening not only to me but to \nothers as well. It's a scam and it needs to stop now!''\n  Although the large telecommunications companies, called facilities\n\n[[Page S4700]]\n\nbased carriers because they own extensive telephone lines and \nequipment, have engaged in slamming, according to a recent GAO report, \nmost intentional slamming is perpetrated by switchless resellers. \nSwitchless resellers have no equipment; they purchase network \nfacilities from large long distance companies at a bulk rate and resell \nthe service either to consumers or to other resellers. Currently a \nswitchless reseller can enter into the telecommunications business \nwithout any proof of financial capability. All a person has to do is \nstrike a deal with a long distance carrier to use that carrier's lines \nand facilities, get a billing company to provide billing services and \ndevelop a customer base. The switchless reseller is then in business \nand can use unscrupulous practices to switch the long distance \nproviders of innocent consumers from the carrier the consumer has been \nusing to the switchless reseller. The reseller then charges higher long \ndistance rates.\n  Many switchless resellers operate legitimately; but there are a \nsurprising number who don't. Currently there is nothing in the law that \nscreens out the scam artists from the legitimate resellers. S. 1618 \nincreases civil penalties, creates new criminal penalties and includes \ndisincentives to eliminate the profit for slammers. I am supportive of \nthose provisions and ask unanimous consent that I be added as a \ncosponsor.\n  But, Mr. President, we also need to try to keep the scam artists out \nof the system--to keep consumers from being slammed in the first place. \nMy amendment would require switchless resellers--those resellers who \nhave no switching facilities under their ownership or control--to post \na bond with the FCC before they can engage in the business of selling \nlong distance service. The bond would be in an amount set by the FCC, \nand the amendment would prohibit a billing agent of a switchless \nreseller from billing subscribers of long distances services on behalf \nof the switchless reseller unless the billing agent has confirmed that \nthe reseller has furnished the bond. In this way, a switchless reseller \ncannot get someone to bill on its behalf unless it has posted a bond \nwith the FCC. The proceeds of that bond can be used to pay for any \ndamages to a consumer awarded by the Commission to reimburse the \nconsumer for excess charges incurred as a result of slamming. The \nrequirement for a bond should keep the unscrupulous resellers out of \nthe business. Take for example, David Fletcher, possibly the most \nnotorious slammer. He started his slamming business, apparently, with \nno resources and managed to bill up to $20 million in long distance \nservices. He couldn't start his business and no billing agent or phone \ncompany could have contracted with him to do his billing unless he had \nposted a bond with the FCC, under my amendment.\n  The other amendment which the Managers have incorporated in their \nsubstitute requires full disclosure of the long distance services and \nproviders on the local phone bill. We learned, Mr. President, in the \nhearing on slamming that some switchless resellers go to great lengths \nto disguise the fact that they have taken over a consumer's long \ndistance service. One reseller, for example, incorporated under the \nname ``Phone Calls.'' Another used the name, ``Long Distance \nServices.'' Those names, then, appeared on the consumers' phone bills, \nand no one would have paid attention to those names. Anyone looking at \nsuch a phone bill would have assumed those were not the names of the \nunexpectedly new long distance carriers, but the identification of the \nitem being listed below --the phone calls. The consumer would continue \nto assume that his or her long distance carrier had not been switched.\n  To make it perfectly clear to consumers who their long distance \nprovider is, the provision requires that the local telephone bill \nexplicitly state the name, address and toll-free number of the long \ndistance telephone provider and the specific services provided. This \nhopefully will address the problem of hidden or disguised switching--\nwhere a consumer gets a bill and can't tell that his or her long \ndistance carrier has been switched. This provision gives the FCC the \nauthority to make telephone bills absolutely clear so slammers can't \nhide behind vague or confusing phone bills.\n  Mr. President, I want to commend Senator McCain and Senator Hollings \nfor their good work in getting this important piece of consumer \nlegislation to the floor so quickly. I also want to commend Senator \nCollins and Senator Durbin from the PSI subcommittee for their energy \nand commitment to publicizing and helping to solve this problem.\n  S. 1618, with my amendments, will provide important consumer \nsafeguards, Mr. President, to help keep slammers out of the system. \nLegitimate resellers will be able to conduct their businesses without \nruthless slammers tarnishing the reseller business.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  We have one amendment remaining of Senator Rockefeller. We are \nawaiting his arrival on the floor. I hope that Senator Rockefeller will \narrive pretty quickly, because we have another bill to do tonight. In \nthe meantime, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President. I rise today to address the \nantislamming legislation before us. I believe that this bill, S. 1618, \nis a bill that we must act on quickly and decisively. I am happy that \nwhen the Senate concludes its business today, we will have passed the \nlegislation and for good reason. The problem which this legislation \nseeks to address described, I guess, by the euphemism ``slamming,'' is \none that is a growing concern to people in my State and, I suspect, to \nalmost all the other States represented in this body.\n  In Michigan, during the last year, complaints about this practice, \nwhich is the changing of an individual's or customer's long-distance \nservice without their knowledge and approval, has risen from relative \nobscurity to becoming, next to billing problems, the second largest \nsource of complaints received by Michigan's Public Service Commission.\n  The nature of the complaints are, of course, pretty obvious and have \nbeen depicted very well by Chairman McCain and others in the discussion \nso far today. People find that through no act of their own, or \ncertainly no intentional act of their own, they have had their long-\ndistance service changed usually with negative consequences. In our \nState, the negative consequences usually fall into two categories, \noften both happen simultaneously: On the one hand, people find that \ntheir service level and quality is diminished; on the other hand, they \nfind that their bills are getting higher.\n  The latter happens for a variety of reasons. First, because \nfrequently the new company, in fact, just simply has higher bills and \ncharges higher rates. In addition, they find it happens because they \nhave found themselves the victim of slamming on several separate \noccasions during a billing period. They have moved from one company to \na second and sometimes to even a third and fourth. Many of the current \nrate practices engaged in with respect to long-distance rates give \npeople a reduced rate if they stay with a service a certain period of \ntime.\n  However, as a result of slamming, people change from one to a second \nto a third to even a fourth company during a billing period or a period \nduring which a rate is being determined based on continuity of service. \nIndividuals discover that their long-distance calls that they expect to \nhave been charged at a very low rate are, in fact, being billed at very \nhigh rates.\n  For all of these reasons, we need to take action now. I mentioned \nthat in our State, the slamming practice has become the second most \nwidely voiced complaint heard by our Public Service Commission. Our \nlocal telephone service carrier, Ameritech, the principal carrier in \nMichigan, reports that they are receiving complaints. People think \nsomehow they are responsible. Last year alone they received 37,000 such \ncomplaints of slamming practices occurring.\n\n[[Page S4701]]\n\n  In order to find out more about this, I went back to Michigan during \na recent recess and began meeting with individuals who were themselves \nthe victims of slamming. What I discovered was that, in fact, the \npractices used by these long-distance companies border on outright \nfraud, and in some cases, go over the line to actual fraud.\n  People have been called up and asked if they want ``direct billing'' \nfor their long-distance service. They answer yes and find the ``Direct \nBilling'' is, in fact, the name of a new long-distance service company \nand that their answer is being used as a basis for the changing of \ntheir service.\n  In other cases, people engage in a conversation of someone calling \nover the telephone, an innocuous conversation, but find the information \nhas been rescripted in such a fashion as to give a basis for changing \nthe long-distance service.\n  The bottom line, Mr. President, is that this practice is wrong. It is \nhurting consumers across America, and we have an obligation to stop it. \nI believe the legislation before us now does so.\n  I am glad we were able to pass it so quickly and so overwhelmingly \nthrough the Commerce Committee, and I look forward to the vote today \nwhere I am confident we will, once again, send a signal that we are not \ngoing to tolerate these practices any longer. The additional penalties \nthat are part of this legislation, in my judgment, set us in the right \ndirection. Not only will they send a strong message, but I believe they \ndramatically deter anyone from engaging in these practices. The \nprocedures in this legislation should hopefully provide those who are \nvictims with a relatively quick resolution of their problems.\n  For these reasons, I rise in support of the legislation. I am a \ncosponsor and am pleased to be part of it. I thank Senator McCain and \nhis staff for working not only on this legislation but other technology \nbills that we will be addressing over the next day or so. I close by \nexpressing my support, once again, for S. 1618. I look forward to its \npassage today and ultimately for its passage through the Congress in \ngeneral and it being signed into law by the President.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, we are still \nwaiting for the final amendment. I hope we can get it done very \nquickly. We have another bill to address tonight, and we are still \nworking on that.\n  So I again suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask unanimous consent that I may be allowed to speak \nfor about 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the chair.\n\n\n                              Junk E-Mail\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased that the chairman is \nincluding in the manager's amendment language that I offered along with \nmy colleague, Senator Torricelli.\n  Mr. President, one of the downsides of the technological revolution \nthat is symbolized by communications today on the Internet is the \ngrowing multitude of junk e-mail. Junk e-mail has quickly become the \nscourge of the Internet. It clogs America's inboxes and raises costs to \nall Internet users. Among those who are regular e-mail users, junk e-\nmail is known as ``spam,'' which many suggest is an insult to the \nHormel Corporation. I originally recognized spam as a spinoff of the \nSecond World War where food was given to soldiers, commonly referred to \nas C rations, that implied a mixture of food products. In any event, it \nis the name that has been adopted for junk e-mail.\n  Rural residents of our Nation and my State of Alaska are forced to \npay long-distance charges to receive these unwanted solicitations, the \nmajority of which contain fraudulent or pornographic messages. Not only \nare these junk e-mails objectionable, but they so clog the transmission \nnetwork that Internet service providers are forced to spend tens of \nmillions of dollars to expand their networks to handle all of these \nmessages.\n  America Online reports that up to 30 percent of daily incoming e-mail \nis junk e-mail. This volume has forced it and other Internet service \nproviders, the ISPs, to buy more equipment and divert staff to handle \nusers' complaints. These resources could be better spent by ISPs on \nimproving service or even reducing monthly fees.\n  My provision, Mr. President, is a modified version of legislation \nthat I introduced last year--S. 771. When I introduced the bill, I put \nit up on the Web and asked for e-mail comments on the bill. So far, I \nhave received over 1,500--the vast majority of which have been \nsupportive of my efforts.\n  So this provision is really a Truth in Advertising provision. It will \nsimply require commercial e-mailers to identify who they are, their \naddresses, and their telephone numbers. The reason we have included \nthis provision is that millions of junk e-mails are sent out with phony \ne-mail addresses which make it impossible for citizens to request that \nthe sender stop cluttering their e-mail boxes. Under this provision, \ncitizens will know exactly who the sender is and have the option of \nturning that sender away from their inbox.\n  The provision further requires that a junk e-mailer must honor the \nrequest of an individual who asks that his or her name be deleted from \nthe mailing list permanently. It's as simple as that. I doubt if there \nis anyone among us here today who would argue against someone's wish to \nsimply be left alone by junk e-mailers.\n  The amendment permits the Federal Trade Commission, the State \nAttorneys General, and Internet service providers to protect consumers \nfrom Internet junk e-mail by allowing them to sue those junk e-mailers \nwho fail to identify themselves properly or refuse to remove a person's \nname from a mailing list.\n  Mr. President, junk e-mail has become so pervasive that some have \nsuggested a complete ban on such unsolicited advertisements. I believe \nthat Internet users should control what comes into their electronic \nmailboxes, not the government. And I wish to emphasize that. This \ndebate should not be about the government controlling the content of \nindividual electronic mailboxes, but about individual users taking \ncontrol of their own mailboxes. I think my provision will sufficiently \nreduce the problems of junk e-mail, and thus show that banning is \nunnecessary.\n  Finally, I thank the floor managers for their attention to this \nissue, as well as the efforts of America Online and the Center for \nDemocracy and Technology.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator McCain and \nSenator Hollings for agreeing to include the Murkowski-Torricelli junk \nE-mail amendment to this bill. And I want to thank my distinguished \ncolleague from Alaska for join with me in this effort.\n  Last year, Senator Murkowski and I each recognized the growing threat \nto Internet commerce posed by the proliferation of unsolicited \ncommercial e-mail, known by its Internet slang as ``Spam.'' Although we \ninitially had somewhat different approaches to this problem, we \nrecognized that something had to be done.\n  The amendment we have today is the product of a good faith effort \ninvolving privacy groups, marketers, online service providers, and \nothers to achieve a result that will rein in these destructive e-mail \npractices, while protecting the first amendment rights of all who wish \nto send and receive legitimate e-mail. Before I address what our \namendments does, I want to briefly discuss the problem of unsolicited \ncommercial junk e-mail.\n  Junk E-mail, or so called spamming, is an unfortunate side effect of \nthe burgeoning world of Internet communication and commerce. Like many \nother Americans, I have an account on America Online and am inundated \nwith unsolicited messages, peddling every item\n\n[[Page S4702]]\n\nunder the sun. Similarly, I receive junk e-mail daily at my official \nSenate e-mail address, as well as the complaints of dozens of \nconstituents who forward me the Spam that they are sent.\n  The incentive to abuse the Internet is obvious, E-mailing ten million \npeople can cost as little as a couple of hundred dollars. And because \nthe senders of these e-mails are generally unknown, they avoid any \npossible retribution for consumers.\n  Today, unsolicited commerical e-mailers are hiding their identities, \nfalsifying their return addresses and refusing to accept complaints or \nremoval requests. Their actions approach fraud, but our current law \ndoesn't seem strong enough to stop them.\n  I have long been concerned about excessive--indeed any--government \nregulation of the Internet. Many of the best qualities of American life \nare represented and enhanced by the Internet, and I fear government \nregulation has the possibility to stifle the creativity and development \nof cyberspace.\n  However, a failure to address this problem now poses a greater threat \nto the Internet than do these minimal requirements. Junk e-mail is \nestimated to take up 30 percent of all Internet traffic and is \nincreasingly responsible for slowdowns, and even breakdowns, of \nInternet services. Let me be clear, this legislation is not a de facto \nregulation of the Internet. In fact, it does not go as far as some have \nsuggested. It does not ban all unsolicited e-mail because we wanted to \navoid any inference of government interference. However, it is a first \nand needed step in making cyberspace saner.\n  The Murkowski-Torricelli amendment takes some important and necessary \nsteps. First, it requires senders of unsolicited commercial e-mail to \nidentify themselves and provide a valid return e-mail address. Second, \nit requires senders to inform recipients that they have the right to \nreply and stop any future messages by typing ``remove'' on the subject \nline. Third, it requires junk e-mail to honor any request to remove \nsomeone from their mailing list. Fourth, it authorizes the FTC to \nenforce these requirements with civil fines and injunctive relief. And \nfinally, it requires the FTC to establish a web site to accept consumer \ncomplaints and list its enforcement actions.\n  Put simply, our amendment strikes a balance that will help consumers \nprevent unwanted and unsolicited electronic mail, without creating a \nburdensome regulatory system or unnecessarily restricting free speech. \nIt recognizes that the government should not hastily and haphazardly \nregulate pass legislation to regulate the Internet. However, it also \nrecognizes that some practices are simply too destructive to ignore.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2392\n\n (Purpose: Require truth in billing procedures for telecommunications \n                               carriers)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Rockefeller, Senator \nSnowe, Senator Kerrey, and myself, Senator Dorgan, I send an amendment \nto the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for Mr. \n     Rockefeller, for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Kerrey and himself, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2392.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . CONSUMER TRUTH IN BILLING DISCLOSURE ACT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings--\n       (1) Billing practices by telecommunications carriers may \n     not reflect accurately the cost or basis of the additional \n     telecommunications services and benefits that consumers \n     receive as a result of the enactment the Telecommunications \n     Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-104) and other Federal regulatory \n     actions taken since the enactment of that Act.\n       (2) The Telecommunications Act of 1996 was not intended to \n     allow providers of telecommunications services to \n     misrepresent to customers the costs of providing services or \n     the services provided.\n       (3) Certain providers of telecommunications services have \n     established new, specific charges on customer bills commonly \n     known as ``line-item charges''.\n       (4) Certain providers of telecommunications services have \n     described such charges as ``Federal Universal Service Fees'' \n     or similar fees.\n       (5) Such charges have generated significant confusion among \n     customers regarding the nature of and scope of universal \n     service and of the fees associated with universal service.\n       (6) The State of New York is considering action to protect \n     consumers by requiring telecommunications carriers to \n     disclose fully in the bills of all classes of customers the \n     fee increases and fee reductions resulting from the enactment \n     of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and other regulatory \n     actions taken since the enactment of that Act.\n       (7) The National Association of Regulatory Utility \n     Commissioners adopted a resolution in February 1998 \n     supporting action by the Federal Communications Commission \n     and the Federal Trade Commission to protect consumers of \n     telecommunications services by assuring accurate cost \n     reporting and billing practices by telecommunications \n     carriers nationwide.\n       (b) Requirements.--Any telecommunications carrier that \n     includes any change resulting from Federal regulatory action \n     shall specify in such bill--\n       (1) the reduction in charges or fees for each class of \n     customers (including customers of residential basic service, \n     customers of other residential services, small business \n     customers, and other business customers) resulting from any \n     regulatory action of the Federal Communications Commission;\n       (2) total monthly charges, usage charges, percentage \n     charges, and premiums for each class of customers (including \n     customers of residential basic service, customers of other \n     residential services, small business customers, and other \n     business customers);\n       (3) notify consumers one billing cycle in advance of any \n     charges in existing charges or imposition of new charges; and\n       (4) disclose, upon subscription, total monthly charges, \n     usage charges, percentage charges, and premiums for each \n     class of customers (including residential basic service, \n     customers of other residential service, small business \n     customers, and other business customers).\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my good friend and \ncolleague from West Virginia Jay Rockefeller, in offering the Consumer \nProtection Act as an amendment to the Consumer Anti-Slamming bill.\n  Just as the slamming bill is designed to protect consumers from \nunscrupulous phone companies that change a customer's phone service \nwithout consent, this amendment will protect consumers from misleading \nor inaccurate billing practices by phone companies. Therefore, I urge \nthat my colleges support this pro-consumer amendment that complements \nthe underlying pro-consumer Anti-Slamming Act.\n  Mr. President, our nation's $260 billion telecommunications industry \nis undergoing a period of rapid growth and change. This change is being \ndriven by the enactment and progressive implementation of the \nTelecommunications Act of 1996--a law that is gradually shifting the \nindustry from being one that is heavily-regulated to one that is open \nand competitive.\n  As would be expected for an industry of this size, the transition \nfrom a regulated environment to a competitive environment has not been \nentirely smooth, nor has it been as rapid as many of us would prefer.\n  To date, there have been countless proceeding at the FCC to \nrestructure the way that services are delivered to consumers and the \nway that telecommunications companies pay each other for these \nservices. In response to these restructuring efforts, there have been a \nvariety lawsuits filed in court by telecommunications companies, and \nmembers of Congress have weighed-in when they believe the new rules do \nnot accurately reflect the intent of the law.\n  And--as would be expected in an emerging competitive market--there is \nnon-stop haggling between the telecommunications companies that are now \nable to tread on each other's turf after years of being statutorily \nlimited to their own market niche. But don't get me wrong . . . that's \nnot a bad thing--that's what competition is all about.\n  Mr. President, during this time of rapid transition and daunting \nchange,\n\n[[Page S4703]]\n\nit is critical that we not forget the individuals for whom the \nTelecommunications Act of 1996 was crafted in the first place: the \nAmerican consumers. Afterall, this landmark law was not passed because \nCongress simply wanted to deregulate an industry--rather, it was passed \nbecause competition will bring consumers a wide array of new and \nadvanced telecommunications services at lower prices.\n  The amendment we are offering today is specifically designed to \nprotect consumers during this time of transition in the \ntelecommunications industry. Specifically, the Consumer Protection Act \nwill require ``truth-in-billing''--a guarantee to consumers that what \nthey see on their phone bills is thorough and accurate.\n  Mr. President, as my colleagues have undoubtedly heard from their \nconstituents--and may be experiencing themselves--there is a great deal \nof confusion being generated by new line-item charges that have been \nadded to phone bills in recent months. Since January, many telephone \ncompanies have started to place new line-item charges on customer phone \nbills for a variety of purposes and under a variety of names, including \n``national access charges,'' ``universal service charges,'' or both. \nWhile the descriptions for these charges vary, the central theme is \nthat these new fees are being imposed because of recent federal actions \nstemming from the Telecommunications Act of 1996.\n  In response to these new charges, telephone customers are \nunderstandably confused and angry, and want to know why Congress would \npass a law--and the President would sign a law--that imposed a host of \nnew costs on them with no apparent benefits. They were told that this \nlegislation would bring competition and lower prices, but all they see \nis new charges on their phone bills. They want to know what happened to \nthe benefits of deregulation!\n  Mr. President, customers deserve an answer to these questions and \nthey deserve to know that what they see on their phone bills is \naccurate. And the simple fact is that the implementation of the \nTelecommunications Act has brought--and will continue to bring--\ncountless benefits to consumers, and they deserve to know about them.\n  For instance, in July 1997, access charges--which are the fees paid \nby long distance companies to local phone companies for use of their \nnetworks--were reduced by $1.7 billion. The long distance companies \nstate that these reductions have been passed on to consumers in the \nform of reduced rates, and I  won't dispute their contention. The \nproblem is that their customers don't know the first thing about this \nfederal action to benefit customers--all they know is that new line-\nitems for various charges prescribed to the federal government have \nbeen added to their bills!\n\n  By the same token, consumers have no idea that the phone companies \nstand to reap substantial benefits as new markets are opened for \ncompetition. As companies are allowed to enter the markets that were \npreviously closed to them, those that are competitive will reap \nsubstantial profits that can greatly benefit their customers--but you'd \nnever know this from reading a company's bill.\n  To remove the confusion that these line-items have generated--and to \nensure that companies exercise full disclosure on the impact of \nderegulation--the amendment we are offering does three things.\n  First, it directs the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Federal \nCommunications Commission (FCC) to investigate the billing practices of \nthe telecommunications industry to ensure that all fees are being \nfairly described on bills. If any company is found to be using \nmisleading billing practices, these agencies would be directed to \nconsider disciplinary actions against that company.\n  Second, the bill ensures that if a company puts a new line-item \ncharge on a phone bill that are attributed to federal actions, it must \nalso include line-items that delineate the benefits of federal actions \nas well. Customers deserve to know the whole story when it comes to \nfederal regulatory actions--not just the side of the story that is in \nthe company's best interests.\n  Third, to ensure that the federal regulator of telephone service has \nall relevant documents available for review, the bill requires that \ncompanies submit the same financial disclosure forms to the FCC that \nthey now submit to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This \nrequirement won't impose a new, excessive burden on phone companies--\nrather, it simply requires that they make a photocopy of the forms that \nare already being sent to the SEC and mail them to the FCC.\n  Overall, this bill ensures that accurate information is being \ndepicted on phone bills--and that customers are told the whole story \nabout federal actions, not just the side that companies would like to \ntell.\n  The bottom line is that changes are occurring as part of the \ntransition to a more competitive telecommunications market that will \nbring substantial benefits to consumers and phone companies alike--but \nsome companies would only like to tell their customers half of the \nstory. That's simply not fair.\n  The amendment that we are offering is fair. It is a fair for \ncompanies, and fair for consumers.\n  Of critical importance, our amendment does not re-regulate the \ntelecommunications industry--the companies will still decide for \nthemselves if they want to use line items. Our amendment simply ensures \nthat if a company does want to use a line-item for costs, it also will \ninclude line-items for benefits. In addition, it ensures that the \nbilling practices of companies are properly examined and improper \npractices are eliminated.\n  I would like to thank my friend from West Virginia for offering this \namendment today, and urge that my colleagues support this bipartisan, \npro-consumer amendment.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was \nclear; competition and consumer choice are to be the hallmarks of the \nnew telecommunication's market. However, the transition to competition \nhas been anything but clear to consumers. The growing pains of the \ntelecommunications industry have proved to be very confusing to \ncustomers who lack full information about the various costs associated \nwith telecommunications services.\n  This lack of information is very troublesome for customers who are \ntrying to make sense of the telecommunications market. In order to help \nconsumers through this confusing morass of information, I recently \njoined Senators Rockefeller and Snowe to introduce S. 1897 the Consumer \nProtection Act. Today, Senator Dorgan joins us as cosponsor of this \nlegislation in the form of an amendment to S. 1618 the Consumer Anti-\nSlamming Protection Act.\n  Under the provisions of this amendment, if a company chooses to \ndepict charges that are linked to federal policy on their bills, then \nthe company will be required to depict the benefits of that action on \nthe same bill. This requirement allows customers to see what they are \npaying for so that they can gain a better understanding of the costs \nassociated with a national telecommunications network.\n  As we transition from the rigid world of monopoly to a competitive \nmarket where consumers have choice, we must make sure that customers \nhave all of the facts. Competition depends upon free flowing \ninformation and the Consumer Protection Act gives consumers the facts \nthey need to make good choices in a competitive market.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I must respectfully oppose the amendment \noffered by my good friend and colleague, Senator Rockefeller.\n  Let me explain why I am opposed. I take no issue with the Senator's \ncommitment to the principles of universal telephone service. And I most \ncertainly take no issue with the principle that consumers have a right \nto clear and correct information about material adjustments to their \nbills. I also believe that companies have an absolute right to inform \nconsumers about increases to their bills that companies have made in \nresponse to federal and nonfederal requirements.\n  But, with all due respect, that's not what's really at issue here.\n  Mr. President, what's really at issue here is an attempt to \nrationalize the rate adjustments imposed by the Telecommunications Act \nof 1996. Unlike Senator Rockefeller, I didn't vote for that act, in \npart because I thought it\n\n[[Page S4704]]\n\nwould produce precisely the result it is producing--little competition, \nlots of consolidation, and lots of bill adjustments--mostly increases.\n  If my colleague's amendment wants to give consumers facts, let's talk \nabout those facts. The telephone industry is built on a very complex \nsystem of implicit internal subsidies. Making them explicit, while at \nthe same time adjusting them for the advent of competition, makes \nadjustments in consumer bills inevitable. Now add these further facts: \nthe Telecom Act creates a whole new multibillion-dollar subsidy, and it \nrequires local telephone companies and interexchange companies to \nexpend billions of dollars to implement the Act's supposedly pro-\ncompetitive provisions.\n  So here are the bottom-line facts. First of all, given this hideously \nconvoluted situation, complete ``truthful'' disclosure of all the \nadjustments inherent in a consumer's monthly phone bill would add pages \nand pages to a bill without necessarily doing much to enlighten the \nconsumer. For example, if a requirement like this were currently in \neffect, a consumer might today be reading something like this:\n\n       Your long-distance bill might have been lower if your long-\n     distance carrier's reduction in access charge payments to \n     your local carrier had been reflected in your long-distance \n     bill instead of being used to help pay for the schools' and \n     libraries' wiring subsidy. Then again, of course, the FCC, \n     your long-distance carrier, and your local carrier disagree \n     on whether your long-distance carrier is really lowering your \n     bills as much as it might, and maybe someday we'll know the \n     answer--or maybe not. In the meantime, you're being assessed \n     a per-subscriber line charge which may or may not reflect the \n     real cost of your service, but the FCC's working on it. Of \n     course, if you live in the suburbs you should also know that \n     a portion of your bill goes to subsidize rural areas and \n     another portion subsidizes low-income subscribers. And be \n     aware that starting next year there's going to be another \n     substantial increase in some local phone bills as local phone \n     companies start passing along the costs of implementing local \n     number portability, which may or may not accurately reflect \n     all their true costs, which will otherwise be recovered by * \n     * *.\n\nAnd on and on and on.\n  I would also note that the Senator's bill would require the FCC to \nexamine the bills of all telecommunications carriers. This would not \nonly require the FCC to investigate the bills of the over 500 long-\ndistance telephone companies that currently exist; it would also \nrequire them to investigate the bills rendered by the thousands upon \nthousands of wireless paging, cellular telephone, and PCS companies \ntoo. This would require an enormous expansion of the current FCC \nbureaucracy.\n  Mr. President, you get the picture: given the complexities of pricing \noffsets in changing telephone industry economics, this attempt at so-\ncalled truthful disclosure won't work. It will only confuse the \nconsumer to no useful purpose and wind up involving the FCC and the FTC \nin neverending regulatory micromanagement in an effort to ascertain the \nunascertainable.\n  If those who voted for the 1996 Telecom Act are now concerned that \nthe act is unexpectedly driving prices upward, the way to solve the \nproblem is to change the Act--not to present attempted excuses in the \nform of confusing additions to consumers' bills.\n  Having said why it's unrealistic to try and explain every single \nthing that has an impact on every single consumer telecom bill, I \nemphatically endorse the proposition that consumers have a right to be \ntold why their bills have gone up--especially when an increase is \nresults from a federal or State levy. I would like to offer my own \namendment to assure consumers have access to that information.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2392) was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, first of all, I want to thank the \nchairman of the Commerce Committee for accepting this amendment which I \nwas rushing to the floor to eloquently and brilliantly explain, and it \nhas been accepted. That is really what one prays for in this \ninstitution. I hope it survives the conference. I am sure that it will.\n  Basically, the theory of it was--and I think that the chairman \nunderstood it as well as the Senator from North Dakota--that we should \nbe honest with consumers. A lot of people don't know what a lot of the \nprices are on the telephone long-distance bill. Charges have gone down \nfrom an average of 34 cents per minute since deregulation of AT to \nabout 16 cents per minute now. We should tell them when we bill them, \nif the prices go up on certain items, they also go down on others.\n  As an example, recently there was a $1.5 billion access charge \nreduction, so actually the cost to the consumer on their residential \nrate bill was going to go down, but the companies only wanted to show \nthe part that had a $675 million increase--$675 million increase, $1.5 \nbillion decrease; obviously, the net of the decrease wins big time, but \nthey are not going to be told that.\n  I think this is a very useful amendment that the chairman of the \nCommerce Committee has accepted. It isn't about reregulation, it is \nabout treating consumers fairly. It is also, frankly, about something \nwhich is very complicated that consumers don't understand, nor should \nthey be expected to understand, nor do many of us understand as we \nshould--things like prescribed interchange carrier charge, called PICC. \nThat is a very big thing in all of this.\n\n  Even where universal service protects high-cost areas, the whole \nconcept of universal service is not understood by most voters or many \nin the Congress itself.\n  We have to be fair. We have to level with them. We have to be \nstraight and honest. That is what this amendment attempts to do. That \nis one of the reasons I am so glad this amendment has been accepted.\n  I thank, once again, the chairman of the Commerce Committee, the \nSenator from Arizona, and also my friend from North Dakota, Senator \nDorgan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. That completes our amendments. I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I was just thinking, while we are all here, \nI know we continue to have a number of names on the Executive Calendar \non nominations, and we have, let's see, nine judges, all of whom have \nbeen voted out of the Judiciary Committee, I think in most cases \nunanimously. We have close to 100 vacancies in the Federal judiciary. \nAmong those who are on here is Sonia Sotomayor of the second circuit. \nThis has been out for some time now. She has been before the Senate for \na couple of years now, I believe. This is a circuit where the Chief \nJudge has declared a judicial emergency. I believe it is the first time \na circuit court has declared a judicial emergency, I think maybe the \nfirst time in history that they have done that.\n  But what that means is that if you go before the second circuit, you \ndon't even have a panel made up of second circuit judges. You have one \nsecond circuit court of appeals judge and two visiting judges. And yet \nwe have two nominees for the second circuit on the Executive Calendar, \nboth of whom could be voted on in the next 5 minutes--they went out of \nthe Judiciary Committee very easily--and it would stop this judicial \nemergency.\n  The reason I mention this, Mr. President, is that with 100 vacancies \nin the Federal judiciary, nearly 100 vacancies, we are finding around \nthe country that prosecutors have to lower charges; they have to nol-\npros cases; they have\n\n[[Page S4710]]\n\nto plea bargain because they cannot give a speedy trial. So the police \ngo through all the work, the Federal agencies and everybody, to \napprehend somebody, and then because we can't guarantee a speedy trial \nbecause there are so many vacancies in the Federal court, somebody who \nhas been charged with a crime suddenly sees their charge lowered. If \nyou are a taxpayer and you pay the bill, as we all are for these \ncourts, and you have a case, a civil case, you cannot get it heard for \nsometimes 2, 3, 4, 5 years. Justice delayed is justice denied. I \nmention this, Mr. President; I certainly, and I understand everybody on \nthis side of the aisle, would be ready to go ahead and vote up or down \nevery one of these nine judges right now and clear this up.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield without losing my right to the floor. Of course, I \nyield to the distinguished Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. When the Senator said we had other nominees, and he only \nlisted the judicial, there are other nominees on the Executive Calendar \nwho have no reason to be held. For instance, we have a woman who has \nbeen serving for 4 years on the Uranium Enrichment Corporation. She \ncame before the Energy Committee on February 11. She was given the \ngreatest of accolades for the tremendous job she had done, and she is \ncaught up in the holds on everything else. And now 90 days have passed \nsince she was unanimously reported out of the Energy Committee.\n  The Uranium Enrichment Corporation is about to privatize. There is $2 \nbillion, approximately, in this budget that will have to be voted on by \nthat particular individual. They said--the ``they'' being the \nmajority--let her have a contract, just a consultant's contract. And \nthat means she can sit there and listen but cannot say a word or cast a \nvote. We are about ready to close the deal.\n\n  So not only do we have the judicial problem, we have other \nnominations that are vitally important to my State and the State of \nOhio of which we have a vital interest. I want to encourage the \nSenator. I am about to make a unanimous consent request that we bring \nMargaret Greene up so we might try to do something here to get her \nmoving and on the board so she can continue to make decisions and do \nthe good work she has been complimented for by the Energy Committee. So \nI thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If I might say to my friend from Kentucky, the irony is \nthat Margaret Hornbeck Greene, if there was to be a vote on her, would \nget every vote in this place. So instead, what you have is somebody in \nthe back recesses of a cloakroom somewhere holding this woman up, as \nare a whole lot of other women on this list being held up by people who \nsay, ``We won't vote on these women. We just won't let them come to a \nvote.''\n  Nobody is going to vote them down. They are all going to be \nconfirmed, if we have a vote. But these women are all being held up by \nsomebody who will not come in the Chamber and say who it is holding \nthem up. But just do it. Frankly, I would like to see all of these \npeople--the committees have passed on them. The committees have given \nthem, in most cases, unanimous recommendations and some overwhelming \nrecommendations.\n  Let the Senate work its will. I think it is wrong to hold them up but \nespecially in the courts. The courts now face an enormous problem. \nPeople are declining appointments to the Federal judiciary because they \nsay they are not going to sit around for 2 or 3 years while their law \npractices fall apart waiting for the Senate to do what we are paid to \ndo.\n  We have, as I said earlier, in the second circuit, my own circuit, a \njudicial emergency, the first time ever, and yet we have two second \ncircuit court of appeals judges voted out of the committee sitting on \nthe calendar and cannot be voted upon. It is wrong, Mr. President, for \nthe Senate to try to diminish the Federal bench.\n  One of the most important parts of our democracy is the fact that we \nhave an independent judiciary. No other nation on Earth has the ability \nto appoint to a judiciary, handling as complex and varied items as ours \ndoes, and still retain its independence. Some, I am afraid to say, on \nthe other side of the aisle and in the other body feel that we must \nstart intimidating these judges--their words, that we must start \nholding up these judges--their words.\n  That is wrong. This democracy is maintained and is able to remain a \ndemocracy, even though it is the most powerful nation on Earth, because \nof an independent judiciary. We hurt all Americans. We hurt the \ncriminal justice system; we allow people to escape for their misdeeds \nif we do not have the judges there to try the cases. And if you are a \nprivate litigant, you cannot be heard. Even though you pay the taxes, \nyou pay the bills, you cannot be heard because the judges are not \nthere.\n  I see the distinguished senior Senator from Arizona in the Chamber. I \nknow he is seeking recognition.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would like to thank the Senator from Vermont for his \ncourtesy. I know he is addressing a very important issue and I \nappreciate his forbearance while I propound a unanimous consent \nrequest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/12/senate-section/article/S4709-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 1260\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, today, the Senate passed the conference \nagreement on S. 1150, the Agricultural Research, Extension, and \nEducation Reform Act of 1998. I am pleased that this important \nlegislation, containing several amendments I authored, has seen its way \nto the Senate floor for proper and overdue consideration and passage.\n  Mr. President, the agricultural provisions of this bill are important \nfor all farmers but I am especially proud of the provisions targeted to \nsupport our endangered small farmers.\n  Mr. President, this country is facing a national farming crisis. Day \nafter day, season after season, we are losing small farms at an \nalarming rate. In 1980, there were 45,000 dairy farms in Wisconsin. In \n1997, there are only 24,000 dairy farms. That is a loss of more than 3 \ndairy farms a day-everyday for 17 years. And it does not begin to \nmeasure the human cost to families driven from the land. As small farms \ndisappear, we are witnessing the emergence of larger agricultural \noperations. This trend toward fewer but larger dairy operations is \nmirrored in most States throughout the Nation.\n  Mr. President, the economic losses associated with the reduction in \nthe number of small farms go well beyond the impact on the individual \nfarm families who must wrench themselves from the land. The reduction \nin farm numbers has hurt their neighbors as well and deprived the \nmerchants on the main streets of their towns of many lifelong \ncustomers. For many of the rural communities of Wisconsin, small \nfamily-owned farms are the key component of the community. They provide \neconomic and sound stability. They are good people and we need a system \nin which their farms are viable and their work can be fairly rewarded.\n  Many feel that basic research is a necessary and underutilized tool \nthat can help to save this dying breed of farmers. There have been \nplenty of Federal investments in agricultural research, past and \npresent, focusing almost solely on the needs of larger scale \nagricultural producers-neglecting the specific research needs of small \nproducers. This research bias has hamstrung small farmers, depriving \nthem of the tools they need to adapt to changes in farming and the \nmarketplace and accelerating the trend toward increased concentration.\n  To address this concern, I worked with the conference committee to \ninclude a provision which authorizes a coordinated program of research, \nextension, and education to improve the viability of small- and medium-\nsize dairy and livestock operations. Among the research projects the \nSecretary is authorized to conduct are: Research, development, and on-\nfarm education, low-cost production facilities, management systems and \ngenetics appropriate for these small and medium operations, research \nand extension on management intensive grazing systems which reduce feed \ncosts and improve farm profitability, research and extension on \nintegrated crop and livestock systems that strengthen the competitive \nposition of small- and medium-size operations, economic analyses and \nfeasibility studies to identify new marketing opportunities for small- \nand medium-size producers, technology assessment that compares the \ntechnological resources of large specialized producers with the \ntechnological needs of small- and medium-size dairy and livestock \noperations, and research to identify the specific research and \neducation needs of these small operations.\n  The provision allows the Secretary to carry out this new program \nusing existing USDA funds, facilities and technical expertise. Dairy \nand livestock producers should not be forced to become larger in order \nto remain competitive. Bigger is not necessarily better. And in fact, \nM. President, expansion is often counterproductive for small \noperations, requiring them to take on even greater debt. Farmers need \nmore help in determining other methods of maintaining long-term \nprofitability. For example, small dairy farmers may find adoption of \nmanagement-intensive grazing systems, combined with a diversified \ncropping operation a profitable alternative to expansion. But there has \nbeen far too little federally funded research devoted to alternative \nlivestock production systems. Small producers need more Federal \nresearch and extension activity devoted to the development of these \nalternatives. This amendment is a good first step in establishing the \nFederal research commitment to help develop and promote production and \nmarketing systems that specifically address the needs of small \nproducers.\n  Using research dollars to help maintain the economic viability of \nsmall- and medium-size dairy and livestock operations has benefits \nbeyond those gained by farmers and the communities in which they \nreside. Keeping a large number of small operations in production can \nprovide environmental benefits as well. As livestock operations expand \ntheir herd size without a corresponding increase in cropping acreage, \nmanure storage and management practices become more costly and more \nburdensome for the operator and raise additional regulatory concerns \nassociated with runoff and water quality among State and Federal \nregulators. Research that helps dairy and livestock operators remain \ncompetitive and profitable without dramatic expansion will help \nminimize these concerns.\n\n[[Page S4712]]\n\n  Mr. President, also incorporated into the bill is language requiring \nthe Secretary to fund research on the competitiveness and viability of \nsmall- and medium-size farms under the Initiative for Future \nAgriculture and Food Systems--a new research program authorized by S. \n1150 and funded at a total of $600 million for fiscal years 1999 \nthrough 2002. With the inclusion of my amendment, the Secretary is \ndirected to make grants for research projects addressing the viability \nof small- and medium-size farming operations with funding made \navailable under the Initiative in fiscal years 1999-2002. This \namendment ensures that the research needs of small dairy, livestock, \nand cropping operations will be addressed under the substantial new \nfunding provided for agricultural research in this bill.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the conference committee also accepted \nimportant language regarding precision agriculture. Precision \nagriculture is a system of farming that uses very site-specific \ninformation on soil nutrient needs and presence of plant pests, often \ngathered using advanced technologies such as global positioning \nsystems, high performance image processing, and software systems to \ndetermine the specific fertilizer, pesticide and other input needs of a \nfarmer's cropland. This technology may have the benefit of lowering \nfarm production costs and increase profitability by helping the \nproducer reduce agricultural inputs by applying them only where needed. \nIn addition, reducing agricultural inputs may minimize the impact of \ncrop production on wildlife and the environment. While precision \nagriculture, generally defined, encompasses a broad range of techniques \nfrom high-technology satellite imaging systems to manual soil sampling, \nit is most frequently discussed in terms of the use of capital \nintensive advanced technologies.\n  Precision agriculture may result in production efficiencies and \nimproved profitability for some farms, yet many in agriculture are \nconcerned that, because of the capital intensive nature of precision \nagriculture systems, this new technology will not be applicable or \naccessible to small or highly diversified farms. It is unclear whether \nprecision agriculture services, even if provided by input suppliers, \nwill be available at affordable rates to small farms. Furthermore, some \nobservers are concerned that private firms may find that marketing \nefforts directed at small farms are not lucrative enough and thus may \navoid efforts to apply the technology to small operations.\n  In addition to concerns about the applicability and accessibility of \nprecision agriculture to small farms, many are concerned that precision \nagriculture may not be the most appropriate production system for small \nfarms given the costs of acquiring new technology or contracting for \nadditional services. There may be other production systems, such as \nintegrated whole farm crop, livestock, and resource management systems, \nthat allow small farmers to reduce input costs, improve profitability, \nand minimize environmental impacts of agricultural production that are \nmore appropriate for smaller operations.\n  To address this concern, accepted language allows USDA to fund \nstudies evaluating whether precision agriculture technologies are \napplicable or accessible to small- and medium-sized farms. The \namendment also allows USDA to conduct research on methods to improve \nthe applicability of precision agriculture to these operations. It is \ncritical that USDA's research investment in this new technology not \nexclude the needs of small farmers. If it does, this new research \nprogram could ultimately affect the structure of agriculture, \npotentially providing disproportionate advantages to large scale \nfarming operations, accelerating the trend to fewer and larger farms. \nMy amendment will allow USDA to conduct research on low cost precision \nagriculture systems that do not require significant financial \ninvestments by farmers and that may be more appropriate to small or \nhighly diversified farming operations.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the cooperation of the chairman, Mr. \nLugar, and the ranking member, Mr. Harkin, of the Agriculture Committee \nand their staff in addressing the important research needs of small- \nand medium-size farms by maintaining these amendments during conference \ncommittee consideration of this bill.\n  These amendments will ensure that research money is directed at the \ninterests of the small farmer providing the tools to make these \noperations viable to survive the riggers of farming in the next \ncentury.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/12/senate-section/article/S4711-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SHANNEL QUARLES--KANSAS YOUTH OF THE YEAR\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

A bill to prohibit the sale of naval vessels and Maritime \nAdministration vessels for purposes of scrapping abroad, to establish a \ndemonstration program relating to the breaking up of such vessels in \nUnited States shipyards, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nArmed Services.\n\n\n                       naval vessels legislation\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to bring to the attention of the \nSenate that today I am introducing legislation to change the way we \ndispose of Navy ships that are no longer needed. I am proud to say that \nthis bill is being cosponsored by my senior Senator, Paul Sarbanes, as \nwell as the distinguished Senator from Ohio, Senator John Glenn.\n  With the end of the cold war, the number of ships to be disposed of \nin the military arsenal is growing. There are 180 Navy and Maritime \nAdministration ships waiting to be scrapped. These ships are difficult \nand dangerous to dismantle. They usually contain asbestos, PCBs, and \nlead paint. They were built long before we understood all of the \nenvironmental hazards associated with these materials.\n  I am prompted to offer this legislation because an issue was brought \nto my attention by a Pulitzer Prize-winning series of articles that \nappeared in the Baltimore Sun written by reporters Gary Cohn and Will \nEnglund. They conducted a very thorough and rigorous investigation into \nthe way we dispose of our Navy and maritime ships. They traveled around \nthe country and around the world to see firsthand how our ships are \ndismantled.\n  I must advise the Senate that the way we do this is not being done in \nan honorable, environmentally sensitive, efficient way. I believe that \nwhen we have ships that have defended the United States of America, \nthat were floating military bases, they should be retired with honor. \nWhen I unfold to you the horror stories that the Sun paper found, you \nwill be shocked, and I hope you will join in the cosponsorship of my \nbill.\n  Let me recite from the Sun paper:\n\n       As the Navy sells off obsolete warships at the end of the \n     cold war, a little known industry has grown up in America's \n     depressed ports, and where the shipbreaking industry goes, \n     pollution and injured workers are left in its wake.\n\n  Headline No. 1. No. 2:\n\n       The Pentagon repeatedly deals with shipbreakers with dismal \n     records, then fails to keep watch as they leave health, \n     environmental and legal problems in America's ports.\n\n  In terms of our own communities on the border in Brownsville, TX:\n\n       In this U.S. shipbreaking capital on the Mexican border, \n     where labor and life are cheap, scrapping thrives amid \n     official indifference.\n\n  And, I might say, danger.\n  Also, even more horrendous is the way we use the Third World to dump \nAmerican ships: In India, the Sun paper found:\n\n       On a fetid beach, 35,000 men scrap the world's ships with \n     little more than their bare hands. Despite wretched \n     conditions--\n\n  And dangerous environmental situations.\n  I point out what this means close to home. Let me tell you some \nstories. In Baltimore:\n\n       Workers have been toiling in air thick with asbestos dust. \n     In Baltimore, laborers scrapping the USS Coral Sea ripped \n     asbestos insulation from the aircraft carrier with their bare \n     hands. At times they had no respirators, standard equipment \n     for asbestos work. [As we all know,] inhaling asbestos fibers \n     can have . . . lethal consequences.\n\n  It was not limited to Baltimore. At Terminal Island, CA, 20 laborers \nwere fired when they told Federal investigators how asbestos was being \nimproperly stripped from Navy ships. In Baltimore, workers were ordered \nto stuff asbestos into a leaky barge to hide it from inspectors.\n\n       Dangerous substances from scrapped ships have polluted \n     harbors, rivers and shorelines.\n\n  The Sun paper goes on to say:\n\n       A scrapyard along the Northeast Cape Fear River in \n     Wilmington, NC, was contaminated by asbestos, oil and lead. \n     ``That site looked like one of Dante's levels of hell,'' said \n     David Heeter, a North Carolina assistant attorney general.\n       Ship scrappers frustrate regulators by constructing a maze \n     of corporate names and moving frequently. The Defense \n     Department has repeatedly sent ships to scrappers who have \n     records of bankruptcies, fraud [and] payoffs. . . .\n\n  Because of downsizing, the Navy promised that this would be a \nbonanza, for amounts ranging from $15,000 to dismantle a destroyer--15 \ngrand to dismantle a destroyer--to $1 million for an aircraft carrier.\n\n       They buy the rights to Navy ships, then sell the salvaged \n     metal. . . .\n       Because of environmental violations and other issues, the \n     Navy has had to take back 20 ships in yards in North \n     Carolina, Rhode Island and California. . . . Of the 58 ships \n     sold for scrapping since 1991, only 28 have been finished.\n\n  And, oh, my God, how they have been finished.\n  I would like to turn to my hometown of Baltimore. Mr. President, this \nis what the Coral Sea looked like while it was being dismantled in the \nBaltimore harbor. It looks like it was ravaged, like it was \ncannibalized. It looks like a tenement in a Third World area.\n  The Sun paper continues:\n\n       In Baltimore, torch handlers worked without other men on \n     fire watch and without fire hoses. . . .\n\n  Picture yourself going out there trying to do that in the early \nmorning.\n\n       The Coral Sea's dismal end has been marked by stubborn \n     fires and dumping of oil in the harbor, by lawsuits and \n     repeated delays--but most of all, by the mishandling of \n     asbestos.\n\n  Let me tell you that it was so bad that even a Navy inspector who \ncame to look at what they were doing was scared to death to go on that \nship because he was afraid it was too dangerous.\n  I am quoting the Sun paper.\n\n       On September 16, 1993, [the military] sent its lone \n     inspector----\n\n  One inspector for the United States----\n\n       On his first visit to the Seawitch Salvage yard in \n     Baltimore. . . . But Evans didn't inspect [it because]. . . . \n     He thought it was too dangerous.\n       The next day, a 23-year-old worker named Alfio Leonardi Jr. \n     found out how unsafe it would be.\n\n  He walked on a flight deck up in that situation and dropped 30 feet \nfrom the hangar.\n\n       I felt a burning feeling inside. . . . There was blood \n     coming out of my month. I didn't think I was going to live.\n\n  He suffered a ruptured spleen, fractured pelvis, fractured vertebrae, \nand he broke his arms in several places.\n  The inspector was new to the job when the accident occurred. He had \nonly 20 hours of training on environmental issues. He was not \nappropriately trained, and he didn't even know what shipbreaking was. \nAt the same time, we had repeated fires breaking out.\n  In November of 1996, a fire broke out in the Coral Sea engine room. \nThere was no one standing fire watch, no hose nearby. The blaze burned \nquickly out of control, and for the sixth time, Baltimore City's fire \ndepartment had to come in and rescue the shipyard. At the same time, \nthe owner of this shipyard had a record of environmental violations for \nwhich he ultimately went to jail.\n  We cannot tolerate this in the Baltimore harbor. If you look there, \nthat is\n\n[[Page S4714]]\n\nwhere it is, right across from Ft. McHenry that defended the United \nStates of America and won the second battle in the war of 1812. And \nlook at it. That is what it looks like. It is a national disgrace that \nthat was in the harbor as well as a national environment danger.\n  Right down the road was the Baltimore City Shipyard, the Bethlehem \nSteel Shipyard that was foraging for work. Another fighting lady from \nMaryland, Helen Bentley, our former Congresswoman--she and I and \nSenator Paul Sarbanes worked for Baltimore to be a home port. We were \ndesperate for work in our shipyard--desperate. But no; do you think the \nNavy turned to shipyards like Bethlehem Steel? They turned to the \nrogues, the crooks, the scum, the scams, to dismantle our Navy ships.\n  I think the ships deserve more. I think the Baltimore harbor deserves \nmore. And I think the United States of America deserves more. That is \nwhy I am introducing legislation to create a pilot project on how we \ncan dispose of these ships, and in a way that is efficient, is orderly, \nand environmentally safe, and keeps the work in American shipyards, \nbecause while this was so terrible in my own home of Baltimore, MD, let \nme show you what was going on in the Third World.\n  This is the U.S. Navy ships being dismantled in India. Thirty-five \nthousand people work on a beach, often with no shoes, dismantling ships \nwith their bare hands. This is so dangerous, in terms of what they are \ndoing, that I believe it is an international disgrace. I was appalled \nwe were also exporting our environmental problems overseas.\n  Mr. President, I called upon Secretary Cohen, when I read this \nseries, to immediately stop what we were doing and to take a look. He \ndid it. I want to thank him for his prompt response. He analyzed what \nthey should do, and they made recommendations. But the recommendation \nwas more enforcement of the same old way of doing business. Well, more \nenforcement of the same old way of doing business will still end up \nwith the same old way of doing business--occupational safety dangers, \nenvironmental catastrophes, and a national disgrace.\n\n  So that is why I am introducing my own legislation. The first section \nof the legislation will absolutely ban the shipping, the sending of our \n180 Navy ships overseas to be dismantled in such despicable situations. \nThe other part establishes a pilot project for the U.S. Navy to look at \nhow it could put our ships out for dismantling bids in American \nshipyards that meet environmental and occupational standards. Those \nshipyards, like the ones in my own hometown of Baltimore, that are fit \nfor duty. They know how to build a ship. They know how to convert a \nship. They know how to dismantle a ship.\n  I think the Navy can do better. The Navy has an outstanding record of \ndismantling nuclear submarines. They do it in a particular and unique \nway. They have the ingenuity and the technical competence, but they \nlack the will and the resources. What I hope my legislation will do is \ngive them both the will and the resources to dismantle this in a way \nthat retires our ships with honor. I knew that when the Senate saw \nthose pictures they would be as taken aback as I have been.\n  I thank the Sun paper for their outstanding series in bringing this \nto not only my attention but to America's attention. They won the \nPulitzer Prize. But I want the United States of America to be sure that \nwe win an environmental victory here.\n  So, Mr. President, I am going to be introducing my legislation today \nas we speak. In fact, I send my legislation to the desk and ask that it \nbe referred to the appropriate committees. I just want to close by \nsaying that when we close military bases, we do it the right way, we \npay to clean them up, we close them down and find other basic ways of \nrecycling their use.\n  Every weekend I am around veterans who wear the ships on which they \nsailed. They have the U.S.S. Coral Sea; they have a variety of the \nships that they sailed on. They are proud of those ships, and I am \nproud of those ships. And I am proud of the military. I conclude by \nsaying, I thank Secretary Cohen for his leadership as well as Secretary \nPerry. They have done more environmentally positive things for the \nmilitary than we have ever had done. But this is the next step.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank the Senate for its kind attention.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received and appropriately \nreferred.\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Maryland for her eloquent statement. I appreciate her leadership. \nHer statement this morning is one that I wish the whole country could \nhear. Her leadership and her willingness to be involved in this issue \nis critical to all of us. And I appreciate so much her eloquence and \nthe studious way in which she has pursued this matter.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 2065. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify \nthe tax treatment of Settlement Trusts established pursuant to the \nAlaska Native Claims Settlement Act; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             alaska native settlement trust tax legislation\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator \nStevens in introducing legislation that will allow Alaska Native \nCorporations to establish settlement trusts designed to promote the \nhealth, education, welfare and cultural heritage of Alaska Natives.\n  Mr. President, in 1987, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act was \namended to permit Native Corporations to establish settlement trusts to \nhold lands and investments for the benefit of current and future \ngenerations of Alaska Natives. Assets in these trusts are insulated \nfrom business exposure and risks and can be invested to provide \ndistributions of income to Native shareholders and their future \ngenerations.\n  Although the 1987 amendments were designed to facilitate the \ndevelopment of settlement trusts, many Native Corporations have been \nstymied in their efforts because the tax law, in many cases, imposes \nonerous penalties on the Native shareholders when the trusts are \ncreated. For example, when assets are transferred to the trust, they \nare treated as a de facto distribution of assets directly to the \nshareholders themselves to the extent of the corporation's earnings and \nprofits.\n  Even though the current shareholders receive no actual income at the \ntime of the transfer into the trust, they are liable for income taxes \nas if they received an actual distribution. This not only requires the \nshareholder to come up with money to pay taxes on a distribution he or \nshe never received, but also can result in a situation where a trust \nfund beneficiary is required to prepay taxes on his share of the entire \ntrust corpus, which may be substantially more in taxes than the amount \nof cash benefits he or she will actually receive in the future.\n  Our legislation remedies this inequity by requiring that a \nbeneficiary of a settlement trust will be subject to taxation with \nrespect to assets conveyed to the trust only when the actual \ndistribution is received by the beneficiary. Moreover, the legislation \nprovides that distributions from the trust will be taxable as ordinary \nincome even if the distribution represents a return of capital. In \naddition, to ensure that these trusts do not accumulate excessive \nlevels of the corporation's earnings, the legislation requires that the \ntrust must annually distribute at least 55 percent of their taxable \nincome.\n  Mr. President, Alaska Native Corporations are unique entities. Unlike \nNative American tribes in the lower 48, Alaska Native corporations are \nsubject to income tax. But unlike ordinary C corporations, Alaska \nNative corporations have diverse purposes, one of which is to preserve \nand protect the heritage of the Native shareholders. The settlement \ntrust concept is well suited to the special needs of Alaska's Natives. \nAs the Conference Committee Report to ANSCA amendments of 1987 stated:\n       Trust distributions may be used to fight poverty, provide \n     food, shelter and clothing and served comparable economic \n     welfare purposes. Additionally, cash distributions of trust \n     income may be made on an across-the-board basis to the \n     beneficiary population as part of the economic welfare \n     function.\n\n[[Page S4715]]\n\n  Settlement trusts will ensure that for generations to come, Native \nAlaskans will have a steady stream of income on which to continue \nbuilding an economic base. The current tax rules discourage the \ncreation of such trusts with the result that Native corporations are \nunder extreme pressure to distribute all current earnings rather than \nprudently reinvesting for the future.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that we will be able to see this \nlegislation adopted into law this year. For the long-term benefit of \nAlaska Natives, this tax law change is fundamentally necessary.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAFEE:\n  S. 2066. A bill to reduce exposure to environmental tobacco smoke; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nregarding one small aspect of the national tobacco debate. This bill \naddresses the problem of second-hand smoke, also known as Environmental \nTobacco Smoke, or ETS for short. It is my hope that the ideas contained \nin this bill can be incorporated into any tobacco legislation acted on \nby the Senate.\n  The Committee on Environment and Public Works recently held a hearing \non ETS at which we learned that the principal victims of second-hand \nsmoke are children who live with smokers. Tobacco smoke has devastating \nconsequences for children under 18 months of age. Annually, up to \n15,000 infants are hospitalized for lung infections caused by ETS such \nas bronchitis and pneumonia. These severe lung infections claim the \nlives of hundreds of children each year.\n  Second-hand smoke is also responsible for less severe lung infections \nin 300,000 infants, 26,000 new cases of asthma among children, millions \nof middle ear infections, and roughly half the cases of Sudden Infant \nDeath Syndrome (SIDS). These preventable illnesses, but 40 percent of \nchildren in one multi-State study were found to be routinely exposed to \ntobacco smoke.\n  The bill I am introducing today would assign some of the funds \ncollected under any national tobacco settlement approved by Congress to \na state grant program to educate parents about the dangers of smoking \nin the home. The statistics I just recited are not widely known by \nparents. Once aware of the profound risk ETS poses for their child, \nmost parents will go to great lengths to protect their child, and I \nbelieve that even includes parents who smoke.\n  With the grant funds from this bill, States could provide information \nabout ETS to pediatricians and other child care professionals for \ndistribution to parents. States also could develop advertising aimed at \nparents. We only need to arm parents with information. They will do the \nrest.\n  This bill has a few other provisions. It affirmatively states that \nthere is no federal preemption of State or local efforts to address \nETS. It would ban smoking on international flights that originate or \nterminate in the United States. It also would extend and codify the \nPresident's Executive Order banning smoking in federal buildings. My \ngood friend, Senator Warner, in his capacity as Chairman of the Senate \nRules Committee, is working to ban smoking from the public areas of the \nSenate. I applaud this effort and encourage my colleagues to support \nit. My legislation would complement his efforts in other federal \nbuildings.\n  This bill does not address the question of smoking in private \nworkplaces. Up to 3,000 adults die each year from lung cancer caused by \nETS. Because of this statistic, some have argued that the federal \ngovernment should ban smoking in nearly every building in the nation. \nMost legislative proposals on this issue would subject every dress shop \nand church hall in the nation to federal smoking regulations.\n  Ironically, most of those bills exempt bars and restaurants and other \nplaces where smoking can be common. That means they ignore the few \nplaces where employees faced a substantial threat from ETS while \nregulating every other workplace. I believe that there is a more \nefficient way to address workplaces with dangerous levels of ETS.\n  We should allow State and local governments to take the lead on this \nmatter, but we also should help them to solve the problem. Some towns \nand States have taken action already. We can encourage more of them to \ndo so by expanding the grant program described in my bill to reward \nStates that reduce dangerous levels of ETS in the workplace. Incentive \ngrants would allow States to tailor their solutions to address local \nconcerns. Some States could seek a gradual ban while others may \nestablish protective ventilation standards.\n  Any rule that requires changing a habit as deeply ingrained as \nsmoking will be met with resistance. In contrast to a federal one-size-\nfits-all approach, State and local efforts can be tailored more easily \nto local concerns, and will, therefore, be more effective.\n  I did not address smoking in the workplace in my bill because I hope \nto work with other interested members to develop language that will be \nsupportable on both sides of the aisle. Such a provision must both \navoid rigid federal mandates and provide real incentives for States to \naddress those workplaces with dangerous levels of ETS. I will continue \nto work with interested parties in an effort to devise such a \nprovision. In the meantime, I wanted to offer the balance of my \nproposal for the Senate's consideration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ASHCROFT (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Burns, Mr. Craig, \n        Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Kempthorne, Mrs. \n        Murray, and Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 2067. A bill to protect the privacy and constitutional rights of \nAmericans, to establish standards and procedures regarding law \nenforcement access to decryption assistance for encrypted \ncommunications and stored electronic information, to affirm the rights \nof Americans to use and sell encryption products, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                           the e-privacy act\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to speak today on an issue that I \nfind very important to the future of this country's leading position in \nthe technology, and that is encryption. This issue has been under \nconsideration since I first came to Capitol Hill, and for more than \nthree years nothing has been accomplished by way of assistance to law \nenforcement, or to industry, or most importantly to the users of \nencryption in this country.\n  My first involvement in this entire discussion came about as a result \nof the need for protection and privacy. If we are to operate at our \nhighest and best in the information age, instead of settling for \nsomething very far below our potential, we are going to need privacy \nand protection, and we are going to need the ability to operate with \nintegrity on the Internet. The Internet has to be something more than \nspeaking on the public square, it has to have the ability to allow \nindividuals to communicate with each other. It has to have the same \nkind of rights and protections that are accorded to other aspects of \ncommunication. Without this privacy, the potential of the Internet is \ndestroyed. In my judgment, the Internet would be destined to become \njust a sort of international bull session, nothing more than an \ninternational party line of commentary, or an international broadcast \ndevice. I do not believe it will fulfill its potential as a \ncommunication, entertainment, commercial and educational opportunity \nunless Internet communications are secure and the right of privacy is \nrespected.\n  The Internet allows for the most participatory form of communications \never. In order for us to be able to both invite participation by \neveryone, and to be able to take advantage of it, we have to be able to \nexclude some parties from a particular communication. I do not know of \nany more successful exclusion technique in the electronic world than \nencryption, especially when so much information is going to be \ntransmitted digitally, much of it through space as well as over hard \nlines of communication.\n  We have a tremendous potential for commerce on the Internet: \neverything from selling clothes, to real estate, to software itself. \nElectronic commerce has not reached its full potential, but it can. I \nthink we've got a big agenda there, not just encryption but we've got \nto have legally binding signature legislation and therefore solid \nencryption.\n\n[[Page S4716]]\n\n  Resisting efforts for mandatory domestic key recovery is also \ncrucial. We have to remind ourselves that the Internet is like so much \nof the rest of the culture--government can't solve all the problems. At \nleast we have to plead for restraint by those who would harm this \ntechnology. As I have said before, now is the time to draw a bright \nline against federal regulation of the computer industry. Washington \nmust not start down the road of dreaming up regulations to fix problems \nthat may or may not exist. Two things can be predicted with confidence \nabout congressional meddling in this sector of the economy. First, \nlegislation will be obsolete on the day it is passed. Second, it will \nhurt consumers, workers, shareholders, and the economy. If Congress had \nhelped set up the transportation industry, there still might be a \nlivery stable in every town, and buggy whip factories in large cities.\n  The irrationality of limiting the United States to levels of \nencryption which are far below what the world market is demanding and \nsupplying in other settings, has been mind boggling. This legislation \ndeclares that American companies will be full and active participants \nin the encryption industry. Today, numerous editions of leading \nAmerican designed and manufactured software bears the stamp, ``Not for \nsale outside the United States,'' because the software features robust \nencryption. That stamp does nothing to make Americans more secure, but \nit does provide aid and comfort to foreign competitors of American \nbusiness. This legislation would eliminate that stamp once and for all.\n  Encryption, of course, is the most important issue to the future of \nelectronic commerce and if we are to foster the integrity of the \nInternet we must have the means of communication domestically and \ninternational. I have to reaffirm that we must allow the software \nindustry to compete in an international market where robust encryption \nalready takes place. Months ago I went to a Commerce Committee meeting \nand took with me an ad from the Internet, which was from Seimens \ncompany in Germany advertising robust 128 bit encryption, saying that \nyou can't get this from a U.S. manufacturer. The advertisement also \nindicated, however, that if you buy this you can use it in the United \nStates and you can use it overseas as well, and, so if you want to have \nrobust encryption buy it from Seimens. The Administration has decided \nto tie the hands of the U.S. encryption industry. To me that's a \ndisaster, but it is also compounded by people beginning to develop \nrelationships with foreign software providers as a result of the \nunavailability of 128 bit or robust encryption on the part of U.S. \nproviders.\n  To see the Germans eagerly promoting this potential, and to have \npeople from my own jurisdiction, from the state of Missouri, say, \n``John, we have an office in Singapore, we have to be able to speak \nwith them confidentially and communicate with them, and the government \nis making it impossible for us to send the encryption that we can use \ndomestically. We can't send it to our office in Singapore because we \nare ineligible to export it.'' I don't want the situation to be such \nthat I have to say, ``Well, go to Seimens in Germany.'' From Seimens \nyou can buy the encryption that can be sent into the United States and \nfrom Seimens in Germany it can be sent to Singapore and so you can have \nyour cake and eat it too by dealing with a non-domestic firm. For us to \nhave a policy which provides for the slitting of our own throats, in a \ntechnology arena, where we have held the lead and must continue to hold \nthe lead, I think is foolhardy to say the least. If we are to mark the \nnext century as an ``American Century,'' or even to celebrate this week \nas high technology week in the Senate, we must be forward thinking and \nacting. This bill moves us away from antiquated export laws to a future \nin which American companies will be able to compete in the \ninternational marketplace without having one hand tied behind their \nback by the federal government.\n  This bill also clarifies the proper approach for encryption \ndomestically as we move ahead in the digital age. The Administration \nand the FBI first indicated support for language that would mandate key \nrecovery for all domestic encryption and now support several suggested \napproaches that would make using domestic key escrow a practical--\nthough not legal--necessity. Director Freeh has gone so far as to \nmention the need for a new Fourth Amendment that considers the \nrealities of the digital age. I think we need a new and improved \napproach to domestic encryption, not a new updated version of the \nFourth Amendment. I, for one, am not eagerly awaiting the FBI's new \nrelease of Fourth Amendment 2.0 or First Amendment '98.\n  I think we have to work together to find a reasonable alternative to \nthe current Administration policy and I think we have to ensure secure \ntransactions. That's a clear responsibility. We can't have a situation \nwhere we don't have security and integrity in our business \ntransactions. We have to be able to compete effectively in a worldwide \nmarketplace. For us to limit our own potential in terms of competition \nmakes no sense. We have to make sure that we don't allow those who \nwould use information improperly or illegally to have access to it. \nThat has to do with securing the transactions, and the integrity of the \nInternet as well.\n  This legislation is the solution to the problem. It is well thought \nout and attempts to address the legitimate concerns of all affected \nparties. I will seek passage of this legislation in this Congress and \nwill commit the resources of my office that may be needed to achieve \nthis end.\n  Business Week has recently reported that 61 percent of adults \nresponded that they would be more likely to go on-line if the privacy \nof their information and communications would be protected. Mr. \nPresident, simply put, strong encryption means a strong economy. \nMandatory access, by contrast, means weaker encryption and a less \nsecure, and therefore less valuable, network.\n  I ask for unanimous consent that the entire bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2067\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Ashcroft, and \nothers, in introducing today the ``Encryption Protects the Rights of \nIndividuals from Violation and Abuse in Cyberspace,'' or E-PRIVACY Act, \nto reform our nation's cryptography policy in a constructive and \npositive manner. It is time the Administration woke up to the critical \nneed for a common sense encryption policy in this country.\n  I have been sounding the alarm bells about this issue for several \nyears now, and have introduced encryption legislation, with bipartisan \nsupport, in the last Congress and again in this one, to balance the \nimportant privacy, economic, national security and law enforcement \ninterests at stake. The volume of those alarm bells should be raised to \nemergency sirens.\n  Hardly a month goes by without press reports of serious breaches of \ncomputer security that threaten our critical infrastructures, including \nDefense Department computer systems, the telephone network, or computer \nsystems for airport control towers. The lesson of these computer \nbreaches--often committed by computer savvy teenagers--is that all the \nphysical barriers we might put in place can be circumvented using the \nwires that run into every building to support the computers and \ncomputer networks that are the mainstay of how we do business. A well-\nfocused cyber-attack on the computer networks that support \ntelecommunications, transportation, water supply, banking, electrical \npower and other critical infrastructure systems could wreak havoc on \nour national economy or even jeopardize our national defense or public \nsafety.\n  We have been aware of the vulnerabilities of our computer networks \nfor some time. It became clear to me almost a decade ago, during \nhearings I chaired of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Technology and the \nLaw on the risks of high-tech terrorism, that merely ``hardening'' our \nphysical space from potential attack is not enough. We must also \n``harden'' our critical infrastructures to ensure our security and our \nsafety.\n  That is where encryption technology comes in. Encryption can protect \nthe security of our computer information and networks. Indeed, both \nformer Senator Sam Nunn and former Deputy Attorney General Jamie \nGorelick, who serve as co-chairs of the Advisory Committee to the \nPresident's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection, have \ntestified that ``encryption is essential for infrastructure \nprotection.''\n  Yet U.S. encryption policy has acted as a deterrent to better \nsecurity. As long ago as 1988, at the High-Tech Terrorism hearings I \nchaired, Jim Woolsey, who later became the director of the Central \nIntelligence Agency, testified about the need to do a better job of \nusing encryption to protect our computer networks. Of particular \nconcern is the recent testimony of former Senator Sam Nunn that the \n``continuing federal government-private sector deadlock over encryption \nand export policies'' may pose an obstacle to the cooperation needed to \nprotect our country's critical infrastructures.\n  I have long advocated the use of strong encryption by individuals, \ngovernment agencies and private companies to protect their valuable and \nconfidential computer information. Moreover, as more Americans every \nyear use the Internet and other computer networks to obtain critical \nmedical services, and conduct their personal and business affairs, \nmaintaining the privacy and confidentiality of our computer \ncommunications both here and abroad has only grown in importance. As an \navid computer user and Internet surfer myself, I care deeply about \nprotecting individual privacy and encouraging the development of the \nInternet as a secure and trusted communications medium.\n  Encryption is the key to protecting the privacy of our online \ncommunications and electronic records by ensuring that only the people \nwe choose can read those communications and records. That is why the \nprimary thrust of the encryption legislation I have introduced is to \nencourage--and not stand in the way of--the widespread use of strong \nencryption.\n  Strong encryption serves as a crime prevention shield to stop \nhackers, industrial spies and thieves from snooping into private \ncomputer files and stealing valuable proprietary information. \nUnfortunately, we still have a long away to go to reform our country's \nencryption policy to reflect that this technology is a significant \ncrime and terrorism prevention tool.\n  Even as our law enforcement and intelligence agencies try to slow \ndown the widespread use of strong encryption, technology continues to \nmove forward. Ironically, foot-dragging by the Administration on export \ncontrols is driving encryption technology, expertise and manufacturing \noverseas where we will lose even more control over its proliferation.\n  Indeed, due to the sorry state of our export controls on encryption, \nwe are seeing rising numbers of our high-tech companies turning to \noverseas firms as suppliers of the strong encryption demanded by their \ncustomers. For example, Network Associates recently announced that it \nwill make strong encryption software developed in the United States \navailable through a Swiss company. Other companies, including Sun \nMicrosystems, are cooperating with foreign firms to manufacture and \ndistribute overseas strong encryption software originally developed \nhere at home.\n  Encryption technology, invented with American ingenuity, will now be \nmanufactured and distributed in Europe, and imported back into this \ncountry.\n  Driving encryption expertise overseas is extremely short-sighted and \nposes a real threat to our national security. Driving high-tech jobs \noverseas is a threat to our economic security, and stifling the \nwidespread, integrated use of strong encryption is a threat to our \npublic safety. The E-PRIVACY Act would reverse the incentives for \nAmerican companies to look abroad for strong encryption by relaxing our \nexport controls.\n  Specifically, the bill would grant export license exceptions, after a \none-time technical review, for mass market products with encryption \ncapabilities,\n\n[[Page S4722]]\n\nproducts which do not themselves provide encryption but are capable of \ninteroperating with encryption products, and customized hardware and \nsoftware with encryption capabilities so long as foreign products with \ncomparable encryption are available.\n  At the same time, the bill retains important restrictions on \nencryption exports for military end-uses or to terrorist-designated or \nembargoed countries, such as Cuba and North Korea. It also affirms the \ncontinued authority of the Secretary of Commerce over encryption \nexports and assures that before export, the Secretary is able to \nconduct a one-time technical review of all encryption products to \nensure that the product works as represented.\n  The E-PRIVACY Act puts to rest the specter of domestic controls on \nencryption. This legislation bars government-mandated key recovery (or \nkey escrow encryption) and ensures that all computer users are free to \nchoose any encryption method to protect the privacy of their online \ncommunications and computer files.\n  At the heart of the encryption debate is the power this technology \ngives computer users to choose who may access their communications and \nstored records, to the exclusion of all others. For the same reason \nthat encryption is a powerful privacy enhancing tool, it also poses \nchallenges for law enforcement. Law enforcement agencies want access \neven when we do not choose to give it. We are mindful of these national \nsecurity and law enforcement concerns that have dictated the \nAdministration's policy choices on encryption.\n  With the appropriate procedural safeguards in place, law enforcement \nagencies should be able to get access to decryption assistance. The E-\nPRIVACY Act contains a number of provisions designed to address these \nconcerns, including a new criminal offense for willful use of \nencryption to hide incriminating evidence from law enforcement \ndetection, establishment of a NET Center to help federal, state and \nlocal law enforcement stay abreast of advanced technologies, and \nexplicit procedures for law enforcement to obtain decryption assistance \nfrom third parties for encrypted communications or records to which law \nenforcement has lawful access.\n  One of the starkest deficiencies in the Administration's key recovery \nproposals has always been the question of foreign government access. \nThe Administration has sought reciprocal relationships with foreign \ngovernments as a critical part of an effective global key recovery \nsystem. Yet many Americans and American companies are rightfully \nconcerned about the terms under which foreign governments would get \naccess to decryption assistance. The E-PRIVACY Act makes clear what \nthose terms will be and ensures that foreign governments will not get \naccess to private decryption keys, but only, at most, plaintext.\n  This is not just an important issue for the privacy and security of \nAmericans; it also is a significant human rights issue. Today, human \nrights organizations worldwide are using encryption to protect their \nwork and the lives of investigators, witnesses and victims overseas. \nAmnesty International uses it. Human Rights Watch uses it. The human \nrights program in the American Association for the Advancement of \nScience uses it. It is used to protect witnesses who report human \nrights abuses in the Balkans, in Burma, in Guatemala, in Tibet. I have \nbeen told about a number of other instances in which strong encryption \nhas been used to further the causes of democracy and human rights.\n\n  For example, in the ongoing trial of Argentinean military officers in \nSpain, on charges of genocide and terrorism arising out of the ``dirty \nwar,'' the human rights group Derechos uses the encryption program \nPretty Good Privacy (PGP)--which the United States government tried to \nkeep out of the hands of foreigners--to encrypt particularly \nconfidential messages that go between Spain and Argentina, to stop the \nArgentinean intelligence forces from being able to read them and so try \nto jeopardize the trial.\n  A group in Guatemala is using a computer database to track the names \nof witnesses to military massacres. A South African organization keeps \nthe names of applicants for amnesty for political crimes carried out in \nSouth Africa during the apartheid regime. Workers at both groups could \nbe subject to intimidation, harassment, or murder by those intent on \npreventing the public discussion and analysis of the claims. Both \nsystems are protected by strong cryptography.\n  A not-for-profit agency working for human rights in the Balkans uses \nPGP to protect all sensitive files. Its offices have been raided by \nvarious police forces looking for evidence of ``subversive \nactivities.'' Last year in Zagreb, security police raided its office \nand confiscated its computers in the hope of retrieving information \nabout the identity of people who had complained about human rights \nabuses by the authorities. PGP allowed the group to communicate and \nprotect its files from any attempt to gain access. The director of the \norganization spent 13 days in prison for not opening his encrypted \nfiles but has said ``it was a very small price to pay for protecting \nour clients.''\n  The Iraqi National Congress, a group opposing Saddam Hussein with \noffices in London and supporters inside Iraq, uses encrypted e-mail to \ncommunicate with its supporters inside Iraq. (Non-governmental Internet \nconnections are banned in Iraq, but the dissidents within Iraq access \ne-mail by dialing outside the country with satellite telephones).\n  Burmese human rights activists working in the relative safe haven of \nThailand use encryption when communicating on-line, because the Thai \ngovernment maintains diplomatic relations with the Burmese government \nand is expected to turn over information to the Burmese authorities.\n  The FBI has argued that lives may be lost in sensitive terrorist and \nother investigations if government agencies do not have access to \nprivate encryption keys. However, the reverse is equally true: weak \nencryption or easy government access to decryption assistance could \njeopardize lives as well.\n  Finally, the E-PRIVACY Act contains provisions to enhance the privacy \nprotections for communications, even when encryption is not employed. \nSpecifically, the bill would require law enforcement to obtain a court \norder based on probable cause before using a cellular telephone as a \ntracking device. In addition, the bill would require law enforcement \nagencies to obtain a court order or provide notice when seizing \nelectronic records that a person stores on a computer network rather \nthan on the hard drive of his or her own personal computer. Finally, \nthe bill grants Federal judges authority to evaluate the reasons \nproffered by a prosecutor for issuance of an ex parte pen register or \ntrap and trace device order, by contrast to their mere ministerial \nauthority under current law.\n  In sum, the E-PRIVACY Act accomplishes the eight goals that Senator \nAshcroft and I set out during our April 2, 1998, colloquy on the floor. \nSpecifically, we sought to craft legislation that promotes the \nfollowing principles:\n  First, ensure the right of Americans to choose how to protect the \nprivacy and security of their communications and information;\n  Second, bar a government-mandated key escrow encryption system;\n  Third, establish both procedures and standards for access by law \nenforcement to decryption keys or decryption assistance for both \nencrypted communications and stored electronic information and only \npermit such access upon court order authorization, with appropriate \nnotice and other procedural safeguards;\n  Fourth, establish both procedures and standards for access by foreign \ngovernments and foreign law enforcement agencies to the plaintext of \nencrypted communications and stored electronic information of United \nStates persons;\n  Fifth, modify the current export regime for encryption to promote the \nglobal competitiveness of American companies;\n  Sixth, avoid linking the use of certificate authorities with key \nrecovery agents or, in other words, not link the use of encryption for \nconfidentiality purposes with use of encryption for authenticity and \nintegrity purposes;\n  Seventh, consistent with these goals of promoting privacy and the \nglobal competitiveness of our high-tech industries, help our law \nenforcement agencies and national security agencies deal with the \nchallenges posed by the use of encryption; and\n\n[[Page S4723]]\n\n  Eighth, protect the security and privacy of information provided by \nAmericans to the government by ensuring that encryption products used \nby the government interoperate with commercial encryption products.\n  Resolving the encryption debate is critical for our economy, our \nnational security and our privacy. This is not a partisan issue. This \nis not a black-and-white issue of being either for law enforcement and \nnational security or for Internet freedom. Characterizing the debate in \nthese simplistic terms is neither productive nor accurate.\n  Delays in resolving the encryption debate hurt most the very public \nsafety and national security interests that are posed as obstacles to \nresolving this issue. We need sensible solutions in legislation that \nwill not be subject to change at the whim of agency bureaucrats.\n  Every American, not just those in the software and high-tech \nindustries and not just those in law enforcement agencies, has a stake \nin the outcome of this debate. We have a legislative stalemate right \nnow that needs to be resolved, and I hope to work closely with my \ncolleagues and the Administration on a solution.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the sectional summary for the ``E-\nPRIVACY Act'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Section-by-Section Analysis of E-Privacy Act\n\n       Sec. 1. Short Title.--The Act may be cited as the \n     ``Encryption Protects the Rights of Individuals from \n     Violation and Abuse in CYberspace (E-PRIVACY) Act.''\n       Sec. 2 Purposes.--The Act would ensure that Americans have \n     the maximum possible choice in encryption methods to protect \n     the security, confidentiality and privacy of their lawful \n     wire and electronic communications and stored electronic \n     information. The Act would also promote the privacy and \n     constitutional rights of individuals and organizations and \n     the security of critical information infrastructures. \n     Finally, the Act would establish privacy standards and \n     procedures for law enforcement officers to follow to obtain \n     decryption assistance for encrypted communications and \n     information.\n       Sec. 3 Findings.--The Act enumerates sixteen congressional \n     findings, including that a secure, private and trusted \n     national and global information infrastructure is essential \n     to promote citizens' privacy, economic growth and meet the \n     needs of both American citizens and businesses, that \n     encryption technology widely available worldwide can help \n     meet those needs, that Americans should be free to use, and \n     American businesses free to compete and sell, encryption \n     technology, programs and products, and that there is a need \n     to develop a national encryption policy to advance the global \n     information infrastructure and preserve Americans' right to \n     privacy and the Nation's public safety and national security.\n       Sec. 4 Definitions.--The terms ``agency'', ``person'', \n     ``remote computing service'' and ``state'' have the same \n     meaning given those terms in specified sections of title 18, \n     United States Code.\n       Additional definitions are provided for the following \n     terms:\n       The terms ``encrypt'' and ``encryption'' mean the use of \n     mathematical formulas or algorithms to scramble or descramble \n     electronic data or communications for purposes of \n     confidentiality, integrity, or authenticity. As defined, the \n     terms cover a broad range of scrambling techniques and \n     applications including cryptographic applications such as PGP \n     or RSA's encryption algorithms; stegonagraphy; \n     authentication; and winnowing and chafing.\n       The term ``encryption product'' includes any hardware, \n     software, devices, or other technology with encryption \n     capabilities, whether or not offered for sale or \n     distribution. A particular encryption product includes \n     subsequent versions of the product, if the encryption \n     capabilities remain the same.\n       The term ``exportable'' means the ability to transfer, \n     ship, or transmit to foreign users. The term includes the \n     ability to electronically transmit via the Internet.\n       The term ``key'' means the variable information used in or \n     produced by a mathematical formula to encrypt or decrypt wire \n     or electronic communications, or electronically stored \n     information.\n       The term ``technical review'' means a review by the \n     Secretary of Commerce based on information about a product's \n     encryption capabilities supplied by the manufacturer that an \n     encryption product works as represented.\n\n\n     title i--privacy protection for communications and electronic \n                              information\n\n       Sec. 101. Freedom to use Encryption.\n       (a) In General.--The Act legislatively confirms current \n     practice in the United States that any person in this country \n     may lawfully use any encryption method, regardless of \n     encryption algorithm, key length, existence of key recovery \n     or other plaintext access capability, or implementation \n     selected. Specifically, the Act states the freedom of any \n     person in the U.S., as well as U.S. persons in a foreign \n     country, to make, use, import, and distribute any encryption \n     product without regard to its strength or the use of key \n     recovery, subject to the other provisions of the Act.\n       (b) Prohibition on Government-Compelled Key Escrow or Key \n     Recovery Encryption.--The Act prohibits any federal or state \n     agency from compelling the use of key recovery systems or \n     other plaintext access systems. Agencies may not set \n     standards, or condition approval or benefits, to compel use \n     of these systems. U.S. agencies may not require persons to \n     use particular key recovery products for interaction with the \n     government. These prohibitions do not apply to systems for \n     use solely for the internal operations and telecommunications \n     systems of a U.S. or a State government agency.\n       (c) Use of Encryption For Authentication or Integrity \n     Purposes.--The Act requires that the use of encryption \n     products shall be voluntary and market-driven, and no federal \n     or state agency may link the use of encryption for \n     authentication or identity (such as through certificate \n     authority and digital signature systems) to the use of \n     encryption for confidentiality purposes. For example, some \n     Administration proposals would condition receipt of a digital \n     certificate from a licensed certificate authority on the use \n     of key recovery. Such conditions would be prohibited.\n       Sec. 102. Purchase and Use of Encryption Products by the \n     Federal Government.--The Act authorizes agencies of the \n     United States to purchase encryption products for internal \n     governmental operations and telecommunications systems. To \n     ensure that secure electronic access to the Government is \n     available to persons outside of and not operating under \n     contract with Federal agencies, the Act requires that any key \n     recovery features in encryption products used by the \n     Government interoperate with commercial encryption products.\n       Sec. 103. Enhanced Privacy Protection For Electronic \n     Records on Computer Networks.--The Act adds a new subsection \n     (g) to section 2703 of title 18, United States Code, to \n     extend privacy protections to electronic information stored \n     on computer networks.\n       Under United States v. Miller, 425 U.S. 435 (1976) \n     (customer has no standing to object to bank disclosure of \n     customer records) and its progeny, records in the possession \n     of third parties do not receive Fourth Amendment protection. \n     When held in a person's home, such records can only be seized \n     pursuant to a warrant based upon probable cause, or compelled \n     under a subpoena which can be challenged and quashed. In both \n     these instances, the record owner has notice of the search \n     and an opportunity to challenge it. By contrast, production \n     of records held by third parties can be compelled by a \n     governmental agent with a subpoena to the third party holding \n     the information, without notice to the person to whom the \n     records belong or pertain. The record owner may never receive \n     notice or any meaningful opportunity to challenge the \n     production.\n       This lack of protection for records held by third parties \n     presents new privacy problems in the information age. With \n     the rise of network computing, electronic information that \n     was previously held on a person's own computer is \n     increasingly stored elsewhere, such as on a network server or \n     an ISP's computers. In many cases the location of such \n     information is not even known to the record's owner.\n       The Act amends section 2703 to extend the same privacy \n     protections to a person's records whether storage takes place \n     on that person's personal computer in their possession or in \n     networked electronic storage. The term ``networked electronic \n     storage'' applies to electronic records held by a third \n     party, who is not authorized to access the contents of the \n     record except in connection with providing storage services, \n     and where the person who created the record is able to access \n     and modify the record remotely through electronic means. \n     Electronic data stored incident to transmission (such as e-\n     mail) and covered under 2703(a) is not included.\n       The new section 2703(g) requires that a governmental entity \n     may only require disclosure of electronic records in \n     ``networked electronic storage'' pursuant to (i) a state or \n     federal warrant (based upon probable cause), with a copy to \n     be served on the record owner at the same time the warrant \n     is served on the record holder; (ii) a subpoena that must \n     also be served on the record owner with a meaningful \n     opportunity to challenge the subpoena; or (iii) the \n     consent of the record owner.\n       Sec. 104. Government Access to Location Information.--The \n     Act adds a new subsection (h) to section 2703 of title 18, \n     United States Code, to extend privacy protections for \n     physical location information generated on a real time basis \n     by mobile electronic communications services, such as \n     cellular telephones. This section requires that when cellular \n     telephones are used as contemporaneous tracking devices, the \n     physical location information generated by the service \n     provider may only be released to a governmental entity \n     pursuant to a court order based upon probable cause.\n       Sec. 105. Enhanced Privacy Protection for Transactional \n     Information Obtained From Pen Registers or Trap and Trace \n     Devices.--The Act enhances privacy protections for \n     information obtained from pen register and trap and trace \n     devices by amending section 3123(a) of title 18, United \n     States\n\n[[Page S4724]]\n\n     Code. This amendment would not change the standard for \n     issuance of an ex parte order authorizing use of a pen \n     register or trap and trace device, but would grant a court \n     authority to review the information presented in a \n     certification by the prosecuting attorney to determine \n     whether the information likely to be obtained is relevant to \n     an ongoing criminal investigation. Under current law, the \n     court is relegated to a mere ministerial function and must \n     issue the order upon presentation of a certification.\n       In addition, the amendment requires law enforcement to \n     minimize the information obtained from the pen register or \n     trap and trace device that is not related to the dialing and \n     signaling information utilized in call processing. Currently, \n     such devices capture not just such dialing information but \n     also any other dialed digits after a call has been completed.\n\n\n                  TITLE II--LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSISTANCE\n\n       Sec. 201. Encrypted Wire or Electronic Communications and \n     Stored Electronic Communications.--The Act adds a new chapter \n     124 to Title 18, Part I, governing the unlawful use of \n     encryption, protections and standards for governmental \n     access, including foreign governments, to decryption \n     assistance from third parties, and establishment of a ``Net \n     Center'' to assist law enforcement in dealing with advanced \n     technologies, such as encryption.\n       (a) In General.--New chapter 124 has six sections. This \n     chapter applies to wire or electronic communications and \n     communications in electronic storage, as defined in 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2510, and to stored electronic data. Thus, this chapter \n     describes procedures for law enforcement to obtain assistance \n     in decrypting encrypted electronic mail messages, encrypted \n     telephone conversations, encrypted facsimile transmissions, \n     encrypted computer transmissions and encrypted file transfers \n     over the Internet that are lawfully intercepted pursuant to a \n     wiretap order, under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2518, or obtained \n     pursuant to lawful process, under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2703, and \n     encrypted information stored on computers that are seized \n     pursuant to a search warrant or other lawful process.\n       Sec. 2801. Definitions.--Generally, the terms used in the \n     new chapter have the same meanings as in the federal wiretap \n     statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2510. Definitions are provided for \n     ``decryption assistance'', ``decryption key'', ``encrypt; \n     encryption'', ``foreign government'' and ``official \n     request''.\n       Sec. 2802. Unlawful use of encryption.--This section \n     creates a new federal crime for knowingly and willfully using \n     encryption during the commission of a Federal felony offense, \n     with the intent to conceal that information for the purpose \n     of avoiding detection by law enforcement. This new offense \n     would be subject to a fine and up to 5 years' imprisonment \n     for a first offense, and up to 10 years' imprisonment for a \n     second or subsequent offense.\n       Sec. 2803. Access to decryption assistance for \n     communications.--In the United States today, decryption keys \n     and other decryption assistance held by third parties \n     constitute third party records and may be disclosed to a \n     governmental entity with a subpoena or an administrative \n     request, and without any notice to the owner of the encrypted \n     data. Such a low standard of access creates new problems in \n     the information age because encryption users rely heavily on \n     the integrity of keys to protect personal information or \n     sensitive trade secrets, even when those keys are placed in \n     the hands of trusted agents for recovery purposes.\n       Under new section 2803, in criminal investigations a third \n     party holding decryption keys or other decryption assistance \n     for wire or electronic communications may be required to \n     release such assistance pursuant to a court order, if the \n     court issuing the order finds that such assistance is needed \n     for the decryption of communications covered by the order. \n     Specifically, such an order for decryption assistance may be \n     issued upon a finding that the key or assistance is necessary \n     to decrypt communications or stored data lawfully intercepted \n     or seized. The standard for release of the key or provision \n     of decryption assistance is tied directly to the problem at \n     hand: the need to decrypt a message or information that the \n     government is otherwise authorized to intercept or obtain.\n       This will ensure that third parties holding decryption keys \n     or decryption information need respond to only one type of \n     compulsory process--a court order. Moreover, this Act will \n     set a single standard for law enforcement, removing any extra \n     burden on law enforcement to demonstrate, for example, \n     probable cause for two separate orders (i.e., for the \n     encrypted communications or information and for decryption \n     assistance) and possibly before two different judges (i.e., \n     the judge issuing the order for the encrypted communications \n     or information and the judge issuing the order to the third \n     party able to provide decryption assistance).\n       The Act reinforces the principle of minimization. The \n     decryption assistance provided is limited to the minimum \n     necessary to access the particular communications or \n     information specified by court order. Under some key recovery \n     schemes, release of a key holder's private key--rather than \n     an individual session key--might provide the ability to \n     decrypt every communication or stored file ever encrypted by \n     a particular key owner, or by every user in an entire \n     corporation, or by every user who was ever a customer of the \n     key holder. The Act protects against such over broad releases \n     of keys by requiring the court issuing the order to find that \n     the decryption assistance being sought is necessary. Private \n     keys may only be released if no other form of decryption \n     assistance is available.\n       Notice of the assistance given will be included as part of \n     the inventory provided to subjects of the interception \n     pursuant to current wiretap law standards.\n       For foreign intelligence investigations, new section 2803 \n     allows FISA orders to direct third-party holders to release \n     decryption assistance if the court finds the assistance is \n     needed to decrypt covered communications. Minimization is \n     also required, though no notice is provided to the target of \n     the investigation.\n       Under new section 2803, decryption assistance is only \n     required under third-parties (i.e., other than those whose \n     communications are the subject of interception), thereby \n     avoiding self-incrimination problems.\n       Finally, new section 2803 generally prohibits any person \n     from providing decryption assistance for another person's \n     communications to a governmental entity, except pursuant to \n     the orders described.\n       Sec. 2804. Access to decryption assistance for stored \n     electronic communications or records.--New section 2804 \n     governs access to decryption assistance for stored electronic \n     communications and records.\n       As noted above, under current law third party decryption \n     assistance may be disclosed to a governmental entity with a \n     subpoena or even a mere request and without notice. This \n     standard is particularly problematic for stored encrypted \n     data, which may exist in insecure media but rely on \n     encryption to maintain security; in such cases easy access to \n     keys destroys the encryption security so heavily relied upon.\n       Under new section 2804, third parties holding decryption \n     keys or other decryption assistance for stored electronic \n     communications may only release such assistance to a \n     governmental entity pursuant to (1) a state or federal \n     warrant (based upon probable cause), with a copy to be served \n     on the record owner at the same time the warrant is served on \n     the record holder; (2) a subpoena that must also be served on \n     the record owner with a meaningful opportunity to challenge \n     the subpoena; or (3) the consent of the record owner. This \n     standard closely mirrors the protection that would be \n     afforded to encryption keys that are actually kept in the \n     possession of those whose records were encrypted. In the \n     specific case of decryption assistance for communications \n     stored incident to transit (such as e-mail), notice may be \n     delayed under the standards laid out for delayed notice under \n     current law in section 2705(a)(2) of title 18, United States \n     Code.\n       Sec. 2805. Foreign government access to decryption \n     assistance.--New section 2805 creates standards for the U.S. \n     government to provide decryption assistance to foreign \n     governments. No law enforcement officer would be permitted to \n     release decryption keys to a foreign government, but only to \n     provide decryption assistance in the form of producing \n     plaintext. No officer would be permitted to provide \n     decryption assistance except upon an order requested by the \n     Attorney General or designee. Such an order could require the \n     production of decryption keys or assistance to the Attorney \n     General only if the court finds that (1) the assistance is \n     necessary to decrypt data the foreign government is \n     authorized to intercept under foreign law; (2) the foreign \n     country's laws provide ``adequate protection against \n     arbitrary interference with respect to privacy rights''; and \n     (3) the assistance is sought for a criminal investigation of \n     conduct that would violate U.S. criminal law if committed in \n     the United States.\n       Sec. 2806. Establishment and operations of National \n     Electronic Technologies Center.--This section establishes a \n     National Electronic Technologies Center (``NET Center'') to \n     serve as a focal point for information and assistance to \n     federal, state, and local law enforcement authorities to \n     address the technical difficulties of obtaining plaintext of \n     communications and electronic information through the use of \n     encryption, steganography, compression, multiplexing, and \n     other techniques.\n\n\n               title iii--exports of encryption products\n\n       Sec. 301. Commercial Encryption Products.\n       (a) Provisions Applicable to Commercial Products.--This \n     title applies to all encryption products other than those \n     specifically designed or modified for military use.\n       (b) Control by Secretary of Commerce.--This section grants \n     exclusive authority to the Secretary of Commerce (the \n     ``Secretary'') to control commercial encryption product \n     exports.\n       Sec. 302. License Exception for Mass Market Products.\n       (a) Export Control Relief.--The Act permits export under a \n     license exception of generally available, mass market, \n     encryption products, which by their nature are uncontrollable \n     given the volume sold and ease of distribution, without a \n     license or restrictions, other than those permitted under \n     this Act, after a 1-time 15-day technical review by the \n     Secretary.\n       (b) Definitions.--This section defines ``generally \n     available'' as a product offered for sale, license, or \n     transfer, including over-the-counter sales, mail or phone \n     order transactions, electronic distribution, or sale on \n     approval and not designed, developed or customized by the \n     manufacturer for specific purchasers (except for installation \n     or configuration parameters).\n\n[[Page S4725]]\n\n       (c) Commerce Department Assurance.--This section permits \n     requests from manufacturers or exporters to the Secretary for \n     written assurance that a product is ``generally available,'' \n     and requires that the Secretary notify the petitioner of a \n     decision within 30 days. This section prohibits imposition of \n     liability or sanctions on petitioners who receive such a \n     written assurance for failing to obtain an export license.\n       Sec. 303. License Exception for Products Without Encryption \n     Capable of Working With Encryption Products.\n       This section permits export under a license exception of \n     products, which do not provide any encryption themselves, but \n     that are capable of working with encryption products, without \n     restriction other than those permitted under this Act, after \n     a 1-time, 15 day technical review by the Secretary.\n       Sec. 304. License Exception For Product Support and \n     Consulting Services.\n       (a) No Additional Export Controls Imposed if Underlying \n     Product Covered by License Exception.--This section permits \n     export of product support and consulting services, including \n     technical assistance and technical data associated with the \n     installation and maintenance of mass market encryption \n     products or products capable of working with encryption \n     products without an export license and without restrictions \n     other than those permitted under this Act.\n       (b) Definitions.--This section defines technical assistance \n     as services, such as instruction, skills training, working \n     knowledge, consulting services and transfer of technical \n     data. ``Technical data'' is defined as information, including \n     blueprints, plans, diagrams, models, formulae, table, \n     engineering designs and specifications, manuals and \n     instructions.\n       Sec. 304. License Exception When Comparable Foreign \n     Products Available.\n       (a) Foreign Availability Standard.--This section permits \n     unrestricted export of customized encryption hardware and \n     software products (i.e., not generally available mass market \n     products) if a foreign encryption product using the same or \n     greater key length or providing comparable security is, or \n     will within 18 months, be commercially available outside the \n     United States.\n       (b) Determination of Foreign Availability.--This section \n     establishes an Encryption Export Advisory Board (the \n     ``Board''), which is chaired by the Under Secretary of \n     Commerce for Export Administration, with seven Presidential \n     appointees (3 government and 4 private sector \n     representatives); and four Congressional appointees from the \n     private sector. The Board is required to meet at the call of \n     the Chairman, or if there are any pending applications for a \n     license exception, the Board shall meet at least once every \n     30 days.\n       The primary duties of the Board shall be to determine \n     whether comparable foreign encryption products are \n     commercially available outside the United States. The \n     decision is by majority vote, and must be made within 30 days \n     of receipt of application for a license exception. The Board \n     must notify the Secretary of its determination, and submit a \n     report to the President within 30 days. Board meetings are \n     exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee Act.\n       The Secretary is required to approve or disapprove each \n     Board determination within 30 days of receipt of that \n     determination, notify the Board of the approval or \n     disapproval, and publish notice of the approval or \n     disapproval in the Federal Register. The notice shall include \n     an explanation in detail of the reasons for the decision, \n     including why and how continued export controls will be \n     effective and the amount of lost sales and market share of \n     U.S. encryption product which resulted. Judicial review of \n     the Secretary's decision to disapprove a Board decision that \n     a product is commercially available is permitted.\n       (c) Inclusion of Comparable Foreign Encryption Products in \n     a United States Product Not Baiss for Export Controls.--This \n     section permits export under a license exception of products \n     incorporating or employing a foreign encryption product in \n     the way it was intended to be used and that the Board has \n     determined to be commercially available outside the United \n     States, without an export license and without restrictions \n     other than those under the Act, after a 1-time 15 day review \n     by the Secretary.\n       Sec. 306. No Export Controls on Encryption Products Used \n     For Nonconfidentiality Purposes.\n       (a) Prohibition on New Controls.--This section prohibits \n     restrictions on encryption exports used for \n     nonconfidentiality purposes such as authentication, \n     integrity, digital signatures, nonrepudiation and copy \n     protection.\n       (b) No Reinstatement of Controls on Previously Decontrolled \n     products.--This section prohibits administratively imposed \n     encryption controls on previously decontrolled products not \n     requiring an export license as of January 1, 1998.\n       Sec. 307. Applicability of General Export Controls.\n       (a) Subject to Terrorists and Embargo Controls.--Nothing in \n     the Act shall limit the President's authority under the \n     International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the Trading With \n     the Enemy Act, or the Export Administration Act to prohibit \n     export of encryption products to countries that have \n     repeatedly provided support for international terrorism, or \n     impose an embargo on exports or imports from a specific \n     country.\n       (b) Subject to Specific Denials for Specific Reasons.--The \n     Secretary is required to prohibit export of encryption \n     products to an individual or organization in a specific \n     foreign country identified by the Secretary, if the Secretary \n     determines that there is substantial evidence that such \n     encryption product will be used for military or terrorist \n     end-use, including acts against the critical infrastructure \n     of the United States.\n       (c) Other Export Controls Remain Applicable.--Encryption \n     products remain subject to all export controls imposed for \n     reasons other than the existence of encryption capabilities, \n     and the Secretary retains the authority to control exports of \n     products for reasons other than encryption.\n       Sec. 308. Foreign Trade Barriers to United States Products.\n       The Secretary, in consultation with the United States Trade \n     Representative, is required within 180 days of enactment of \n     the Act to: (1) identify foreign barriers to the export of \n     U.S. encryption products; (2) initiate appropriate actions to \n     address such barriers; and (3) submit to Congress a report on \n     the actions taken under this section.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I stand before the chamber today in support \nof the e-Privacy Act because the very future of electronic commerce on \nthe Internet is being held hostage to cold-war era export controls. \nThese outdated regulations tie the hands of the U.S. high technology \nindustry and pose a threat to privacy and security of all Americans who \nuse the Internet. Despite some small concessions by the Administration, \nthe competitive advantage of the U.S. high technology industries and \nthe privacy and security of our citizens remain trapped by the Clinton \nAdministration's outdated policy.\n  The e-Privacy Act will relax current export controls on encryption \ntechnologies so that U.S. companies can effectively compete in the \nglobal marketplace. The bill will also prevent the government from \nmandating risky and expensive ``key-recovery'' or ``key-escrow'' \nencryption systems domestically. It's a good bill, it has broad support \nfrom the computer and communications industry, Internet users, and \nprivacy advocates from both the left and right of the political \nspectrum.\n  The Clinton Administration has expressed concerns about the impact \nthe e-Privacy Act would have on the legitimate needs of law enforcement \nand national security. My colleagues and I do not take their concerns \nlightly. Several provisions in the e-Privacy Act address the \nAdministration's valid concerns while at the same time freeing U.S. \ncompanies to effectively compete in the global marketplace, and \nensuring that the American people can trust the Internet as a secure \nmeans of commerce, education, and free expression of ideas.\n  The e-Privacy Act would create a National Electronic Technology \nCenter (``NET Center'') to serve as a central point for information and \nassistance to federal, state, and local law enforcement authorities to \naddress the technical difficulties of obtaining electronic information \nbecause of encryption. National security and law enforcement would be \ngiven seats at the table in making these determinations. Once again, I \nam very sensitive to the legitimate needs of national security and law \nenforcement, and I think the provisions made in the e-Privacy Act \naddress them.\n  The e-Privacy Act also extends to citizens that same privacy rights \nthat they have in their homes to their digital property in cyberspace. \nThe bill would require a court order or subpoena to obtain either the \nplaintext or decryption key from their parties. I believe that this is \nthe correct approach.\n  Citizens are also specifically given the right to use whatever kind \nof encryption software at whatever strength they choose. The bill \nrecognizes the folly of requiring the government to create procedures \nto license ``key certificate authorities'' and ``key-recovery agents,'' \nas well as require the development of a massive and complicated \ninfrastructure to ensure that the government could recover the right \nkey out of the hundreds of millions of keys in real time.\n  On many occasions, the world's leading cryptographers concluded that \nbuilding such a key recovery infrastructure would be prohibitively \nexpensive and would create a less secure network. The bill recognizes \nthat mandatory key escrow will never work, no one will use it and \ncertainly no criminals or other bad actors will use a system that is \nimmediately accessible by the government.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the e-Privacy Act, which I feel is \nthe true compromise package. We all have the same goals in mind--\nallowing for the\n\n[[Page S4726]]\n\ncontinued growth of high tech industries while not harming national \nsecurity. If we move forward with the compromise bill being offered \ntoday, I am confident we can do both.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMPSON (for himself and Mr. Glenn):\n  S. 2068. A bill to clarify the application of the Unfunded Mandates \nReform Act of 1995, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nBudget and the Committee on Governmental Affairs, jointly, pursuant to \nthe order of August 4, 1977, with instructions that if one Committee \nreports, the other committee have 30 days to report or be discharged.\n\n\n                     UNFUNDED MANDATES LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nclarify the application of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995. On \nits face, this legislation is necessary to correct the Congressional \nBudget Office's interpretation of the law as it applies to large \nentitlement programs. But more fundamentally, it is a bill to force \nCongress to abide by the spirit of the law we passed in 1995 to \ndiscourage Congress from imposing costly new mandates on States and \nlocal governments.\n  CBO's performance in fulfilling its responsibilities under the \nUnfunded Mandates Reform Act has been commendable. CBO cost estimates \nhave been timely and sound, and analysts have been responsive. However, \nI have serious concern that CBO is misinterpreting the definition of \n``Federal intergovernmental mandate'' as provided in the law. The \nresult is a loophole that makes the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \ninoperative for two-thirds of all federal aid to all governments for \nall purposes. Every State, every municipality is justifiably concerned; \nindeed, it is with the strong backing of the National Governors' \nAssociation that I introduce this bill today.\n  The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act defined ``federal intergovernmental \nmandate'' with the intent to cover new requirements or a cap on the \nfederal share of costs under Medicaid or other large entitlement \nprograms--unless the legislation imposing the new mandates also \nprovides new flexibility in the program to offset the cost. However, \nCBO has taken the position that existing flexibility is sufficient to \noffset the cost of new mandates. For example, CBO has determined that \nthe current ability of States to reduce ``optional'' Medicaid services \nis, in effect, the flexibility called for in the law. If this had been \nthe intent of the drafters, there would have been no reason for them to \ncover Medicaid under the Act in the first place. CBO's interpretation \nof the law largely removes the point of order as a tool to discourage \nnew mandates or cost-shifts to States under the large entitlement \nprograms where mandates tend to be the most burdensome and expensive.\n  Let's stop for a moment and consider why it is so important that we \nact to correct this problem. Congress passed the Unfunded Mandates \nReform Act in 1995 with the recognition that State and local \ngovernments are not wayward subordinates who cannot be trusted to run \ntheir own affairs, nor are they just more entities for the Federal \nGovernment to regulate. They are our partners in government. The \nUnfunded Mandates Reform Act was intended to force Congress to stop and \nthink twice before violating this partnership. It does not preclude new \nmandates, but it does give any member the right to raise a point of \norder against new mandates which would cost States or localities more \nthan fifty million dollars.\n  To avoid the point of order, the House and Senate intended that the \nflexibility required under the Act be new flexibility, concomitant with \nthe mandate-imposing legislation, for States to amend their \nresponsibilities to provide ``required services''--not optional \nservices. CBO is not reading the law as Congress intended. The bill I \nam introducing today amends the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act to clarify \nthat new flexibility is required to offset any new federally-imposed \ncosts that States or localities will incur under large entitlement \nprograms.\n  I am pleased that Senator Glenn, an original cosponsor and conferee \non the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, has joined me in \ncosponsoring this bill to clarify its application.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2068\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for an Underground Railroad Educational \nand Cultural Program; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n         the underground railroad educational and cultural act\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Underground \nRailroad Educational and Cultural Act. This legislation will provide \nfor the establishment of programs to research, display, interpret, and \ncollect artifacts relating to the history of the Underground Railroad.\n  Let me tell you how important the Underground Railroad is to Ohio--\nand to me personally. In the 20 years prior to the Civil War, more than \n40,000 slaves escaped bondage and made their way to free soil on the \ntrails of the Underground Railroad. More than 150 key Underground \nRailroad sites have been identified in Ohio--sites that symbolized \nfreedom for thousands of enslaved Americans.\n  When I visit these places, it gives me some real cause for hope about \nthe future of America. When we talk about race relations in this \ncountry, we would do well to remind ourselves that at one of the \ndarkest times in our nation's history--the period of slavery--some \nblacks and whites took immense personal risks to work together to \nliberate slaves.\n  That is the part of the American story that we should be proud of--\nand build on. In Ohio, we are very proud of the part our ancestors \nplayed in this great story--and why I think this legislation is so \nimportant.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support this legislation. It is \nvery important to recognize this period in our history.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2070\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. UNDERGROUND RAILROAD EDUCATIONAL AND CULTURAL \n                   PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Underground Railroad Educational and Cultural Act''.\n       (b) Program Established.--The Secretary of Education, in \n     consultation and cooperation with the Secretary of the \n     Interior, is authorized to make grants to 1 or more nonprofit \n     educational organizations that are established to research, \n     display, interpret, and collect artifacts relating to the \n     history of the Underground Railroad.\n       (c) Grant Agreement.--Each nonprofit educational \n     organization awarded a grant under this section shall enter \n     into an agreement with the Secretary of Education. Each such \n     agreement shall require the organization--\n       (1) to establish a facility to house, display, and \n     interpret the artifacts related to the history of the \n     Underground Railroad;\n       (2) to demonstrate substantial private support for the \n     facility through the implementation of a public-private \n     partnership between a State or local public entity and a \n     private entity for the support of the facility, which private \n     entity shall provide matching funds for the support of the \n     facility in an amount equal to 4 times the amount of the \n     contribution of the State or local public entity, except that \n     not more than 20 percent of the matching funds may be \n     provided by the Federal Government;\n       (3) to create an endowment to fund any and all shortfalls \n     in the costs of the on-going operations of the facility;\n       (4) to establish a network of satellite centers throughout \n     the United States to help disseminate information regarding \n     the Underground Railroad throughout the United States, if \n     such satellite centers raise 80 percent of the funds required \n     to establish the\n\n[[Page S4727]]\n\n     satellite centers from non-Federal public and private \n     sources;\n       (5) to establish the capability to electronically link the \n     facility with other local and regional facilities that have \n     collections and programs which interpret the history of the \n     Underground Railroad; and\n       (6) to submit, for each fiscal year for which the \n     organization receives funding under this section, a report to \n     the Secretary of Education that contains--\n       (A) a description of the programs and activities supported \n     by the funding;\n       (B) the audited financial statement of the organization for \n     the preceding fiscal year;\n       (C) a plan for the programs and activities to be supported \n     by the funding as the Secretary may require; and\n       (D) an evaluation of the programs and activities supported \n     by the funding as the Secretary may require.\n       (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out this section $6,000,000 for \n     fiscal year 1999, $6,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, $6,000,000 \n     for fiscal year 2001, $3,000,000 for fiscal year 2002, and \n     $3,000,000 for fiscal year 2003.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

\n   RESPECT TO PROMOTING COVERAGE OF INDIVIDUALS UNDER LONG-TERM CARE \n                               INSURANCE\n\n  Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Grassley) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 95\n\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring),\n\n     SECTION 1. PROMOTION OF COVERAGE OF INDIVIDUALS UNDER LONG-\n                   TERM CARE INSURANCE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) As the baby boom generation begins to retire, funding \n     Social Security and Medicare will put a strain on the \n     financial resources of younger Americans.\n       (2) Medicaid was designed as a program for the poor, but in \n     many States Medicaid is being used for middle income elderly \n     people to fund long-term care expenses.\n       (3) In the coming decade, people over age 65 will represent \n     up to 20 percent or more of the population, and the \n     proportion of the population composed of individuals who are \n     over age 85, who are most likely to be in need of long-term \n     care, may double or triple.\n       (4) With nursing home care now costing $40,000 to $50,000 \n     on average per year, long-term care expenses can have a \n     catastrophic effect on families, wiping out a lifetime of \n     savings before a spouse, parent, or grandparent becomes \n     eligible for Medicaid.\n       (5) Many people are unaware that most long-term care costs \n     are not covered by Medicare and that Medicaid covers long-\n     term care only after the person's assets have been exhausted.\n       (6) Widespread use of private long-term care insurance has \n     the potential to protect families from the catastrophic costs \n     of long-term care services while, at the same time, easing \n     the burden on Medicaid as the baby boom generation ages.\n       (7) The Federal Government has endorsed the concept of \n     private long-term care insurance by establishing Federal tax \n     rules for tax-qualified policies in the Health Insurance \n     Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.\n       (8) The Federal Government has ensured the availability of \n     quality long-term care insurance products and sales practices \n     by adopting strict consumer protections in the Health \n     Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that--\n       (1) the Federal Government should take all appropriate \n     steps to inform the public about the financial risks posed by \n     rapidly increasing long-term care costs and about the need \n     for families to plan for their long-term care needs;\n       (2) the Federal Government should take all appropriate \n     steps to inform the public that Medicare does not cover most \n     long-term care costs and that Medicaid covers long-term care \n     costs only when the beneficiary has exhausted his or her \n     assets;\n       (3) the Federal Government should take all appropriate \n     steps not only to encourage employers to offer private long-\n     term care insurance coverage to employees, but also to \n     encourage both working-aged people and older citizens to \n     obtain long-term care insurance either through their \n     employees or on their own;\n       (4) appropriate committees of Congress, together with the \n     Department of Health and Human Services and other appropriate \n     Executive Branch agencies, should develop specific ideas for \n     encouraging Americans to plan for their own long-term care \n     needs;\n       (5) the congressional tax-writing committees, together with \n     the Department of the Treasury should determine whether the \n     tax rules for long-term care insurance need to be modified to \n     ensure that the rules adequately facilitate the affordability \n     of long-term care insurance; and\n       (6) the National Summit on Retirement Income Savings should \n     consider the importance of planning for long-term care in its \n     discussion of retirement security.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit, with my colleague \nSenator Grassley, a Senate resolution that will focus attention on an \nextremely important health care issue for American families--long-term \ncare needs.\n  Rapidly increasing long-term care costs pose huge financial risks to \nfamilies. With the average cost of nursing home care at $40,000 per \nyear, early planning is required to ensure that long-term care needs \ndon't leave the spouses or children of the elderly and disabled \ndestitute.\n  What most Americans do not realize is that Medicare is very limited \nin the type of long-term costs it covers. Medicare only provides \ncoverage for ``acute'' health care costs, such as short-term stays in \ncertain kinds of nursing homes, or short-term nursing care in the home \nfollowing a hospitalization. Medicare was never meant to cover chronic \nlong-term health needs.\n  Medicaid does offer assistance with long-term costs, but only after \nan individual has totally exhausted his or her assets. This means that \nfamilies must become completely impoverished in order to get Medicaid \ncoverage for nursing home care.\n  What fills in the gaps? We know that sixty-five percent of many \nelderly who live at home and need help rely exclusively on unpaid \nsources, such as family and friends. But this help is not without a \nprice--it takes a huge toll on families. Caregiving frequently competes \nwith the demand of employment and requires caregivers to reduce work \nhours, take time off without pay, or quit their jobs. Families whose \nmembers must be in institutional settings often exhaust all of their \nresources paying privately for nursing home care.\n  As a country, we need to have better alternatives so that our Golden \nYears can be lived out with dignity. Our job as policy makers is to \ninform the public of the importance of planning ahead. Employers need \nto be encouraged to make private long-term care insurance coverage \navailable to their employees. In turn, families should be encouraged to \nprepare themselves financially well in advance for this potential \nexpense.\n  A similar proposal by my fellow Connecticut colleague in the House of \nRepresentatives, Congressman Chris Shays, has received strong bi-\npartisan support. My hope is that this commonsense, forward-looking \nproposal will receive the same kind of support by my colleagues here in \nthe Senate. This Senate resolution truly represents an investment in \nour future.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join Senator Dodd \nin submitting a common-sense Senate resolution to raise public \nawareness of the need for all Americans to plan ahead for their long-\nterm care needs.\n  Earlier this year, the Special Committee on Aging, which I chair, \nheld a hearing to explore the challenges of providing long-term care \nfor the baby boomer generation. A key message from that hearing was \nthat policy makers need to encourage personal responsibility for \nfinancing long-term care.\n  It is difficult to pay for long-term care even when one has worked \nhard and saved for retirement. It's impossible when a family is not \nprepared. Unfortunately, many seniors and their families find out too \nlate that they have not saved enough. Today's average cost of nursing \nhome care is about $40,000 a year. When individuals are faced with a \nchronic or disabling condition in retirement, they often quickly \nexhaust their resources. As a result, these individuals turn to \nMedicaid for help. In fact, the care for nearly 2 out of every 3 \nnursing home residents is paid for by Medicaid.\n  As policy makers, our job is to develop policies for public programs \nthat can deliver efficient and cost-effective services. Yet, equally \nimportant is the role of private long-term care financing. We must \ninform everyone about the importance of planning for potential long-\nterm care needs. And, we must provide incentives now for the baby \nboomer generation to prepare financially for their retirement.\n  As Congress works to prepare for a growing demand for long-term care \nservices, the role of private long-term care insurance must not be \nignored. Over the past ten years, the long-term care insurance market \nhas grown significantly. The products that are available today are \naffordable and of high quality.\n  This common-sense proposal has also been introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives by Congress Shays where it has received strong bi-\npartisan support.

Res. 227\n\n       Whereas the Government of India conducted an underground \n     nuclear explosion on May 15, 1974;\n       Whereas since the 1974 nuclear test by the Government of \n     India, the United States and its allies have worked \n     extensively to prevent the further proliferation of nuclear \n     weapons in South Asia;\n       Whereas on May 11, 1998, the Government of India conducted \n     underground tests of three separate nuclear explosive \n     devices, including a fission device, a low-yield device, and \n     a thermo-nuclear device;\n       Whereas this decision by the Government of India has \n     needlessly raised tension in the South Asia region and \n     threatens to exacerbate the nuclear arms race in that region;\n       Whereas the five declared nuclear weapons states and 144 \n     other nations have signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty \n     in hopes of putting a permanent end to nuclear testing;\n       Whereas the Government of India has refused to sign the \n     Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty;\n       Whereas the Government of India has refused to sign the \n     Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty;\n       Whereas India has refused to enter into a safeguards \n     agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency \n     covering any of its nuclear research facilities;\n       Whereas the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994 \n     requires the President to impose a variety of aid and trade \n     sanctions against any non-nuclear weapons state that \n     detonates a nuclear explosive device; Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate\n       (1) Condemns in the strongest possible terms the decision \n     of the Government of India to conduct three nuclear tests on \n     May 11, 1998;\n       (2) Calls upon the President to carry out the provisions of \n     the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994 with respect \n     to India and invoke all sanctions therein;\n       (3) Calls upon the Government of India to take immediate \n     steps to reduce tensions that this unilateral and unnecessary \n     step has caused;\n       (4) Expresses its regret that this decision by the \n     Government of India will, of necessity, negatively affect \n     relations between the United States and India;\n       (5) Urges the Government of Pakistan, the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China, and all governments to exercise \n     restraint in response to the Indian nuclear tests, in order \n     to avoid further exacerbating the nuclear arms race in South \n     Asia;\n       (6) Calls upon all governments in the region to take steps \n     to prevent further proliferation of nuclear weapons and \n     ballistic missiles; and\n       (7) Urges the Government of India to enter into a \n     safeguards agreement with the International Atomic energy \n     Agency which would cover all Indian nuclear research \n     facilities at the earliest possible time.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, at this time, on behalf of Senator \nBrownback, Senator Glenn, and myself, I send to the desk for reference \nto committee a sense-of-the-Senate resolution which, in essence, deals \nwith the explosion of three nuclear devices by the Government of India \nyesterday. As this body well knows, the Government of India conducted \nunderground tests on three separate nuclear explosive devices, \nincluding a fission device, a low-yield device, and a thermonuclear \ndevice. They did this also very close to the border of Pakistan, \nthereby raising tensions between the two countries and in the entire \nsouth Asia region.\n  This sense of the Senate will condemn that explosion in the strongest \npossible terms and will call upon the President of the United States to \ncarry out the provisions of the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of \n1994 with respect to India and invoke all sanctions therein.\n  It will also call upon the Government of India to take immediate \nsteps to reduce tensions that this unilateral and unnecessary step has \ncaused.\n  I am aware that Senator Brownback's subcommittee, of which I am a \nmember, will be meeting tomorrow, and will be discussing this issue, \nand, hopefully, will be able to agree to this resolution.\n  I am delighted to work with the Senator, and I note that he is \npresent on the floor at this time, so I will say no more but simply \nsend this to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I would like to note my support for the \nresolution of my colleague from California. I think this is an \nimportant, quick statement for us to be making to the Government of \nIndia and to the nations in the region, both Pakistan and China in \nparticular. The nuclear test that took place yesterday will have a \ntremendously destabilizing impact in the region. It was a bad move on \nthe part of the Government of India. I think this is something the U.S. \nSenate needs to speak out on clearly and quickly, to state our \ndispleasure, and that this will have consequences to it. I urge the \nadministration to put forward the sanctions that are called for in the \nGlenn amendment. I don't think we can stand by and tolerate the sort of \nactions that have taken place. I urge my colleagues to look at this \nresolution, to sign on. Hopefully, we can pass this in an expedited \nfashion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/12/senate-section/article/S4729-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4729-S4732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n       THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1998\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 McCAIN (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 2386\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS (for Mr. McCain, for himself, Mr. Hollings, Mr. \nJeffords, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Frist, Mr. Rockefeller, and Ms. Collins) \nproposed an amendment to the bill (S. 1046) to authorize appropriations \nfor fiscal years 1998 and 1999 for the National Science Foundation, and \nfor other purposes; as follows:\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The People's Liberation Army is the principal \n     instrument of repression within the People's Republic of \n     China, responsible for occupying Tibet since 1950, massacring \n     hundreds of students and demonstrators for democracy in \n     Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989, and running the Laogai \n     (``reform through labor'') slave labor camps.\n       (2) The People's Liberation Army is engaged in a massive \n     military buildup, which has involved a doubling since 1992 of \n     announced official figures for military spending by the \n     People's Republic of China.\n       (3) The People's Liberation Army is engaging in a major \n     ballistic missile modernization program which could undermine \n     peace and stability in East Asia, including 2 new \n     intercontinental missile programs, 1 submarine-launched \n     missile program, a new class of compact but long-range cruise \n     missiles, and an upgrading of medium- and short-range \n     ballistic missiles.\n       (4) The People's Liberation Army is working to coproduce \n     the SU-27 fighter with Russia, and is in the process of \n     purchasing several substantial weapons systems from Russia, \n     including the 633 model of the Kilo-class submarine and the \n     SS-N-22 Sunburn missile system specifically designed to \n     incapacitate United States aircraft carriers and Aegis \n     cruisers.\n       (5) The People's Liberation Army has carried out acts of \n     aggression in the South China Sea, including the February \n     1995 seizure of the Mischief Reef in the Spratley Islands, \n     which is claimed by the Philippines.\n       (6) In July 1995 and in March 1996, the People's Liberation \n     Army conducted missile tests to intimidate Taiwan when Taiwan \n     held historic free elections, and those tests effectively \n     blockaded Taiwan's 2 principal ports of Keelung and \n     Kaohsiung.\n       (7) The People's Liberation Army has contributed to the \n     proliferation of technologies relevant to the refinement of \n     weapons-grade nuclear material, including transferring ring \n     magnets to Pakistan.\n       (8) The People's Liberation Army and associated defense \n     companies have provided ballistic missile components, cruise \n     missiles, and chemical weapons ingredients to Iran, a country \n     that the executive branch has repeatedly reported to Congress \n     is the greatest sponsor of terrorism in the world.\n       (9) In May 1996, United States authorities caught the \n     People's Liberation Army enterprise Poly Technologies and the \n     civilian defense industrial company Norinco attempting to \n     smuggle 2,000 AK-47s into Oakland, California, and offering \n     to sell urban gangs shoulder-held missile launchers capable \n     of ``taking out a 747'' (which the affidavit of the United \n     States Customs Service of May 21, 1996, indicated that the \n     representative of Poly Technologies and Norinco claimed), and \n     Communist Chinese authorities punished only 4 low-level arms \n     merchants by sentencing them on May 17, 1997, to brief prison \n     terms.\n       (10) The People's Liberation Army contributes to the \n     People's Republic of China's failure to meet the standards of \n     the 1995 Memorandum of Understanding with the United States \n     on intellectual property rights by running factories which \n     pirate videos, compact discs, and computer software that are \n     products of the United States.\n       (11) The People's Liberation Army contributes to the \n     People's Republic of China's failing to meet the standards of \n     the February 1997 Memorandum of Understanding with the United \n     States on textiles by operating enterprises engaged in the \n     transshipment of textile products to the United States \n     through third countries.\n       (12) The estimated $2,000,0000,000 to $3,000,000,000 in \n     annual earnings of People's Liberation Army enterprises \n     subsidize the expansion and activities of the People's \n     Liberation Army described in this subsection.\n       (13) The commercial activities of the People's Liberation \n     Army are frequently conducted on noncommercial terms, or for \n     noncommercial purposes such as military or foreign policy \n     considerations.\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, as a long-time strong supporter \nof Israel and her security, and a fierce advocate of the Middle East \npeace process, I want to commend President Clinton, Secretary Albright, \nAmbassador Ross and Assistant Secretary Indyk for their ongoing efforts \nto preserve, and even reinvigorate, the stalled peace process. I was \nencouraged to read this morning that President Clinton has asked \nSecretary Albright to forgo the G-7 meeting in Germany in order to meet \nwith Prime Minister Netanyahu while he is here this week in the United \nStates.\n  While they have come under fire recently, as a Member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee who has for years followed closely the peace \nprocess, I believe they should be supported in their efforts to help \nforge a just and lasting peace for the region by helping the parties to \nmove forward urgently on the Israeli-Palestinian track.\n  About a month ago 81 Senators joined in a letter to President Clinton \nexpressing concern about the Administration's ideas for the next phase \nof redeployment being made public, about certain of Israel's security \nconcerns, and about final status talks. I did not sign that letter, in \npart because I believe the Administration should be commended, not \ncriticized, for sticking with this process at a critical time, and for \nits willingness to press for Israel's legitimate security concerns \nwhile recognizing the legitimate claims of the Palestinians.\n  I have watched with growing concern over the past week or so as some \ncritics of the Administration's policy toward Israel here in Congress \nhave launched fierce, often partisan, attacks on that policy. The \nSpeaker, late last week, was even quoted as saying, in a press \nconference in which he criticized the Administration's recent handling \nof the peace process, that ``America's strong-arm tactics would send a \nclear signal to the supporters of terrorism that their murderous \nactions are an effective tool in forcing concessions from Israel.''\n  That is, simply put, Mr. President, a scandalous and demagogic \naccusation to level at the President, who has been engaged for over a \nyear, along with his senior foreign policy advisors, in a vigorous \neffort to bring the two sides together at a critical time in the peace \nprocess, and to help bridge the gaps that exist between them by \noffering constructive, creative ideas for each to consider. I \nunderstand that this proposal was crafted over many months, and was \ndesigned to address many of the Israeli government's most pressing \nsecurity concerns and to meet many of its criteria for evaluating real \nprogress on these issues.\n  The President has repeatedly made clear that he is not trying to \nimpose a solution on the parties, nor could he. And that he is not \nissuing ultimatums to anyone--as further evidenced by his willingness \nto have Secretary Albright reach out again to Mr. Netanyahu this week. \nAfter months of on-and-off negotiations, with U.S. envoys shuttling \nback and forth among the parties, the major points of disagreement have \nbecome clear, and President Clinton is now simply offering ideas for \nthem to consider--an approach consistent with America's role at \nvirtually every other critical point in the Middle East peace process \nover the years. At Camp David, in Madrid, and at subsequent major \nnegotiations, American attempts to bridge the gaps between the parties \nhave played a critical role in reaching final agreement. I have talked \nwith senior American officials involved in the discussions, and remain \nhopeful that a final agreement will soon be reached. The parties must \nnot miss this key opportunity to move forward in the peace process.\n  Over the weekend Mr. Netanyahu rejected the Administration's offer, \nwhich Mr. Arafat had accepted, to come to Washington this week for a \nsummit to agree on terms for a further withdrawal from the West Bank, \nand to agree to accelerate final status talks provided for in the Oslo \nAgreement. I understand from news reports that alternative proposals \nare now being considered by the Israeli government for a 13 percent \nwithdrawal which could happen in two stages--a substantial withdrawal \nimmediately, followed by an additional 2-4 percent withdrawal once Mr. \nArafat makes good on certain tough new security commitments he has \nreportedly agreed to make as a part of the overall agreement.\n  I understand these new arrangements include the kind of strong new \nPalestinian commitments to fight terrorism which the Israeli government \nhas long been seeking, strengthening the terms of the Memorandum of \nUnderstanding negotiated at the end of last year, and providing for a \ntest period before this phase of withdrawal is completed. That is a \nmajor victory for Israel, and should help to address legitimate Israeli \nconcerns about the Palestinian Authority's commitment to fighting \nterrorism.\n  Now I am not an expert, and I acknowledge that I do not know all the \ndetails of the various land parcels that are being discussed. But it is \nclear that on the issue of land, some progress is possible. Let us not \nforget that the Palestinians had originally sought a 30 percent \nwithdrawal from the West Bank, as the first in a 3-phase withdrawal to \nwhich Israel agreed--though the timing and extent of each withdrawal \nwere not explicitly established. So the Palestinians had sought a 30 \npercent withdrawal, the Israelis offered just under ten percent, and \nthe Administration has been pressing for a compromise of 13 percent. \nMr. Netanyahu has reportedly now privately agreed to a withdrawal of \nabout 11 percent.\n  I understand that Mr. Arafat has also agreed, as a condition for \nattending a Washington summit meeting with President Clinton and Mr. \nArafat, to allow the next redeployment to be considered alongside final \nstatus talks, by a joint Palestinian-Israeli Committee, operating on a \nparallel track. The American proposal also reportedly contemplates \ngreater flexibility on the Oslo timetable, which had been set to \nconclude by May 4, 1999. Each of these changes would be significant \nachievements for Israeli negotiators.\n  Let me make four points about this situation, Mr. President. First, \ndespite all of the recent (frequently partisan) criticism of the \nAdministration, recent polls both here and in Israel show substantial \nsupport for further progress in the peace process. And this includes \npolls of Jewish Americans, of which I am proud to be one. Indeed, I \nread about a poll last week which noted that a substantial majority of \nJewish Americans polled agreed that the U.S. in this process was doing \njust what we should be doing--offering ideas, facilitating discussions, \nworking with the parties on alternative formulations which could meet \nall of their legitimate security and other interests.\n\n[[Page S4740]]\n\n  Second, let me remind my colleagues, especially those who have \noffered such fierce criticism of the Administration's efforts in recent \ndays, of the need for a sense of proportion. Let me point out that the \nAdministration is not threatening, as the Bush Administration did with \nsettlement assistance, to cut off any kind of aid to Israel in this \ndispute. It is simply playing the role mediators should play in \noffering creative ideas, and allowing the parties to make their own \ndecision about whether those ideas are acceptable to them.\n  Third, let me commend the Administration on remaining engaged in the \npeace process, a process for which many Israelis--including most \nrecently Prime Minister Rabin--have given their lives. President \nClinton has been a strong friend of Israel, and the Administration is \nright to press the parties to come to a final agreement, to offer \nsolutions which can bridge gaps, to ensure that proposals are on the \ntable from a neutral mediator which one side could perhaps not accept \nfrom their adversary, but could accept from a third party.\n  The administration has done so, I believe, because it knows that the \nsuccess of these efforts is crucial to fulfilling longstanding American \ncommitments to preserve the peace process, ensure Israel's security, \nenhance regional stability, and protect U.S. interests in the Middle \nEast. Most urgently, the President recognizes that without a peaceful \npermanent resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Israel's \nsecurity--clearly a vital U.S. interest--can never be guaranteed. Let \nus not forget one thing in all of this, Mr. President: peace is the \nultimate guarantor of Israel's security.\n  Finally, let me ask my colleagues to contemplate what could happen if \nthe Administration did not press to preserve this process, and it \ncollapsed--as it almost surely would without such intervention. An \nalternative scenario, with the peace process in a shambles--an \nescalation in terrorist attacks, Israel facing newly hostile Arab \nneighbors on all sides, and increased pressure from the Arab street for \nviolent action against her--is frightening to consider.\n  Some here in Washington act as if the Israeli-Palestinian stalemate \nof the past fifteen months does not pose dangers for all sides. I think \nthey are wrong. It poses very grave dangers to Israel, to the \nPalestinians, and to the whole region. That's why the President's \napproach of urging the parties to uphold their commitments, \nfacilitating ongoing contacts and negotiations, helping each side \nunderstand the other's legitimate security and other needs, and \npresenting creative ideas intended to help bridge gaps between the \nparties, makes sense.\n  Senator Feinstein observed on the floor last week that the \nAdministration's attempts to facilitate an agreement between the \nparties efforts were ``principled, worthy efforts . . . grounded in a \ndeep commitment to Israel's security.'' I agree with that assessment, \nand join her, Senator Lautenberg, and others in calling for restraint \nby my colleagues who have unfairly criticized the Administration during \nthis difficult and sensitive time in the peace process. Of course, \noffering principled, thoughtful critiques of Administration foreign \npolicy-making is a legitimate role of Congress, an important aspect of \nour system of checks and balances. But it is a right accompanied by a \nresponsibility to be fair and informed.\n  Mr. President, the recent crisis in the peace negotiations coincides \nwith Israel's celebration of her 50-year jubilee, an occasion of great \njoy for all of us who love Israel. With the founding of modern Israel, \nthe Children of Abraham and Sara, survivors of over 2000 years of \npersecution and exile, were home at last and free at last. But Israel's \nfounder David Ben-Gurion's dream, and that of his allies, was not \nsimply to provide a safe haven from centuries of Jewish suffering. It \nwas also about fulfilling Isaiah's prophecy of making Israel ``a light \nunto the nations,'' a powerful sign and symbol of justice and \ncompassion to all peoples of the world.\n  Although it's fitting that we pause this year to celebrate all that \nthe people of Israel have accomplished over these past 50 years, we \nmust also look forward to the tasks which face her in the next \nmillennium, chief among them the task of building a just, secure and \nlasting peace. It is my deepest prayer that our children and \ngrandchildren, fifty years from this year, will be able to say with \ngratitude that we were the generation which overcame ancient hatreds, \nand enabled them to achieve a just and lasting peace which has by then \nembraced the entire region and all its peoples. That is a vision worthy \nof Israel's founder, and of all those who come after. It is a vision \nfor which we should and must be willing to struggle, to fight for, for \nwhich all must continue to take risks.\n  Prime Minister Netanyahu is coming to the U.S. this week, and will be \nmeeting with Secretary Albright. I have heard from sources both in the \nAdministration and in Israel that the Israeli government is actually \nclose to reaching internal agreement on a variation of the \nAdministration's proposed plan. I hope that is true, and that all the \nparties will reassess their positions in light of recent developments, \nand agree this week to take one more important step toward resolving \nthis longstanding and bitter dispute, thereby helping to forge a just \nand lasting peace for the region worthy of Israel's founders' \ndream.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/12/senate-section/article/S4739-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4740-S4741]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CREDIT UNION MEMBERSHIP\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to support legislation \nprotecting the 70 million Americans who belong to credit unions from \nbeing stripped of their financial security and to allow tens of \nmillions of others, who currently are denied access to a credit union, \nto become members.\n  One of the most important financial assets our country has, Mr. \nPresident, is our extensive system of not-for-profit, community-based \ncredit unions. Credit unions provide unique and valuable services to \nmembers, most of whom work for small businesses. Credit unions offer \ntheir members lower costs, higher returns, lower loan rates and greater \nconvenience. They nonetheless provide important benefits to their \nmembers and crucial competition in the financial services marketplace.\n  But credit unions have been put in significant danger by a recent \nSupreme Court decision. That Court ruled that attempts by the National \nCredit Union Administration during the Reagan Administration to more \nbroadly interpret the 1982 ``common bond'' requirement for membership \nare beyond the scope of original intent.\n  The Court's interpretation of this requirement could result in over \n10 million Americans being forced out of their credit unions. It also \nmeans that small businesses with fewer than 500 employees--the engine \nof economic growth in this country--are barred from offering credit \nunion memberships to their employees.\n  Clearly, in the wake of the Court's ruling, the laws pertaining to \ncredit union membership must be modified. Credit Unions have a proud \nhistory of providing important benefits without cost to either \nbusinesses or taxpayers. In Michigan alone 4 million people avail \nthemselves of these benefits, and they should be protected against \nunfair limitations on credit union membership. What is more, the growth \nof credit unions in America has coincided with a significant expansion \nof earnings for community bankers, another crucial financial services \nasset for our people and our economy. As reported by the ABA Banking \nJournal's Annual Community Banking Earnings Report, the vast majority \nof community bankers believe that earnings will continue expanding, \nseeing no threat from credit union expansion.\n  There is no reason, in my view, to see credit union expansion as \nanything but a significant benefit for our people and our economy. That \nis why I am supporting legislation authored by Senator D'Amato, \nmodelled after H.R. 1151, legislation that already has passed the \nHouse. This legislation will grant credit unions authority to add \nSelect Employee Groups of 3,000 or less to their membership.\n  This legislation also sets a moderate cap on commercial loans in the \ninterest of fairness and consensus. In my opinion, such a requirement \nwas necessary to respond to some of the concerns raised in response to \nextended membership.\n  The critical issue, Mr. President, is whether we are going to allow \ncredit unions to continue to provide important services at reasonable \ncost to a\n\n[[Page S4741]]\n\nvast and growing number of Americans, or impose new regulatory burdens \non one of our economy's most important assets. I believe it is crucial \nthat we save credit unions from undue limitations, and that this \nlegislation will achieve that goal without harming any other industry. \nI urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/12/senate-section/article/S4740-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4741-S4742]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   FIFTH CLASS OF INDUCTEES INTO THE CONNECTICUT WOMEN'S HALL OF FAME\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nfifth class of inductees into the Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame. \nThese five women gained recognition in fields of nature, justice, the \narts, and finance and represent the best of my state and of our nation.\n  I want to take this opportunity to speak about each of this year's \ninductees.\n  Dorrit Hoffleit, a resident of New Haven, Connecticut, has \nestablished herself as a premiere astronomer through her work as senior \nresearcher at Yale University. For over seventy years she has studied \nastronomy and has received an undergraduate degree from Radcliffe in \nmathematics and a doctorate from Harvard. Her interest in stars began \nearly in her childhood when she saw two stars collide.\n  During World War II, Professor Hoffleit worked as a mathematician at \nthe Ballistic Research Laboratories at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in \nMaryland. It is here that she felt the effects of being a female in a \nmale-dominated field. She was paid less for doing the same work as her \nmale colleagues. In fact, despite her doctorate she still received a \nsub-professional ranking. However, she protested this treatment and as \na result was given her due rank and ultimately transferred to \nWashington.\n  In 1956, she went on to direct the Maria Mitchell Observatory in \nNantucket, Mass. Her work there helped to provide women with more \nsubstantial opportunities in astronomy. An indication of her success is \nthat twenty-five percent of the students who worked with Professor \nHoffleit have gone on to become professional astronomers.\n  As a member of the Yale research faculty, Professor Hoffleit has made \nimmense academic contributions to her field. She is most renowned for \nher two star catalogs. Her most well known catalog, The Bright Star \nCatalogue, has been defined as ``the bible of virtually every stellar \nastronomer.''\n  Despite retiring from Yale over twenty years ago, Professor Hoffleit \ncontinues to go to work every day. In these past twenty years, she has \nnot drawn a salary. She is dedicated to educating her colleagues and \nfuture astronomers, rather than promoting herself and her career. As a \nresult of her profound selflessness and service, the effects of her \nefforts will be as limitless as the stars she has spent a lifetime \nstudying.\n  A second inductee is Judge Constance Baker Motley. Born in New Haven, \nConnecticut, Judge Motley first became interested in civil rights after \nbeing denied admission into a local public beach and skating rink.\n  After graduating from high school, she was unable to afford college, \nso she worked for $50 a month refinishing furniture. She continued to \nbe active and to voice her beliefs, despite her inability to further \nher education. A local philanthropist, Clarence Blakeslee, heard her \nspeak at the Youth Council in 1939, and he was so impressed with her \nthat he offered to pay for her education. She graduated from New York \nUniversity in 1943, and three years later received her law degree from \nColumbia University.\n  After graduating from Columbia, she worked full time for the Legal \nDefense and Educational Fund of the NAACP, under then chief counsel \nThurgood Marshall. She worked there for twenty years as a staff member \nand associate counsel and she was known for her impressive skill as an \noral advocate. During her time at the Legal Defense and Educational \nFund she argued before the Supreme Court ten times, winning nine \nappeals. She is renowned for her work with Thurgood Marshall and others \non the landmark Brown versus Board of Education case.\n  Judge Motley entered politics in 1964, serving in the New York State \nSenate. In 1965 she became the first woman to serve as a City Borough \nPresident. During this time, she worked on ways to improve the inner-\ncity through better housing and schools. In 1966, she became the first \nAfrican-American woman to be appointed to a federal judgeship in the \nU.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. As a federal \njudge she continued to break new ground. In 1982 she was made chief \njudge and in 1986 was appointed senior judge. Neither position had ever \nbeen held by a woman before her.\n  Judge Motley's work for justice over five decades has been \nresponsible for some of the most extraordinary changes in American \nculture during our history. She has received many awards and honorary \ndegrees for her immense contributions to civil rights and the legal \nprofession.\n  A third inductee is Rosa Ponselle. Born Rosa Melba Ponzillo, she was \na first generation American, the daughter of Italian immigrants who \nsettled in Meriden, Connecticut. She began studying music and singing \nat age ten. Her musical break came at eighteen when she auditioned for \nthe great opera legend, Enrico Caruso. Immediately after auditioning, \nshe was cast in the role of Leonora in the Metropolitan Opera's staging \nof Verdi's ``La Forza del Destino.'' She remained loyal to the \nMetropolitan throughout her career, and she spent all but four seasons \nof her nineteen-year career performing there. In fact, she was the \nfirst American-trained singer to star at the Metropolitan.\n  Ms. Ponselle shocked the opera world when she retired in 1937. She \ndedicated the remaining forty-four years of her life to helping train \nand teach aspiring young operatic youths. One of her most notable \nstudents was Placido Domingo. She also served as the artistic director \nof the Baltimore Civic Opera Company. She died in Baltimore in May \n1991.\n  Her voice was said to exude a blend of youthfulness and maturity and \nshe remains an inspiration to opera students and audiences worldwide.\n  Lillian Vernon, another inductee, is a resident of Greenwich, \nConnecticut. She is the founder and CEO of Lillian Vernon Corporation. \nShe entered the industry of mail order catalogues in the 1950's when it \nwas dominated by industry moguls such as Richard Sears and A. \nMontgomery Ward. The company, which began in 1951, was one of the first \nto offer personalized merchandise by mail. The corporation was the \nfirst company founded by a woman to be publicly traded on the American \nStock Exchange.\n  Ms. Vernon also does a great deal of charity work. She serves on the \nboards of various non-profit organizations, including the Kennedy \nCenter, Lincoln Center, New York University's College of Arts and \nScience, and the Children's Museum. She has been honored for her work \nas a business leader and community activist. She received the Ellis \nIsland Medal of Honor, the Big Brothers-Big Sisters National Hero \nAward, and the Direct Marketing Hall of Fame Award. Ms. Vernon is a \nremarkable entrepreneur, businesswomen, and role model.\n  The final inductee is Mabel Osgood Wright. She was a resident of \nFairfield, Connecticut and was the founder and President of the \nConnecticut Audubon Society. Wright established the first bird \nsanctuary in the United States, naming it Birdcraft. She founded the \nsanctuary around the turn of the century, fearing that bird life was \nbeing gradually eradicated.\n  Wright saw conservation education as a key element to sustaining \nwildlife. She wrote many books in an effort to introduce children to \nnature appreciation and conservation. She published a field guide to \nNew England birds in 1895. During this time, the Audubon movement was \nstill young and was lacking public support. Through her involvement she \nhelped to revive the organization on the state level. Aside from \nserving as President of the Connecticut Audubon Society, she served as \nan officer of the national group and as an editor and writer for Bird \nLore magazine.\n  It is said that Wright was unique in the environmental movement. This \nis because she was a nature writer as well as a community leader and \nher message focused not on the protection of our national parks but the \npreservation of our backyards, our gardens, and our bird sanctuaries. \nShe believed the best way to preserve nature was through teaching \nchildren how to do it.\n\n[[Page S4742]]\n\n  Although she died in 1935, her message lives on at the Birdcraft Bird \nSanctuary which remains a museum containing exhibits of Connecticut \nwildlife and providing frequent tours for school children.\n  All five of these inductees are richly deserving of this award.

Mr. President, as Chairman of the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, I have sought recognition to express my support for \nthe Medicare subvention demonstration project legislation which has \nbeen introduced by Senator Jeffords. This important legislation was \napproved by the Senate last year as part of the Balanced Budget Act, \nbut the measure was stricken from the final version of that legislation \nin conference. I hope that this year, the House will recede from its \nobjections, and we can send this legislation, which is supported by the \nAdministration, to the President for his signature.\n  This bill would begin the process of opening a new--and vitally \nneeded--source of funding for the provision of health care services by \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). It would grant to VA, on a \ndemonstration project basis, the authority to collect and retain funds \nfrom Medicare--just as VA collects reimbursement funds from veterans' \nprivate insurance carriers--for the costs associated with treating \nMedicare-eligible veterans' non-service-connected illnesses and \ninjuries.\n  The Balanced Budget Act specifies that appropriated funding for the \nprovision of health care services by VA will be flat over the next five \nfiscal years. At the same time, 7.7 million World War II veterans and \n4.5 million Korean War veterans--veterans who are eligible for Medicare \nbenefits--will require extensive heath care assistance as they age. It \nis critical that these veterans be allowed to bring their Medicare \nbenefits to VA so that VA might be better able to meet their needs.\n  This legislation will surely assist VA by providing a new revenue \nstream. But it will also benefit Medicare. Under the plan set out in \nthis legislation, VA would be reimbursed at a level not to exceed 95% \nof the rate Medicare would otherwise pay a private hospital for care \nsupplied to a Medicare-eligible veterans. In summary, under this \nlegislation Medicare would receive care for its veteran beneficiaries \nat a discount, and VA would receive a vitally needed new source of \nfunding.\n  Medicare subvention legislation is supported by all of the members of \nthe Veterans Affairs Committee. It is supported by the Administration. \nAll of the major veterans' service organizations have urged enactment \nof this legislation. And, as I previously noted, the Senate approved \nthis legislation last year as part of the Senate-approved Balanced \nBudget Act.\n  I am pleased to add my name to this bill as a cosponsor, and I urge \nmy colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/12/senate-section/article/S4742-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4742]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNITION OF DR.

Mr. President, on May 19, an endowed lectureship, at \nWashington University in my home State of Missouri, will be named in \nhonor of Louis Avioli, M.D., for his contribution to the field of bone \nand mineral metabolism. Washington University and St. Louis University \nemploy the largest group of bone research scientists in the world. Dr. \nAvioli is known as a legend in this field and for good reason.\n  Dr. Avioli is the founder of the American Society for Bone and \nMineral Research (ASBMR), and is responsible for individually combining \nthe growing research interests beginning from a large range of \ndisciplines into what is now the top scientific society devoted to bone \nand mineral research. The membership of ASBMR has grown to more than \n3,000 scientists and more than 5,000 attend the annual convention. Dr. \nAvioli has been appointed to numerous positions, been published \ncountless times and has several honorary degrees.\n  With so many impressive accomplishments, it is no wonder an endowed \nlectureship is named in his honor. Commending Dr. Avioli for his many \nyears of service to the field of bone and mineral metabolism, I am glad \nto say that the State of Missouri is enriched with his wisdom and \nleadership. I join the many who congratulate and thank him for his hard \nwork and wish him continued success in future years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/12/senate-section/article/S4742-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4742]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    VETERANS' EQUALITY FOR TREATMENT AND SERVICES (VETS) ACT OF 1998\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, as a supporter of the Veterans' \nEquality for Treatment and Services Act of 1998, introduced last Friday \nby Senator Jeffords on behalf of myself, Senator Rockefeller, Senator \nSpecter, and Senator Murkowski, I am committed to ensuring that our \naging veterans have access to quality, affordable, reliable, and \nconvenient health services.\n  However, as budgets decrease so, unfortunately, do services provided. \nThe demonstration project outlined in the VETS Act of 1998 will allow \nMedicare to reimburse the VA for its services without putting a strain \non the Medicare trust, and will provide an additional funding source \nfor the VA. The project authorized by this legislation will be \nconducted over a three-year period, at up to 12 sites across the \nnation, and annual Medicare spending will be capped. Safeguards will \nalso be imposed to ensure the cap is not exceeded. This bill may even \nsave Medicare dollars by imposing a mandatory five percent discount on \nits reimbursement for services provided to veterans.\n  Those targeted by this legislation are lower- and middle-income \nveterans who are no longer eligible for treatment at the VA because of \nits constrained resources. People like Mr. John C. Elkins, of Columbia, \nSouth Carolina, who is in his late seventies and who served over 28 \nyears in the military. Recently, Mr. Elkins wrote this in a letter to \nme: ``Oh, I know some think we hang on to life and drain government \nresources that are being paid for by the younger workers. But I must \nask you and those who question us: isn't three wars in a lifetime worth \nsomething?''\n  The veterans of our nation have served honorably and faithfully, \noften under perilous conditions, and they have sacrificed both with the \nloss of their lives and with their livelihoods. Thousands of veterans \nhave experienced any number of health care problems. These veterans \nshould have the same access to health care as all other Americans and, \nquite frankly, Mr. President, they deserve more for the sacrifices they \nhave made.\n  Mr. President, you will remember what my good friend, the late \nPresident John F. Kennedy said in his inaugural address: ``Ask not what \nyour country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country.'' \nThe men and women of the armed services, our veterans, did just that. \nThey answered their country's call to duty, and in response they were \noften put in harm's way. They served 24 hours a day, seven days a week, \nall around the world. They continue to support and defend our nation's \ninterests, and I believe it is time our nation supported their \ninterests.\n  I urge my distinguished colleagues to join Senators Jeffords, \nRockefeller, Specter, Murkowski, and me in supporting the VETS Act of \n1998. It is among the very least that we in Congress can do to continue \nour support for these veterans, like Mr. Elkins, who have given so much \nto this country, while at the same time helping to preserve the VA \nmedical system and the Medicare trust.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/12/senate-section/article/S4742-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4742-S4743]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF CFIDS AWARENESS DAY\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to reaffirm my \nsupport for the tireless efforts of the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome \nAssociation of Lehigh Valley to fight Chronic Fatigue and Immune \nDysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS), or Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS).\n  For six years, the CFS Association of Lehigh Valley has been \ndedicated to finding a cure for CFIDS, increasing public awareness, and \nsupporting victims of this disease. The Lehigh Valley organization is \nactively involved in\n\n[[Page S4743]]\n\nCFS-related research. In addition, they regularly participate in \nseminars to train health care professionals. Public education is an \nessential aspect of the association's mission. Likewise, the Lehigh \nValley organization raises public awareness through the International \nCFIDS Awareness Day, which is held on May 12 each year. I would also \nnote that the CFS Association of Lehigh Valley received the CFIDS \nSupport Network Action Award in both 1995 and 1996 for their \ninitiatives in public advocacy.\n  Although researchers have made some advances in the study of this \ncondition, CFIDS remains a mysterious illness. Presently, there is no \nknown cause or cure. Victims experience a wide range of symptoms \nincluding extreme fatigue, fever, muscle and joint pain, cognitive and \nneurological problems, tender lymph nodes, nausea, and vertigo. \nRecently, the Centers for Disease Control gave CFIDS ``Priority 1'' \nstatus in the new infectious disease category, which also includes \ncholera, malaria, hepatitis C and tuberculosis. Until this disease is \nobliterated, the CFS Association of Lehigh Valley will continue its \nresearch and education campaigns.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in commending the \nLehigh Valley organization and in supporting the following \nproclamation:\n\n                              Proclamation\n\n       Whereas, the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) Association of \n     the Lehigh Valley joined the Chronic Fatigue and Immune \n     Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS) Association of America, the \n     world's largest organization dedicated to conquering CFIDS, \n     in observing May 12, 1998 as International Chronic Fatigue \n     and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome Awareness Day; and\n       Whereas, the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Association of the \n     Lehigh Valley, a member of the Support Network of the CFIDS \n     Association of America, is celebrating their sixth year of \n     service to the community; and\n       Whereas, CFIDS is a complex illness which is characterized \n     by neurological, rheumatological and immunological problems, \n     incapacitating fatigue, and numerous other symptoms that can \n     persist for months or years and can be severely debilitating; \n     and\n       Whereas, estimates suggest that hundreds of thousands of \n     American adults already have CFIDS; and\n       Whereas, the medical community and the general public \n     should receive more information and develop a greater \n     awareness of the problems associated with CFIDS. While much \n     has been done at the national, state, and local levels, more \n     must be done to support patients and their families; and\n       Whereas, research has been strengthened by the efforts of \n     the Centers for Disease Control, the National Institutes of \n     Health, and other private institutions, the CFS Association \n     of the Lehigh Valley recognizes that much more must be done \n     to encourage further research so that the mission of \n     conquering CFIDS and related disorders can be achieved;\n       Therefore, the United States Senate commends the \n     designation of May 12, 1998 as CFIDS Awareness Day and \n     applauds the efforts of those battling the illness.\n\n  I appreciate the Senate's consideration of this issue, and I thank my \ncolleagues for their attention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/12/senate-section/article/S4742-4", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4743]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DEBORAH MILLER\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am pleased to extend my \ncongratulations to Deborah Miller on her 14 years of outstanding \nservice to the Solomon Schecter Day School of Raritan Valley in East \nBrunswick, NJ, where she currently serves as Director. Deborah has \ndecided to leave the school to pursue her own education, and I want to \nwish her continued success in her future endeavors.\n  While I'm sure that everyone at Solomon Schecter is saddened by \nDeborah's departure, her eagerness to earn a Ph.D. in Jewish Education \nat the Jewish Theological Seminary is a fitting next step in Deborah's \nalready distinguished academic career. After finishing her \nundergraduate work at Barnard College, Deborah went on to earn a \nMasters in Jewish Education and a Day School Principals Certificate \nfrom the Jewish Theological Seminary of America.\n  Deborah has been a devoted educator and administrator during her many \nyears teaching. Since her arrival at Solomon Schecter Day School 14 \nyears ago, Deborah has done everything to develop the school and make \nit a complete success.\n  While Deborah has served as Director, the school has been nationally \nrecognized for its excellence in education. It is particularly well \nknown for its integration of Jewish and General Studies curricula and \nits ``immersion'' Jewish Studies courses in Hebrew. The school has also \ngrown in size during Deborah's tenure. It originally taught students in \npre-kindergarten through 6th grade. Now the school teaches 7th and 8th \ngraders as well. When Deborah started, there were 180 students \nenrolled. Now there are 315.\n  As if Deborah didn't have enough to keep her busy, her \nextracurricular activities are equally impressive. Outside of Solomon \nSchecter, Deborah teaches Jewish Studies to adults in neighboring \neducational facilities and synagogues. She also happens to be a well-\nknown author of children's fiction. She currently has written five \nbooks for children about Judaism. Her style is clever and fun-loving, \nand her books are enjoyed by all ages as a result.\n  Deborah's departure from Solomon Schecter Day School may be \nbittersweet, but she has a great deal to look forward to as she \ncontinues to learn about Jewish literature, history and the Torah. The \nlucky ones are not only those who have known her at Solomon Schecter, \nbut those students who will have the privilege of being in Deborah's \nclassroom when she returns to teaching full time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/12/senate-section/article/S4743-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4743]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNITION OF DR. INEZ KAISER\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Dr. Inez \nKaiser for being named 1997 National Minority Advocate of the Year. She \nreceived this prestigious award from the United States Department of \nCommerce's Minority in Business Development Agency (MBDA). Dr. Kaiser \nis president of Inez Kaiser & Associates, Inc., the oldest African-\nAmerican female-owned public relations firm in the United States.\n  Dr. Kaiser was chosen for the award based on her forty+ years of \nadvocacy on behalf of minority business development. In addition to her \nuntiring efforts to expand minority roles in the business industry, she \nwas a consultant and advisor to former Presidents Nixon and Ford on \nminority women's business issues and organized the first nationwide \nconference of Women in Business for the United States Department of \nCommerce. Over the years she has strived to help other minority \nbusinesses by identifying their problems and offering advice on how to \naddress those problems. Being the only African-American female in the \nNational Hall of Fame of Women in Public Relations, she is also the \npresident of the National Association of Minority Women in Business.\n  Dr. Kaiser has set a positive example for minority business people \neverywhere and it is a pleasure to see her impressive accomplishments \nreceive the recognition they deserve. My home State of Missouri is \nextremely fortunate to have such a shining example of success and hard \nwork. I wish her continued prosperity and achievement in the coming \nyears.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/12/senate-section/article/S4743-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4743-S4744]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         PRESIDENT OF SUNY FARMINGDALE CELEBRATES TWENTY YEARS\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Dr. \nFrank A. Cipriani, whose long and outstanding career as president of \nSUNY Farmingdale will be celebrated with much pomp on Wednesday, May \n20, 1998.\n  Dr. Cipriani's outstanding qualities of enlightened leadership and \ninnovation brought unprecedented success to SUNY Farmingdale. Dr. \nCipriani took the school from a two year agrarian institution to a \nfour-year college, one of the largest of the nine Colleges of \nTechnology in the New York State University system.\n  His great success is readily visible on the SUNY Farmingdale Campus. \nMr. Cipriani's other associations and affiliations are not as well \nknown but are worthy of commendation. They include: Team Chairman for \nthe Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools Evaluation; \nChairman of the Board, Regional Industrial Technical Education; Member, \nNew York State-wide Job Training Partnership Council; Member, New York \nState Education Department's Advisory Council on Postsecondary \nEducation; just to name a few of the associations and affiliations that \ndemonstrate the special concern that Dr. Cipriani has for education.\n  Born in New York of immigrant parents, Dr. Cipriani has been a New \nYorker all of his life, with the exception of\n\n[[Page S4744]]\n\na stint in the United States Air Force. He attended PS 14 in Corona, \nQueens, and Brooklyn Technical High School, and holds the A.B. degree \nfrom Queens College and the M.A. and Ph.D. Degrees from New York \nUniversity.\n  Dr. Cipriani was an officer in the United States Air Force who \nachieved the rank of Captain and the rating of Navigator-Flight \nInstructor before receiving an honorable discharge. As a member of the \nAmerican Society of Safety Engineers, he pursued his graduate studies \nwhile employed in the Engineering Department of an international \ninsurance company. He speaks Italian and French fluently, and has been \na strong advocate of international education and a strong supporter of \na humanities component in technical education curricula.\n  Dr. Cipriani is married to Judith M. Pellathy and has four children--\nMaria, Frank, Michael and Dominique.\n  His accomplishments are varied and great and we might say that Dr. \nFrank A. Cipriani is the salt of the earth. He has done much for SUNY \nFarmingdale and for the state of New York. It is no wonder that such a \nfine celebration is being prepared to commemorate his twenty years of \nservice to such a fine institution. Frank, I salute you and wish you \nmuch health and happiness in the days to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/12/senate-section/article/S4743-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4744]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        ``WE THE PEOPLE . . .

Mr. President, last week, more than 1200 \nstudents from across the nation came to Washington, D.C. to compete in \nthe national finals of the ``We the People . . . The Citizen and the \nConstitution'' program. I am proud to announce that the competing class \nfor Kentucky represented Louisville Male High School. These young \nscholars worked diligently to reach the national finals by winning \nlocal competitions in the Commonwealth.\n  The distinguished members of the class who represented Kentucky were: \nAngela Adams, Perry Bacon, Katherine Breeding, Will Carle, Eric \nCoatley, Courtney Coffee, Brian Davis, Mary Fleming, Matt Gilbert, \nAmanda Holloway, Holly Jessie, Heath Lambert, Gwen Malone, Kristy \nMartin, Brian Palmer, Lauren Reynolds, Shane Skoner, LaVonda Willis, \nBryan Wilson, Darreshia Wilson, Beth Wilson, Janelle Winfree, Treva \nWinlock, Jodie Zeller.\n  I would also like to recognize their teacher, Sandy Hoover, who \ndeserves much of the credit for the success of the class. The state \ncoordinators, Deborah Williamson and Jennifer Van Hoose, and the \ndistrict coordinator, Dianne Meredith, also contributed a significant \namount of time and effort to help the class reach the national finals.\n  The ``We the People . . . the Citizen and the Constitution'' program \nis the most extensive educational program in the country developed \nspecifically to educate young people about the Constitution and the \nBill of Rights. The three-day national competition simulates a \ncongressional hearing whereby students are given the opportunity to \ndemonstrate their knowledge while they evaluate, take, and defend \npositions on relevant historical and contemporary constitutional \nissues. The simulated congressional hearing consists of oral \npresentations by the students before panels of adult judges.\n  Administered by the Center for Civic Education, the ``We the People . \n. .'' program has provided curricular materials at upper elementary, \nmiddle, and high school levels for more than 75,000 teachers and 24 \nmillion students nationwide. Members of Congress and their staff \nenhance the program by discussing current constitutional issues with \nstudents and teachers.\n  The ``We the People . . .'' program is designed to help students \nachieve a reasoned commitment to the fundamental values and principles \nthat bind Americans together as a people. The program also fosters \ncivic dispositions or traits of public and private character conducive \nto effective and responsible participation in politics and government.\n  I want to commend these constitutional experts on their academic \nachievements as participants in the ``We the People . . .'' program and \ncommend them for their great achievement in reaching the national \nfinals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/12/senate-section/article/S4744-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4744]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NEXT GENERATION INTERNET\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1609, \nthe ``Next Generation Internet Research Act of 1998.'' This legislation \nfunds six agencies that are involved in creating advanced computer \nnetworking technology that will make tomorrow's Internet faster, more \nversatile, more affordable, and more accessible than today. The Next \nGeneration Internet (NGI) is an advanced research program which fosters \npartnerships among academia, industry, and Federal laboratories to \ndevelop and experiment with technologies that will enable more \npowerful, flexible information networks in the 21st century. The \noverall objective of the program is to perform fundamental research in \ntechnologies that will accelerate the development of a high-speed, \nhigh-quality network infrastructure to support revolutionary \napplications.\n  The Internet is a prototypical success story. There are in fact, \nmultiple dimensions to its success. It was a successful public-private \ncollaboration. It demonstrated successful commercial application of \ntechnology developed as part of a mission-directed research program. It \nexhibited a successful transition of an operational system from the \npublic to the private sector. And most importantly, it is a prime \nexample of a successful Federal investment.\n  In some respects the Internet is now ``suffering'' from too much \nsuccess. We are currently constrained by the capacity and capabilities \nof today's Internet technologies, which were not designed for either \nthe scale or mode of its current use. Even though new applications and \ndramatic private investment have increased the Internet's abilities, \ntechnological bottlenecks have sprung up throughout the system.\n  The Next Generation Internet comes at a crucial juncture in the \ndevelopment of the nation's information infrastructure. During the \nperiod of NGI-sponsored research, the telecommunications backbone of \nthe US will likely undergo a dramatic transition in which the levels of \npacket-based traffic will surpass that of conventional telephone \ntraffic. The speed and degree of the impending transition is indicative \nof the urgency with which the NGI goals must be pursued and the results \nof that research transition to the commercial sector.\n  Recently, I had a first-hand look at some of these advanced \napplications. Highway 1, a non-profit organization established to \neducate Members of Congress and their staffs about the Internet and \nassociated technical developments, showcased several remarkable \nprojects. As a physician, I was intrigued by the virtual reality \n``Immersion Desk'' collaboration demonstration. Using special glasses, \nI was able to take a guided tour of the human ear, observing its \nstructure in three dimensions, and able to interact with the guided and \nthe structure in ``real time''. It was immediately obvious to me the \neducational benefits that will evolve from putting similar devices into \nthe hands of our nation's teachers and students. Sophisticated \napplications, such as the ones I witnessed at Highway 1, place heavy \ntechnical demands upon the network. However, until the Internet's \ninfrastructure limitations have been overcome, these applications will \nremain outside the reach of those who benefit the most.\n  Some of the limitations that now impede advanced applications can be \nmastered through a straightforward application of the existing \ntechnology, but there is an entire class of problems that requires new \napproaches. I believe that our nation's research and development \nenterprise hold the key. The Next Generation Internet program will \nprovide grants to our universities and national laboratories to perform \nthe research that will surmount these technical challenges and create \nthe technology that will energize the Internet of tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I believe that passage of this legislation will \ncontinue the tradition of prudent and successful investment in science \nand technology. The Next Generation Internet Research Act will help \nensure that the Internet reaches its maximum potential to provide \ngreater education and economic benefits to the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/12/senate-section/article/S4744-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4744-S4745]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, I had intended to propound a unanimous \nconsent agreement concerning S. 1723, the skilled workers immigration \nbill, which Senator Abraham has worked on for at least a year and a \nhalf that I know of, and worked very hard. There are still some \nobjections. I do not think those objections are major on the other side \nof the aisle. And since those objections would be voiced, I will not \npropound that unanimous consent request at this time.\n  I hope we can work with the other side of the aisle so that there can \nbe an agreement on relevant amendments and we can move forward on this \nissue. It is a very, very important issue, as Senator Abraham pointed \nout earlier today. We have now reached our quota of H-1B workers for \nthe year. Our high-tech industries need workers. And this modest \nproposal, although an important one, would simply raise that limit by \nat least enough to get these high-tech industries through this year.\n  I understand the concerns on the other side of the aisle about this \nbill, and yet I believe that we could address those through the \namending process. So it would be our intention tomorrow to try and work \nout any concerns there might be and move forward tomorrow with the \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, as soon as the staff is ready, it will be my intention \nto move to adjourn.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 229 introduced earlier today by \nSenators Moseley-Braun and Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the resolution.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 229) commemorating the 150th \n     anniversary of the establishment of the Chicago Board of \n     Trade.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, this year, the Chicago Board of \nTrade is celebrating its 150th anniversary. Its an anniversary well \nworth celebrating, and not just in Chicago, but all across our country, \nbecause the vibrant, creative marketplace the Chicago Board of Trade \ncreated has meant a lot to all of us.\n  Whether we are in the food production and distribution system, or \nnot; whether we participate in our nation's financial markets or not, \nwe have all benefitted from the agricultural and financial marketplace \nthe Chicago Board of Trade first established 150 years ago. Food prices \nin the United States are lower than they otherwise would be because of \nthe Board of Trade. Interest rates on federal securities--and, \ntherefore, all interest rates that are related to rates on Treasury \nsecurities--are lower than they otherwise would be because of the \nChicago Board of Trade. The existence of this extremely efficient, \nvital marketplace has saved us all money, whether we have ever \npurchased a futures contract or not.\n  It is not by accident that this market is located in Chicago. Due to \nits central location, access to waterways and proximity to farmland, \nChicago is the natural crossroads of commerce in the United States. \nBefore the Board was created, however, problems of supply and demand, \ntransportation, and storage created chaos in the agricultural \nmarketplace. The solution was simple but ingenious. Eighty-two Chicago \nmerchants came together to establish a price discovery mechanism to \ninsure against volatile grains prices. The exchange began modestly--\neven giving a free lunch to guarantee the attendance of traders--but \nthe concept caught on rapidly and spawned the global multi-billion \ndollar futures industry we know today.\n  Belying its age, the Chicago Board of Trade remains energetic and \neternally innovative. In the past ten years, the Board has introduced \nover 100 new products. Four years ago, the Board launched Project A, \ntheir global overnight electronic trading system, that has enjoyed \ntremendous success and will soon be expanded. This year, the Board of \nTrade will launch the Chicago Board Brokerage, a new electronic trading \nsystem for the trading of cash US Treasury securities.\n  The success of the Board of Trade has not only created huge benefits \nfor our nation generally, it has also contributed enormously to the \neconomy of Chicago. Chicago's two future exchanges have created over \n150,000 jobs, and put over $10 billion each night in the city's banks.\n  Moreover, the Board has also made major aesthetic contributions to \nChicago. In a city world-renowned for its architecture, the beautiful \nBoard of Trade structure stands out as a major example of late Art Deco \nstyle--and one of Chicago's treasured landmarks.\n  The Chicago Board of Trade is a shining example of what a little \ningenuity and Midwest common sense can accomplish. The resolution my \ngood friend from Illinois, Senator Durbin, and I are today introducing, \ncongratulates the Board for 150 years of real accomplishment, and \nsalutes the Board for demonstrating the kind of leadership that will \nensure that their markets are as dynamic and useful to everyone \ninvolved in agricultural and our financial system--and to our economy \ngenerally--over the next 150 years. The Chicago Board of Trade richly \ndeserves to be celebrated, and I urge all of my Colleagues to work with \nSenator Durbin and I to ensure that this resolution\n\n[[Page S4746]]\n\nreceives prompt and favorable consideration by the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the editorials from the \nChicago Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Chicago Tribune, Apr. 3, 1998]\n\n                   CBOT Looks Back and Forward at 150\n\n       As the City of Chicago grew up out of the prairie grasses \n     and farmlands of the American Midwest in the latter half of \n     the 19th Century, the Chicago Board of Trade grew with it. \n     Some would say it was the other way around: The city grew as \n     its status as a trade center grew. They wouldn't be wrong.\n       The first ``skyscrapers'' to dominate this particular \n     landscape were giant grain silos, erected to hold the \n     millions of bushels of grain pouring into the city from the \n     west and south. The silos are long gone, but the Board of \n     Trade, which celebrates its 150th anniversary this year, \n     remains a vibrant center of commerce linking the buyers and \n     sellers of the world.\n       Founded by 82 Chicago merchants in 1848, CBOT made its mark \n     by revolutionizing how grain was stored and sold. It \n     standardized a method of weighing and grading grains so that \n     all grain of a particular grade could be stored together. The \n     seller was given a receipt for the grain he brought in, and \n     that receipt was sold to the buyer, who redeemed it for the \n     stated amount and grade of grain.\n       Of course, it didn't take long for traders to figure out \n     they could make a bundle if they contracted at this month's \n     wheat prices to deliver a load of wheat next month--if the \n     price of wheat were to drop next month. Then they could buy \n     it at next month's low price and sell it for this month's \n     higher price.\n       Thus was born the futures market, a centralized marketplace \n     for sellers and buyers of grain that replaced the cumbersome \n     method of exchanging specific loads of grain. From those \n     origins have sprouted the world's largest futures exchange, \n     now making markets in everything from soybeans to U.S. \n     Treasury bonds to the Dow Jones industrial average.\n       Just as in the last century development of the railroads \n     and telegraph helped CBOT reach beyond the Midwest, the \n     modern Board of Trade is using cutting-edge technology to \n     forge links with trading partners worldwide. In 1995, it \n     became the first futures exchange to open a commercial \n     service on the Internet, and since then it has established an \n     electronic system for overnight trades.\n       This year CBOT has entered into a cooperative agreement \n     with Eurex, its Swiss-German counterpart, and plans are in \n     the works to add a partner in Asia. Eventually, traders on \n     the after-hours electronic system will be able to access \n     those international markets from a single screen.\n       That's a long way from a bunch of grain merchants \n     exchanging slips of paper and shouting prices in a cloud of \n     wheat dust. But a remnant of that history lives on even at \n     the board's new multimillion-dollar trading floor, where \n     ``open outcry'' trading still rules during normal trading \n     hours.\n       It's a charming, chaotic anachronism--a link to the last \n     century that cannot long endure into the next if the Chicago \n     Board of Trade is to maintain its pre-eminent place in global \n     commerce.\n\n               [From the Chicago Sun-Times, Apr. 3, 1998]\n\n                          150 Years of Success\n\n       What has been here as long as Chicago's first railroad? \n     What arrived here with the first telegraph line and the \n     digging of the Illinois and Michigan Canal?\n       What, despite its age, is so healthy and vital that it is \n     one of the city's biggest economic engines, generating \n     150,000 jobs and producing $35 billion in bank deposits? And \n     what is so uniquely successful that cities around the world \n     are trying to copy it?\n       Obviously we are not talking about the Cubs or the White \n     Sox. Not even the world famous Michael Jordan can claim this \n     kind of impact. The answer is the Chicago Board of Trade, \n     which today celebrates the 150th anniversary of its founding.\n       A far cry from the striking and historic edifice it now \n     occupies at the foot of La Salle Street, the exchange began \n     in 1848 when 83 grain merchants met in rooms over a Water \n     Street flour shop to discuss a creative idea: How to protect \n     themselves against the risks of ever-changing grain prices.\n       Their idea caught on as Chicago rapidly became an \n     agricultural and shipping hub. Simply put, the exchange \n     offered traders a chance to buy or sell grain for a certain \n     price at a later date. For some, it offered the security of a \n     hedge against troublesome price fluctuations; for others it \n     offered a chance for lucrative profits.\n       It was pure Chicago--innovative, risky, boisterous, \n     expansive, entrepreneurial and gritty. And it grew with the \n     city, from a handful of corn, soybean and other grain \n     contracts to imaginative trading in everything from precious \n     metals, stock options and interest rate futures to pollution \n     emission allowances and, most recently, the Dow Jones \n     Industrial Average index. That growth and its impact on \n     Chicago and the world are detailed in today's Business \n     section on Page 58.\n       Its growth has not been without problems. The city's \n     leadership in this form of ``risk management'' is threatened \n     by copycats, such as markets in Britain and other countries \n     where the freewheeling spirit that gave Chicago its start is \n     alive and well and functioning without some questionable U.S. \n     regulations. A 1995 London Business School study, for \n     example, found that the cost of U.S. regulation is 57 percent \n     higher than in Britain. Furthermore, the Chicago exchanges \n     find themselves forever fending off proposals for new taxes \n     and restrictions on futures and options.\n       No one should fool himself into thinking such restrictions \n     would affect only a single, high-flying industry. Consider: \n     While banking employment was declining nationally from 1986 \n     to 1994, it grew 10 percent in Chicago. Thank Chicago's \n     exchanges, such as the Board of Trade, whose huge volumes \n     created the need for nearby banks, outfits from New York, \n     Europe and Asia--72 foreign banks in all--with their high-\n     paying jobs.\n       The Sun-Times, this year celebrating its 50th anniversary, \n     can admire this kind of longevity, especially when it has \n     meant for this community continuing prosperity and \n     opportunity for so many. Congratulations, CBOT.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Chicago \nBoard of Trade, the most influential marketplace for futures trading in \nthe world, on the 150th anniversary of its establishment. I am pleased \nto join my colleague, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, in introducing a \nresolution commemorating this momentous occasion.\n  On April 3, 1848, 83 merchants who realized that the grain trade was \ngrowing rapidly, came together to form a marketplace for grains and \nlivestock. Thus, the world's largest futures and options trading \nfacility was born, bringing buyers and sellers from all walks of life \ntogether under one roof for the first time.\n  With the birth of the Chicago Board of Trade came a financial \nindustry which has spread around the world over the last 150 years. The \nChicago Board of Trade has been a vital part of Chicago since the first \nrailroad, telegraph lines, and the digging of the Illinois and Michigan \nCanal. The Board has weathered through a Civil War, the great Chicago \nfire, The Great Depression, World War I and II, and countless other \nstruggles.\n  The Chicago Board of Trade is a powerful economic engine that \ngenerates 150,000 jobs throughout the Chicagoland area and also \nproduces $35 billion in bank deposits each year. Over the years, the \nChicago Board of Trade has grown beyond grain and livestock, and has \nbranched out into soybean futures, corn options, and wheat options. \nLast year, the Chicago Board of Trade set the record for the trading of \nsoybean futures traded. The Chicago Board of Trade also established \nrecords for the trading soybean meal, and soybean oil.\n  Mr. President, it has been a long time since the days when prices \nwere shouted through a cloud of dust on the floor of the Chicago Board \nof Trade. The Board has relocated several times throughout its 150 \nyears. Currently, the Board is located in downtown Chicago. The base of \nthe building spans an entire city block, and is a Chicago landmark.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate \nthe Chicago Board of Trade on 150 years of bringing economic vitality \nto Chicago, the State of Illinois, and the world.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution and preamble \nbe agreed to, en bloc, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and any statements relating thereto be placed in the Record at \nthe appropriate place as if read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
