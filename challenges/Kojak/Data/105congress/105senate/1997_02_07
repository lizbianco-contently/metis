Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume consideration\n\n[[Page S1120]]\n\nof Senate Joint Resolution 1 which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 1) proposing an amendment to \n     the Constitution of the United States to require a balanced \n     budget.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the joint resolution.\n\n       Pending:\n       Durbin amendment No. 2, to allow for the waiver of the \n     article in the event of an economic recession or serious \n     economic emergency with a majority in both Houses of \n     Congress.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, yesterday the President of the United \nStates submitted his budget. I have to say that the President has come \na long way. He now says that he agrees that the budget needs to be \nbalanced by the year 2002. This budget is a legitimate departure point \nfrom which to move in developing a final budget package.\n  I was disappointed, however, to see that the President's 5-year cost \nof Government is almost identical to what he proposed a year ago. This \ndoes not look like the era of ``big government is over.'' It is not \neven shrinking according to this budget. Even more disturbing, the \nbudget deficit over the next 5 years is nearly $200 billion higher than \nwhat was proposed just a year ago. And the deficit does not even \ndecline until the year 1999. The bulk of the spending cuts contained in \nhis budget occur after the President leaves office.\n  So he has left all of the hard decisions to the years 2002 and 2001. \nSeventy-five percent of any fiscal responsibility has to occur in the 2 \nyears after he leaves office.\n  That is not what I call political courage. That is not what I call \nattending to the structural problems and the economic problems of this \ncountry. It is more of the same that we have had for the last 28 years.\n\n  These huge stacks here on the table to my right represent 28 years of \nunbalanced budgets. These are the actual 28 budgets. Keep in mind that \nonly involves the last 28 years, since 1969, the last time we balanced \nthe Federal budget. For most of the last 60 years we have not balanced \nthe Federal budget. So this is just a small smattering. If we put them \nall up here for the last 60 years, they would reach almost to the \nceiling.\n  Then we have this budget which came up here yesterday that has all \nthe tough decisions made after he leaves office. The reason we elect \nPresidents is so they can make the tough decisions and help us to work \nin a bipartisan way so that nobody can scream at the other side.\n  In this particular case this budget is filled with smoke and mirrors. \nWhat this means is that many of the tax cuts and spending increases \ncontained in this budget are not even likely to occur or will not be \noffered until the last 2 years of the budget's projections, well after \nthis President is gone.\n  Just as important as reaching a balanced budget in 2002 is reforming \nthe entitlement programs. This is what we are going to have to face. We \nare going to have to face the growing financing and deficit problems we \nsee looming in the next century. This may sound far away, but it is \nonly a few short years before we see the next century begin. We cannot \nbe lulled into a false sense of security because we have not reached \nthe crisis yet.\n  I had hoped that the President would take a leadership position and \ntackle these difficult programs. Unfortunately, the budget contains \nonly short-term fixes. We see no sign of the structural reforms that \nare absolutely needed. We see more signs of business as usual.\n  By the way, while the President says that his budget balances the \nbudget, the Congressional Budget Office--which he has touted himself as \nbeing accurate through the years and which certainly has not been what \nI consider a conservative Congressional Budget Office for all the time \nI have been here--the Congressional Budget Office says that his budget \nwill not be balanced in the year 2002; and that the Administration is \nusing economic assumptions that just are not realistic.\n  I want to applaud the President for providing some tax relief in the \nbudget. It is a solid first step in giving some tax relief to the \nAmerican people. But it is only a baby step, and really a tentative one \nat that, because all of the tax increases--and there are plenty of them \nin this budget that he submitted yesterday--are permanent. The spending \nprograms are permanent. But, the tax cuts are temporary and are likely \nnever to occur because they go away if he does not meet his standards.\n  So it is a big shell game again.\n  I get so doggone tired of it. It is almost unbelievable. It is just \nmore of the same of what we have had over the last 28 years, and it is \nreally another reason why we simply have to pass this balanced budget \namendment.\n  The Presidents just do not seem to have the courage to stand up and \ndo what really has to be done. I am really concerned about it. Well, I \ncould go on and on on the President's budget, but I want to leave time \nfor others.\n  As we open the debate today on the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution, I have to refer again to this stack of unbalanced \nbudgets. These are the actual 28, the last 28 years' budget packages.\n  I keep these budgets here, Mr. President, as a reminder of the \ngeneration of bipartisan budgetary failure. Here it is, 28 straight \nyears of unbalanced budgets. There has not been one single balanced \nbudget since 1969, not one in 28 years, and yet we have people on the \nother side come and say, ``Oh, let's just have the will to do it. Let's \njust do it and the President will sign it.''\n  Give me a break. That is not going to happen any more than it \nhappened over the last 28 years. Paul Simon said, ``Your hair will turn \ngreen before that happens, unless we have this balanced budget \namendment.''\n  I might say, Mr. President, there has only been one balanced budget \nin the last 36 years. If we had 36 up here, it would be much higher, \nthe 36 individual budgets that have not been balanced. And there have \nbeen only eight balanced budgets in the past 66 years. Just think about \nit--58 years of unbalanced budgets. Only eight balanced budgets since \n1930.\n  This sad history of budgetary failure is not a Democratic problem or \na Republican problem. It is an American problem. Those of us who are \nproposing a constitutional amendment to require balanced budgets do not \ndo so as Republicans or Democrats; we do so as Americans, Americans \nconcerned about America and the future of our children and our \ngrandchildren.\n  Let me just give you a few illustrations of how bad our debt problem \nhas become. The national debt, as we all know, is now over $5.3 \ntrillion--$5.3 trillion. That is a debt for each and every American of \nmore than $20,000. CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, projects that \nin the year 2002, total Federal debt will exceed $6.8 trillion. That \nmeans roughly $24,000 of debt for every person, every man, woman and \nchild in America, with annual interest costs projected to be over \n$3,100 per taxpayer. That is just what we have to pay on the interest \nagainst the Federal debt, $3,100 for each taxpayer a year by the year \n2002.\n  The national debt has increased more than $4 trillion since the \nSenate last passed a balanced budget amendment in 1982. We passed it in \nthe Senate. Tip O'Neill and the liberals in the House defeated it at \nthat time.\n  The debt, which started this year at a baseline of $5.3 trillion, has \nincreased over $550 million each and every day since then. Since we \nbegan debate this year on the balanced budget amendment in the \nJudiciary Committee, the debt has increased by more than $10 billion--\njust since we began debate this year.\n  In 1996, gross interest exceeded $344 billion. That is more than the \ntotal Federal outlays in 1975--all outlays--and is nearly $50 billion \nmore than the total revenues in 1975.\n  In 1996, gross interest consumed nearly 25 percent of the Federal \nbudget and more than one-half of all personal income taxes.\n  In 1997, for the first time, we will pay more than $1 billion a day \nin gross interest on the debt. That is more than $41 million each hour \nand $685,000 each minute that we are losing in just interest costs.\n  Net interest payments on the debt are currently the third largest \nbudget category, amounting to 15 percent of the Federal budget, and it \nis the fastest growing item in the Federal budget.\n  Our annual net interest payment on the debt is more than the combined \nbudgets of the Departments of Commerce, Agriculture, Education, Energy, \nJustice, Interior, Housing and Urban Development, Labor, State, and \nTransportation.\n\n[[Page S1121]]\n\n  I think these basic facts should make it plain why the balanced \nbudget amendment is an idea with appeal for Republicans and Democrats, \nfor liberals and conservatives.\n  There are liberal Democrats who see the money we waste on interest \npayments that could be used in better ways to help the disadvantaged. \nThere are conservative Republicans who see the wreckage we are doing to \nthe opportunities for our citizens and our people by strapping debt, \ninterest, and future economic and tax burdens on them.\n\n  We are all concerned that our resources are being misallocated \nbecause the Federal Government is spending willy-nilly, with \nthoughtless borrowing, rather than making deliberate choices.\n  As we close this week of debate, I thank my colleagues who have \nparticipated in the debate who have expressed why we, Republicans and \nDemocrats, are concerned about the debt the Government piles up just \nlike the stack of these unbalanced budgets here, and why we, \nRepublicans and Democrats, believe the only answer is the \nconstitutional requirement that the Government act more deliberately in \nits spending decisions without always taking the easy recourse to \nborrow.\n  This is a proposal that can unite us as Americans across party lines. \nLet me mention again that every Republican Senator is a cosponsor of \nthis amendment. That is a great signal. But equally important is that \nseven courageous and bold Democrats have also signed on as original \ncosponsors. I wish to pay special tribute to those Democrats who \nsupport this and who have spoken in support of a constitutional \namendment either in the Chamber or by signing on as cosponsors. \nSenators Bryan, Graham of Florida, Kohl, Baucus, Breaux, Moseley-Braun, \nand Robb have stood up for America and its future, and I applaud them \nfor standing for principle and our children.\n  Mr. President, I am also pleased to say that six other Democrats have \nvoted for this in the recent past and have promised to support it in \ntheir most recent campaigns. I welcome their support for this most \nimportant insurance policy that this stack of budgetary failures will \nnot grow too much higher and, more importantly, that our American \nfuture will be brighter. If all of these folks honor their commitments \nto their constituents, all 55 Republicans and all 13 Democrats who have \nsaid to their constituents they will vote for it, we will pass the \nbalanced budget amendment this year and it will be a great day for all \nAmericans.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I truly appreciate this opportunity to \nspeak in behalf of the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, \nand in this regard I especially thank several of my colleagues: Mr. \nHatch, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee--and I \nassociate myself with all of his remarks--Mr. Domenici, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, and Mr. Craig, the \nRepublican policy chairman, for their longstanding leadership and \nefforts in behalf of this legislation that I feel, in effect, would \nsimply protect the financial and economic future of our children and \ntheir children.\n  For those who have had the perseverance and the tenacity to pursue \nthis goal, it has at times been a very lonely trail. Whatever success \nwe might achieve, and that I hope we will achieve, it has been in large \npart due to the efforts of these Senators and their leadership role, \nand the American people should certainly be aware of that.\n  I have read some interesting commentary in regard to this effort. Our \nopponents predict dark budget clouds for Social Security and any other \nprograms deemed essential by Senators regarding their particular and \nparochial interests; but contrary to that dire prediction, if we total \nthe sum of the balanced budget parts, I see and predict a very bright \nfuture. I see a nation with 6.1 million more jobs in 10 years. I see \nlower interest rates that will directly affect the daily lives and \npocketbooks of every citizen in terms of the amount of the hard-earned \nincome they pay now for living essentials--health care, housing, \neducation, loans, food and transportation.\n  If you ask the American people, with a 2 percent drop in interest \nrates, how would you like 6 months of groceries free as compared to \nwhat you are paying now, or corresponding savings in your health care \npremium costs, mortgage payment or student loans, and if you compare \nthose savings in their pocketbooks with the marginal reductions in the \namount of growth in Federal programs in this city, why, put that way, \nthe American people support a balanced budget. They are six jumps ahead \nof Washington.\n  So the question is how, how do we achieve a balanced budget? In his \nState of the Union Address, President Clinton said, ``Don't give me a \nbalanced budget amendment. Give me a balanced budget.''\n  I agree with that. I must say I do agree. But with all due respect to \nthe President, many of my colleagues and I have done just that but to \nno avail. During the last session of Congress, we sent two balanced \nbudgets to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, and despite exhaustive effort and \ndespite a lot of rhetoric to the contrary, in reality I think they were \ndead on arrival. However, I must say that passing the balanced budget \namendment in the House last year and two budgets that were in fact in \nbalance, despite the Presidential vetoes, this action did provide the \nkind of fiscal backbone and tenacity not seen in the Congress for \ndecades. In my own case, I was very proud of our efforts within the \nHouse Agriculture Committee, as chairman, in enacting farm program and \nfood stamp reform that also produced an estimated $350 billion in \nsavings over the life of the budget agreement.\n\n  It can be done. They said it could not be done, but it can be done. \nAnd with our reform of farm program policy passing by overwhelming \nmargins--318 in the House, 74 in the Senate--we also proved there is \nbipartisan support for true reform and budget savings.\n  We also achieved very considerable budget savings in discretionary \nspending at the conclusion of the appropriations process, all 13 major \nspending bills--something unique to the last Congress. So we made some \nprogress. But that was last year. And last year, despite our successes \nand a reduced deficit, we fell short of the final goal, a budget that \nis truly, truly in balance. However, the real problem is that while \nthere is considerable talk about accepting responsibility and standing \nfoursquare for a balanced budget, there are serious differences of \nopinion as to how to bring the budget into balance.\n  I don't know how many times I have heard my Kansas constituents say, \n``Pat, why can't you and Senator Kassebaum and Senator Dole--Bob and \nNancy--work together and bring this budget into balance?'' Well, which \nprograms would be cut? In most cases, I know, our constituents \ncertainly come to Washington and say, ``Yes, I want to balance the \nbudget; yes, I know we have to quit this business of mortgaging the \nfuture of our young people, our children and their children; but, you \nknow, my program is a little different. My program really represents an \ninvestment.'' And, in many cases, that is true. But, do we have the \npolitical wherewithal to address the real entitlement question, and \nthat is our individual freedom and the future of our kids and their \nkids? In that, if you total up all the spending, you reach a certain \nlevel, as evidenced by all of the budget reports on the floor of the \nSenate, where that is the key question, not each individual program.\n  So, do we have the political wherewithal to save and restore Medicare \nand other entitlements? In this regard, the President and many of our \nfriends across the aisle stated over and over again they are for a \nbalanced budget, but not that budget, that budget meaning any cuts in \ntheir favorite and priority programs. And I must say, despite the fact \nthat a Republican Congress and the President were within $10 a month \ndifference last year in regard to preventing Medicare bankruptcy, $10 a \nmonth, some even say $7, because of the fact we were not able to reach \nagreement and the fact that the Democratic Party made a conscious \ndecision to make Medicare a top issue in last year's campaign, I am not \noverly confident any budget agreement can be worked out without a great \ndeal of difficulty--unless we have to--unless there is some outside \ndiscipline that\n\n[[Page S1122]]\n\nwill force Congress to get the job done. The lure of political \nopportunism may be just too great. The coming debate in regard to \nSocial Security is a classic example.\n  I have here the report in regard to the balanced budget amendment \nlegislation we are considering. On page 33, the minority views begin. \nAnd I note, as I thumb through some of the commentary, that it is \nmerely a repeat of what many of us on this side of the aisle \nexperienced in 30-second spots.\n  So the real question is, does the Congress have the fortitude and the \nperseverance and the tenacity to truly balance the budget? As has been \nsaid by many of my colleagues, despite very good men and women of both \nparties with the best of intentions, it is now the 28th year in which a \nmajority in Congress has failed in efforts for the Federal Government \nto live within its means and to prevent the mortgaging of our children \nand their children--28 years. There is the evidence right down there, \nright next to Senator Craig. As a matter of fact, I think it stacks so \nhigh that we are in violation of the Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration code, and maybe the fire code.\n  So we all agree that we must make progress toward a balanced budget. \nThen during the course of our political deliberations, we most \ngenerally agree to disagree on how to achieve this goal. I think it is \nclear that, if there is anything to be learned during the time we have \nregretfully experienced ever-increasing deficits and political discord, \nit is that we need a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution to \nsimply get the job done.\n\n  Now, the minority says in the beginning of their views:\n\n       The real question this year is not whether to reduce the \n     deficit but by how much and what cuts to make in order to \n     bring the budget into balance. That is the real work that \n     lies before us.\n\n  And amen to that. And I credit the minority for starting off with \nthat paragraph.\n  But, as has been said before, we now have the President's budget, and \nin that regard I am going to quote from today's issue of the Washington \nPost. This is an independent observation, not known for conservative \nviews--some conservative views. When they shine the light of truth into \ndarkness, it is usually to the left-field bleachers as opposed to the \nright-field bleachers. But the Post says this morning:\n  ``For the first time in 30 years, we'll be able to tell the American \npeople that we have brought fiscal sanity back to their Government,'' \ndeclared Clinton's Budget Director, Franklin D. Raines, at a news \nconference.\n  And the Post goes on to say this, and this a wake-up call to the \nAmerican people:\n\n       But, in many respects, [the President's] fiscal 1998 budget \n     falls well short of the administration's soaring rhetoric. On \n     issues such as deficit reduction, Medicare, tax cuts and \n     welfare, congressional Republicans and many independent \n     budget analysts charge [the President's] plan is crafted less \n     to impose fiscal discipline than to gain political advantage \n     in the budget battle to come.\n\n  That is the Washington Post. That is not some Republican on Senate \nfloor.\n\n       In assembling its blueprint for wiping out the deficit by \n     2002 and beyond, the administration offers dozens of new \n     spending initiatives, including almost $60 billion of \n     additional entitlement programs [I thought we were going to \n     scale those back], while providing sketchy information about \n     spending cuts.\n\n  Clinton is relying heavily on new fees and deferred spending \nreductions to reach balance. About 75 percent of all the proposed \nspending cuts would take effect after 2000, a strategy that would put \noff most of the pain--most of the discipline, if you will--until after \nPresident Clinton leaves office.\n  A respected columnist, second to none, the dean of the political \nwriters in Washington, David Broder, added this in today's issue of the \nPost:\n\n       The numbers in the latter document [I am talking about the \n     budget] are immensely revealing. After pages of pat-myself-\n     on-the-back rhetoric, the gauzy camouflage is pulled aside. \n     And you can learn that there's really not that much wrong \n     with this budget except that it adds another $1.2 trillion to \n     the statutory national debt in the next 5 years, fails to \n     start addressing the baby-boomer retirement problem, further \n     squeezes the share of money available for needed domestic \n     programs, shifts burdens to the States, shortchanges the \n     cities and stagnates investments in nonmilitary research and \n     development, the real seed corn for the future. Other than \n     that, it's a fine, forward-looking budget plan.\n\n  That is by David Broder and I think it deserves significant attention \nfor those involved in this debate as well as all of the American \npeople.\n  Mr. President, with the fall of the Greek Republic as an example, \nthere is an often-quoted and pessimistic theory that a democracy cannot \nexist as a permanent form of government. The argument and prediction is \na democracy can only exist until the voters discover they can vote \nthemselves largesse from the Public Treasury. From that moment on, the \nmajority always votes for the candidates promising the most benefits, \nwith the result that a democracy always collapses over a loose fiscal \npolicy.\n  That was predicted about the Greek Republic. It happened. If that \nprediction is true, it is a terrible prospect for our future.\n  Mr. President, I don't buy it. I think the American people are \nwilling to sacrifice and invest in the future if we but set the example \nand get the job done.\n  I must say, when we look at our most recent history, and the fact our \nbest efforts fell short during the last session of Congress--and, \ngoodness knows, we worked hard--I believe this debate, this legislation \nand this time represents our very best opportunity to set our Nation's \nfiscal house in order.\n  In his State of the Union Address, President Clinton said, ``we need \naction.'' And I agree. It is, indeed, time for action.\n  And for action that gets the job done, we need a constitutional \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me make note of the comments of the \nSenator from Kansas. They are so appropriate and so well directed at \nwhat we can do here as it relates to controlling our spending and \nmodifying programs that do just that and produce long-term benefits.\n  The Senator from Kansas last year, of course, was a major player and \nauthor of the Freedom to Farm Act while he was chairman of the House \nAgriculture Committee. That very act changed the whole dynamics of \nGovernment policy as it related to farm programs and Government's \nrelationship to production agriculture.\n  He spoke of the net savings in the tens of billions of dollars that \nwill result over an extended period of time. I would guess that less \nthan a few years ago, many Senators and many Members of the U.S. House \nwould have said, ``That can't be done; you cannot sever that \nrelationship.'' And yet, we have severed it.\n  Agriculture continues to prosper every bit as well as it did tied \ndirectly to the Government and Government programs and, we believe, in \nthe long term will prosper more, simply because it is not relying on \nfarming-to-Government programs but, in fact, is now looking at the \nmarket and producing to the market, as we had hoped it would.\n  That was one major benefit in change that occurred in the 104th \nCongress.\n  Another one that occurred that is, in the long term, going to \nsubstantially get us to the point by 2002 of a balanced budget, of \ncourse, was the welfare reform.\n  So when the kind of pandering that occurs here on the floor, often \nfrom the other side, that there is no way to balance the budget, or, if \nyou balance it, you must begin to exempt major portions of the budget \nbecause they are too sensitive, too important and no constraints must \nbe put upon them of the kind that a constitutional amendment would \nplace upon them, so, therefore, they must be exempt, I would argue just \nthe opposite, that all it forces us to do is make tough choices, \npriorities, where should the dollars be spent.\n  Of course, we all know we are going to build and maintain a strong \nhuman safety net in Government policy for the citizens of this country \nwho are poor or disadvantaged or need an opportunity. That is exactly \nwhat has been and will remain a concern of this Congress always.\n  All we are asking, and what I think we are causing to happen, is what \nthe American people have been asking now for well over a decade. Out of \nfear--now fright--that this Congress cannot control a Federal debt, \nthey are saying, ``Balance your budget.''\n\n[[Page S1123]]\n\n  Of course, the Senator from Kansas and I, the day before yesterday, \nreferenced this large stack of 28 consecutive budgets that are piled \nhere beside me, to recognize that 14 of them have deficit spending, \nwith all the intent to deficit spend and no intent to balance. And 14 \nof them have the intent to balance, where the Congress collectively, in \nproducing the budgets, said it is our intent that these budgets lead to \na balanced budget.\n  Yet, of course, we now have evidence, by the President's budget \ncoming to us yesterday, that in all the rhetoric and all the time that \nhe expended and all the good intentions that he expended in the State \nof the Union Message this week, referencing a balanced budget many, \nmany times, that his budget isn't balanced, won't even balance unless \nyou do major cuts and major tax increases, largely because he is \nhabitually the kind of public leader that we have had for so many \nyears, who wants to constantly add new programs without making the \ntough choices of deleting programs so that you can add.\n\n  I am not suggesting the programs the President spoke of are not \ncontemporary and necessary. When he spoke to education the other night, \nI applauded a fair amount of what he said. But I am willing to stand \nhere and make the tough votes to suggest spending ought to decrease \nsomewhere else if we as a country are going to shift our priorities in \nspending to education.\n  We now have an amendment before us that would impact the whole intent \nof a balanced budget amendment to our Constitution, and those are tough \nchoices, prioritizing and doing exactly what the American people expect \nus to do, and that is balance the budget. If 51 of us can say, ``Oh, we \ncan't balance the budget, the environment is too extreme at the moment, \neconomically at this point in the country or the priorities of spending \nare we just have to bypass this national mandate, this constitutional \nmandate and do it only by 51 votes here in the Senate,'' then I suggest \nto you this amendment wipes away the full intent of a balanced budget \namendment and causes us, if that were to become part of the balanced \nbudget amendment, to gimmick up the Constitution by simply doing \nexactly what we do now.\n  So we are telling the American people that the amendment that is \nbefore us is one where, ``Oh, we have given you a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution. Rest assured we have given you what you \nwanted, but more importantly, we have now simply represcribed business \nas usual.''\n  It is with those frustrations that I think we are now suggesting that \nthis is an amendment--the amendment to the constitutional amendment, \nthe one before us--is one that does not deserve to be in the \nConstitution, because it would be false pretense to argue it any other \nway.\n  Yesterday, there was a fascinating article from Investors Business \nDaily that I thought was very reminiscent of the very arguments we are \nplacing here on the floor. The President had expressed concern about \nthe ability to react promptly in a recession and, of course, the \namendment we have before us would argue that that is what it allows. \nWhen the President said that, I said, ``Mr. President, we have provided \nfor that. We have a three-fifths vote in the amendment now.'' It is a \ntough vote. It is not always easy to come by, but it is a necessary \nvote to force us to the reality.\n  Let me suggest that Congress, in 1962, passed 12 economic stimulus \nbills because of a recession. All 12 bills received 60 votes or more in \nthe U.S. Senate. In 1993, in a stimulus package, there were similar \nkind of votes.\n  What I am suggesting is that the record is replete with a voting \npattern that says if we are truly in a major economic emergency and \nthere is need for economic stimulus, that the very marker we have put \nin the proposed constitutional amendment that we are debating on the \nfloor is the proper mark and not 51 votes.\n  So what Investors Business Daily said yesterday was:\n\n       The idea that deficit spending could smooth out the rough \n     spots in a business cycle comes from John Maynard Keynes. \n     Recessions, he believed, started when all the buyers in the \n     economy suddenly stopped spending. . .\n       The evidence shows that public works programs have done \n     nothing to solve recessions, a 1993 article by economist \n     Bruce Bartlett in The Public Interest magazine pointed out.\n       Spending packages aimed at fighting recession have never \n     been enacted before a recession ended on its own.\n\n  In other words, they always came after all of the indicators were in \nplace that the recession was over.\n       Recessions are usually defined as two straight quarters of \n     falling GDP. So no one actually knows a recession is \n     happening until six months after it starts. No one knows it's \n     over until three months later.\n\n  That is the reality of how we define ``recession.'' Yet, the \namendment that we have before us to amend the resolution would argue \nthat we know better.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \neditorial called ``Prospective Balanced-Budget Blather'' be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Perspective Balanced-Budget Blather, February 6, 1997\n\n       Without deficits, recessions would be longer, deeper and \n     harder to pull out of, the common wisdom says. Treasury \n     Secretary Robert Rubin echoes that in opposing a balanced-\n     budget amendment. But it's not true.\n       The idea that deficit spending could smooth out the rough \n     spots in a business cycle comes from John Maynard Keynes. \n     Recessions, he believed, started when all the buyers in the \n     economy suddenly stopped spending.\n       Sellers usually respond to such a decline in demand by \n     cutting output and jobs, rather than cutting prices, the \n     Keynesian view went. That threw more people out of work, and \n     further reduced aggregate demand.\n       Only government could turn this cycle around, by pumping \n     money into the economy. It did so by hiring people for public \n     works programs, for example.\n       But because the government collects less in taxes during \n     recessions, those public programs had to be paid for with \n     debt, Keynes argued.\n       The evidence shows that public works programs have done \n     nothing to solve recessions, a 1993 article by economist \n     Bruce Bartlett in The Public Interest magazine pointed out.\n       Spending packages aimed at fighting recession have never \n     been enacted before a recession ended on its own, as the \n     chart shows.\n       In fact, Congress often enacts these packages the very \n     month the recession is over. They are usually nothing more \n     than pork-barrel spending dressed up as compassion.\n       Recessions are usually defined as two straight quarters of \n     falling GDP. So no one actually knows a recession is \n     happening until six months after it starts. No one knows it's \n     over until three months later.\n       Even then, it takes Congress time to pass a law for extra \n     spending. And it takes still more time for that money to make \n     its way through the economy.\n       So even if Congress could tell when a recession was \n     starting--unlikely, given the records of most economic \n     forecasters--it still wouldn't have more than a small effect.\n       And Keynes was wrong not just in practice, but in theory as \n     well.\n       He based his whole theory on the notion that government \n     experts acted rationally, while the average person did not. \n     Central planners could know enough and act quickly enough to \n     save people from the consequences of their own bad \n     decisions--clearly not the case.\n       There are programs, such as unemployment insurance, that \n     kick in automatically when recession hits, without having to \n     wait for Congress to act. The amount those programs actually \n     increase during recession could be easily handled within a \n     balanced budget, however.\n       Between 1980 and 1984--which includes years of deep \n     recession--real spending on jobless benefits rose $47.4 \n     billion above its level in 1979, an economic peak. That \n     increase was just 1% of government spending over those four \n     years.\n       Recessions have been less severe in the postwar period, \n     many economists argue, largely because of the greater role \n     Government has played in easing recessions. But it is not \n     certain that they are less severe, and it is even less \n     certain that this is due to government.\n       On the surface it seems true. From 1920 to 1938, recessions \n     averaged 20 months, with a 14.2% decline in real GNP. Since \n     1948, they averaged 11 months, with 2.4% drop in real GNP. \n     Unfortunately, it's hard to compare the two periods, because \n     the prewar data are quite crude.\n       National Bureau of Economic Research economist Christina \n     Romer, in a key 1986 American Economic Review article, tried \n     to compare apples with apples. She adjusted the more recent \n     data so that it was calculated much like those of the prewar \n     period.\n       And she found the evidence of a change in the length, \n     frequency and severity of business cycles was weak.\n       Even if recessions are less severe, it may have little to \n     do with government. The growing importance of the service \n     sector, where employment tends to be stable, could be one \n     reason. And technology has helped ease the sharp boom-bust \n     cycle of the farm and factory sectors.\n       Legitimate gripes about a balanced-budget amendment are \n     easy to come by. But Rubin's is not one of them.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. It is important to recognize that while the politics of \nthe argument are interesting, the record would\n\n[[Page S1124]]\n\nsuggest that it does not fit, that Congress has always responded to \nrecessions after they were over. And, in fact, what ended up usually \nwas pork-barrel spending that became a part of the total budget program \nthat went on.\n\n       Between 1980 and 1984--which includes years of deep \n     recession--real spending on jobless benefits rose $47.4 \n     billion above its level in 1979, an economic peak. That \n     increase was just 1% of government spending over those four \n     years.\n       Recessions have been less severe in the postwar period, \n     many economists argue.\n\n  That is exactly the point of those figures, the argument that somehow \nwe straitjacket our Government by a balanced budget not able to respond \nto times of recession, and the facts simply do not bear it out, the \neconomic facts, not mine, but those of the economists who study this.\n  So when Secretary Rubin fears straitjacketing, what Secretary Rubin \nfears is that the American people will once again have control of their \nbudget and the spending of the Federal Government and that we take it \nout of the hands of politicians and force them to stay within \nparameters and make the tough choices and to stop mounting the huge \nFederal debt that we are currently having.\n  That is the essence of a balanced budget amendment. That is why we \nare here on the floor, because the American people have asked us to do \nthis. I am one of those who believes so strongly that the record is \nreplete with the facts that we as politicians cannot do it.\n  Some of us can make those tough votes; others cannot for various \nreasons. It is true that, as never before, special interest groups come \nto Washington for a piece of the pie. So it is easy to give it away and \nmake the pie bigger. The only problem is we borrow hundreds of billions \nof dollars annually to make the pie, expecting future generations to \npay for the ingredients. Therein lies the great discrepancy, why we are \nhere.\n  It is an important issue. We must fight to make sure that we retain \nit and that we pass the balanced budget constitutional amendment \nresolution and disallow the kind of amendments that would weaken it or \nmake it hollow at best. We cannot put that kind of language in our \nConstitution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be able \nto proceed as in morning business and the time I use not be deducted \nfrom the debate on the pending business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, all of us in this country were deeply \nsaddened by the tragic death of Pamela Harriman in Paris a few days \nago. Regardless of party or political persuasion, this was a remarkable \nwoman who spent a lifetime, from the basement of 10 Downing Street with \nthat most revered of leaders of the 20th century, Sir Winston \nChurchill, to representing the United States in the Embassy in Paris. \nHers was a remarkable life in many ways.\n  As we have been reading about the legend of Pamela Harriman over the \npast few days not enough attention, in my view, is being paid to her \nprofound legacy to this country. Most of us--I think all of us, maybe \nwith some exception in this Chamber--were born in this country. We did \nnot make the choice to be Americans. We were fortunate enough that our \nparents or grandparents or great-grandparents came to this country, and \nwe were the beneficiaries of those decisions.\n  I have always thought it was somewhat different for people who made \nthe choice, the conscious choice to become an American. Pamela Harriman \nmade that choice to be an American and contributed mightily to this \ncountry. She was engaged in the political process. She was a partisan. \nAnd I say to my friends on the other side, I think that is healthy when \npeople become engaged and not only have ideas and values and beliefs, \nbut are willing to act on them. And for those of us who are Democrats, \nwe will be eternally grateful for her support and her willingness to be \nengaged in the political life in this country. For people, regardless \nof political persuasion, she was a great individual who represented our \ncountry in Paris with great distinction.\n  There was a column presented the other day, Mr. President, by Richard \nHolbrooke in the Washington Post which I think captured in many ways \nthe feelings of many of us about Pamela Harriman's service.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that column by Richard \nHolbrooke be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed to \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 6, 1997]\n\n                     Pamela Harriman's Last Mission\n\n                          By Richard Holbrooke\n\n       If, as Soren Kierkegaard said, ``Life is lived forward but \n     understood backward,'' then the arc that Pamela Harriman \n     traveled can best be understood by beginning at its end, with \n     her ambassadorship to France. The four years she spent in \n     Paris in service to her adopted nation gave a different \n     meaning to what had gone before it, not only to her \n     biographers but also to herself. In retrospect, everything \n     that preceded Paris will look different because, after a life \n     in which she was identified closely with a series of \n     important men, she did something important so splendidly on \n     her own.\n       She spent her last hours before she fell ill in a \n     characteristic whirlwind of activity. Less than an hour \n     before her fatal attack, she was discussing on the telephone \n     with her friend Undersecretary of State Peter Tarnoff some \n     highly technical problem concerning the Treaty on \n     Conventional Forces in Europe. This was not the public Pamela \n     Churchill Harriman, the one the press always described as \n     ``beautiful and glamorous,'' but the intensely serious public \n     servant, handling personally a matter most ambassadors would \n     have left to someone else. Then, after discussing the CFE \n     with Tarnoff, she went swimming at the Hotel Ritz and, as she \n     got out of the pool, collapsed without warning.\n       Because Pam was the daughter of a Dorset baron, I often \n     asked her, teasingly, how she had managed to overcome the \n     disadvantages of her birth. But in a sense, I meant it; had \n     she followed the normal trajectory for a girl of her \n     generation and limited education, she would perhaps have \n     lived out the last few years of a fairly predictable life as, \n     say, a duchess dowager in some stately English home. Instead \n     she began a 57-year voyage almost continuously in the public \n     eye.\n       The standard stories always emphasize the men in each phase \n     of Pam's life, and there was truth in this; she herself \n     talked of it occasionally with her close friends. But the \n     role men played in her life can be misunderstood. It is true \n     that she loved, and was loved by, an extraordinary group of \n     men. But Pam absorbed more than the luxuries of life from her \n     close proximity to men in power. From each of them she \n     learned something new and gave something back. It was with \n     Averell Harriman, a major figure in both foreign policy and \n     the Democratic Party for half a century, that she returned to \n     the world of public affairs, this time not as the British \n     daughter-in-law of Winston Churchill but as a proud new \n     American citizen. She became increasingly involved in \n     Harriman's two major concerns: the Democratic Party and \n     American foreign policy. Thus, when President Clinton made \n     the decision to send her to Paris in 1993, she was more \n     prepared than either she or most of us realized.\n       Unlike many political appointees, she was determined to \n     understand the most complex details of her job. At the same \n     time, she remained a perfectionist, equally determined to \n     present a flawless facade. When, as her ``boss,'' I tried to \n     get her to take more time off, to relax more, to do less, she \n     simply said, ``I can't do that. I'm not built that way.''\n       Her efforts produced results not only for her personally \n     but for the nation. In the famously difficult relationship \n     between Washington and Paris, Pam achieved a level of access \n     to the highest levels of the French government that was \n     unique. While the press focused on the strains in the \n     relationship, these were never as serious as reported, and in \n     any case they would have been far greater without Pam's \n     ability to bring officials of both nations--most of them \n     younger than her son Winston--together under her roof to work \n     things out. It was one of her enduring beliefs that if she \n     could get the right people together in a room she could get \n     them to agree, or at least reduce their disagreements. That \n     she was so often right, in the face of the usual bureaucratic \n     passivity or pessimism, was a tribute to her determination \n     and tenacity.\n\n[[Page S1125]]\n\n       Almost exactly 28 years ago, on January 19, 1969, a group \n     of us went to Orly airport in Paris to say goodbye to Averell \n     Harriman, who was leaving his post as chief negotiator to the \n     Vietnam Peace Talks on the day before Richard Nixon's \n     inauguration. Harriman was 76 years old, and that day in \n     Paris was to be his last as a U.S. government official. Now, \n     at the same age and in the same city, his widow has gone out \n     as she would have wanted to, just as she was ending a \n     successful mission for her nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/07/senate-section/article/S1124-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1125-S1126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO CASEY MILLER\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, a third subject matter I raise here in \nmorning business today is one that did not get national attention \nexcept for those who may have been interested. But I want to pay \ntribute to a neighbor of mine, Mr. President, a neighbor and a friend, \na woman who truly revolutionized the way we speak and write in this \ncountry. Casey Miller is her name.\n  Throughout her life, Casey Miller promoted and venerated the role of \nwomen in our society by fighting to eradicate gender-specific language \nfrom everyday speech.\n  Postal worker, artisan, police officer, and restaurant server are \njust some of the words that enter the glossary of modern English \nbecause of Casey Miller. While many falsely see these words as \npolitical correctness gone awry, they in fact represent a genuine \neffort to place America's women on the same linguistic standing as men.\n  Her book, ``The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing'' is still considered \nthe standard reference guide on how to correctly utilize language in \norder to properly address and speak of women. Too often in everyday \ndiscussions we use the words ``man,'' ``men,'' and ``he,'' as if they \nwere interchangeable for all people. But these words only describe the \nrole of the male gender and they demean to many women the significant \nposition of women in our society.\n  As the English novelist Thomas Hardy once said, ``It is difficult for \na woman to define her feelings in language which is chiefly made by men \nto express theirs.'' The fact is that ``the man on the street'' may be \nthe woman with a strong opinion. Things that are ``man-made'' are often \nbuilt by women. The ``man of the house'' is by no means always a man. \nAnd the ``land where our fathers died'' is the same land of our \nmothers.\n  Through Casey Miller's writings, more and more Americans became aware \nof the implicit discrimination in our language and the distinct \nindividuality of women in our society. Though she was not a household \nname, Mr. President, for most Americans, her impact on the way we write \nand speak has been profound. For all of her efforts she deserves the \nappreciation of women and men across this country of ours.\n  Besides her groundbreaking work on behalf of women, Casey Miller was \nan active and vital participant in humanitarian and philanthropic \ncauses.\n  Through Childreach, the U.S. branch of Planned Parenthood \nInternational, Ms. Miller served as a foster parent for dozens of \nchildren in poor and disadvantaged countries. What is more, she shared \nher good fortune with others, generously donated to her alma mater \nSmith College, the NAACP, and the Humane Society.\n  On a personal level I rise here, Mr. President, to talk about Casey \nMiller who passed away a number of days ago not just because she was a \npioneer in the feminist movement, served our country in uniform in \nprevious conflicts, but she was a dear friend, and she happens to have \nbeen my next door neighbor in Connecticut. More than just being an \nactivist and someone who made a significant contribution through a \nparticular avenue that she sought, she was a wonderful, wonderful, \nfriend. I cannot tell you the countless breakfasts, lunches, and \ndinners, so lively across the lawn. I could spend an evening with Casey \nMiller and Kate Swift, her lifetime friend and partner.\n  For millions of us across the country, Casey Miller has had an \nimpact--you may not know her name--for the way we speak today, for the \nchanges that have occurred. Even in our own legislative body Casey \nMiller made a significant contribution.\n  Mr. President, I just wanted to rise this morning and pay tribute to \nmy neighbor. I will miss her very, very much. She was a wonderful \nfriend, a great person, an individual who proved, once again, that one \nperson can truly make a difference in our society.\n  I ask unanimous consent that two editorials about Casey Miller be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Casey Miller, 77, a Promoter of Using Nonsexist Language\n\n                        (By Lawrence Van Gelder)\n\n       Casey Miller, a writer and editor who was a pioneering \n     advocate of nonsexist language, died on Sunday at her home in \n     East Haddam, Conn. She was 77.\n       Kate Swift, her close friend and co-author, said the cause \n     of death was chronic obstructive lung disease.\n       Beginning in the early 1970's, Ms. Miller and Ms. Swift co-\n     wrote numerous books and articles on English usage and its \n     relationship to the status of women. Writing in a climate of \n     increasing sensitivity and opposition to language that \n     relegated women to secondary status, Ms. Miller and Ms. Swift \n     waged a forceful campaign against what many considered sexist \n     language. If not all their proposals (like ``genkind'' to \n     replace mankind) found their way into everyday usage, the \n     women nonetheless helped to raise awareness of oppression by \n     language.\n       Ms. Miller and Ms. Swift were the authors of ``Words and \n     Women,'' published in 1976 by Doubleday and 1991 by \n     HarperCollins, and ``The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing,'' \n     published in 1980 by Lippincott & Crowell and in 1988 by \n     HarperCollins. They also wrote many articles on sexism in \n     English that appeared in national periodicals and in more \n     than 30 anthologies and textbooks.\n       They achieved widespread recognition as authorities on the \n     subject of linguistic disparagement of women with ``One Small \n     Step for Genkind,'' a 1972 article in The New York Times \n     Magazine that was reprinted in college textbooks as recently \n     as last year.\n       In it, they wrote: ``Except for words that refer to females \n     by definition (mother, actress, Congresswoman), and words for \n     occupations traditionally held by females (nurse, secretary, \n     prostitute), the English language defines everyone as male. \n     The hypothetical person (``If a man can walk 10 miles in two \n     hours . . . ), the average person (``the man in the street'') \n     and the active person (``the man on the move'') are male. The \n     assumption is that unless otherwise identified, people in \n     general--including doctors and beggars--are men.\n       ``It is a semantic mechanism that operates to keep women \n     invisible; `man' and `mankind' represent everyone; `he' in \n     generalized use refers to either sex; the ``land where our \n     fathers died'' is also the land of our mothers--although they \n     go unsung. As the beetle-browed and mustachioed man in a \n     Steig cartoon says to his two male drinking companions, `When \n     I speak of mankind, one thing I don't mean is womankind.' ''\n       Ms. Swift said yesterday that the idea for the article grew \n     out of their first collaboration as editors in 1970, on a sex \n     education handbook for high schools that talked about the \n     nature of man and man's behavior and used the pronoun ``he'' \n     in ways that made it impossible to know whether the author \n     was writing about both males and females or only about males.\n       ``We began to think this was a field that needed to be \n     written about and explored,'' Ms. Swift said.\n       Their articles on the subject first appeared in New York \n     magazine and in the first issue of Ms. magazine. The New York \n     Times Magazine article appeared on April 16, 1972, and ``got \n     an awful lot of negative comment,'' Ms. Swift said.\n       Casey Geddes Miller was born on Feb. 26, 1919, in Toledo, \n     Ohio. She received a bachelor of arts degree in 1940 from \n     Smith College, where she was a philosophy major. During World \n     War II, she served for three years in the Navy, working in \n     Washington in naval intelligence.\n       She was on the staff of Colonial Williamsburg from 1947 to \n     1954, when she became the curriculum editor of the publishing \n     house of the Episcopal Church, Seabury Press. Ten years \n     later, she became a free-lance editor, working at her home in \n     Greenwich and after 1967 in East Haddam, where she formed her \n     editorial partnership with Ms. Swift.\n       She is survived by her sisters, Kate R. Gregg of Falmouth, \n     Me., and Caroline S. Cooper of Gilmanton, N.H.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                         Taking on ``Mankind''\n\n       Gender-neutral phrases like postal carrier and police \n     officer roll off our tongues nowadays as if they had always \n     been a part of our linguistic consciousness. But we know \n     that's not true. Until a few years ago, the English language \n     was loaded with male-biased terms.\n       A turning point came in 1980, with the ``Handbook of \n     Nonsexist Writing,'' today considered the standard reference \n     on how to avoid degrading women with words. Its co-authors \n     were Casey Miller and Kate Swift of East Haddam.\n       Ms. Miller died Sunday at the age of 77.\n       In dozens of magazine articles and two books, Ms. Miller \n     and Ms. Swift made a strong case for banishing gender-biased \n     words from our everyday language.\n       Many of their proposals--such as eliminating suffixes -ess \n     and -ette and replacing loaded words like ``craftsman'' with \n     the neutral ``artisan''--have been widely adopted.\n\n[[Page S1126]]\n\n       The two authors drew attention to other sexist expressions, \n     from founding fathers to working wife to old wives' tale, \n     arguing that prejudices in language reflect the mostly white, \n     Anglo-Saxon patriarchal society in which our grammar and \n     vocabulary developed. Such terms are destructive, Ms. Miller \n     and Ms. Swift wrote, because they perpetuate stereotypes \n     demeaning to women.\n       Theirs were persuasive arguments.\n       A graduate of Smith College, Ms. Miller's lifelong passions \n     were words and language. As a lieutenant during World War II, \n     she helped to break codes used by Japanese in the Pacific. \n     Later she worked in publishing before moving to East Haddam \n     in 1967 to begin her career as a freelance editor and writer.\n       Although hers was not a household name, Ms. Miller has left \n     a more lasting legacy than others who have achieved celebrity \n     status: Changing the way Americans write and speak.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleagues for allowing me to digress. Mr. \nPresident, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/07/senate-section/article/S1125-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1126-S1130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  The Senate continued with consideration of the resolution.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank my colleague from the State of Connecticut. Mr. \nPresident, I am pleased to have an opportunity to make some remarks \nabout the balanced budget amendment. It is my understanding the \nminority leader may come to the floor to speak, and if he does I am \nhappy to interrupt my remarks to provide him an opportunity to make \nwhatever remarks he plans to make.\n  Mr. President, when we discuss the balanced budget amendment, we are \nusually talking about the impact of runaway spending on our economy or \non our future. These are fundamental considerations, but I think there \nis another consideration that we must not lose sight of, and that is, \nperhaps, more fundamental and more profound than the economic \nimplications of the balanced budget. A protracted deficit spending \nempowers the central Government with the means to undermine our basic \nliberties. What I really mean to say is that unlimited spending by \nGovernment promotes unlimited Government, and unlimited Government \nmeans limited freedom. There is a relationship between the size of \nGovernment and the number of its prerogatives and the size of \nindividuals and the number of their prerogatives.\n  For how we tax and spend, really, in fact, determines whether we are \nprosperous or poor, free or enslaved, good or evil. I believe if we \nwant to be free, we have always to be careful about the size of \nGovernment.\n  Now, the acknowledgment that we can control Government by controlling \nits power of the purse is not new. From the very beginnings of this \nRepublic there has been a clear understanding that if you could control \nthe purse, if you could limit spending, you could limit the \nencroachment of Government upon the freedom of individuals. Money is \nand money has always been the source of Government's most basic power. \nHistory bears testament to this truth.\n  The Magna Carta, which was signed grudgingly by King John a few \ncenturies ago--I might add, no relation, King John, but the name is \nstill in current use--prescribed that the monarchy could not impose \ntaxes, and King John grudgingly signed this, the monarchy could not \nimpose taxes without the consent of the Great Council. Charles I was \nexecuted because he tried to spend money without the consent of the \nCommons. And our own Declaration of Independence talks of injuries and \nusurpations, not the least of which was George III's imposition of \ntaxes without representation, taxes without the consent or \nparticipation in the decisionmaking by colonial residents.\n  Mr. President, deficit spending has wrested power from the people. It \nhas taken power from the next generation and brought it to this \ngeneration, the power to decide how the resources of our own children \nwill be spent. It has deposited this power in the Halls of Congress.\n  We are not only taking the freedom of this generation when we spend \nin deficit, we are taking the freedom of the next generation, so that \nwe have a compound problem here. The extent and reach of Government \nencroaches upon the capacity of individuals to live freely, not only in \nthe present time but because we are funding this overreaching of \nGovernment with deficit spending, it encroaches upon the freedom of the \nnext generation.\n  This is an inversion of the will of the Framers of the Constitution. \nIt is an invasion of the social contract in which our forefathers \ndeveloped this country. It takes the power from the people and puts it \nin the hands of the Congress. And really what Congress' enterprise \nought to be is empowering people. It is time to return to the people \nthe ability to control their own lives, their future and their destiny \nand to begin to assure the next generation that we will not have \nexercised their prerogatives, we will not have made their choices about \nhow to spend their resources, but that we will, indeed, protect some of \nthat prerogative which they rightfully have which they ought to enjoy. \nAnother way of saying this is that it is simply immoral to tax unborn \ngenerations of Americans in anticipation of their existence in order to \nsatisfy our undisciplined consumption that is a result of deficit \nspending.\n  Mr. President, Congress today does not have to vote to raise more \nrevenue in order to spend more money. We have gone through a transition \nfrom tax and spend, which is an arguable proposition, to borrow and \nspend, which is certainly a very questionable proposition. We now are \nin a category of steal and spend, because borrowing without the \nintention or capacity to pay back by those who are doing the borrowing \nis something that is categorized in the law as something far different \nfrom borrowing. People who go to borrow without the intention to pay \nback are stealing. Most State statutes call it stealing by deceit. When \nwe in this generation borrow without the intention or capacity to repay \nthose moneys which we have borrowed, we, in fact, are stealing from the \nnext generation. We cannot have their consent to take their resources \nbecause they do not exist yet. We are taking resources from our \nchildren and grandchildren at a time before they are even born. We are \nborrowing without the intention to pay back. We have gone from tax and \nspend to borrow and spend, and I daresay, now we find ourselves in the \nmoral reprobate position of stealing from the next generation to spend.\n  I spent some time as attorney general of my State. I had the \nprivilege of serving the people of Missouri for 8 years as attorney \ngeneral. It is the attorney general's responsibility to uphold the \nconvictions of individuals who have violated the law. Among those are \npeople who abuse children. I think child abuse is reprehensible. It is \nbeyond my comprehension how someone would abuse a child, let alone his \nor her own child.\n  But most of the people who abuse children would not think of stealing \nfrom children, or stealing from their own children. I find it to be \nabhorrent and immoral, and it is very unwise that we would take from \nour own children the capacity that they ought to have to be free, and \nthat we would somehow wrest from them the decisionmaking capacity of \nfree citizens in the next generation to decide how to deploy the \nresources that they generate. We would have already made the decisions, \nwe would already have consumed the benefits, and we would send to them \nnothing more nor less than the bill--the debt to be paid.\n  We owe our children so much more than that. Tax and spend was bad; \nborrow and spend was worse. When we got to a situation where we could \nnot repay that which we had borrowed, it became stealing by deceit, and \nsteal and spend is morally reprehensible and must be curtailed, it must \nbe stopped.\n  The ability to take resources of the next generation is unique to the \nCongress. No father can create debts which are visited upon his or her \nson or daughter. No mother can create a debt that can be visited upon \nher son or daughter. The law simply does not allow the debts of a \nparent to be imposed upon a child. Only in one universe can this \nhappen, and it can only happen when the people of this country, through \ntheir Congress, create a debt which will be visited on those who are \nyet unborn, will be used as a set-off to garnishee the wages that are \nyet unearned. It's time that we stop.\n\n[[Page S1127]]\n\n  No family in America finds its children encumbered by the debts of \nparents. The American people are fed up with a Congress that spends \nthese yet unearned wages of the next generation, and rightly so. It is \nmore than economics; it is a matter of freedom. Second it is more than \nfreedom; it is a matter of integrity.\n  Mr. President, deficit spending is not only a threat to our posterity \nand our children's future, it is a method by which Washington's elite \ncircumvent the public, the law, and the Constitution. When the people \nexpress the belief that Government is out of control, they are correct. \nFor too long, this body has satisfied the appetites of narrow interests \nat the public's expense. Where is the accountability to taxpayers? \nWhere is the will to do that which is right?\n  Mr. President, we have tried time and time again to deal with this \nproblem of recurring chronic debt. In terms of the medical profession, \nthis is not an acute problem that lasts momentarily and then is gone, \nthis is a chronic problem. These copies of out-of-balance budgets for \nthe United States, year after year--I believe there are only 28 years \nstacked here. Over the last 60 years, you can more than double, perhaps \ntriple, the volume represented by these out-of-balance budgets. They \nrepresent the absence of our capacity to discipline ourselves to stop \nspending someone else's money, to stop borrowing someone else's money, \nto stop stealing by deceit the resources of the next generation.\n  In 1985, we tried something. It was a noble endeavor. To be commended \nare Senators Gramm, former Senator Rudman, and Senator Hollings in the \nGramm-Rudman-Hollings Act. Then again we didn't have the will to carry \nthrough, and we changed the law so we could change the rules because we \ncould not change our habits. We put Gramm-Rudman II in place in 1987. \nThen we changed the law and we changed the rules because we could not \nchange our habits and broke that agreement. When the Budget Enforcement \nAct of 1990 went into effect, again, we found ourselves changing the \nlaw and the rules because we could not break our habit. It becomes \napparent to me that we need to do more than just have laws and rules, \nbecause we never have been able, in the face of our bad habit, to \nmaintain our commitment to the rules or to the laws. We have simply \nchanged the law and broken the rules because we could not break the \nhabit.\n  We need systemic change, something that goes to the very heart of us, \nthat forbids this insistent expropriation, taking away from the next \ngeneration. It is simply that we need to put into the Constitution an \nimmutable, unchangeable document, a kind of capacity to provide the \ndiscipline we have lacked and lacked consistently. I think we need to \nsummon the discipline to restrain Government. It is obvious that \nRepublican and Democrat Congresses have not had it. Republican and \nDemocrat Presidents have not had it. It is time for us to provide a \nbackbone implant, if you will, for the Congress of the United States to \nplace in the Constitution of the United States this discipline.\n  While one Senate cannot bind the next Senate, and hasn't because we \nhave changed the laws and changed the rules because we could not break \nthe habit, our Constitution can provide that discipline. Persons born \nin 1900 paid, roughly, 24 percent of their income in Federal and local \nnet taxes. Persons born in 1970 will pay about 34 percent of their \nincome in net taxes. If the policies that we have in place now remain, \npersons born in 1994 and thereafter will find themselves, over the \ncourse of their lifetimes, paying a net tax rate of about 84 percent. \nIt is a trend which cannot continue. It is taxation without \nrepresentation. It is an expropriation of the freedom and opportunity \nof the next generation. It is immoral, it is obscene, and it must end.\n\n  As Thomas Jefferson stated in a letter to James Madison in 1789:\n\n       The question whether one generation of men has a right to \n     bind another * * * is a question of such consequence as not \n     only to merit discussion, but place also, among the \n     fundamental principles of every government.\n\n  We must place it among the fundamental principles of our Government \nby enshrining the balanced budget amendment in our Constitution.\n  Now, there is some quibbling about whether those who founded this \ngreat Nation would have wanted the balanced budget amendment in the \nConstitution. I must say to you that there were certain presumptions \nthat surrounded most individuals who assembled to create the finest \ndocument ever written by human hand--the U.S. Constitution. One \npresumption was the presumption of integrity and the presumption of \nresponsibility that the Founders expected of those in Government. \nTragically, that presumption is unwarranted as it relates to the \nCongress today. I believe, absent their ability to rely upon the \nintegrity and determination of the Congress, they would gladly have \nplaced in the Constitution a framework which would have required such \nresponsibility.\n  Mr. President, I send to the desk for inclusion into the Record the \nletter of Thomas Jefferson to James Madison, written in Paris on \nSeptember 6, 1789.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record following my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, during this debate, we have heard \nfrequently that there is not a need to amend the Constitution. There is \nauthority, we are told, for Congress to do what is right if we simply \nexercise greater fiscal discipline. No one in this Chamber has ever \nargued that there is inadequate authority for balancing the budget. But \nthese unbalanced budgets are a testimony which is undeniable, not to \nthe absence of authority, but to the absence of discipline. It is time \nthat we, who have experienced a collective loss of will, provide a \nstructure in which we cannot allow this abuse of the future of the \nUnited States to continue.\n  The balanced budget amendment is real reform, and it will be felt. I \nhad the privilege of serving my State as Governor. I have seen what \nhappens when there is a framework and structure which demands \ndiscipline. I know that for 8 years we balanced our budgets. As a \nmatter of fact, we aimed for a little surplus so we could create a \nrainy day fund so that when times got tough, we could simply call upon \nthose resources that we had developed when times were good. And it was \nnot only an appropriate way to do business because it was moral and \nbecause it didn't steal from the next generation. It was an appropriate \nway to do business because it was very healthy for the State \neconomically. And over and over again our State was rated at the very \ntop with the highest bond rating--the highest financial rating of any \nState in the country because it was understood that we had this concern \nabout the integrity of our fiscal affairs.\n\n  So, Mr. President, let me just say a balanced budget amendment is \nreal reform. It will reestablish the historical responsibilities \nobserved in this country that we could have balanced budgets, except in \ntimes of war, which is something that should be assumed. But it cannot \nbe assumed and must be institutionalized.\n  It is also a political reform that will be felt first and foremost in \nthe cold corridors of power here on the Potomac. Most importantly, it \nwill be felt by the American people who will have their right to self-\ngovernance restored.\n  Over two centuries ago Edmund Burke reminded members of the British \nHouse of Commons of a fundamental principle. Burke said: ``The people \nmust possess the power of granting their own money or no shadow of \nliberty can subsist.''\n  The truth of the matter is that, if the people do not have power over \ntheir own purse strings and if we can extend our Republic of Government \nby borrowing or stealing from the next generation, we indeed will have \nseriously eroded the liberty which we are entitled to in this country.\n  We need to safeguard those liberties which were first inscribed in \nthe Magna Carta in 1215 preserved by the blood of patriots on \ncontinents around the world. We must return the power of the purse to \nthe people. We must stop stealing from our children. We must stop \nstealing by deceit.\n  Mr. President, the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution not \nonly has to do with economics and the economy, and not only has to do \nwith\n\n[[Page S1128]]\n\nprosperity. It is a problem about integrity, and it is a challenge \nrelating to liberty. And we must embrace it and offer it to the people \nof the United States for ratification.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n letter from thomas jefferson to james madison, paris September 6, 1789\n\n       Dear Sir: I sit down to write to you without knowing by \n     what occasion I shall send my letter. I do it because a \n     subject comes into my head which I would wish to develop a \n     little more than is practicable in the hurry of * * * of \n     making up general dispatches.\n       The question Whether one generation of men has a right to \n     bind another, seems never to have been started either on this \n     or our side of the water. Yet it is a question of such \n     consequences as not only to merit decision, but place also, \n     among the fundamental principles of every government. The \n     course of reflection in which we are immersed here on the \n     elementary principles of society has presented this question \n     to my mind; and that no such obligation can be so transmitted \n     I think very capable of proof.--I set out on this ground, \n     which I suppose to be self evident, `that the earth belongs \n     in usufruct to the living': that the dead have neither powers \n     nor rights over it. The portion occupied by any individual \n     ceases to be his when himself ceases to be, and reverts to \n     the society. If the society has formed no rules for the \n     appropriation of it's lands in severality, it will be taken \n     by the first occupants. These will generally be the wife and \n     children of the decendent. If they have formed rules of \n     appropriation, those rules may give it to the wife and \n     children, or to some one of them, or to the legatee of the \n     deceased. So they may give it to his creditor. But the child, \n     the legatee, or creditor takes it, not by any natural right, \n     but by a law of the society of which they are members, and to \n     which they are subject. Then no man can, be natural right, \n     oblige the lands he occupied, or the persons who succeed him \n     in that occupation, to the paiment of debts contracted by \n     him. For if he could, he might, during his own life, eat up \n     the usufruct of the lands for several generations to come, \n     and then the lands would belong to the dead, and not to the \n     living, which would be the reverse of our principle.\n       What is true of every member of the society individually, \n     is true of them all collectively, since the rights of the \n     whole can be no more than the sum of the rights of the \n     individuals.--To keep our ideas clear when applying them to a \n     multitude, let us suppose a whole generation of men to be \n     born on the same day, to attain mature age on the same \n     day, and to die on the same day, leaving a succeeding \n     generation in the moment of attaining their mature age all \n     together. Let the ripe age be supposed of 21. years, and \n     their period of life 34. years more, that being the \n     average term given by the bills of mortality to persons \n     who have already attained 21. years of age. Each \n     successive generation would, in this way, come on, and go \n     off the stage at a fixed moment, as individuals do now. \n     Then I say the earth belongs to each of these generations, \n     during it's course, fully, and in their own right. The 2d. \n     generation receives it clear of the debts and \n     incumberances of the 1st. the 3d of the 2d. and so on. For \n     if the 1st. could charge it with a debt, then the earth \n     would belong to the dead and not the living generation. \n     Then no generation can contract debts greater than may be \n     paid during the course of it's own existence. At 21. years \n     of age they may bind themselves and their lands for 34. \n     years to come: at 22. for 33: at 23. for 32. and at 54. \n     for one year only; because these are the terms of life \n     which remain to them at those respective epochs.--But a \n     material difference must be noted between the succession \n     of an individual, and that of a whole generation. \n     Individuals are parts only of a society, subject to the \n     laws of the whole. These laws may appropriate the portion \n     of land occupied by a decedent to his creditor rather than \n     to any other, or to his child on condition he satisfies \n     the creditor. But when a whole generation, that is, the \n     whole society dies, as in the case we have supposed, and \n     another generation or society succeeds, this forms a \n     whole, and there is no superior who can give their \n     territory to a third society, who may have lent money to \n     their predecessors beyond their faculties of paying.\n       What is true of a generation all arriving to self-\n     government on the same day, and dying all on the same day, is \n     true of those in a constant course of decay and renewal, with \n     this only difference. A generation coming in and going out \n     entire, as in the first case, would have a right in the \n     1st. year of their self-dominion to contract a debt for \n     33. years, in the 10th. for 24. in the 20th. for 14. in \n     the 30th for 4. whereas generations, changing daily by \n     daily deaths and births, have one constant term, beginning \n     at the date of their contract, and ending when a majority \n     of those of full age at that date shall be dead. The \n     length of that term may be estimated from the tables of \n     mortality, corrected by the circumstances of climate, \n     occupation  peculiar to the country of the contractors. \n     Take, for in stance, the table of M. de Buffon wherein he \n     states 23,994 deaths, and the ages at which they happened. \n     Suppose a society in which 23,994 persons are born every \n     year, and live to the ages stated in this table. The \n     conditions of that society will be as follows 1st. It will \n     consist constantly of 617,703 persons of all ages. 2ly. Of \n     those living at any one instant of time, one half will be \n     dead in 24. years 8. months. 3dly. 10,675 will arrive \n     every year at the age of 21. years complete. 4ly. It will \n     constantly have 348,417 persons of all ages above 21. \n     years. 5ly. And the half of those of 21. years and upwards \n     living at any one instant of time will be dead in 18. \n     years 8. months, or say 19. years as the nearest integral \n     number. Then 19. years is the term beyond which neither \n     the representatives of a nation, nor even the whole nation \n     itself assembled, can validly extend a debt.\n       To render this conclusion palpable by example, suppose that \n     Louis XIV. and XV. has contracted debts in the name of the \n     French nation to the amount of 10,000 milliards of livres, \n     and that the whole has been contracted in Genoa. The interest \n     of this sum would be 500. milliards, which is said to be the \n     whole rent roll or nett proceeds of the territory of France. \n     Must the present generation of men have retired from the \n     territory in which nature produced them, and ceded it to the \n     Genoese creditors? No. They have the same rights over the \n     soil on which they were produced, as the preceding \n     generations had. They derive these rights not from their \n     predecessors, but from nature. They then and their soil \n     are by nature clear of the debts of their predecessors.\n       Again suppose Louis XV, and his cotemporary generation had \n     said to the money-lenders of Genoa, give us money that we may \n     eat, drink, and be merry in our day; and on condition you \n     will demand no interest till the end of 19 years you shall \n     then for ever after receive an annual interest of 12\\5/8\\ per \n     cent.\\1\\ The money is lent on these conditions, is divided \n     among the living, eaten, drank, and squandered. Would the \n     present generation be obliged to apply the produce of the \n     earth and of their labour to replace their dissipations? Not \n     at all.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ 100, at a compound interest of 5. per cent, \n     makes at the end of 19. years, an aggregate of principal and \n     interest of 252-14, the interest of which is \n     12 12-12s-7d which is nearly 12\\5/8\\ per cent on \n     the first capital of 100. .\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       I suppose that the received opinion, that the public debts \n     of one generation devolve on the next, has been suggested by \n     our seeing habitually in private life that he who succeeds to \n     lands is required to pay the debts of his ancestor or \n     testator: without considering that this requisition is \n     municipal only, not moral; flowing from the will of the \n     society, which has found it convenient to appropriate lands, \n     become vacant by the death of their occupant, on the \n     condition of a paiment of his debts: but that between society \n     and society, or generation and generation, there is no \n     municipal obligation, no umpire but the law of nature. We \n     seem not to have perceived that, by the law of nature, one \n     generation is to another as one independant nation to \n     another.\n       The interest of the national debt of France being in fact \n     but a two thousandth part of it's rent roll, the paiment of \n     it is practicable enough: and so becomes a question merely of \n     honor, or of expediency. But with respect to future debts, \n     would it not be wise and just for that nation to declare, in \n     the constitution they are forming, that neither the \n     legislature, nor the nation itself, can validly contract \n     more debt than they may pay within their own age, or \n     within the term of 19 years? And that all future contracts \n     will be deemed void as to what shall remain unpaid at the \n     end of 19 years from their date? This would put the \n     lenders, and the borrowers also, on their guard. By \n     reducing too the faculty of borrowing within it's natural \n     limits, it would bridle the spirit of war, to which too \n     free a course has been procured by the inattention of \n     money-lenders to this law of nature, that succeeding \n     generations are not responsible for the preceding.\n       On similar ground it may be proved that no society can make \n     a perpetual constitution, or even a perpetual law. The earth \n     belongs always to the living generation. They may manage it \n     then, and what proceeds from it, as they please, during their \n     usufruct. They are masters too of their own persons, and \n     consequently may govern them as they please. But persons and \n     property make the sum of the objects of government. The \n     constitution and the laws of their predecessors [are] \n     extinguished then in their natural course with those who gave \n     them being. This could preserve that being till it ceased to \n     be itself, and no longer. Every constitution then, and every \n     law, naturally expires at the end of 19 years. If it be \n     enforced longer, it is an act of force, and not of right.--It \n     may be said that the succeeding generation exercising in fact \n     the power of repeal, this leaves them as free as if the \n     constitution or law had been expressly limited to 19 years \n     only. In the first place, this objection admits the right, in \n     proposing an equivalent. But the power of repeal is not an \n     equivalent. It might be indeed if every form of government \n     were so perfectly contrived that the will of the majority \n     could always be obtained fairly and without impediment. But \n     this is true of no form. The people cannot assemble \n     themselves. Their representation is unequal and vicious. \n     Various checks are opposed to every legislative proposition. \n     Factions get possession of the public councils. Bribery \n     corrupts them. Personal interests lead them astray from the \n     general interests of their constituents: and other \n     impediments arise so as to prove to every practical man \n     that a law of limited duration is much more manageable \n     than one which needs a repeal.\n       This principle that the earth belongs to the living, and \n     not to the dead, is of very extensive application and \n     consequences, in every country, and most especially in \n     France. It enters into the resolution of the\n\n[[Page S1129]]\n\n     questions. Whether the nation may change the descent of lands \n     holden in tail? Whether they may change the appropriation of \n     lands given antiently to the church, to hospitals, colleges, \n     orders of chivalry, and otherwise in perpetuity? Whether they \n     may abolish the charges and privileges attached on lands, \n     including the whole catalogue ecclesiastical and feudal? It \n     goes to hereditary offices, authorities and jurisdictions; to \n     hereditary orders, distinctions and appellations; to \n     perpetual monopolies in commerce, the arts and sciences; with \n     a long train of et ceteras: and it renders the question of \n     reimbursement a question of generosity and not of right. In \n     all these cases, the legislature of the day could authorize \n     such appropriations and establishments for their own time, \n     but no longer; and the present holders, even where they, or \n     their ancestors, have purchased, are in the case of bona fide \n     purchasers of what the seller had no right to convey.\n       Turn this subject in your mind, my dear Sir, and \n     particularly as to the power of contracting debts; and \n     develope it with that perspicuity and cogent logic so \n     peculiarly yours. Your station in the councils of our country \n     gives you an opportunity of producing it to public \n     consideration, of forcing it into discussion. At first blush \n     it may be rallied, as a theoretical speculation: but \n     examination will prove it to be solid and salutary. It would \n     furnish matter for a fine preamble to our first law for \n     appropriating the public revenue; and it will exclude at the \n     threshold of our new government the contagious and ruinous \n     errors of this quarter of the globe, which have armed despots \n     with means, not sanctioned by nature, for binding in \n     chains their fellow men. We have already given in example \n     one effectual check to the Dog of war by transferring the \n     power of letting him loose from the Executive to the \n     Legislative body, from those who are to spend to those who \n     are to pay. I should be pleased to see this second \n     obstacle held our by us also in the first instance. No \n     nation can make a declaration against the validity of \n     long-contracted debts so disinterestedly as we, since we \n     do not owe a shilling which may not be paid with ease, \n     principal and interest, within the time of our own \n     lives.--Establish the principle also in the new law to be \n     passed for protecting copyrights and new inventions, by \n     securing the exclusive right for 19, instead of 14, years. \n     Besides familiarising us to this term, it will be an \n     instance the more of our taking reason for our guide, \n     instead of English precedent, the habit of which fetters \n     us with all the political heresies of a nation equally \n     remarkeable for it's early excitement from some errors, \n     and long slumbering under others.\n       I write you no news, because, when an occasion occurs, I \n     shall write a separate letter for that, I am always with \n     great & sincere esteem, dear Sir Your affectionate friend & \n     servt.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today we begin the debate about the \nbudget resolution. As everyone knows, yesterday the President sent to \nCongress his plan for a balanced budget. The way we receive that budget \nwill be the first real test of our ability and our willingness in this \nCongress to find bipartisan consensus on a budget.\n  Is bipartisanship truly our goal, or is it merely a PR strategy? The \ndebate that begins today will go a long way on both sides of the aisle \ntoward answering that question.\n  The plan the President is sending us balances the Federal budget by \nthe year 2002 while protecting our priorities. It invests in America's \nfuture, and pays for those investments.\n  The President's budget offers targeted tax relief for homeowners and \nfamilies with children; for parents who are struggling to save for \ntheir children's college education, and workers who are trying to save \nfor their own retirement; for companies involved in environmental \ncleanup and converting old industrial sites into new hubs of \nopportunity.\n  The budget provides a strong framework for a bipartisan agreement. It \nreflects 2 years of hard negotiations, and contains ideas advocated by \nboth parties.\n  With the requisite sense of purpose and political will, this Congress \ncan enact a balanced budget that protects important national priorities \nthis year. That is my goal, and I am committed to making it happen.\n  It does not take a miracle to balance the budget. I know. I helped \nwrite a plan last year that balanced the budget by the year 2002--and \nprotected Medicare, education, and the environment. I voted for it. And \nso did a lot of other people.\n  The President adopted the plan. And the President is submitting a \nmodified version of that very plan today. So he knows it does not take \na miracle to balance the budget. The President has shown us a blueprint \nthat will allow us to make that a reality.\n  It also doesn't require a constitutional amendment. The President's \nbudget will balance the budget by the year 2002 without it.\n  But let me be clear. I support a balanced budget amendment. I have \nsince I was first elected to Congress. I have voted for amendments in \nthe past. I have opposed other amendments. And I will support a \nbalanced budget amendment again this year.\n  But it has to be the right amendment. There is a difference between \nsupporting a responsible amendment and supporting any balanced budget \namendment.\n  Senator Dorgan and I and others are cosponsoring an amendment that \nrequires Congress to pass a balanced budget without looting the Social \nSecurity trust funds.\n  The version of the amendment now before the Senate contains no such \nprotection.\n  It places current retirees in the most immediate danger. Let me read \na letter from the President that I received just last week. In that \nletter the President states:\n\n       In the event of an impasse in which the budget requirements \n     can neither be waived nor met, disbursement of Social \n     Security checks could cease or unelected judges could reduce \n     benefits to comply with this constitutional mandate.\n\n  That was a letter from the President just last week.\n  Social Security has never been a day late or a dollar short. The \namendment should not force us to break that historic contract.\n  This version of the amendment also places future retirees at risk. \nThe heart of the 1983 bipartisan agreement that rescued Social Security \nwas a plan to set aside funds for baby boomers' retirement. Because of \nthat plan, Social Security is now running huge surpluses. This year \nalone that surplus is expected to be $78 billion. By the year 2002, it \nis expected to be $104 billion. By 2019, when many of the baby boomers \nstart to retire, the Social Security trust funds will have built up a \n$3 trillion surplus, which will be absolutely necessary to pay the \nretirees at that time.\n  But, if we pass this version of the balanced budget amendment, none \nof those funds will be available to pay the Social Security benefits.\n  This amendment says clearly, ``Total outlays for any fiscal year \nshall not exceed total receipts for that year.'' Total outlays, \nincluding Social Security.\n  The Government would be forbidden not only from running a deficit, \nbut also from drawing down the surplus.\n  Social Security benefits could be paid only from taxes raised in the \nsame year. That means, when the baby boomers retire, Congress would \nhave to raise taxes dramatically, or slash Social Security benefits \ndeeply--or both.\n  In addition, this version of the amendment cheats working families.\n  American workers are paying more in payroll taxes today than is \nneeded to cover the Social Security checks that go out. The surplus \nrevenues are supposed to be set aside to meet their future retirement \nneeds. If we pass this amendment without exempting Social Security, the \nGovernment cannot save those tax dollars to pay for future Social \nSecurity needs of the baby boomers. Instead, the money will be diverted \nto other Government programs, to everything from highways to salaries \nof Members of Congress.\n\n  More than half of American taxpayers, 58 percent, pay more in Social \nSecurity taxes than they do in income tax. These taxes place a \ndisproportionately heavy burden on low and moderate-income families. It \nis justifiable to levy these taxes if they are truly set aside for \nSocial Security, but it is inexcusable if they are used to pay for \ngeneral Government operations. The Congress should not enshrine this \nabuse of the payroll tax in the U.S. Constitution.\n  The amendment that is before the Senate contains another flaw that I \nwill seek to change. It would limit in perpetuity how Congress can \ntreat capital investments in our future economic growth. If this \namendment\n\n[[Page S1130]]\n\npasses, any proposal to create a capital budget would be declared \nunconstitutional. A capital budget would allow us to differentiate \nbetween investments and operating costs like every single State in the \ncountry.\n  If we were to ask any Governor today, do you have a capital budget, \nthe answer is ``yes.'' If we would ask any Governor today, if you had \nto work under the same accounting devices that we do at the Federal \nlevel, a unified budget, would you have a balanced budget, chances are \nin every single case the answer would be, ``no, we would have a \ndeficit.'' We would have a large deficit, billions of dollars of \ndeficit. Why? Because for many, many years, in some cases from the very \nbeginning of a State's history, they have known the importance of \ndifferentiating between capital investments and operating costs, \nknowing that you do not treat an investment long term like you do \nsomebody's lunch.\n  I think it is very important for this country to differentiate in \nthat regard at some point in the future as well. And for us at this \ndate, regardless of how one feels about a capital budget, to say that \nfrom here on out we are going to make it unconstitutional for this \ncountry to even consider budgeting the way we do in business, the way \nwe do in families, the way we do in States, in my view is \nextraordinarily dangerous to this country's economic health and well-\nbeing.\n  How many times have we heard on this Senate floor the following \nphrase: this Government ought to budget its expenditures the way a \nfamily does. We ought to treat our budget the way every single family \ntreats its budget.\n  Mr. President, there are not many families I know of that pay off \ntheir mortgage in 1 year. How many families today say that they have a \nbalanced budget, taking into account the mortgage that they themselves \nmust pay? Few families today would have the ability to pay off a \nmortgage in 1 year. But we are asking the Federal Government to pay off \nevery one of its mortgages in each year, to treat a mortgage the same \nway we treat a bill for the lights which run this building.\n  There is a big difference, and I think the time has come for this \ncountry to have a capital budget. Regardless, as I say, the real \nquestion is, should we have an accounting system like families, like \nbusinesses, like States? I hope the answer is ``yes,'' someday, and I \nhope we will have the foresight, regardless of what we may think of a \nbudgeting system of that kind, to at least say that the Senate has the \nright to consider a capital budget at some point in the future. To make \nit expressly unconstitutional, in my view, is extraordinary.\n  I ask all of my colleagues to think very carefully about the \namendment we write. I have also heard so often Senators come to the \nfloor and say this bill is not perfect; this amendment is not the best \nwe can do, but let us accept the fact that we can improve on it at some \npoint in the future.\n  I hope no one in this entire debate will ever come to the floor and \nsay this bill is not perfect, this amendment to the U.S. Constitution \nmay not be perfect, because we do not have the luxury of coming back \nand amending it. We do not have the luxury of altering it once it \nbecomes part of the U.S. Constitution. We tried that once before with \nprohibition, and it took another constitutional amendment to undo the \ndamage we did the first time.\n  So let us not in any way, shape or form be content to satisfy our \nneed to pass an amendment and then say we are willing to accept \nsomething that is imperfect. We have imperfections in this amendment \nthat have to be dealt with. There is absolutely no reason to pay for \ndeficit spending with Social Security trust funds. There is no reason \nto constitutionally preclude us from dealing directly with the real \nneed to pass a capital budgeting system at some point in the future.\n  So let us be honest. Let us recognize that this amendment is not \nperfect; it needs to be changed; it needs to be amended in a \nconstructive way; it needs to take into account our future; it needs to \nrecognize that we have to be truthful with the American people; and it \nneeds at long last to be dealt with in a bipartisan way, with \nRepublicans and Democrats working together to fashion an amendment that \nmakes sense not only for us but for all posterity.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/07/senate-section/article/S1126-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1130-S1131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       PEOPLE HELPING PEOPLE--STORIES FROM THE WINTER OF 1996-97\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, one of the great fears of our time has \nbeen that America is slowly losing its sense of community and, with it, \nthe idea that each of us has a responsibility toward one another. \nToday, I am proud to say that all around America our spirit of \ncommunity remains strong. As you know, the Great Plains have been \nparalyzed this winter by terrible blizzards, high winds, and subzero \ntemperatures. But thanks to the efforts of individuals all over the \ncountry, I am happy to report this afternoon that we are pulling \nthrough.\n  I am proud to say that during the worst of the bitter cold and \nhowling winds, South Dakotans have been at their best. They have \nbundled up, put on their boots and trudged outside to help their \nfriends and neighbors--even perfect strangers--make it safely through \ndangerous storms.\n  Residents of the northern Great Plains are accustomed to harsh \nwinters. But all would agree, this winter has been especially brutal. \nSome say it is the worst we have seen this century. I remind you that \nmost of this century has already passed.\n  In the blizzards that descended upon us in January, wind chill \ntemperatures dropped to nearly 90 degrees below zero. Blowing snow \ncovered roads with drifts that were as high as 30 feet and 60 feet \nlong. Visibility dropped to less than a few feet as 60-mile-an-hour \nwinds whipped snow into swirling white walls, hiding everyone and \neverything before it.\n  With roads closed, thousands of South Dakotans were left with only \nthe food in their cupboards and a dwindling supply of propane to heat \ntheir homes. Even more seriously, travelers were left stranded on the \nhighways, and many of our elderly residents and those in need of \nmedical attention were cut off from any assistance.\n  I wish I could say that we survived these dangers unharmed, but I \ncannot. Five people have died directly as a result of these conditions. \nOthers have died in the aftermath of the repeated ice storms and \nblizzards. While today we honor the heroes of these difficult times, we \nmust also remember the victims. To those who lost loved ones this \nwinter, I want to say that our thoughts and our prayers are with you.\n  Our hearts also go out to those whose farms and homes and businesses \nhave been so hard hit by the heavy snow and cold. No one can know for \nsure how many livestock have died, but estimates range at least as high \nas 40,000. I urge all of those who have suffered loss not to go through \nthis tragedy alone. There is no shame in asking for help.\n  Despite our losses, the heavy toll of this winter could be much \nworse. Many might have died, but did not. Many might have gone without \nheat and food and medicine, but were brought needed supplies just in \ntime. This is due not to luck but to the simple fact that South \nDakotans from every walk of life have pitched in to ensure that we get \nthrough this winter as safely as we can and together.\n  No one can list the thousands of people who put themselves at risk to \nhelp the victims of these storms, and no one can tell all of their \nstories. Indeed, the few I want to relate today only scratch the \nsurface of those that might be told.\n  Time and again across South Dakota, neighbor has checked on neighbor, \nand families have taken in stranded travelers in need of assistance. \nEmergency snowmobile crews have teamed up with local police departments \nto ensure that doctors and nurses have made it to work over snow-\nclogged roads.\n  In fact, just last night my parents told me of a cousin of mine who \nleft his home at 3 o'clock in the morning, on a Saturday morning, to \ndrive 300 miles to buy a new snow blower he was going to use in the \ncommunity. He brought it\n\n[[Page S1131]]\n\nback that morning, and his wife told my parents that it was the single \nbiggest event that has occurred in that area in decades.\n\n  They have delivered medicine to the homebound and brought spare parts \nto farmers in need of aid. During the darkest, coldest parts of the \nblizzard that have torn through our State, they have risked their lives \nto rescue stranded motorists and brought life-saving medical attention \nto those in need.\n  One of those teams was the Drift Busters. The Drift Busters is a \nsnowmobile club in Aberdeen, my hometown, which went into action \nshortly after the onset of our most recent blizzard. Their quick action \nand bravery were instrumental in saving the residents of Aberdeen from \nserious harm.\n  One of the most threatening situations occurred when 2-year-old \nStetson Heirigs accidentally ingested poison and needed emergency care \nin a hospital. After a quick conference call with Stetson's family and \nthe poison control center, club president Duane Sutton drove his \nsnowmobile over 7 miles through darkness, blowing snow, and bitter cold \nto reach the family's home near Richmond Lake. Then, with the aid of a \ncomember, Dennis Beckler, he ensured that the boy reached the hospital \nsafely and received the treatment he needed just in time. Today Stetson \nis safe and healthy.\n  Extraordinary bravery has been a fact of life throughout the course \nof this winter. We have all heard the remarkable story of Karen Nelson, \na nursing home aide from Webster who was stranded for over 40 hours in \nher pickup after becoming disoriented on the roads she has driven her \nentire life. With her engine running for heat and her cellular phone \nher only link to the world, Karen waited through the hours of darkness, \ncrying and praying, as a team from around the State assembled to find \nher.\n  From Rapid City came aircraft equipped with special heat-seeking \nsensors to scour the drifts from the sky. From Watertown came experts \nin communications to triangulate the signal from Karen's phone and \nnarrow down her location. Meanwhile, Day County rescue teams in \nsnowmobiles and four-wheel-drive vehicles combed the roads for any sign \nof her car. At last she was found when she told the rescue team over \nher phone that she heard the sound of engines overhead. I cannot \nadequately express how proud we are of all the outstanding people that \nmade Karen's rescue possible, and of Karen for her bravery in enduring \nthose long, cold hours before the rescuers arrived.\n  Many of the dangerous circumstances of this winter have been found on \nSouth Dakota's Indian reservations. Blasted by blizzard after blizzard \nand woefully short of money and equipment, tribal workers have acted \ncourageously throughout this difficult season.\n  Of particular note are the Rescue Rangers of the Cheyenne River \nReservation, who during the height of the January blizzards led convoys \nof snowplows, ambulances, and four-wheel-drive vehicles to ensure that \nmedical attention was received where it was needed. In dangerous \nconditions, the Rescue Rangers plowed through 30-foot drifts packed \nharder than adobe by 80-mile-an-hour winds. Creating an even greater \nchallenge were the vast distances that had to be traveled to reach \nthose in need.\n  At one point this month, seven Rescue Rangers nearly froze after \nbecoming stranded on an 85-mile trip to provide medical attention to a \ntribal elder.\n  A truly heart-wrenching story was related to me by Gregg Bourland, \nchairman of the Cheyenne River Reservation, who told me of two families \nstranded in a snow-blocked pass on highway 63. After 14 hours, \nfrostbitten and certain that rescue would come too late, the parents \nplaced tags with vital information on each of their children so they \nmight be identified after they had died. Thankfully, the Rescue Rangers \narrived in time.\n  Luckily, not all of the stories of this winter are as terrible as \nthat. For instance, I was touched to learn of the Bredvik family, who \nopened their home to stranded motorists along I-29 near the North \nDakota border. While Lynn Bredvik picked up the travelers one by one in \nhis snowmobile and brought them home, his mother Dorothy opened up her \nkitchen and provided each with a hearty breakfast of eggs, sausage, \nbread, and, in South Dakota, lefse. When asked why she would open her \nhome to over a dozen strangers, Dorothy said it was ``old hat'' to her. \nIt is what families do during blizzards.\n\n  I think Dorothy has summed it up for all of us. Her actions might \nseem extraordinary to someone else, but for people like her they are \nold hat. We like to think of our State as the biggest small town in \nAmerica, where everyone is a member of the same community. We \nunderstand you cannot make it through this world alone and that we have \na responsibility to help each other whenever or wherever we can.\n  We will need to continue to do that because this winter is not over. \nWeather reports from South Dakota continue to tell us of minus-50 \ndegree windchills. We have received nearly 10 inches of new snow in the \npast couple of days, and there are over 2 more months of snow to come. \nWe need to make sure that the farmers and ranchers devastated by their \nlivestock losses can get the help they need and that low-income \nfamilies can keep their homes heated during this freezing weather.\n  We must prepare ourselves for the inevitable floods of spring. When \nthe great drifts that currently cover my State begin to melt, they will \nrelease their force on areas that have been declared Federal flood \ndisasters in the last 4 of 5 years. Simply put, come spring there will \nbe nowhere left for the water to go. We need to ensure that prompt \nFederal assistance is made available when this flooding occurs. These \nare difficult challenges to be sure, but together I am absolutely \nconvinced that we will overcome them. We always do.\n  Finally, I want to thank everyone whose help has been so vital to \nSouth Dakota. This has been more than an individual or a State effort. \nAmerica has pulled together. Our neighbors to the south, north, west \nand to the east have all helped and sent something--snowblowers, \nsnowplows, teams of rescue workers. For hours upon end, workers and \nsnowplows donated from States as far away as Texas have labored \nalongside our National Guard to keep the roads clear.\n  During the worst of the storms, when the Pine Ridge Indian \nReservation was cut off from the outside world, 25,000 pounds of food \nwere donated by Feed the Children, based in Oklahoma City, and \ndelivered to Pine Ridge by the 28th Transportation Squadron of \nEllsworth Air Force Base. Together they worked to ensure that no one \nwould go without food. Indeed, help has poured into South Dakota from \naround the country. Even as we speak, Federal Emergency Management \nAgency teams are fanning out over South Dakota to assess the damage and \nbring help where it is needed. Thanks to the rapid response of \nPresident Clinton, public and private agencies too numerous to mention, \nand the support of our friends and neighbors all over, I am proud to \nannounce to my colleagues this afternoon that we are pulling through.\n  So thank you, South Dakota, and thank you America. We are proud of \nyou. All of your stories will never be known but you can be sure that \nthey are alive in the hearts of those of us whom you have helped when \nwe needed it the most.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

In 1994, President Clinton named \nhim United States Ambassador to the Seychelles.\n  The Honorable Carl Stokes had a long and distinguished career before \nhis untimely passing in April of last year. In his eulogy for Mayor \nStokes, the Reverend Jesse Jackson called him ``a dream maker and an \nodds buster.''\n  That's exactly right.

Mr. President, today I offer my support to the \nPresident's nomination of the Honorable John F. Maisto to serve as \nUnited States Ambassador to the Republic of Venezuela. Mr. President, \nit has been my pleasure to know Ambassador Maisto and I have known him \nas the United States Ambassador to Nicaragua. He has served with great \ndistinction as our United States Ambassador to Nicaragua for the last 4 \nyears, helping that country make its very historic transition to full \ndemocracy.\n  In fact, Mr. President, I had occasion to be in Nicaragua this past \nNovember, and it just happened to be the week that the Ambassador and \nhis wife were leaving after 4 years. I had the opportunity to talk to \nNicaraguans clear across the political spectrum. I had the opportunity \nto talk to Nicaraguans with all kinds of background, Nicaraguans who \nhad many different political beliefs. But I found that it was unanimous \nthat our Ambassador had done a fantastic job--a fantastic job of \nrepresenting our country in a time in Nicaragua's history that was \ncrucial for not only democracy to continue to develop in Nicaragua, but \nalso crucial for our continuing relationship with this country, which \nwe have had such a long relationship with in the past.\n\n  It was very clear to me, after talking to the many Nicaraguans that I \nsaw, that our Ambassador was very well respected and that he had \nrepresented us exceedingly well.\n  Mr. President, before his posting to Managua, Ambassador Maisto had \nserved as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American \nAffairs. He also served as Deputy U.S. Representative to the \nOrganization of American States, and Deputy Chief of Mission in the \nUnited States Embassy in Panama.\n  Mr. President, this is a man whose hands-on experience with Latin \nAmerica will serve us very well. It has served us in the past and will \ncontinue to serve us. Mr. President, the Ambassador will be an \noutstanding Ambassador to Venezuela, and I urge that his nomination be \nconfirmed.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A bill to provide for the management of the airspace over \nunits of the National Park System, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n           the national parks airspace management act of 1997\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, in behalf of myself, Senator Frist, and \nSenator Inouye, I am today introducing the National Parks Airspace \nManagement Act of 1997, a bill designed to mitigate the impact of \ncommercial air tour flights over units of the National Park System. The \nmeasure would establish a new, statutory framework for minimizing the \nenvironmental effects of air tour activity on park units. This measure \nis similar to legislation I offered in the last two Congresses.\n  Briefly, our bill would specify the respective authorities of the \nNational Park Service and the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] in \ndeveloping and enforcing park overflight policy; establish a process \nfor developing individualized airspace management plans at parks \nexperiencing significant commercial air tour activity; provide for the \ndesignation of those parks which did not experience commercial air tour \nactivity as of January 1, 1997, as flight-free parks; establish a new, \nsingle standard governing the certification and operation of all \ncommercial air tour operators that conduct flights over national parks; \nrequire a variety of safety measures, such as improved aircraft \nmarkings, maintenance of accurate aeronautical charts, installation of \nflight monitoring equipment, and an air tour data base; and, establish \na National Park Overflight Advisory Council.\n   Mr. President, aircraft overflights of noise-sensitive areas such as \nnational parks have been increasing in scope and intensity for a number \nof years, sparking significant public debate and controversy about the \nsafety and environmental impact of such activity. The focus of much of \nthe debate, and much of the controversy, has been the commercial air \ntour sightseeing industry, which has experienced explosive growth in \nsome areas, notably at the Grand Canyon and in my own State of Hawaii. \nBut significant commercial air tour activity has also been developing \nin such widely dispersed locations as Glacier National Park in Montana, \nthe Utah national parks, Mount Rushmore in South Dakota, and the Statue \nof Liberty and Niagara Falls in New York. In fact, at Great Smoky \nMountains National Park, commercial air tour overflights have fostered \nsuch opposition that the State of Tennessee has passed legislation to \nrestrict such flights.\n  In 1987, precipitated by a midair collision at the Grand Canyon, \nCongress adopted the National Parks Overflights Act, Public Law 100-91. \nThe act permanently banned below-the-rim flights at the Grand Canyon \nand led to a Special Federal Aviation Regulation--SFAR 50-2--\nestablishing flight-free zones and air corridors at the park. The act \nalso established temporary altitude restrictions for Yosemite National \nPark in California and Haleakala National Park in Hawaii. Finally, \nPublic Law 100-91 mandated that the Park Service conduct a study on the \nimpact of low-level flights on units of the National Park System.\n\n  Since passage of the National Parks Overflights Act, a number of \nimportant developments have occurred. First, in 1993 a Department of \nTransportation and Department of the Interior interagency working group \nwas established to address park overflight issues of mutual concern, an \nacknowledgment by the executive branch that the issue required \nextensive interagency cooperation, but also a reflection of the deep \ndifferences in approach and attitude that existed between the National \nPark Service and the FAA on this contentious matter.\n  In 1994, the overflights report mandated by Public Law 100-91 was \ncompleted, identifying and documenting low-altitude flights as threats \nto park resources and recommending a variety of means to address these \nthreats, such as incentives to encourage use of quite aircraft \ntechnology, flight-free zones and flight corridors, altitude \nrestrictions, noise budgets, and limits on times of air tour \noperations. Also in 1994, in response to a pair of helicopter crashes \nin the Pacific, the FAA issued an emergency flight rule--SFAR 71--\nimposing certain altitude and other operating restrictions on air tour \noperators in Hawaii.\n  More recently, last spring, the President issued an executive \nmemorandum directing agency heads to participate in the effort to \nprotect natural quite in National Park System units. The memorandum led \nto the final rule for the Grand Canyon, issued in December 1996, \nproviding for additional, delineated restrictions on air tour activity \nat the park. The memorandum also led to a new rule promulgated earlier \nthis year to ban preemptively, for 2 years or until a national rule is \ndeveloped, flights at Rocky Mountain National Park. Finally, as a \nresult of the President's memorandum, the FAA and the Park Service were \nrequired to develop a comprehensive, national rule governing air tour \nflights at all national parks. Work on the national rule is in the \npreliminary stages.\n  While these developments have been welcome, it is fair to say that \noverall progress on the overflights issue has been desultory. For every \nGrand Canyon or Rocky Mountain, there are dozens of parks whose \noverflights problems remain completely unaddressed. In this regard, \nproblems and delays associated with the development of a national rule \nhave been particularly disappointing. Reportedly, the FAA and Park \nService continue to squabble over matters of jurisdiction, and air tour \noperators and environmental organizations continue to prefer \nconfrontation to accommodation. In the meantime, air tour-generated \nproblems continue to accrete, exacerbating the environmental and safety \nconsequences of park overflights. This experience has shown us that \nonly Congress, through legislation, can produce lasting, effective \npolicy on this matter.\n  Mr. President, when all is said and done, the simple truth is that \nthe complex problems associated with park overflights cannot be fully \nresolved administratively. In my opinion, this state of affairs is \nlargely due to the fact that the FAA and the Park Service, the two \nagencies with the heaviest responsibility for addressing park \noverflights, are governed by vastly different statutory mandates. On \nthe one hand, the FAA is responsible for the safety and efficiency of \nair commerce; on the other, the Park Service is charged with protecting \nand preserving park resources. These mutually exclusive missions have \nbred different approaches, attitudes, and institutional cultures that \nhave hindered interagency cooperation and development of a consistent, \neffective park overflights policy. Only by modifying or clarifying \ntheir statutory responsibilities with respect to the management of park \nairspace can the two Federal agencies be expected to work together \nconsistently and systematically to address the overflight problem.\n\n  Mr. President, the legislation we are proposing today would address \nthis and other barriers to the development of a comprehensive park \noverflights policy. Our bill deals with the commercial air tour \noverflights issue in a national context, since the safety and \nenvironmental concerns which are being debated so vociferously at the \nGrand Canyon and in Hawaii are being echoed at park units scattered \nthroughout the National Park System.\n  At the outset, our bill establishes a finding that National Park \nService policy recognizes the importance of natural quiet as a resource \nto be conserved and protected in certain park units. Toward that end, \nour legislation creates a new statutory framework for minimizing the \nenvironmental effects of air tour activity on units throughout the \nNational Park System.\n  The bill articulates a regulatory scheme under which the Park Service\n\n[[Page S1134]]\n\nand the FAA are required to work in tandem to develop operational \npolicies with respect to the overflights problem. It provides for joint \nadministration in many areas while clearly denoting the FAA's primary \non matters related to safety and air efficiency and the Park Service's \nlead role in identifying the resources to be protected and the best \nmeans of protecting them.\n  The bill requires the development, with public involvement, of \nindividually tailored park airspace management plans for units \nsignificantly affected by overflight activity, as determined by the \nDirector of the Park Service. It calls for good faith negotiations \nbetween commercial air tour operators and both the Park Service and the \nFAA to reach agreement on flights over park areas.\n  It provides for the Park Service to recommend to the FAA the \ndesignation of individual units as ``flight-free parks'' for those \nunits which, as of January 1, 1997, experienced no overflights by \ncommercial air tour operators and where air tour flights would \nbe incompatible with or injurious to the purposes or values of those \nparks.\n\n  It also mandates the development by the FAA of a generic operational \nrule for commercial air tour operations at all units of the National \nPark System, subject to modification at individual park units based on \nnegotiations among air tour operators, the FAA, and the Park Service.\n  Our legislation requires the FAA to implement a single standard, \nthrough a new subpart of part 135, title 14, Code of Federal \nRegulations, for certifying commercial air tour operators. Such a \nuniform standard, which has been recommended by the National \nTransportation Safety Board [NTSB], will substantially enhance safety \nby providing essential consistency in such areas as pilot \nqualifications, training, and flight and duty time limitations.\n  It mandates commercial air tour safety initiatives recommended by the \nNTSB and others, including the installation of a flight monitoring \nsystem and the use of identification markings unique to a commercial \nair tour operator, the development of aeronautical charts which reflect \nairspace management provisions with respect to individual park units, \nand the development of a national database on air tour operations.\n  Last, but by no means least, the bill establishes a National Park \nOverflight Advisory Council which would provide advice and \nrecommendations to the Park Service and the FAA on all issues related \nto commercial air tour flights over park units and serve as a national \nforum for interest groups, including representatives of the air tour \nindustry and the environmental community, to exchange views \nconstructively.\n  It is significant to note that our bill will not affect emergency \nflight operations, general aviation, military aviation, or scheduled \ncommercial passenger flights that transit National Park System units. \nFurthermore, recognizing the special needs for air travel in Alaska, \nthis bill will not affect the management of park units or aircraft \noperations over or within park units in the State of Alaska.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the legislation we are offering today \nwill give us the tools to minimize the adverse effects of commercial \nair tour flights on park resources as well as on the ground visitor \nexperience, while at the same time enhancing the safety of such \nflights. I believe it is a balanced measure that, through extensive \nopportunity for public involvement, attempts to accommodate the \nlegitimate concerns of all park users, including air tour operators and \npassengers. Indeed, I strongly believe that under certain well-\nregulated conditions, air tourism provides an important service to many \nelderly, disabled, or other visitors who might otherwise never enjoy \nthe wonders of our national parks.\n  Nevertheless, our bill's central premise is that the 369 park units \nof the National Park System were created because of their exceptional \nnatural or cultural significance to the American people. All of the \nprovisions of the National Parks Airspace Management Act are therefore \ndesigned with the protection of park resources as their essential, if \nnot exclusive, goal. For it is self-evident that a park whose values \nhave been corrupted is a park ultimately not worth visiting, by air or \nland.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I would like to acknowledge the fact that \nthe senior Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] earlier this week \nintroduced related legislation on park overflights. While his bill \ndiffers from ours in some details, the intent of both measures is the \nsame--to mitigate the adverse effects of air tours flights on our \nnational parks. Given our common goal, I hope that we can work together \nin crafting an effective, bipartisan approach to this troubling and \ndivisive issue.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I urge my colleagues to support the \nNational Parks Airspace Management Act of 1997. I ask unanimous consent \nthat a copy of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 291\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Commercial air tour flights over units of the National \n     Park System (referred to in this Act as ``units'') may have \n     adverse effects on the units.\n       (2) The flights may degrade the experiences of visitors to \n     the affected areas and may have adverse effects on wildlife \n     and cultural resources in those areas.\n       (3) A significant number of complaints about commercial air \n     tour flights over certain areas under the jurisdiction of the \n     National Park Service have been registered.\n       (4) Although resource preservation is the primary \n     responsibility of the National Park Service, the agency \n     continues to struggle to develop a policy that would achieve \n     an acceptable balance between flights over units by \n     commercial air tour operators and the protection of resources \n     in the units and the experiences of visitors to the units.\n       (5) Although the mission of the Federal Aviation \n     Administration is to develop and maintain a safe and \n     efficient system of air transportation while considering the \n     impact of aircraft noise, the agency continues to have \n     difficulty adequately controlling commercial air tour flights \n     over units.\n       (6) Significant and continuing concerns exist regarding the \n     safety of commercial air tour flights over some units, \n     including concerns for the safety of occupants of the \n     flights, visitors to those units, Federal employees at those \n     units, and the general public.\n       (7) The concern of the Congress over the effects of low-\n     level flights on units led to the enactment, on August 18, \n     1987, of the Act entitled ``An Act to require the Secretary \n     of the Interior to conduct a study to determine the \n     appropriate minimum altitude for aircraft flying over \n     national park system units'' (Public Law 100-91; 101 Stat. \n     674; 16 U.S.C. 1a-1 note).\n       (8) The Act referred to in paragraph (7) requires the \n     Director of the National Park Service to identify problems \n     associated with flights by aircraft in the airspace over \n     units.\n       (9) Pursuant to the Act referred to in paragraph (7), on \n     September 12, 1994, the Director submitted a report to \n     Congress entitled ``Report On Effects Of Aircraft Overflights \n     On The National Park System''.\n       (10) The National Park Service report concluded that, \n     because the details of national park overflights problems are \n     park-specific, no single altitude can be identified for the \n     entire National Park System.\n       (11) The National Park Service report presented a number of \n     recommendations for resolution of the problem of national \n     park overflights, including--\n       (A) the development of airspace and park use resolution \n     processes;\n       (B) the development of a single operational rule to \n     regulate air tour operations;\n       (C) seeking continued improvements in safety and \n     interagency planning related to airspace management; and\n       (D) the development of a Federal Aviation Administration \n     rule to facilitate preservation of natural quiet.\n       (12) The policy of the National Park Service recognizes the \n     importance of natural quiet as a resource to be conserved and \n     protected in certain units.\n       (13) The National Park Service--\n       (A) defines natural quiet as ``the natural ambient sound \n     conditions found in certain units of the National Park \n     Service''; and\n       (B) recognizes that visitors to certain units may \n     reasonably expect quiet during their visits to those units \n     established with the specific goal of providing visitors with \n     an opportunity for solitude.\n       (14) The number of flights by aircraft over units has \n     increased rapidly since the date of enactment of the Act \n     referred to in paragraph (7) and, due to the high degree of \n     satisfaction expressed by air tour passengers, as well as the \n     economic impact of air tour operations on the tourist \n     industry, the number of flights will likely continue to \n     increase.\n       (15) A progression of aesthetic and safety concerns about \n     low altitude flights have been associated with growth in \n     commercial air tour traffic.\n\n[[Page S1135]]\n\n       (16) As the number of flights over units continues to \n     increase, the likelihood exists that there will be a \n     concomitant increase in the number of conflicts regarding \n     management of the airspace over the units.\n       (17) A need exists for a Federal policy to address the \n     conflicts and problems associated with flights by commercial \n     air tour aircraft in the airspace over units.\n       (18) A statutory process should be established to require \n     the Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary of the \n     Interior, acting through the Director, to work together to \n     mitigate the impact of commercial air tour operations on \n     units, or specific areas within units that are adversely \n     affected by commercial air tour operations.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 6\n\n       Whereas Congress recognizes that the legacy of civil \n     conflict in Afghanistan during the last 17 years has had a \n     devastating effect on the civilian population in that country \n     and a particularly negative impact on the rights and security \n     of women and girls;\n       Whereas the longstanding civil conflict in Afghanistan \n     among the warring political and military factions has created \n     an environment where the rights of women and girls are \n     routinely violated;\n       Whereas the Afghan forces led by Burhanuddin Rabbani and \n     Abdul Rashid Dostum are responsible for numerous abhorrent \n     human rights abuses, including the rape, sexual abuse, \n     torture, abduction, and persecution of women and girls;\n       Whereas Congress is disturbed by the upsurge of reported \n     human rights abuses, including extreme restrictions placed on \n     women and girls, since the Taliban coalition seized the \n     capital city of Kabul;\n       Whereas Afghanistan is a sovereign nation and must work to \n     solve its internal disputes; and\n       Whereas Afghanistan and the United States recognize \n     international human rights conventions, such as the \n     International Convenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural \n     Rights, which espouse respect for basic human rights of all \n     individuals without regard to race, religion, ethnicity, or \n     gender: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That (a) Congress hereby--\n       (1) deplores the violations of international humanitarian \n     law by the Taliban coalition in Afghanistan and raises \n     concern over the reported cases of stoning, public \n     executions, and street beatings;\n       (2) condemns the Taliban's targeted discrimination against \n     women and girls and expresses deep concern regarding the \n     prohibition of employment and education for women and girls; \n     and\n       (3) takes note of the recent armed conflict in Kabul, \n     affirms the need for peace negotiations and expresses hope \n     that the Afghan parties will agree to a cease-fire throughout \n     the country.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that the President should--\n       (1) continue to monitor the human rights situation in \n     Afghanistan and should call for an end to discrimination \n     against women and girls in Afghanistan and for adherence by \n     all factions in Afghanistan to international humanitarian \n     law;\n       (2) review United States policy with respect to Afghanistan \n     if the Taliban coalition and others do not cease immediately \n     the harassment and other discriminatory practices against \n     women and girls;\n\n[[Page S1137]]\n\n       (3) encourage efforts to procure a durable peace in \n     Afghanistan and should support the United Nation Special \n     Mission to Afghanistan led by Norbert Holl to assist in \n     brokering a peaceful resolution to years of conflict;\n       (4) call upon the Government of Pakistan to use its good \n     offices with the Taliban to reverse the Taliban's restrictive \n     and discriminatory policies against women and girls; and\n       (5) call upon other nations to cease providing financial \n     assistance, arms, and other kinds of support to the \n     militaries or political organizations of any of the warring \n     factions in Afghanistan.\n       Sec. 2. The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this concurrent resolution to the President with the \n     request that he further transmit such copy to the United \n     Nations and relevant parties in Afghanistan.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, as a matter of cold war aggression, Soviet \ntroops invaded, as we all remember, Afghanistan in December of 1979. \nAfter years of harsh struggle for independence, the Afghan people \nfinally achieved that goal of independence in 1992. No sooner, however, \nhad the Soviet threat been lifted than a new destabilizing force \nemerged in that region. Then, instead of fighting outside aggressors, \nthe Afghans started fighting among themselves.\n  Today, Afghan civilians continue to live in constant fear: fear of \nbeing embroiled in armed conflict; fear of being abducted by one \nmilitia group or another; fear of persecution and torture; fear of rape \nand sexual harassment; and, finally, fear of dying an early and \nsenseless death.\n  Amnesty International has done an excellent job of monitoring and \nreporting on the deteriorating human rights situation in Afghanistan.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a factsheet prepared by \nAmnesty International be printed at the end of these remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the conflict in Afghanistan has changed \ndramatically in recent months. In September 1996, the Taliban coalition \nseized the capital city of Kabul, thereby securing control of two-\nthirds of the territory of Afghanistan.\n  The Taliban, many of whom grew up and were educated in the refugee \ncamps in Pakistan during the war years of the 1980's, see themselves as \nthe guardians of Afghan security and stability. Unfortunately, this \nguardianship has had very harsh consequences for the women and young \ngirls of Afghanistan. Moreover, in an effort to solidify total control \nover Afghanistan, they continue to engage militarily with the other \nfactions led by various leaders of that country. Today, the Taliban \ncontrols three-quarters of the nation.\n  Mr. President, my concern here is that we have had significant \nreports of terrible abuse of the young women of Afghanistan by the \nTaliban, including denying them even the basic opportunities to work. \nMany of the teachers in Afghanistan were women. They have been denied \nentirely the right to work, to teach.\n  Internal tensions have been exacerbated by players who have \nencouraged the various factions to continue the armed conflict in order \nto advance their own selfish economic and security interests. Outside \nassistance in the form of arms transfer, military training, and \nfinancial aid seriously undermined international efforts to broker a \npolitical solution to the conflict.\n  With respect to humanitarian issues, the fact of the matter is that \nnone of the parties involved in the civil conflict are innocent. All \nhave contributed to the extraordinary human rights crisis.\n  While all these human rights abuses concern me, today I want to call \nspecific attention to the deteriorating human rights practices as they \nrelate to the rights and treatment against Afghan women and girls--much \nof these at the hands of the Taliban. I am deeply disturbed by the \nTaliban's discriminatory treatment of women and girls. Some of the most \nobjectionable features of the Taliban's discriminatory policies include \nbarring women from employment, prohibiting girls from attending \nschools, restricting the times when women and girls may leave their \nhomes, and mandating a restrictive dress code for females. Moreover, \nthe Taliban has reacted to women and girls who stray from these \nrestrictive policies with public rebukes in the form of street beatings \nand stonings.\n  I believe, and imagine most of my colleagues would agree that: Women \nshould have the right to work--to earn a living for their families \nusing their knowledge, expertise, and skills; girls and women must be \ngiven access to basic education; and both women and men must be \nafforded a basic sense of humanity and respect. Street beatings, \namputations, and other forms of summary justice for alleged crimes are \nunacceptable.\n  The United States cannot stand idly by in the face of unconscionable \nviolations of basic human rights and needless killings. We certainly \ncannot condone, by our silence, the plainly discriminatory practices \nwhich severely handicap women and girls.\n  I believe that the resolution I have introduced today will call \npublic attention to the serious situation in Afghanistan. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in reaffirming the need for a peaceful settlement \nfor a country that has been plagued by the brutality of war for too \nmany years; in urging all the factions in Afghanistan to adhere to \ninternationally recognized principles of human rights; and in calling \nan end to the Taliban's discriminatory policies toward women and girls. \nI hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the enactment of this \nresolution at the appropriate time.\n  I am going to, Mr. President, send this resolution to the desk. And I \nurge my colleagues to take a look at it, along with a report from \nAmnesty International, and urge that they join with me in our \ncondemnation of these events as they are occurring today.\n  Hopefully, we can consider this resolution at some appropriate time \non the floor of the U.S. Senate and adopt it and send a clear message \nthat those of us in this body--while there are many issues we deal with \nat home--that an issue such as this basic fundamental denial of human \nrights should not go unrecognized as an institution here that cares so \ndeeply about it in a bipartisan way as we have talked about so \nfrequently. I urge they give their support to this resolution. I just \nsend it to the desk, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The resolution will be received.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n       afghanistan: amnesty international brief, January 24, 1997\n\n                                Summary\n\n       For years Amnesty International has consistently decried \n     the shocking human rights abuses committed by all sides of \n     the conflict in Afghanistan. Due to the last twelve years of \n     civil war, 400,000 children have been killed, five million \n     people, one-third of the population, have been made refugees, \n     Afghanistan is the most heavily mined country in the world, \n     women have been treated as spoils of war.\n       Since the emergence of the Taliban as a major political and \n     military force in 1994 and the takeover of Kabul on September \n     27, 1996, a new chapter has opened in the long history of \n     human rights abuses in Afghanistan. The Taliban's strict \n     interpretation of Islamic law have led them to severely \n     restrict public freedom, especially with regards to women.\n\n                              The Taliban\n\n       The Taliban, (literally ``religious students''), were \n     trained and organized in Islamic schools in Pakistan. They \n     now control approximately three-fourths of the country, with \n     other factions controlling the rest. When the Taliban first \n     took over Kabul, it seemed that perhaps the death and \n     destruction of the previous years of fighting could finally \n     be replaced by some semblance of stability. However, it soon \n     became apparent that the price of this stability would be \n     human rights, and its primary victims would be women.\n\n                          Abuses against women\n\n       Women have suffered tremendously over the years of conflict \n     in Afghanistan as rape victims, casualties of war, refugees, \n     and mothers, sisters, and wives of the dead. However, since \n     the Taliban's rise, their strict policies towards women's \n     behavior have been of particular concern. These policies not \n     only violate internationally recognized standards of human \n     rights but do so solely based on their gender.\n       All schools for girls have been closed and women forbidden \n     from attending universities.\n       Women are not allowed to work outside the home or leave the \n     house without being covered from head to toe.\n       Women have been beaten for allowing their head covering to \n     slip or showing a few inches of ankle.\n       Appearing in public without ``proper'' reason is punished \n     by severe beating. One woman received bullet wounds for \n     leaving her home in order to take her child to the doctor.\n       By forbidding women to work outside the home, the Taliban \n     have severely limited\n\n[[Page S1138]]\n\n     many families' incomes. Especially hard hit are some 30,000 \n     widows who were the primary providers for their families and \n     now have no means to support them.\n       Women's medical care has suffered, as women are not allowed \n     to be treated by male doctors, and the female doctors are now \n     forbidden to work.\n\n                             Other concerns\n\n       Amnesty International is also concerned with several other \n     forms of human rights abuses perpetrated by the Taliban. \n     These include:\n       Deliberate and arbitrary killings: These include civilians \n     killed in retribution, for being suspected anti-Taliban \n     sympathizers, and captured soldiers.\n       Political prisoners: The Taliban have detained hundreds, \n     possibly more than a thousand, civilians for their ethnic \n     origin, political affiliation, or refusing to obey the \n     Taliban's religious edicts.\n       Torture and Ill-treatment: Beatings have become a common \n     form of punishment, and prisoners are often used for life-\n     threatening work such as clearing minefields.\n       Unfair trials and cruel or inhumane punishments: Courts of \n     law in Taliban-controlled areas are presided over by \n     ``Islamic'' judges who sentence such punishments as stonings \n     and amputations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/07/senate-section/article/S1136-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1138-S1139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 51--CONCERNING THE OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS OF NETDAY\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Warner, Mr. Burns, Mr. Robb, Mrs. \nMurray and Mrs. Boxer) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources:\n\n                               S. Res. 51\n\n       Whereas the children of the United States deserve the \n     finest preparation possible to face the demands of this \n     Nation's changing information-based economy;\n       Whereas in the year 1996, NetDay succeeded in bringing \n     together more than 100,000 volunteers nationwide to install \n     the wiring infrastructure necessary to connect classrooms, \n     from kindergarten to the high school level (K-12), to the \n     Information Superhighway and bring them the educational \n     benefits of contemporary technology;\n       Whereas NetDay succeeded in wiring 25,000 K-12 schools \n     nationwide efficiently and cost-effectively, while \n     establishing and improving classroom information \n     infrastructure;\n       Whereas NetDay organizers created a World Wide Web site \n     (http://www.netday96.com/) with an on-line database of all \n     public and private K-12 schools, where individuals with a \n     shared interest in upgrading technology in their schools can \n     locate each other and form communities with a lasting \n     interest in their schools;\n       Whereas NetDay stresses educational opportunity for \n     everyone by reaching out to rural and lower income \n     communities to equalize access to current technology;\n       Whereas the relationships formed through NetDay activities \n     and initiatives between schools and their communities will \n     last well beyond 1996 into the 21st century, and other \n     communities are already planning to organize future NetDay \n     projects that build and expand upon the initial achievements \n     of NetDay in 1996;\n       Whereas NetDay has substantially increased the visibility \n     of educational technology issues;\n       Whereas NetDay enables K-12 schools to move into the \n     information age through community and cyberspace-based \n     action;\n       Whereas students and schools benefited from significant \n     NetDay corporate sponsorship and donations from hundreds of \n     companies and organizations throughout the nation who \n     contributed by sponsoring individual schools, providing \n     wiring kits, and helping to design and test the networks;\n       Whereas NetDay will help facilitate the placement of \n     educational technology, such as computer hardware, software, \n     Internet and technical services, and teaching aids and \n     training material, in the hands of schools through NetDay \n     activities nationwide; and\n       Whereas both past and future NetDay activities across \n     America will save schools and taxpayers millions of dollars \n     in technology startup costs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the organizers, coordinators, and volunteers of NetDay \n     throughout the United States should be commended for their \n     actions;\n       (2) NetDay's success should be used as a positive model in \n     other communities throughout the United States, this year and \n     in future years;\n       (3) NetDay activities should continue to expand nationwide \n     to assist students, parents, and schools across the country, \n     so that they may obtain the full benefits of computer \n     equipment and networks, strengthen their educations, and \n     begin careers with more skills and opportunities in order to \n     help them compete more successfully in the global economy;\n       (4) businesses, students, parents, educators, and unions \n     throughout the country should consider organizing NetDay \n     activities in their communities to provide similar \n     opportunities for their schools; and\n       (5) the Senate affirms its support of NetDay's commitment \n     to have classrooms of K-12 schools fitted with the needed \n     technological infrastructure for the 21st century.\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, on behalf of myself, Senator \nJohn Warner, Senator Conrad Burns, Senator Charles Robb, Senator Patty \nMurray, and Senator Barbara Boxer, I rise today to reintroduce a Senate \nresolution acknowledging the achievements of NetDay and affirming \nNetDay's commitment to wire our local K-12 schools to the information \nsuperhighway. I wish to commend the organizers and volunteers of \nNetDay, a nationwide public-private partnership.\n  Last year, NetDay was successful in bringing out more than 100,000 \nAmericans, including 50,000 Californians to volunteer in their \nneighborhood schools. These students, teachers, parents, and friends of \nthe schools came to wire classrooms and school libraries throughout the \nNation. Thousands of individuals accomplished their goal to install \ncommunications cables, connect wires and switches to upgrading their \nschools for the 21st century.\n  Their success was significant. Over 25,000 elementary, junior, and \nsenior high schools were wired. Throughout the United States, \nvolunteers climbed ladders and got on their hands and knees to install \nthe wiring infrastructure needed to connect thousands of elementary and \nsecondary school classrooms with contemporary technology.\n  In recognition of the NetDay effort, I am very proud to submit a \nSenate resolution commending all of the more than 100,000 volunteers \nfor their hard work and dedication to ensure that schools throughout \nAmerica have the needed technological infrastructure for the 21st \ncentury.\n  NetDay began in California on March 9, 1996. The term was coined by \nco-founders John Gage of Sun Microsystems, one of the Nation's leading \ntechnology companies and Michael Kaufman of KQED, a California public \nbroadcasting station. Mr. Gage and Mr. Kaufman saw this initiative as a \nday where hundreds of Californians came out to an old-fashioned barn \nraising for the modern technology age.\n  Just as volunteers would gather in the Nation's early years, with \nneighbor helping neighbor, to build homes, barns, or community \nbuildings, California's NetDay volunteers gather in support of \nneighborhood schools. Amazingly, and to their surprise, NetDay \nsucceeded in 1 year in wiring 3,500 schools efficiently and cost \neffectively, establishing and improving our classroom information \ninfrastructure up and down the State.\n  The NetDay effort is an important one to California. Despite the \nState's tremendous resources, opportunities, and wealth of technology \ncompanies, California still ranks at the bottom of States in funds \nspent per student on computers. The cost today of providing a computer \nfor each student, from kindergarten to high school, is approximately $6 \nbillion for 1,159,565 computers in California. NetDay activities are \none way to ease some of the financial burden.\n  With our current budget deficit, we have been doing everything to \nencourage local, volunteer solutions to difficult problems. NetDay \nactivities across America have and will continue to save schools and \ntaxpayers millions of dollars in technology start-up costs by providing \nequipment, computer time, and training for teachers through the \nschool's corporate partners. Business sponsors and corporate volunteers \nhave been instrumental in making NetDay a successful reality.\n  But we should also note that NetDay was not just about saving money. \nThe most valuable asset of NetDay was the commitment of thousands of \nvolunteers who worked in their community schools. The relationships \nformed between schools and their communities will extend beyond 1996. \nNetDay volunteers have the continued goal of stimulating and \nfacilitating communities in the United States to participate in their \nlocal schools. Parents and neighbors who had previously never visited \nor been involved in their children's school are now motivated to come \nback to the classroom and work to improve their child's learning \nenvironment.\n  NetDay organizers tell me that communities across the Nation are \nalready planning to organize future NetDay activities, building and \nexpanding upon earlier achievements. Further, in April of this year, \nNetDay organizers will be focusing resources on schools and communities \nthat are often underserved.\n\n[[Page S1139]]\n\n  We all agree our children deserve the finest preparation possible to \nface the demands of the changing information-based economy. We need to \nprovide the next generation with the proper training for high-\ntechnology, well paying jobs. This will only happen if we include all \nour neighborhoods. NetDay will help meet these challenges, stressing \neducational opportunity for everyone by reaching out to rural and lower \nincome communities where current technology may be inadequate or \nincomplete. Even if students don't have computers at home, at least \nstudents can have access at schools to explore, develop skills, learn, \nand grow. Congress should encourage these important goals.\n  With this resolution we can support the overall effort of ensuring \nthat our classrooms are equipped with effective and constructive \nlearning tools. As students move from elementary school to high school \nand then into college or the work force, it is imperative that these \nindividuals are adequately trained to use contemporary technologies. \nThis resolution will help motivate our communities, both volunteers and \nbusinesses, to provide donated resources, to build upon the success of \nthe NetDay experience and to ensure that the children in all our towns \nand cities reap the benefits of an advanced learning environment.\n  I would also like to take this time to congratulate this \nadministration for making the improvement of our classroom's \ntechnological infrastructure a priority. This administration deserves \ngreat credit for advancing education and technology. Last year, \nPresident Clinton and Vice President Gore joined thousands of \nCalifornian volunteers in fulfilling this goal. They also support the \nexpansion of NetDay activities nationwide to increase the level of \ntechnology in our classrooms to enhance our children's ability to \nlearn.\n  It is my pleasure to submit this resolution commending the NetDay co-\nfounders, Michael Kaufman and John Gage, the dozens of corporate \nsponsors and business partners, and the thousands of students, \nteachers, parents, and neighbors working in community schools \nthroughout California and the Nation. The success and commitment they \nhave shown can serve as a positive model, this year and in future \nyears.\n  My colleague and cochair on the U.S. Senate Information Technology \nCaucus, Senator John Warner joins me in cosponsoring this resolution. \nIn addition, Senator Conrad Burns of Montana, Senator Charles Robb of \nVirginia, Senator Patty Murray from Washington, and my California \ncolleague Senator Barbara Boxer join me in supporting the advancement \nof educational technology by sponsoring this resolution. Together, we \nurge our Senate colleagues to affirm congressional support for \npreparing U.S. classrooms with the needed technological infrastructure \nfor the 21st century.\n  In today's global economy, America's students will face challenges on \nan international scale. Students must graduate with the skills needed \nto face today's changing workplace. Computers and technology can \nenhance the educational experience of children and provide a valuable \ncomplement to traditional teaching tools. Technology is not the \ncomplete solution to our complex education needs, but it is an \nimportant area that needs both our attention and our support.\n  I invite my Senate colleagues to join this public-private partnership \neffort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/07/senate-section/article/S1138-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n                 committee on labor and human resources\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

PHILLIP R. SHRIVER\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor, on a very special \noccasion, one of the most important figures in the history of education \nin the State of Ohio. This year, Dr. Phillip R. Shriver will celebrate \nthe 50th anniversary of his career as a teacher.\n  Dr. Shriver was born in Cleveland in 1922. When he was 6 years old, \nhis grandfather gave him an Indian spear point, and thus began his \nlifelong interest in Ohio history.\n  He graduated from Yale in 1943, graduating early so he could go and \nmake some history himself as a Navy lieutenant in World War II.\n  When Dr. Shriver got back to the United States, he set his sights on \nhis work of a lifetime. Armed with an M.A. from Harvard in 1946, and \nhis Ph.D. from Columbia in 1954, he began teaching history to \ngeneration after generation of Ohio students.\n  In 1947, Dr. Shriver joined the faculty at Kent State University. In \n1965, he became the president of Miami University, greeting in his \nfirst incoming class a freshman, myself, and my future wife, Frances \nStruewing.\n  He served as Miami's president for 16 years--all the while continuing \nto teach. He has also served as president of the Ohio College \nAssociation, and as chairman of the Council of Presidents of the \nNational Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges.\n  Even after his retirement from the presidency of Miami, he continues \nhis mission in the classroom. Dr. Shriver continues to teach.\n  It has been said that the past is prologue. Well, I think of the \nenthusiasm of Dr. Phillip Shriver, as he has made Ohio's past a living \nreality for countless young men and women, I cannot help thinking that \nhe has done much to shape the future of our State and the lives of its \npeople.\n  Mr. President, I join all of his family and friends in congratulating \nhim on a truly historic milestone.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto speak for 10 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

For the information of all Senators, the Senate will \ncontinue the debate on the balanced budget amendment on Monday. Under a \nprevious order, the Senate will resume debate on the Durbin amendment \nat 3:30 with a vote occurring on or in relation to that amendment at \napproximately 5:30 on Monday. Senators can, therefore, expect the next \nrollcall vote on Monday, February 10, at 5:30.\n  Prior to that debate, Senator Wellstone will be recognized to offer \ntwo amendments. It is my hope we will be able to complete all debate on \nSenator Wellstone's amendments during Monday's session, however those \namendments will be voted on during Tuesday's session.\n  I also remind my colleagues that next week is the final week of \nbusiness prior to the Presidents' Day recess. I hope we will be able to \nmake continued progress on the balanced budget amendment, and it is \npossible the Senate will act on a number of nominations that will be \navailable. In fact, we do have pending before us for consideration the \nnomination of Charlene Barshefsky to be the U.S. Trade Representative, \nalthough her nomination will involve probably a vote on a waiver of an \nexisting law, and possibly an amendment to that waiver that may be \noffered by Senator Hollings or others; so we will have to keep that in \nmind. And we expect to have the nomination reported out for U.N. \nAmbassador Richardson.\n  We also may be voting next week on the mandatory provisions included \nin last year's omnibus appropriations bill involving population \nplanning funding. That will depend on whether the House is able to \ncomplete its action early in the week. But we could very well get to a \nvote on that issue Wednesday or Thursday of next week because we would \nlike to complete it, if we could, before the Presidents' Day recess.\n  We will continue, then, to have debate on amendments, with time \nagreements wherever possible, on the constitutional amendment for a \nbalanced budget. So I urge my colleagues to be understanding next week.\n  We also will be out a good portion of Thursday morning for Ambassador \nHarriman's funeral, and therefore we probably won't be able to get \nstarted with votes until sometime after noon on Thursday. But we'll \nhave a full day on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday next week \nbefore we go out for the Presidents' Day recess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/07/senate-section/article/S1140-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ORDER FOR ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, first, I express my gratitude to the \nmajority leader for graciously arranging at the end of the business \ntime for me to address the issue at hand, and that is the proposed \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n  I, like all of my colleagues, do not know a single Member of this \nbody who disagrees with the proposition that we ought to be balancing \nthe budget or getting us close to it and as quickly as we possibly can. \nI don't think there is any debate about the desired goal shared by \neveryone in this Chamber and the overwhelming majority of Americans in \nthis country for a balanced budget. They do, I think, Mr. President, \nshare this goal for wise reason.\n  I was asked the other day in a classroom in my home State of \nConnecticut by students, ``Why is balancing the budget, why is there so \nmuch talk about that? What is the importance of that?'' Maybe we take \nfor granted that everyone understands the answer. We talk about it as \nif it were an end in and of itself, rather than the implications of a \nbalanced budget for our Nation and, for that matter, people who live \nbeyond our Nation.\n  The reason is that balancing the budget is not a goal in and of \nitself. It is what it does, what it creates, and that is, of course, a \nsound economy and an expanded economy. It creates jobs in the country \nand opportunities for people that wouldn't otherwise exist if we were \noperating with a mountain of debt that forced the U.S. Government to \ncompete in the borrowing business with private institutions and \nindividuals.\n  By balancing the budget, what we are doing is contributing \nsignificantly to the economic growth and the job creation that is \nabsolutely essential if any nation is going to succeed, and \nparticularly if we are going to be successful in the 21st century.\n  Balancing the budget has importance, but its real importance is not \nin and of itself, but rather what it contributes to the overall wealth \nand strength of our Nation.\n  So I begin these remarks, Mr. President, by stating what I think is \nthe obvious--I hope it is the obvious--and that is that every Member of \nthis body believes that balancing the Federal budget is an issue of \ncritical importance to our Nation's future. Across the political \nspectrum, from the White House to the Capitol, among Democrats and \nRepublicans, liberals, conservatives, moderates, whatever label people \nwish to place on themselves or are placed on them, there exists, I \nthink, a broad-based consensus on the desire for bringing the Federal \nbudget into balance.\n  In fact, in the last Congress, both the President and the Republican \nleaders agreed in principle to a 7-year balanced budget plan. The \nsticking point then was the details of those plans, not the notion of a \nbalanced budget itself. So the debate today is not about whether we \nshould balance the budget. That we agree on. The debate today, and will \nbe over the coming days, is how we balance the budget.\n  The proponents of this constitutional amendment would have us believe \notherwise. They would lead us to believe that the Congress is simply \nincapable of mustering the necessary courage to make the tough choices \nto balance the budget. They would have us believe that only by an \namendment to the U.S. Constitution would we be forced, and future \nCongresses forced, to act.\n  Mr. President, when one considers our efforts at reducing the deficit \nover the past half dozen years, I think it is fair to say such an \nassertion lacks credibility. Over the past decade, the\n\n[[Page S1141]]\n\ndeficit, as a percentage of the gross domestic product, has shrunk by \nmore than 70 percent. Let me restate that. Over the past decade, the \ndeficit as a percentage of the gross domestic product has shrunk by \nmore than 70 percent. Today, it is only 1.4 percent of the gross \ndomestic product. In fact, as a percentage of the economy, the deficit \nis at its lowest level in more than a generation in this country.\n\n  These figures clearly demonstrate that contrary to the conventional \nwisdom, contrary to the rhetoric from across the aisle, and from other \nplaces, this body does, in fact, possess ample courage to reduce the \ndeficit. In fact, the tremendous decreases in the Federal deficit came \nin the last 4 years, as this chart to my left, I think, amply \ndemonstrates.\n  I will just point out, it is entitled ``Bringing the Deficit Down to \nGround Zero,'' which we all agreed should occur by the year 2002. What \nis indicated by these dots and lines, in 1992, the annual deficit stood \nat $290 billion. Based on the projections in 1992, that deficit was \ngoing to increase each year from $302 billion over 1993 and 1994, going \nup to $312 billion, then up to $319 billion in 1996, $351 billion by \n1997, $391 billion by 1998. Those were the projections for the increase \nin the deficit that we were given in 1993.\n  But in 1993, as many will recall, we adopted a budget plan that was, \nunfortunately, not bipartisan, Mr. President. It was adopted with just \nDemocratic votes. Those were the days when we were in the majority on \nthis side. That is, before the arrival of the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer.\n  We were in the majority and passed a budget resolution here in the \nU.S. Senate. A similar one was passed in the House. They were done in \nthe most uncommon of fashions. Usually there is some bipartisanship. \nBut this one was done exclusively with Democratic votes, on both sides.\n  It was hotly contested, hotly debated. People may recall it was \ndecided by one vote, I think, in the House of Representatives, and I \nthink by that margin here in the Senate as well. In fact, I think it \nwas the vote of the Vice President at the time casting the vote that \nmade that possible. At any rate, it was a very narrow vote.\n  But what has happened since then, since 1993, and that budget \nresolution? We have seen by 1993, instead of being $302 billion, the \ndeficit went from $290 billion to $255 billion. Then it has proceeded, \nover the next 3 years, down to $203 billion, $164 billion, and in 1996, \n$107 billion.\n  What we hope is going to occur with this budget proposal that is \nbefore us now, and over the next 5 years, is that the budget will \ncontinue, based on the projections included, will fall to that ground \nzero, balancing the budget by the year 2002.\n  Let me state here that I appreciate immensely the reaction, of the \nmajority in both this body and in the House of Representatives, to the \nPresident's budget. That is not to say they have endorsed the budget. \nQuite to the contrary, there are significant disagreements. But unlike \nalmost every year that I can recall, Mr. President, whether it was a \nRepublican President or a Democratic President, with the submission of \nbudgets you could almost guarantee the press releases would go out from \nwhoever was the opposing party in the legislative branch announcing \nthat the budget was dead on arrival and we began this tremendous fight \non Capitol Hill to try to come up with a new budget altogether.\n  That is not the case this year. I give the majority here credit, as \nwell as the administration, for working ahead of time to try to come up \nwith some common ground on some of the more delicate issues. As I said, \nthere has not been total agreement, but we are not in the same \nsituation we have been in the past where this turns into a huge battle \nfrom the very beginning.\n  So my hope is, despite what previous history there may have been, we \nare now going to be able to work on a budget agreement that gets us to \nthat ground zero in the year 2002. That is really what we ought to be \ndoing. Because as the Presiding Officer knows, and others are certainly \naware, writing something into the Constitution and issuing a press \nrelease about it does not make it happen. You have to do the work.\n  Whether it is in the Constitution or not, you have to do the kind of \nwork in order to move us in that direction toward ground zero. Because \nof the implications, again, I want to stress the point. This is \nimportant to do because of what it does to our economy. It gives us the \nkind of economic growth, the stability, the lower interest rates that \nallow for businesses to borrow and expand and put people to work. That \nis the effect of a balanced budget.\n  So there has been a good record here now. We are going in the right \ndirection for the first time in years. The challenge for all of us \nhere, regardless of party or ideology or some label that someone wants \nto put on someone, is to work together to see to it that we achieve \nthose desired goals stated in this chart.\n  None of us can predict, obviously, what is going to happen next week, \ntomorrow, or, for that matter, next month, next year that might disrupt \nour ability to move in this direction. That is one of the major reasons \nI have such reluctance about writing into the Constitution an economic \ntheory that could end up being highly disruptive toward our ultimate \ngoals as a nation.\n  As someone suggested--I think my colleague from North Dakota, Senator \nConrad, the other day, Mr. President, in talking about the proposed \namendment. He suggested to a group of us that if we had any hesitation \nabout whether or not this particular amendment belonged in the \nConstitution--and I have made a similar recommendation to people in my \nown home State--to take out 20 minutes or a half-hour, which is all you \nneed, to read the Constitution of the United States. It is an \nincredible document in its simplicity and directives.\n\n  Then, if you would, after you read the Constitution of the United \nStates, pick up and read this amendment and ask yourself the simple \nquestion: Does this language in this amendment, putting aside the \nimplications of it, but does this language in this amendment belong in \nthis document, this organic law of our country, which represents the \ntimeless principles--the timeless principles--that we embrace as a \npeople?\n  Nothing in the Constitution is contemporary in the sense that it \ndeals with a present-day problem, except to the extent that human \nnature constantly raises issues that need to be addressed and protected \nby the Constitution. But we have historically stayed away from dealing \nwith the issue of the day in the Constitution.\n  I urge again that we consider what the implications would be of \ntaking language which deals with economic theory, which is the \ncontemporary issue of the day, and enshrining it in the organic law of \nthe country, in such a way that I think we do an injustice to that \ndocument. Also, we run the risk, as I hope my colleagues will \nappreciate, of making it far more difficult in many ways for us to \nachieve the kind of economic opportunity, the job creation, the \nstability that is the underlying goal behind the entire discussion of \nwhether or not we ought to have a constitutional amendment that \nbalances the budget and does what we are presently on the right path \ntoward achieving and that the Congresses in the years ahead will have \nto grapple with itself, as it deals with the issues of its day.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that Members, and others who may be in \ndoubt about what this debate is all about, that they might take the \ntime to read, as I say, both the Constitution and the amendment and ask \nthemselves the question that Senator Conrad of North Dakota posed to us \nthe other day, as to whether or not those particular words belong in \nthe Constitution.\n  Mr. President, other issues have been raised over the past number of \ndays, and more will be raised next week, which are posed by this \namendment.\n  One of the issues that I will be raising has to do with the issue of \nnational security. Again, the Presiding Officer is someone who is no \nstranger to these issues as a new Member of this body and he has a \ndistinguished record in serving our country. I commend him for it.\n  One of my concerns here is that the amendment would seem to indicate \nthat we could not expend resources on a national security problem \nunless there was a declaration of war. As my colleagues are certainly \naware, it has been many a year since we declared\n\n[[Page S1142]]\n\nwar despite the fact that we have had many conflicts in which American \nmen and women have lost their lives. My concern would be that, given \nhow difficult that can be, given the nature of the world in which we \nlive today, declarations of war may be harder to achieve.\n  This could be a matter for a separate discussion, the whole issue of \nthe role of Congress and the war powers resolutions which we have \ndebated extensively here over the years. But I can imagine, as I am \nsure the Presiding Officer could, situations that would not warrant \nnecessarily a declaration of war, and yet it may be critically \nimportant that the United States respond because the national interest \nof the country is at stake, and yet we find ourselves engaged in such a \ndebate where we have to first declare war before a President might be \nable to act and get the necessary funds.\n  That is the kind of problem I see posed by the well-intended authors \nof this amendment, to create situations that could pose serious \nproblems for our country. I have drafted an amendment and I have asked \npeople to look at it. It may be an amendment that can be agreed to. It \nseems to me that we ought to be able to respond to situations without \ntying ourselves into long legislative knots around here. It may be \nabsolutely critical that the Chief Executive, the Commander in Chief of \nthis country be able to respond to a situation without getting bogged \ndown in what could be a partisan battle, for whatever reason, and put \nin jeopardy the lives of American men and women or put in jeopardy the \ninterests of our country. We could find ourselves hamstrung by a \nproblem in the constitutional amendment that its authors never \nintended, but in the years to come could occur.\n\n  So that is one issue that I find particularly troublesome about the \nbalanced budget amendment. I urge again my colleagues to review and \nlook at it.\n  Another issue was raised by our colleagues from California, Senator \nFeinstein and Senator Boxer. Unfortunately, their State, maybe more so \nthan any other in recent years, has been plagued by one disaster after \nanother, natural disasters in most cases, where they have needed \nadditional attention and resources. There seems to be little or no \nprovision to respond to those situations again without having to go \nthrough the tremendous gyrations of developing some support.\n  California is a big State. They have more than 50 Members of Congress \nin the House. They have the same number of Senators we have. What if \nyou come from a smaller State that does not have the same kind of \npolitical clout that California might bring to a situation, where they \nneed those extra dollars? Are we going to be able to respond? A \nlegitimate issue is raised, Mr. President, by the language of this \namendment, this constitutional amendment, that would make it extremely \ndifficult for the Congress to respond to natural disasters that could \nhit any State in this country.\n  Again, that is another reason that I think my colleagues ought to \nexamine carefully some proposals that will be offered and, I would say, \nultimately to step away from what I consider to be sort of a bumper-\nsticker approach to an issue that deserves far greater work and \ndiligence than merely writing into the Constitution language that could \nmake our job as legislators far more difficult in responding to the \nneeds of our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I will not take a great deal of time here today. I \nmerely wanted to rise to indicate once again that we are on the right \ntrack. I think we are going in the right direction in dealing with the \nissue of getting our budgetary house in order. That is what we are \ngoing to have to do year in and year out, to see to it that we have the \nability to respond.\n  I am not old enough to remember the Great Depression, and I am \nconfident the Presiding Officer is not either, but there are people \ncertainly who will read this Record who are listening to what we are \nsaying who remember the 1930's. I can only imagine how difficult it \nmust have been for that Congress and that Chief Executive Officer. In \nthe Northeast, in my State of Connecticut, and the Midwest was \nparticularly hard hit in those years, what would life have been like in \na Connecticut or Nebraska if we had been hit as we were with that Great \nDepression and faced with the tremendous need to provide resources to \npeople in our States. We ought to be very thankful that we do not have \nnational depressions. We have taken enough steps over the years to \navoid the kind of difficulties that can sweep across a nation.\n  Mr. President, I am sure the President is aware of this, my State, \nover the last 4, 5, 6, or 7 years, has been very hard hit economically. \nWe have historically been called the Provision State, dating back to \nthe Revolutionary War, and we are proud of it. The builders of \nhelicopters, and jet engines at Pratt & Whitney, and submarines and \nelectric boats, radar systems at Norden, we have a long history. The \nend of the cold war, the recession and the real estate collapse all hit \nmy small State very hard. It has been very, very difficult for us to \nget back on our feet. Luckily, these economic troubles did not sweep \nacross the country. Most parts of the country have done well. What am I \nto do in my State because of its unique problems? We need some \nparticular help in responding to the needs of our people.\n  What worries me is that we may not have national depressions, but we \ncould have regional depressions. Will there be enough votes in these \nbodies to have supermajorities to provide the resources that specific \nregions of the country need? It could be an agricultural problem that \nhits--possibly bad crop seasons. I know the people of my State have \nbeen sympathetic in the past in responding when that has occurred. They \nare consumers of the food that is produced in this country. But natural \ndisasters can hit. People can be literally wiped out in a matter of \nweeks. How do we respond? Should we respond? Is every State that does \nnot have the same interests going to vote accordingly?\n  Again, hamstrung by a constitutional amendment, it would make it \ndifficult for us to use common sense and respond. That is troublesome \nto me, to put it mildly. For those reasons and others, Mr. President, I \nurge my colleagues to move away from this particular debate. If the \nissue was we needed to get the attention of some reluctant Members of \nCongress--and I happen to believe there were some who were not serious \nenough about this issue. I go back to the days of the early 1980's. As \nan original sponsor of the Gramm-Rudman proposal, I think it could have \nworked had we not had a bunch of loopholes. Back in 1982 or 1983, I \noffered a pay-as-you-go budget, Mr. President, requiring that for every \nsingle expenditure there had to be resource to pay for it--every single \nexpenditure. Had we adopted a pay-as-you-go in 1982, we would have been \nin balance 11 years ago, in 1986. I only got 22 votes on the floor of \nthis Chamber in 1982 on that proposal.\n  I take very seriously this debate about getting this budget in \nbalance and moving in the right direction, but I again argue, as I did \nat the outset, it is work. It is not easy. Everybody has to go back to \ntheir constituencies and explain why everyone has to share in this \nresponsibility. Merely taking out a chisel and etching into the organic \nlaw of this country the conclusion of a proposal of balancing the \nbudget does not get us there, and it does raise serious, serious \nquestions about other weighty matters that this Nation must come to \nterms with from time to time.\n  In my view, it places them in jeopardy, and particularly at a time \nwhen it seems to me that we are on the right track, moving in the right \ndirection. I do not understand why we would place in jeopardy other \nvitally important issues when, in fact, we are achieving, I think all \nwould agree, the goals stated by those who strongly endorse this \nconstitutional amendment.\n  In addition the constant inflexibility in our budgetary \ndecisionmaking process could have a disastrous impact on the business \ncommunity. The private sector expects order and consistency in our \neconomic policy. What's more, they rely on the Federal Government for \nour support and assistance in myriad ways.\n  Whether it's the research and experimentation tax credit, our \naggressive advocacy for American exporters, or the vital statistics and \ninformation published by Federal agencies, the private sector receives \ncrucial support from the Federal Government. However, passage of this \namendment could\n\n[[Page S1143]]\n\nthreaten to create a frantic rush, year in and year out, for the \nsavings necessary for bringing the budget into constitutional \ncompliance. In that sort of an environment, no Federal program would be \nsafe. Business leaders would be unable to plan ahead, not knowing what \nprograms will be funded or cut from year to year. An R tax credit \nthat is constantly in jeopardy of being canceled is of little benefit \nto American business.\n  Contrary to the rhetoric of those who support this amendment, \nAmerican businesses will suffer if they are forced to operate in the \nlooming shadow of tax increases or potential cuts in important \nprograms. What's more, under the requirements of a balanced budget \namendment the Congress would be forced to reorder our budgetary \npriorities every fiscal year. There'd be no rhyme or reason to what we \ncut and what we fund, because our decisions would be based on short-\nterm economic factors. Long-term considerations would simply go by the \nwayside. By almost any standard, the balanced budget amendment is bad \neconomic policy. But, it would have even worse and more far-reaching \nconstitutional implications. Passage of this amendment risks allowing \ndirect judicial involvement in the enforcement of a balanced budget \nrequirement.\n  If for whatever reason, the Congress was unable to achieve either a \nbalanced budget or get 60 votes to waive the requirement for such, then \nthe Federal judiciary could be forced to make critical decisions on \nbudgetary allocations. I must say, I find it quite interesting that \nmany of the same people who complain about so-called judicial activism \nare seeking to pass an amendment that would thrust the judiciary \ndirectly into our budgetary discussions. Theoretically, judges could \norder the Government to stop Social Security checks from being sent \nout, cut Federal spending, or even raise taxes. Additionally, to those \nwho complain about a clogged court system, we could see a significant \nrise in litigation by either Members of Congress or private citizens \nhurt by spending cuts mandated by this amendment.\n  For the Congress to go along with such a proposal represents an \nabdication of our responsibilities as legislators. The Constitution \nmandates very clearly that the legislative and executive branches must \nposses sole responsibility for fiscal policy. Yet, this amendment would \nfundamentally transform our constitutional system of checks and \nbalances by placing the judiciary in an unheard of position--making \nbudgetary decisions. This contravenes the most sacrosanct notions of \nconstitutional integrity--our system of checks and balances and \ndivision of authority among the three branches of government. And it \nwould debase the Constitution by involving it directly in economic \ndecision making. This constitutional amendment would place what is \nfundamentally a fiscal policy into our organic law.\n\n  Again, I urge all my colleagues to read the Constitution before they \ncast their vote. Look at the sorts of amendments that have been \nenacted. At their core, they deal almost universally with issues of \nsocial policy and the functioning of our democratic institutions--not \nwith economic policy. But, this amendment would change that legacy. And \nI believe it could begin a disquieting process of including what is \nbasically statutory language into our national Constitution. There can \nbe little doubt that we face a momentous decision.\n  Changing the Constitution is not like adopting a simple statute that \ncan be modified or repealed somewhere down the road. The fact is, \namending the Constitution is one of the most sacred duties of our role \nas national leaders. Indeed, the language we insert into the \nConstitution is timeless. And it will likely stay there long after all \nof us leave this Earth. However, I worry that the fundamental, hallowed \nnature of our Constitution is being lost on my colleagues.\n  The last Congress advocated one of the most sweeping rewrites of the \nU.S. Constitution since the Bill of Rights. And I worry that this \nCongress will continue this troubling precedent. In the 104th Congress, \namendments were proposed requiring a supermajority for taxes, \nadvocating terms limits, providing for a line-item veto, allowing \nschool prayer, preventing unfunded mandates, criminalizing flag \nburning, and the list goes on.\n  The Constitution is not a set of institutional guidelines to be \namended by each new generation of leaders. Generation after generation \nwill live with the consequences of our constitutional decisions. And \nwhile I realize that this amendment is incredibly popular among the \nAmerican people, that should not be our determining factor. Amending \nthe Constitution must not be based on the political currents of today, \nbut the sacred principles on which our Nation was founded. There is a \nvery good reason why, in the more than 200 years since this Nation \nadopted the Constitution, we have seen fit to amend it only 27 times--\n27 times in more than 200 years. In fact, in those 200 or so years, \nthere've been approximately 11,000 proposed amendments to the \nConstitution. Only 33 passed the Congress. And the Bill of Rights \nnotwithstanding, only 17 are now part of the Constitution. What's more, \namending the Constitution remains an incredibly difficult task.\n  Two-thirds of the Congress, and three-fourths of the State \nlegislatures must agree before we change the law of the land. Our \nFounding Fathers made clear that amending the Constitution would not be \nan easy or brazen decision. As Henry Clay said 145 years ago, ``The \nConstitution of the United States was made not merely for the \ngeneration that then existed, but for posterity--unlimited, undefined, \nendless, perpetual posterity.''\n  These are not idle words. The Constitution is sacred parchment--our \nguiding force for more than 200 years of democratic rule and a beacon \nfor millions around the world who yearn for the dignity that freedom \nand democracy bestows. In my view, this document remains one of the \ngreatest political and democratic accomplishments in human history and \nthe amending of it must not be a rash or impetuous act. We all agree on \nthe need for balancing the budget, but this amendment is the wrong way \nto go about doing it. If we are to really bring our fiscal house in \norder; if we are to guarantee to future generations that they will not \nbe burdened with our debts; if we are to balance the budget in a fair \nand equitable manner, then let us reject this amendment and instead \nroll up our shirt sleeves and get down to the task of making the tough \nchoices to truly balance the budget.\n  I thank the majority leader for making this possible. I yield the \nfloor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/07/senate-section/article/S1140-4", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, FEBRUARY 10, 1997\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
