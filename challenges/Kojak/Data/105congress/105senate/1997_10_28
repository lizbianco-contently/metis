Mr. President, my remarks this morning go to the need for \nthis body to begin to address the substantive provisions of the highway \nbill, S. 1173. As the Senate full knows, I am privileged to be the \nchairman of the subcommittee which, over the course of a period of the \nyear, developed this piece of legislation. Many Senators have traveled \ngreat distances. We had hearings in several places throughout the \nUnited States and a number of hearings here, of course, in our \ncommittee room. But a lot of hard work went into this bill.\n  Now, the question on cloture involves the Senate consideration of the \ncampaign finance bill. I leave to the respective leaders who, as nearly \nas I can determine, are trying to work diligently to resolve the \nprocedural conflict involving that piece of legislation, campaign \nfinance reform, as it relates to this bill. But as I read through the \norder that was prepared by the leader's office this morning reciting \nother pieces of legislation to which this body will turn, the question, \nof course, rises, why can't we go ahead with the ISTEA bill?\n  Again, I leave that to the leaders. They have worked on this \ndiligently and indeed there are developments every hour on the hour. So \nit is difficult for any of us not involved in the negotiations to \nexplain the exact reasons.\n  But the reason I asked to take the floor this morning is that we are \nwitnessing here in this country, in the past week, and particularly \nyesterday, a very precipitous decline in our stock market, commodity \nmarkets, and the like. It clearly manifests an instability.\n  As I look at this piece of legislation, this is an absolute building \nblock of stability for America's economy. This bill has literally \nmillions and millions of jobs related to it. Now, highways, bridges, \nand other infrastructure requirements take months to plan--engineering, \nfinancial, consideration by the respective legislative bodies and \nhighway commissions of the several States. It is a process which was \ncarefully crafted in the 1991 bill over a period of\n\n[[Page S11246]]\n\n6 years. The reason we put in a 6-year bill was to provide the type of \nstability that enables those from the Governor and State legislatures \nto the various highway boards and commissions to do that type of \nplanning.\n  All across this country today, in the wake of the instability of the \nmarketplace and other economic indicators, millions and millions of men \nand women are dependent for their livelihood on this program going \nforward in an orderly way. Highways can't be built overnight. Weather \nhas a very definite impact on the ability of the hands of these \nlaboring people to build these highway systems. In some States, that \nenvelope of weather is a matter of several months, primarily because of \nthe weather conditions. But indeed during the course of the intense \nheat of summer, again, there are restrictive periods in which roads and \nhighways can be built. It is for that reason that I ask this morning \nthat we cannot be oblivious to what is taking place in the marketplace \nof our country and all over the world, this instability, at a time when \nthis bill will be a very steady building block to add stability.\n  This vote will be the fourth to invoke cloture so that the Senate can \nproceed to the consideration of this legislation to reauthorize our \nNation's surface transportation programs. This is needed because of the \nintent regarding campaign financing.\n  Mr. President, the funding level is $145 billion. Stop and think \nabout that--$145 billion. That would benefit every single State. We \nhave tried in this bill to equitably and fairly distribute these funds \nthat would go from the State in the form of gasoline taxes, petroleum \ntaxes associated with trucks, and diesel, and so forth--up to the \nhighway trust fund and revolve and come back. We have tried to \nequitably distribute these funds, more so than in the 1991 ISTEA. The \nfunding level in ISTEA II, which is the present bill, is $145 billion. \nIt is a 20-percent increase in funding over the 1991 ISTEA I.\n  This funding level, if I may say, is significantly higher than \nrecommended by the administration in their proposal that came to the \nCongress. The United States has the largest transportation system in \nthe world, with 170,000 miles of National Highway System routes, \n900,000 miles of other Federal aid roads, and 3.7 million miles of \nother public roads. Our national network of highways carries 136 \nmillion cars, 58 million light trucks, 6.9 million freight trucks, and \n686,000 buses. In 1995, cars and light trucks, mostly personal \nvehicles, were driven 2.2 trillion miles.\n  What is alarming to learn, however, is that nearly half of our major \nroad system is in mediocre or fair condition. I will repeat that. Half \nof this vast communications system is in mediocre or fair condition. \nThis lack of investment clearly jeopardizes safety, the individual \npersonal safety of those on the highways, and the mobility of the \ntraveling public, as well as our economic competitiveness.\n  Now, I don't presume to give the causes for this problem in the \nmarket today, but anybody who wishes to be informed can certainly \nlisten carefully, as I have done in the last 24 hours, to others who \npresumably have a better knowledge. But this problem is precipitated \nless by the U.S. economy, if at all--because that economy is relatively \nhealthy--but more by the world marketplace, and primarily in Asia. It \nis a one-world competitive market, and the ability of this Nation to \ncompete in that market is very, very significantly dependent on the \nefficiencies, the safety of this infrastructure of highways and roads \nand bridges. Mr. President, again, it is the competition in the world \nfinancial markets, primarily the deterioration of the situation in Asia \nthat is causing the precipitous decline in our markets. I subscribe \nthat that same competition exists in every other walk of life relative \nto the ability of the American working men and women to compete with \ntheir hands and their minds with others throughout the world. It is a \none-world market.\n  I remember so well visiting, in Luray, VA, a plant that manufactures \nblue jeans. Now, blue jeans are almost a language in the world over \ntoday in many respects. I saw Virginians down over their machines \nsewing the particular garments being made that day.\n  I turned to the plant manager, who was escorting me through and I \nsaid, ``How can we compete with the blue jeans manufacturers elsewhere \nin the world?'' It was very interesting. I said, ``We are complying \nwith all the environmental requirements, with the wage laws, the \nworkers are well paid, well cared for, with health programs; how can we \ncompete with those plants that are operating while we are sleeping in \nthe Asian market?''\n  He said, ``Come with me.''\n  We walked down and I saw a bank of computers that take the orders in, \nrelay the orders to the workbench, products are manufactured, put on a \nconveyor belt, and then he beckoned me and we went outside. There were \na half-dozen semi-trailers being loaded, box after box. He said to me \nvery simply, ``That order came in this morning, that garment was \nmanufactured to the specifications of the merchant that placed that \norder, and the finished product is put in that truck and that truck \ntravels overnight and that pair of jeans is on the store shelf the \nfollowing morning.''\n  Asia cannot compete because of the infrastructure of transportation, \nthe ability of this plant and other plants all over America to, within \n24 hours, turn around an order and have that product on the shelf.\n  That is what is at stake, the ability to turn around these products \nin the face of a deteriorating infrastructure all across this country.\n  Mediocre and fair condition. That is half of the Nation's road \nsystem. That extrapolates into jobs, millions and millions of men and \nwomen of the United States ready to go to work provided in this bill \nand provide the needed stability that we are lacking today in view of \nthese tragic declines in the world markets.\n  Transportation provides the link between business, industries, and \nconsumers. Transportation and related industries employ 9.9 million \npeople in the United States, slightly more than 7 percent of the total \nwork force in this Nation. According to the Department of \nTransportation, for every $1 billion invested in highway and bridge \nprojects, over 42,000 new jobs are created. As one of the largest \nsectors of our economy, transportation represents nearly 11 percent of \nthe gross domestic product. It is just behind the basic services of \nhousing, health care, and food.\n  Another compelling statistic confirms that transportation remains a \nsound investment for the American taxpayers. For every dollar spent, \nthere is an economic return of $2.60.\n  Mr. President, I therefore urge my colleagues to consider these facts \nand let us not bring upon this institution that old adage that while \nRome burned, Nero fiddled. We have to come to grips with this \nprocedural question on campaign finance reform, but this type of \nlegislation must go forward to provide the economic stability that is \nnecessary at this very hour in America.\n  So I close, Mr. President, by urging all Senators who will be coming \nto the floor very shortly to express their views to perhaps take a look \nat what is happening in the international financial markets. It is \nimpacting this country. Take a look at what is happening because while \ncampaign finance is an important issue, it could really be perceived in \nthe workplace by those who carry the lunch buckets, those who bend and \nsweat and toil to build America's roads and bridges, as the ant that \ntoppled the mountain of jobs that are involved in this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak as in morning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes this \nmorning to debunk a few myths that are being spread about how the \nSenate voluntary national testing plan would\n\n[[Page S11247]]\n\nwork and explain why a so-called compromise that has been discussed \nhere in the Capitol in the last few days misses the mark almost \nentirely.\n  As many of my colleagues here in the Senate already know, the \nopponents of a voluntary national test are blocking what in my view is \na reasonable and carefully crafted proposal to improve our schools. \nOver a month ago here in the Senate, we voted 87 to 13 in support of \nthis proposal. Since then, the opponents of it have refused to even sit \ndown at the table and talk about the issue. In fact, they have \nthreatened to shut down the Federal Government again rather than to \nallow States and school districts and parents to decide for themselves \nwhether or not they want to use these new tests.\n  In recent weeks, the opponents of voluntary national testing have \ntried to spread a series of myths about the proposal that was passed by \nthe Senate. Many of these are described on the chart here. Let me just \ngo through a few of them.\n  First of all, one of the myths is that this is ``just another test.'' \nIn reality, these national tests would provide essential information to \nparents that none of the commercial tests presently available provide, \nby allowing a comparison. The tests that are being considered by us in \nthis legislation would allow a comparison between students across the \nNation as to their level of performance on reading in the fourth grade \nand mathematics at the eighth grade.\n  Another myth is that the tests are not voluntary. The claim is that \nthey are not voluntary. In fact, we have written into the language of \nthe bill a specific requirement that they be voluntary; a prohibition \nagainst any impediment or any force being put on a State or district or \ncommunity that chooses not to use the tests.\n  Another of the myths is that they would not do anything, when in \nreality we have various States and communities and school districts \naround the Nation that are showing that high standards and uniform \nmeasures of achievement can engage and empower area communities to put \nmore emphasis on their schools and increase the learning that occurs \nthere.\n  But, despite the mischaracterizations of the voluntary testing \nproposal, I am glad to report that educators and business leaders and \nthe American public support this proposal overwhelmingly, the proposal \nthat the President sent forward. I know this from having heard it from \npeople on the front lines.\n  This last Friday we had a meeting with various people. An elementary \nschool parent and PTA member, Laura Scott, told about how important \nindependent tests were for parents who are handing their children over \nto schools and need all the leverage they can get to make sure the \neducation their children are getting in those schools is adequate. Gov. \nRoy Romer of Colorado spoke about the efforts that are being made in \nColorado to develop their tests in these various subjects and how he \nwould appreciate a chance to know how his State is doing relative to \nother States. He could not see any justification for each of the 50 \nStates having to reinvent the wheel. Obviously, the President's \nproposal would eliminate the need for that. The Governor of North \nCarolina, Jim Hunt, also spoke eloquently about the importance of \nhaving benchmarks so that he can determine the appropriateness of the \neducation that is being provided to his own grandchildren in the public \nschools of North Carolina.\n  From a business perspective, Alan Wurtzel, of the National Alliance \nof Business, and Chris Larson, of the Technology Network, described how \nimportant uniform measures of achievement are to preparing a qualified \nwork force for the 21st century and how the business community insists \nupon objective measurements of achievement in the training that they \ndo. And they believe that same concept makes a lot of sense in our \nschools as well.\n  Representing large, urban school districts, Philadelphia School \nSuperintendent David Hornbeck said that the tests, as he saw it, would \nbe, and the phrase he used was a ``sword of equality'' for poor and \nminority students in Philadelphia and elsewhere who today are receiving \nan inferior education, unfortunately, in many of these school systems \nbut, by virtue of this kind of objective performance testing, would be \nable to improve the situation.\n  Most recently, opponents of the voluntary national tests came up with \nthe so-called compromise proposal that in my view reveals a basic \nmisunderstanding about what the voluntary national testing proposal is \nsupposed to do. The proposed compromise preserves the status quo. It \nrelies on a type of test --the type which many of our school districts \nare now using--which creates the impression that students are doing \nbetter than they really are. We could refer to this proposal as the \nLake Woebegone proposal. It is clearly a situation, which we have \ntoday, where ``all the children are above average.''\n  First off, the compromise they are proposing is not much different \nfrom an outright prohibition on the development of any new tests. \nFurther development of a voluntary national test would be immediately \nand completely prohibited under this compromise, so-called compromise, \nthat has been discussed. That is nothing else but protecting the status \nquo, in denying States, denying school districts the choice to \nparticipate in a national measure of student achievement. Seven States \nhave already indicated they want to participate and 15 major school \ndistricts have opted to do so.\n\n  Second, this proposed compromise wouldn't really accomplish anything \nuseful in terms of focusing more attention on world-class standards for \nall children. That is because instead of developing new national tests \non fourth grade reading and eighth grade math, this antitesting \nproposal would fund a $3 million study of the feasibility of linking \nvarious commercial tests that are already there with each other. These \ncommercial tests that would be linked under this study do not conform \nto the rigorous academic standards of the National Assessment of \nEducational Progress. The whole idea behind this development of a \nfourth grade reading test and eighth grade math test is we want these \nkinds of rigorous national academic standards that are reflected in the \nNational Assessment of Educational Progress available for all schools \nto look at.\n  In addition, the tests that would be studied are all ``norm-\nreferenced'' tests, which means their scores are all reported by \npercentiles. They show how you scored compared to others, but they do \nnot show how you score relative to any kind of objective criteria, as \nto whether or not you can read at a reasonable level or do math at a \nreasonable level.\n  In many ways, this proposal misses the point. It suggests that the \ncurrent hodgepodge of commercial tests can adequately solve the \nproblem. It proposes to preserve the status quo rather than allowing \nStates and districts to make their own choices. It undercuts the \nNational Assessment for Educational Progress which is the most rigorous \nnational measure of student achievement. And this so-called compromise \nis completely unsatisfactory in that it would block the proposal we \nagreed to here in the Senate, to allow this test to be developed by the \nNational Assessment Governing Board.\n  Here in the Senate, the compromise that was negotiated, it was clear, \nwas supported overwhelmingly by a bipartisan group of Senators. Leading \nscholars in this field such as Checker Finn and Bill Bennett supported \nthat compromise. Since then, 43 Senators have pledged to block the \nappropriations bill or to uphold a veto, if the President is required \nto veto the bill, if that original compromise is not maintained.\n  So, if testing opponents want the National Academy of Sciences to \nstudy whether commercial or even State-developed tests are as rigorous \nas the National Assessment of Educational Progress, I have no problem \nwith that. I think studies can sometimes be useful. But until it is \nclear that State and commercial tests are up to the task, I believe we \nshould be able to go ahead with the voluntary national test development \nand that funding should be kept in the bill and not be prohibited as \nthe House is considering doing.\n  Mr. President, I know there are others waiting to speak. I yield the \nfloor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am here this morning on the floor to talk \nabout the very important ISTEA legislation that is being held up in the \nSenate here for many, many different reasons. But the introduction of \nthe Senate's Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1997 \nrepresents the results of intense negotiations between Chairman Chafee, \nSenator Warner, and Senator Baucus, each of whom have represented three \ndifferent legislative approaches to the reauthorization of ISTEA.\n  I thank each of these Senators for the work they have done to bring \nthis bill to the floor because the citizens of my home State of \nMinnesota strongly support a 6-year reauthorization bill, funded at the \nhighest levels. This should be one of our top priorities before we \nadjourn this session. Unfortunately, however, this very important piece \nof legislation is being held up by other Senators seeking to impose a \npolitical agenda on a very vital transportation spending issue. Again, \nit is being held up by Senators who want to impose a political agenda \non vital transportation spending.\n  Their effort to halt this crucial transportation spending bill are \nfar more egregious than other attempts in the past to influence \nlegislation by holding it hostage. It is inconceivable to me that we \nwould not consider this bill on its own merits. The question of why not \nis being asked by every State concerned about the availability of \ntransportation funds for continuing projects. It is ironic that \nSenators claiming to support labor issues would now thumb their noses \nat the same hard-working Americans who feed and clothe their families \nthrough the salaries they earn working on transportation projects, not \nto mention how important those projects are for improved safety and for \nmeeting our growing transportation needs.\n  ISTEA must be considered before we adjourn for the year. There has \nbeen a real effort to reach a compromise that achieves balance among \nthe 50 States. This balance is required to address unique \ntransportation needs in the different regions of our country: The \ncongestion needs of the growing South, the aging infrastructure needs \nof the Northeast, as well as the national transportation needs of the \nrural West and the Midwest. Almost every State shares in the growth in \ndollars contained in the bill compared with the funding levels that \nthey received under ISTEA back in 1991.\n  I was proud to join Senator Warner as a cosponsor of STEP 21 earlier \nthis year, as Minnesota was a member of the STEP 21 coalition, and I am \npleased that much of the bill has been incorporated now into this piece \nof legislation.\n  Mr. President, this bill attempts to preserve the principles of ISTEA \nthat have proven to be successful. We need to ensure that our \ntransportation growth contributes to the preservation of our \nenvironment.\n  We need to continue to build upon the shared decisionmaking among the \nFederal, State, and local governments in the transportation planning \nprocess. We also need a transportation bill that is based on a formula \nthat is fair. This bill will either succeed on the doctrine of fairness \nor it will fall victim to politics as it has in the past.\n  I am pleased the ISTEA reauthorization attempts to ensure a fair \nallocation of funds. The new formula was determined with objective \nfactors, such as the number of miles of the National Highway System and \neach State's contributions to the highway trust fund.\n  Under this legislation, every State will receive a minimum return of \n90 percent of their contributions to the highway trust fund. That is a \nvery different guarantee from the so-called 90-percent minimum \nallocation in ISTEA. This is a real guarantee.\n  Finally, we must have a transportation bill that makes an improvement \nin streamlining as well as flexibility. This bill streamlines ISTEA's \nfive major programs down into three, and they are the National Highway \nSystem, the Surface Transportation Program, and the Congestion \nMitigation and Air Quality Program.\n  The Federal focus on our most important network of roads, the \nNational Highway System, which includes our interstate system, is \nmaintained. The streamlining and the flexibility provided by the ISTEA \nreauthorization will give Minnesota the ability to make its own \ntransportation decisions, and that is a great step forward. Other \nStates also would have the same freedom.\n  This bill attempts to get a reasonable rate of return for Minnesota. \nIn this bill, my State will receive 1.50 percent of Federal \napportionment dollars, which represents an increase from the 1.43 \npercent of actual dollars under the 1991 ISTEA.\n  The bill would also increase my State's share by over $82 million per \naverage year above the 1991 authorization level.\n  I am also pleased to be a cosponsor of the Byrd-Gramm amendment which \nallows the Federal gas tax of 4.3 cents now dedicated to the highway \ntrust fund to actually be spent on highways. This will provide \nMinnesota the necessary additional revenue that is so critical to \nmeeting our infrastructure needs.\n  Mr. President, the political games must end. The reauthorization of \nISTEA has expired. We need to go forward and we need to approve a new \nhighway reauthorization bill.\n  It has been proven again and again that transportation spending is \none of the most important, it is one of the most cost-effective \ninvestments in our Nation's future. For every $1 billion spent on \ntransportation, we create 60,000 jobs, jobs that are now at risk again \nwhile some Senators attempt to hold this legislation prisoner in \nexchange for the advancement of their particular political agendas. I \nask my colleagues this morning to help liberate this political hostage \nto allow the ISTEA legislation to proceed.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.

Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the attention \nof the Senate and, hopefully, to the Nation, a concern that is very \nimportant to my constituents in the State of Louisiana and to other \ncoastal States. I rise to address this issue in order to begin what I \nhope will be an educational process for all of us.\n\n  As you know, the Federal Government, through the Minerals Management \nService and the Bureau of Land Management at the Department of the \nInterior shares with the States 50 percent of the mineral revenues from \nFederal lands inside the boundary of States, to offset the impacts of \nonshore mineral development. Unlike the States that support onshore \ndevelopment of Federal mineral resources, Louisiana, particularly, and \nTexas, Alaska, California, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida receive \ncomparatively little of the revenues received by the Federal Government \nfor offshore oil and gas development on the Outer Continental Shelf.\n  I intend very shortly to introduce legislation to realign the OCS \nrevenues to reflect a more fair and more just allocation. This \nlegislation will also address historical and anticipated impacts on \ninfrastructure and environmental needs that have been identified over \nthe course of time. I raise this issue as the Senate today, Mr. \nPresident, will be voting on the Interior and related agencies \nappropriations conference report this afternoon. That bill\n\n[[Page S11249]]\n\ncontains funding for land and water conservation and the National \nHistoric Preservation Fund. All of those moneys, almost up to $1 \nbillion authorized, comes from OCS revenues. So the Federal Treasury \nhas been a great beneficiary, and many States, of course, have shared \nin these revenues.\n  This year also marks the 50th anniversary of oil and gas exploration \nand production in the United States off the gulf coast. We have come a \nlong way from the early days when a few intrepid souls dared to combine \ntheir resources to take a risk on a black pitch-like substance that was \nseeping out of the hills of Pennsylvania. They discovered that this \nsubstance would burn. From that substance kerosene was derived and then \ncame gasoline and numerous other petroleum products that support the \nAmerican economy and the American lifestyle today.\n  Oil and gas development has long been the lifeblood of my State--\nthrough good times and bad, through the early years of this century and \nthe bust years of the 1980's. In Louisiana, as in other oil-patch \nStates, there was an abundance of oil and gas. Many people dug wells, \nplugged them, and made and lost fortunes.\n  In the 1970's, there was an oil boom that no one thought would end, \nbut it did. During that time, businesses sprang up in Oklahoma and \nTexas and throughout the oil patch with businesses building \nheadquarters in cities like Tulsa, Houston, and Dallas. In the Gulf of \nMexico, oil and gas platforms appeared. People discovered a wealth of \nreserves in coastal waters and, later, in Federal waters, particularly \noff the coast of Louisiana.\n  Mr. President, I want to share with you today, and many Members of \nthe Senate, that all of the production in the gulf identified is by \nthese squares that are blocked off. You can see that almost 90 percent, \nfrom approximately this line to all the way over is off Louisiana's \ncoast. About 90 percent of the production is supported off Louisiana's \ncoast, and that is the point I want to make today. It is not all the \ncoastal States supporting it equally. Louisiana is contributing a huge \namount to this development, which is contributing a huge amount of \nmoney to the Federal Treasury.\n  The history of OCS development and State versus Federal ownership was \ndefined in the time of President Truman. There was a great deal of \ndiscussion on this issue between interested parties, with no real \nsolution as to how these proceeds should be fairly divided. The \ncontroversy continued briefly through the forties and fifties. Finally, \nlegislation came in 1953. This act established a 3-mile State water \nboundary for Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama and, for historical \nreasons, a 10-mile border for Texas and the gulf coast of Florida.\n  The understanding was that States would own the resources up to 3 \nmiles out from their coastal boundaries, and the Federal Government \nwould own the resources beyond the 3-mile mark, and that lasted for \nyears. In addition, in 1985, a new zone was created through an \namendment to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, the 8g zone. So \nbetween 3 and 6 miles, the States on the coast can now benefit in some \nadditional ways, but rather minor, from the oil and gas derived from \nthat 3- to 6-mile zone.\n\n  The most recent Federal law to apply to the Outer Continental Shelf \nwas passed in the last Congress, through the leadership of my \npredecessor, former Senator Bennett Johnston. This measure, the Outer \nContinental Shelf Deepwater Royalty Relief Act, provided a royalty \nincentive for companies that wished to explore in deep waters off the \ncontinental shelf but were constrained by the cost of deepwater \ndrilling.\n  Today, as a result of this act, you can see from the previous chart \nthat there have been record sales and bids off the gulf coast, \nparticularly in Louisiana. In March of this year, lease sale No. 166 \nwas held in the central gulf, and 103 companies bid on over 5,000 \nblocks comprising 27 million acres offshore Alabama, Louisiana, and \nMississippi. The companies made record bids. Fifty-one percent of these \nblocks were in 800 meters of water. The deepest block was in 9,000 feet \nof water.\n  The mind-boggling total value of these bids was in excess of $800 \nmillion. Mr. President, five additional sales are planned beginning in \nMarch. All of this is due to the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act which \nhas created thousands of good paying jobs in the energy industry, both \nonshore and offshore. The Federal Treasury has benefited substantially. \nThe Federal Treasury received an amount of $2.8 billion from these \nleases in 1995. Louisiana contributed $2.1 billion. These figures do \nnot include corporate taxes and taxes that were also collected for the \nFederal Treasury.\n  I need to clarify the funding situation for those who are listening \ntoday. When there is onshore oil and gas production, States are \nentitled to 50 percent of the royalties. Alaska gets 90 percent \nonshore. For coastal States with offshore production in 8g, States \nreceive only 27 percent, and beyond the 6-mile mark for Louisiana, \nMississippi, and Alabama, States are not entitled to any percentage. \nThat is the point of this discussion.\n  In conclusion, let me say that we need to make this distribution more \nfair and more equitable. With the amounts of money that are being \ndistributed based on 50 percent for onshore, based on 90 percent for \nAlaska, but now under the current law, outside of this 6 miles, the \ncoastal States receive almost nothing. The amount of money being \ngenerated is greater and greater every year. Just last year, as I \nmentioned, it was up to $2.8 billion received by the Federal Treasury. \nAnd of that amount, Louisiana received less than $16 million from \ncontributing over 90 percent of the production totaling almost $3 \nbillion. We received only $15.9 million.\n  For 50 years, Louisiana has borne the brunt of the impacts associated \nwith oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico. While we acknowledge \nthat hosting offshore production has provided some economic rewards in \nthe State, Louisiana cannot tax the production on the OCS, nor do we \nreceive a share of the governmental payments on the OCS. There has been \ndamage to onshore staging areas, damage from activities by the Corps of \nEngineers, and deterioration of infrastructure such as roads and \nhighways that are used to get equipment and workers to the offshore \nfields. The State of Louisiana has not received appropriate \ncompensation for the use of its land and the environmental impacts of \nthis production.\n  Moreover, Mr. President, we have a very fragile environment in south \nLouisiana. I have visited Port Fouchon, in La Fourche Parish many \ntimes. La Fourche Parish is a rural, relatively isolated parish at the \nbottom of the ``L'' in Louisiana, if you picture the State in the form \nof the letter ``L.'' The people there are of modest means, and do their \nbest to make a good living. Port Fouchon is Louisiana's only port on \nthe Gulf of Mexico. Its proximity to the deepwater oil and gas \ndiscoveries makes it the port of choice for an increasing number of \nbusinesses. Over 6,000 people depend on the port as an avenue to and \nfrom offshore facilities. In just 3 years, Port Fouchon has tripled the \namount of cargo it handles--from 10 million to over 30 million tons in \n1996.\n\n  Near Port Fouchon is the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port [LOOP]. LOOP is \na state of the art offshore facility located 20 miles south of Port \nFouchon. LOOP is connected through five pipelines to over 30 percent of \nthe Nation's refining capacity. Recently, the deepwater platform Mars, \nby Shell Oil, was connected by pipeline to LOOP. Consequently, LOOP \nwill be handling a significant portion of the Gulf of Mexico's domestic \ndeepwater oil production. Couple this with the recently announced goal \nthat the MMS would like to increase oil production in the gulf from 1.7 \nto 2 million barrels of oil a day. This is an extremely ambitious \nschedule. Such an increase would amount to an additional $600 million \nin royalties by the year 2000. Yet, there has been little attention to \ninfrastructure in La Fourche Parish, and little attention to the \nenvironment. According to Bob Thompson, president of LOOP, ``Nearly all \nof LOOP's logistical support for offshore operations comes directly \nthrough Port Fouchon, and hence across substandard roadways. We must \nimprove our highway infrastructure to accommodate this new business.'' \nCurrently, over 80 deepwater prospects are identified off coastal \nLouisiana. An astounding 75 percent of these are in the Port Fouchon \nservice area. Terrebonne and St. Mary Parishes, St. Bernard, and \nJefferson which\n\n[[Page S11250]]\n\nare adjacent to La Fourche, will also support industry activity. Many \nof the parishes need additional help as well as other coastal States. \nThese new demands will put a great deal of stress on an already \nbesieged environment. Mr. President, these areas and their fragile \nenvironments in Louisiana were sacrificed long ago for the benefit of \nindustry investment and development. I intend to ensure that these \nareas will be ignored no longer.\n  Since the early 1990's, the Minerals Management Service at the \nDepartment of the Interior and various heads of environment and natural \nresource departments from a number of States have been holding talks \nand negotiations over revenue sharing from the funds collected from \nactivity in the gulf. This month, in fact, tomorrow, the OCS Policy \nCommittee will be meeting in Galveston, TX, to vote on a revenue \nsharing initiative. I commend this method of consensus building that \nthe Department, industry, and the States have undertaken to address \nrevenue sharing and its implementation. But I want to go further than \njust recognizing their actions, Mr. President.\n  In the next few weeks, I will be filing the bill to bring this issue \nto the attention of the U.S. Senate to ask for a greater distribution \nand a more fair distribution to those States impacted so that we can \ncontinue to support this industry, but in return this industry can and \nthe Federal Treasury can invest back into Louisiana and other coastal \nStates so we can continue this drilling in an environmentally sensitive \nway.\n  Through advances in technology and favorable laws, we have come upon \na great resource for this Nation, to reduce our dependence on foreign \noil. At the same time, we must take advantage of this economic boon to \nreinvest in our environment, to repair damage to our wetlands, and to \ntake stock of our natural resources and their value as we benefit in \nthe coming years from activity in the gulf.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I thank you for the time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/28/senate-section/article/S11248-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              WALTER GREY HEMPHILL, JR., WORLD WAR II HERO\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, funeral services will be held today in my \nState for Walter Grey Hemphill, Jr., a World War II hero, who was also \na very close personal friend.\n  He was best known in our community as a former star athlete at Byram \nHigh School, who was recruited to play football at the University of \nMississippi in 1941, as a successful coach and teacher at his alma \nmater, a respected vice president and general manager of Deviney \nConstruction Co., an active member and chairman of the deacons at the \nFirst Baptist Church of Byram, and as a past worthy patron of the Order \nof the Eastern Star.\n  While most of his friends knew that Walter Grey Hemphill, Jr., had \nbeen a veteran of World War II, few were aware of the details of his \ncombat experiences. The fact that he was one of the true heros of the \nBattle of the Bulge was not something he talked about very easily.\n  The citation he received awarding him the Silver Star for valor in \nbattle described his bravery under fire and his willingness to risk his \nlife to save the lives of his fellow paratroopers of the 101st Airborne \nDivision in the fighting near Bastogne, Belgium, in December 1944. He \ndestroyed a German gun emplacement with an explosive charge at close \nrange while under heavy enemy fire. His courageous action saved the \nlives of the members of his unit, but he was seriously wounded in the \nprocess. He received two Purple Hearts and spent over a year in \nhospitals recovering from his injuries.\n  After the war, he returned to the University of Mississippi and, \nalthough unable to play football, he earned his bachelor and master's \ndegrees and became my high school world history teacher, as well as my \nfootball, basketball, and baseball coach. He was also our close \nneighbor whose friendship I enjoyed and appreciated. I'm confident that \nthe lessons I learned from him on the athletic fields, in the \nclassrooms, and in our neighborhood provided me with a firm foundation \nof values, attitudes, and work habits that made future academic and \nprofessional success possible.\n  I will always remember and be grateful for his generous acts of \nkindness, his fair but firm discipline, and his thoughtful leadership.\n  He is survived by a dear and loving wife, Elsie, and a devoted \ndaughter, Patricia Windham, to whom I extend my sincerest condolences.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/28/senate-section/article/S11250-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would just like to say a few words about \nwhere we are on the highway bill. It is due to internal political \ndiscussion and confrontation that we have not been able to move on the \nhighway bill. There has been a bipartisan effort to try to get an \nagreement on campaign finance reform. We are still at loggerheads.\n  Mr. President, it is imperative that we in the Senate find some way \nto get a highway bill passed. It has been a month now since the \nauthorization expired. It expired on September 30. We in the Senate are \nderelict by not passing highway legislation.\n  I say that because there are many States that are going to run out of \nmoney very soon. My State of Montana will run out the first part of \nFebruary. It takes a long time to let contracts, to bid on contracts, \nto get the pipeline lined up so dollars are out to the States for jobs. \nI have been in favor of the 6-year bill. It only makes sense that we \nhave some continuity in our highway program.\n  This is not some abstract theory, Mr. President. This is jobs. This \nis local people, cities and counties and States, that very much depend \nupon this multibillion-dollar program. So I urge us to find some \npragmatic, practical way to get some form of a highway bill passed. I \nhope it is 6 months. It may not be 6 months. I hope it is 6 years. It \nmay not be 6 years. But we have to pass something so when we go home \nover the holidays we will at least have built a bridge so next year we \ntake up a full 6-year bill and find a way to get that passed.\n  I urge my colleagues to find some way to solve this impasse now so we \nas a practical matter do our duty to get highway legislation passed.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my leader time to comment on \nthe remarks just made by the senior Senator from Montana. I share his \nview.\n  Obviously, this is a very significant concern for all of our States \nand for a lot of Governors and those who are making decisions in their \ndepartments of transportation.\n  There are really two approaches. The first approach is for us to \nreach an agreement to allow campaign finance reform to be set for a \ncertain date early next year. I think there are good-faith negotiations \ncontinuing, and I am hopeful they will produce the desired result.\n  But that is the first option. Then we can take up the 6-year bill and \ncomplete our work, as I know many of our colleagues, including this \nSenator, would like to do.\n  The second option is the one that the Senator from Montana alluded \nto. We can do what the House has already done. We can take up a 6-month \nbill. We can improve upon the 6-month bill that the House has proposed. \nI think we could use our allocation, our numbers and be in a much \nbetter position to go to conference. But certainly no one should object \nto moving a 6-month bill if we can't get agreement on a longer bill.\n  So either way, Mr. President, we have an option. We can take up the \n6-year bill--hopefully, that is still possible--only if we can get \ncampaign finance reform. Who knows what will happen in conference even \nwith a 6-year bill. But at least the Senate will have acted. Short of \nthat, there is absolutely no reason why we cannot take up a 6-month \nbill. We could do it on a unanimous-consent basis if we wished, and I \nhope we could do that as a second option should we not resolve the \nfirst.\n  However, I do believe we must act. We must resolve this matter prior \nto the end of this session. I am confident that, working together, we \ncan find a way to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would ask that I might proceed for 4 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I point out we have been on this highway \nbill, the surface transportation legislation, for nearly 3 weeks. This \nwas, I believe, the fourth cloture vote so that we could move on and \ndeal with the bill.\n  We could not get cloture. The other side didn't want us to have \ncloture. So that's why we are in this jam. This legislation before us \nis a 6-year bill. It came out of the committee unanimously. There may \nbe variations and amendments. That is fine. We ought to have a chance \nto bring them up and vote on them.\n  But we could not do that, Mr. President. I think that is very \nregrettable. Now people are backing off and saying let's possibly have \na 6-month bill. I think that is a disaster; nobody can do any long-\nrange planning with a 6-month piece of legislation.\n  So I think it is very unfortunate the way this has worked out. I am \nnot sure what the next order of business is or what the next step in \nconnection with this highway legislation will be, but I feel very badly \nthat we did not get cloture so we could go ahead and deal with a good \nbill, bring up the amendments and vote on them one way or another. But \nwe were unable to do that, and I regret it.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto proceed as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to respond briefly to the \nSenator from Rhode Island and make it as clear as I think it can be \nmade clear that this is about one issue. It is not about ISTEA. It is \nnot about the transportation needs of the country. It is about campaign \nfinance reform.\n  That is all this is about. We have been pressing for months to be \nable to get the ability to debate and have a full-fledged legislative \neffort on campaign finance reform. We have been denied the right to \nhave one vote on the substance of real campaign finance reform, not one \nvote.\n  The reason we are in this predicament is exclusively the resistance \non the part of the Republicans to permit us to have a date certain and \nthe ability to be able to legislate on campaign finance reform.\n  That is all this is about. There are as many Members on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle who want to vote for ISTEA as there are on \nthe Republican side. ISTEA will ultimately pass the Senate, and it will \npass overwhelmingly. This is about whether or not we are going to face \none of the most important issues the people in this country want to \nface, that a group of people are resisting and will not allow the \ndemocratic process to work. It is that simple. I hope no one will \nconfuse it in the days ahead. This could be resolved in a matter of \nhours by reasonably permitting those of us who seek campaign finance \nreform to know that we can return after the recess and be able to vote \nin February or March and have the Senate properly discuss the issue of \ncampaign finance reform.\n  This is an issue that, on the Republican side, Senator McCain has \nsaid and on our side the leadership has said and a number of us have \nsaid, is not going to go away.\n  If there is any lesson we have learned in the Senate, it is that when \nthere is the kind of issue that has a sufficient number of votes for \nthe underlying bill, they do not go away. We have seen that on the \nminimum wage. We have seen it on a host of other issues through history \nhere. I am confident that we can come together around some reasonable \napproach to campaign finance reform.\n  We have acknowledged to Senator McConnell and others that this is an \nissue which will take 60 votes. We know that. We are not suggesting \nthat this can be resolved other than by coming together with some kind \nof consensus that will resolve the capacity of either side to \nfilibuster. We know that.\n\n[[Page S11252]]\n\n  But until we get to the business of legislating, of actually \nproposing amendments and working with that kind of energy, we are never \ngoing to know if we can reach that kind of consensus, and that is what \nthis fight is about.\n  So I hope no one confuses it as somehow surrogate or secret \nopposition to ISTEA. It is not. It is about the unwillingness of the \nRepublicans at this point in time to set a date certain for campaign \nfinance reform and to permit us to come back and do the business of the \nSenate. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Might I ask colleagues whether or not there would be \nan opportunity to speak 5 minutes in morning business? Is that all \nright with my colleagues?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Minnesota for 5 \nminutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/28/senate-section/article/S11251-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11252-S11253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNITED STATES-CHINA SUPPORT\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to address the direction of our \ncountry's relationship with China. Right now, the Clinton \nadministration is busy with the state visit of Chinese President Jiang \nZemin. A state visit is the highest, most formal diplomatic event \nhosted by the United States. The champagne will flow, and flattering \ntoasts will be made.\n  I disagree with this red carpet treatment, Mr. President. There is no \nquestion that United States-Chinese relations are crucial and important \nfor both countries. It is wrong, however, for the United States to host \na state visit for President Jiang Zemin until we see significant \nprogress made on human rights in China. Instead of a ceremonial visit, \nwe should be holding a working visit with the Chinese leadership, \nfocusing on the critical issues that exist between our two nation, like \nhuman rights, weapons proliferation, and trade.\n  China continues to wage a war against individual freedoms and human \nrights. Hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of dissidents and advocates of \npolitical reform were detained just last year. They included human \nrights and pro-democracy activists, and members of religious groups. \nMany have been sentenced to long prison terms where they have been \nbeaten, tortured, and denied medical care.\n  Scores of Roman Catholics and Protestants were arrested. A crack-down \nin Tibet was carried out during the ``Strike Hard'' campaign. \nAuthorities ordered the closure of monasteries in Tibet and banned the \nDalai Lama's image. At one monastery which was closed, over 90 monks \nand novices were detained or disappeared.\n  Harry Wu, a man of extraordinary courage and character, has \ndocumented China's extensive forced labor system. His research has \nidentified more than 1,100 labor camps across China, many of which \nproduce products for export to dozens of countries around the world, \nincluding the United States.\n  Because he criticized his government, Harry Wu was also imprisoned in \nthese camps. For 19 years in 12 different forced labor camps across \nChina, Harry was forced to mine coal, manufacture chemicals, and build \nroads. He survived beatings, torture, and starvation. He witnessed the \ndeath of many of his fellow prisoners from brutality, disease, \nstarvation, and suicide.\n  According to Amnesty International, throughout China, mass summary \nexecutions continue to be carried out. At least 6,000 death sentences \nand 3,500 executions were officially recorded last year. The real \nfigures are believed to be much higher.\n  Our own State Department reported that in 1996: ``All public dissent \nagainst the party and government was effectively silenced by \nintimidation, exile, the imposition of prison terms, administration \ndetention, or house arrest. No dissidents were known to be active at \nyear's end.''\n  Mr. President, that is a chilling, deeply disturbing statement. It \ncuts to the core values of our Nation. And it was made by our own \nGovernment, and this administration. Yet, this week, the administration \nwill welcome President Jiang with pomp and circumstance. These actions \nindicate that, where China is concerned, what we have is not a policy \nof constructive engagement, but one of unconditional engagement.\n  Let us put some names and human faces to the statistics and \ngeneralities we have all heard with regards to China.\n  In May 1996, Wang Hui was detained. She was the wife of a jailed \nlabor activist. While detained, she was denied water and other liquids. \nShe tried to kill herself by hanging. According to Human Rights Watch, \nafter being cut down by police, she was punished with severe beating.\n  Ngawang Choephel is a Fulbright Scholar from Middlebury College. He \nstudied music, and returned to his homeland to document the ancient \nmusic and culture of Tibet. It is disappearing under the heel of the \nChinese Government. As a result of his work, he was convicted in \nFebruary, and sentenced to 18 years imprisonment for espionage. His \ncrime--sending videotapes of ethnic Tibetan music and dancing out of \nChina.\n  Last year, Wang Dan was sentenced to 11 years in prison on charges of \nconspiring to subvert the Chinese Government. Prior to sentencing, Wang \nhad already been held 17 months in incommunicado detention. His crime: \nHe was a leader of the Tiananmen movement.\n  Two years ago, Beijing sentenced Wei Jingsheng to 14 more years of \nincarceration for the crime of peacefully advocating democracy and \npolitical reform. Wei had been arrested and sentenced after he wrote \nwall posters on the Democracy Wall outside Beijing. They argued for \ntrue democracy and denounced Deng Xiaoping.\n  I have read Mr. Wei's work and his letter from prison. I can't tell \nyou how impressed and moved I was by them. As a political scientist, I \nseldom, if ever, have read such an eloquent and intelligent espousal of \ndemocracy and human rights. Making the letters all the more remarkable \nis the fact that they were written while Wei was in prison or labor \ncamps, mostly in solitary confinement. He has been jailed for all but 6 \nmonths of the last 18 years.\n  Wei Jingshen is not only China's most prominent dissident and \nprisoner of conscience, but ranks with the greatest fighters for \ndemocracy and human rights of this century. He brings to mind Martin \nLuther King, Nelson Mandela, and, of course, Alexander Solzhenitsyn. I \nwas honored to join many of my colleagues in nominating Wei for the \nNobel Peace Prize.\n  Last week, Mr. Wei's sister came to the United States to tell the \nadministration that he is dying in jail, and that this summit may be \nhis last chance of emerging from detention alive. It is urgent that the \nChinese Government release Wei and that he be given the medical care \nthat he desperately needs, but has been denied.\n  By agreeing to this state visit without any significant concessions \non human rights, like the release of Wei Jingsheng, the Clinton \nadministration squandered its strongest source of leverage with \nBeijing.\n  This is not to say that all dialog between the United States and \nChina or that working level visits are wrong. Instead, I believe that \nthe symbolism of a state level visit is inappropriate given our strong \ndisagreement with China over its human rights record. That is why I \ncosponsored a resolution with Senators Feingold and Helms to urge the \nPresident to downgrade this event from a state visit to working visit.\n  The Chinese have said they do not welcome American advice on what \nthey view as a ``purely internal affair.'' Welcome or not, President \nClinton must insist that China's leaders take specific actions on human \nrights.\n  Indeed, I believe strongly that the administration has a moral duty \nto press a range of issues with the Chinese Government that it may not \nwelcome, but that are of enormous important to the Chinese people, and \nthe United States.\n  Specifically, I call on President Clinton to demand:\n  The immediate and unconditional release of Wei Jingsheng, Wang Dan, \nand other prisoners of conscience held in jails in China and Tibet.\n  Improvement in the conditions under which political, religious, and \nlabor dissidents are detained in China and Tibet. This includes \nproviding prisoners with adequate medical care and\n\n[[Page S11253]]\n\nallowing international humanitarian agencies access to detention \nfacilities.\n  Significant progress in improving the overall human rights conditions \nin China and Tibet. The Chinese Government must take concrete steps to \nincrease freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of \nassociation, in order to comply with the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights, which it signed in 1948.\n  Some say that we cannot influence what goes on in China, that the \ncountry is too proud, too large, and that changes take too long. I \ndisagree. For years we have pressured the Chinese on human rights, and \nto let up now is tantamount to defeat for the cause of human justice. \nDissidents who have been freed and come to the United States have \nthanked advocates for keeping them alive, by keeping the pressure on, \nand focusing attention on their plight.\n  As Americans, it is our duty and in our interest to make the extra \neffort required to promote freedom and democracy in China, and to bring \nit into compliance with international standards on human rights.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/28/senate-section/article/S11252-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11253-S11257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                        1998--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of the conference report accompanying H.R. \n2107, which the clerk will now report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     2107) making appropriations for the Department of the \n     Interior and related agencies for the fiscal year ending \n     September 30, 1998, and for other purposes having met, after \n     full and free conference, have agreed to recommend and do \n     recommend to their respective Houses this report, signed by \n     all of the conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of October 22, 1997.)\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The time under the \nconference report is controlled.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. GORTON. I yield myself such time as I may use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring before the Senate \nthe conference report on H.R. 2107, the fiscal year 1998 Interior and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations Act. The conference report provides \n$13.8 billion for programs under the jurisdiction of the Interior \nsubcommittee, and incorporates a number of changes to House and Senate \nfunding levels and legislative provisions in an effort to reconcile the \ndifferences between the two bodies, and to reconcile the differences \nbetween the Congress and the administration. I firmly believe the \nresulting conference agreement is worthy of my colleagues' support.\n  While at this time I will not go into great detail about the \nconference report, I want to stress the fact that the conferees on this \nbill have gone to extraordinary lengths to try to accommodate the \nconcerns of the administration. I ask unanimous consent that a more \ndetailed discussion of the modifications that have been made in \nresponse to administration concerns appear at the end of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GORTON. There are, however, a handful of issues in the conference \nagreement that I know are of great interest to all Senators. I will \nspend a little time discussing two of these issues: Land acquisition \nand the National Endowment for the Arts.\n  The budget agreement provided the Appropriations Committees with the \noption to appropriate $700 million for ``priority land acquisitions and \nland exchanges,'' with the appropriation being in addition to the \nsubcommittee's 602(b) allocation. This reserve fund was requested by \nthe administration in budget talks, in large part because of the \nadministration's desire to finance two major land purchases that it \nnegotiated shortly before the Presidential election: The Headwaters \nForest in California and the New World Mine in Montana.\n  The administration originally had proposed to conduct these \nacquisitions administratively, exchanging oil and gas properties and \nrevenue streams in ways that stretched existing exchange authorities to \nthe limit, if not beyond. I and many others strongly objected to the \nproposed acquisitions at the time, in part because it was clear that \nthe administration was trying to evade the requirements of the Budget \nAct and bypass Congress altogether on two major expenditures. In that \nsense, I am glad that the budget agreement provided an opportunity for \nthese acquisitions to come before Congress, albeit not under ideal \nconditions.\n  The House Appropriations Committee chose not to provide the $700 \nmillion. Chairman Regula not only doubted the value of the Headwaters \nand New World Mine acquisitions to the U.S. taxpayer, but also felt \nstrongly that if $700 million were available in the context of the \nbudget agreement, that money would be better spent reducing the multi-\nbillion-dollar maintenance backlog that exists in our parks, refuges, \nand public lands. I cannot honestly say that I disagree with him on \neither point.\n  I did, however, include the $700 million in the Senate bill, largely \nbecause I feel a personal commitment to the budget agreement and the \nbroader benefits that it provides for the American taxpayer. $315 \nmillion of the funds provided in the Senate bill were for the \nHeadwaters Forest and New World Mine acquisitions. But because of the \ncomplexity of the acquisitions, the many questions that had been raised \nabout them, and their sheer magnitude, I agreed with Senator Murkowski \nthat the funds should be provided subject to enactment of subsequent \nauthorizing legislation. Some have intimated that this was an attempt \nto kill the two deals, but I can assure you that on my part it was not. \nI also have no doubt that Senator Murkowski was doing anything other \nthan his job, part of which is to authorize land purchases of this \nnature. The notion that Congress should simply accept the \nadministration's word as to the worth of these expensive and highly \ncomplex projects is not only an abandonment of congressional \nprerogatives, but of our duty.\n  Mr. President, the conference on the Interior bill was closed 3 weeks \nago but for the very difficult question of land acquisition. The \nadministration has continually insisted that the money for Headwaters \nand New World Mine must be included in any Interior bill that the \nPresident would sign, and that such money could not be subject to an \nauthorizing requirement. Senator Murkowski has continued to insist on \nan appropriate role for the authorizing committee. Congressman Young, \nCongressman Hill, Congressman Riggs, and Senator Burns desired to make \ncertain that the communities impacted by the two acquisitions were \nadequately compensated. Congressman Regula has insisted that a portion \nof the $700 million be made available to reduce maintenance backlogs on \nour public lands, rather than require all the money to be used to \nincrease the public land base, and I should not fail to mention that \nCongressman Obey, among others, was greatly displeased that the budget \nresolution dictated to the penny the amount that the Appropriations \nCommittee could provide for priority land acquisitions.\n  The negotiations among all of these parties over the past several \nweeks have been exceedingly difficult. The compromise included in the \nconference report provides $699 million for priority land acquisitions \nand land exchanges, and critical maintenance needs. Of this amount, up \nto $250 million is for Headwaters Forest and up to $65 million is for \nthe New World Mine. Authorizations for both projects are included in \nthe conference report, but the acquisitions cannot be made until 180 \ndays after enactment, providing the authorizing committees time to \nreview the acquisitions and possibly recommend changes to the \nauthorizing language. The authorizing language itself is the product of \nlengthy discussions between House and Senate authorizing committees, \nthe Appropriations Committees and the administration. I should note\n\n[[Page S11254]]\n\nthat Senator Murkowski was a reluctant participant in these \ndiscussions, and feels strongly that the authorizing legislation should \nhave gone through the normal committee process. I will also say that \nthe administration is not in complete agreement with the provisions of \nthe authorization.\n\n  The major sticking point in these discussions over the last week has \nbeen the question of whether or not a formal appraisal would be \nrequired for the Headwaters and New World Mine acquisitions. The \nadministration has insisted that appraisals are not necessary, and that \nCongress should be satisfied with an opinion of value--a term with no \nformal meaning. On the other hand, Senator Murkowski, Congressman \nRegula, and I all agree that a formal appraisal is the only way to \nsafeguard the American taxpayer. While the conferees have reluctantly \nagreed not to cap the purchase price at the appraised value, the \nconference report does require an appraisal for each acquisition.\n  In spite of the great strides that have been taken to address the \nconcerns of the administration elsewhere in the bill, I have no doubt \nthat if this bill is vetoed by the President, it will primarily be \nbecause of the appraisal requirement for these two acquisitions. I also \nhave little doubt that if the bill is vetoed, the $700 million stands a \nbetter chance of being removed from a future bill than does the \nappraisal requirement. I cannot entirely account for the \nadministration's strong resistance to the notion of a formal appraisal. \nIf either appraisal places the value of these properties below the \nprice to which the administration agreed, the administration will have \nample opportunity to dispute the appraisal. Congress does, from time to \ntime, approve acquisition above the appraised value. If either \nappraisal values one of these properties above the price to which the \nadministration has agreed, such appraisals will only support the \nadministration's case that these acquisitions represent good buys for \nthe taxpayer. In short, I think Congress has been extraordinarily fair \nin its dealings with the administration with regard to Headwaters and \nNew World Mine.\n  Turning to the National Endowment for the Arts, my colleagues will \nrecall that the House bill included zero funding for the NEA. The \nSenate bill included just over $100 million, a small increase over the \ncurrent year level. The Senate also considered a number of NEA \namendments during floor consideration, ranging from complete \ntermination of the Endowment to greatly increasing the percentage of \nNEA funds that are provided as block grants to the States. Though the \ndebate on these amendments made clear that there is significant concern \nabout NEA's current structure and practices, the votes on the \namendments also made clear that the Senate does not share what were \napparently the views of the House.\n  The conference report $98 million for NEA--a remarkable outcome given \nthe House position. In exchange for providing nearly all the funding \nincluded in the Senate bill, the House requested that the conference \nreport include a number of reforms to the NEA's structure and \nprocedures. As a result, the conference report increases the percentage \nof block grants to States, makes arts education a priority, and alters \nthe structure and membership of the National Council for the Arts to \nreflect congressional interest in the NEA's conduct and direction.\n  With regard to the conference agreement on the NEA, it is safe to say \nthat the House leadership is not pleased with the result. I think it is \nalso safe to say that if this bill is vetoed and returned to \nconference, it is almost certain that the House will demand additional \nreductions in funding for the NEA. This is not a threat from an \nopponent of the Endowment. To the contrary, I have been a strong \nsupporter of the NEA, even though I have been critical of some of the \ndecisions made by the agency over the years. My comments are rather a \nsimple recognition of current sentiment in Congress.\n  In a similar vein, I cannot say what would happen to the $700 million \nfor land acquisition should this bill be vetoed. This comes not from \nsomeone who strictly opposes providing the $700 million, but rather \nfrom someone who included the money in this bill in the first place. I \nam simply stating the fact that this conference agreement is very \ndelicately balanced, and that a decision by the administration to come \nback for one more bite at the apple--despite the great lengths we have \ngone to accommodate its concerns--will not be without peril.\n  On a less ominous note, I do want to take a brief moment to mention a \nfew other items. First, I want to note the work that Senator Jeffords \nand Senator Torricelli have done in the interests of the preservation \nof Civil War battlefields--a subject near and dear to my heart. The \nSenators offered an amendment to this bill expressing the sense of the \nSenate that Civil War battlefield preservation should be a high \npriority for Congress. I know they would like to have done more, \nparticularly with regard to earmarking a portion of the $700 million, \nbut I do want them to know that I will continue to work with them in \nthe allocation of the $700 million should this conference report be \nenacted. I also want to note some of the Civil War projects that are \nfunded elsewhere in this bill, such as the $1.7 million provided for \nrehabilitation at Vicksburg National Military Park, the $2 million \nprovided for stabilization work at Shiloh National Military Park, the \n$1 million provided for an interpretive center at Corinth battlefield, \nand the $3.5 million provided for land acquisition at Fredricksburg/\nSpotsylvania National Military Park. I am also very pleased that the \nconference report provides a more than $1 million operating increase \nfor Gettysburg National Military Park, a subject on which Senator \nSantorum has worked very diligently.\n  I also want to clarify that the funding provided to the Fish and \nWildlife Service for habitat conservation planning for the Preble's \nMeadow jumping mouse applies to four counties in Colorado. These mice \nrange over four counties in Colorado and two counties in Wyoming. \nHowever, the mice occur on private lands in Colorado and on Federal \nland in Wyoming. The habitat conservation plan only applies to the \nprivate lands in Colorado.\n  Finally, I want to make special note that this bill includes funding \nfor the National Park Service to study alternatives for the \ncommemoration and interpretation of events associated with the \nintegration of the Charleston School District in Arkansas and Central \nHigh School in Little Rock. While other Senators are familiar with the \nevents surrounding the integration of Central High School in 1957, they \nmay not be aware that the Charleston public schools were actually the \nfirst to integrate in Arkansas--by some accounts the first in the \nSouth--shortly after the Brown versus Board of Education decision in \n1954. My colleagues may also not be aware that Senator Bumpers is a \nformer member of the Charleston School Board, and that he was counsel \nto the school board during the period in which the decision was made to \nintegrate the Charleston schools. Perhaps the relatively smooth \nintegration of the Charleston schools, as compared to the bitter \nstruggle that took place at Central High School, is a most telling \ntestament to Senator Bumpers' wisdom and power of persuasion--qualities \nthat we will sorely miss after his departure from the Senate.\n  With that I will once again express my thanks to Senator Byrd for all \nhis help and guidance over the course of the year, and express my \nsincere hope that the President will sign this bill. I cannot stress \ntoo greatly the length to which we have gone to address the \nadministration's concerns, nor can I overstate the delicacy of the \nbalance that has been achieved in this conference report. Nothing good \ncan come of the President vetoing this bill.\n\n                              [Exhibit 1]\n\n             Efforts To Accommodate Administration Concerns\n\n\n                             forest service\n\n                    Forest land management planning\n\n       The Senate bill included a provision prohibiting the \n     expenditure of funds for revisions of individual forest plans \n     until new forest planning regulations have been issued. Those \n     regulations have been under review for eight years through \n     two administrations, and have been withdrawn at the last \n     minute prior to each of the last two presidential elections. \n     Such delay is intolerable. The Appropriations Committee is \n     greatly concerned that millions of dollars are being spent \n     for forest plan revisions that will be invalid or obsolete \n     upon issuance of the new regulations. The Committee is also \n     concerned that the Forest Service may be revising plans\n\n[[Page S11255]]\n\n     pursuant to a set of regulations that have been drafted, but \n     not aired in the public rulemaking process.\n       The conference language has been significantly revised to \n     accommodate Administration concerns, while making clear that \n     the current forest planning process is broken and needs \n     prompt revision. The conference language allows funds to be \n     expended for forest plan revisions under current regulations \n     where a Notice of Intent to Revise was published in the \n     Federal Register prior to October 1, 1997, or where a court \n     order directs that a revision must occur. The statement of \n     managers further clarifies that the new regulations need only \n     be released in an interim form to comply fully with this \n     provision.\n\n                     Office of the Western Director\n\n       The House bill eliminated all funding for operations of the \n     western director and special assistant to the Office of the \n     Secretary of Agriculture. The Senate bill prohibited funding \n     for this purpose absent approval through the reprogramming \n     process. Despite House and Senate concerns about the use of \n     funds for this purpose, the conference agreement allows \n     Interior bill funds to be used for the western director up to \n     the level provided in the Interior bill for fiscal year 1997.\n\n                              Log exports\n\n       This important legislation bans the export of raw logs from \n     national forest lands and from Washington State lands. It \n     further alters rules governing substitution of private logs \n     in the export market for federal timber. This legislation has \n     bipartisan support and is the result of lengthy discussion \n     among affected industries and parties in the affected states. \n     This language encourages domestic processing of timber, \n     creates more American jobs, and entirely bans the export of \n     raw logs from State of Washington timber lands.\n\n                              Forest roads\n\n       The Administration has objected to the fact that the \n     conference agreement does not provide for the termination of \n     the ``purchaser credit'' program for the construction of \n     timber roads. The issue was hotly debated in both the House \n     and Senate, but neither body voted to terminate the program. \n     As such, the conference agreement is appropriate.\n       While I firmly believe that the real issue in this debate \n     is the continued effort by fringe environmentalists to \n     eliminate the harvest of timber from National Forests, I \n     believe it would be wise for Congress and the Administration \n     to resolve this issue somewhere other than on the floors of \n     the Senate and House. I encourage the Administration to \n     negotiate with the timber industry, environmentalists, and \n     timber workers to develop reforms that will build confidence \n     in the purchaser credit program, and provide assurances to \n     taxpayers that the program is an efficient alternative to \n     Forest Service road construction, and is not an industry \n     subsidy.\n\n                           Western red cedar\n\n       The conference report contains language that protects the \n     economic stability of timber processors in the Pacific \n     Northwest by requiring the Forest Service to make Alaskan \n     Western Red Cedar available to processors in the contiguous \n     United States before it can be exported. Although the bill \n     language does not fully satisfy the Administration, it does \n     have strong bipartisan support in the Pacific Northwest where \n     timber producers have been severely harmed by reduced \n     availability of public timber, and fully complies with \n     Alaska's Tongass National Forest Land Management Plan.\n\n          Interior Columbia Basin ecosystem management project\n\n       The conference agreement includes language on the Columbia \n     Basin ecosystem planning project in response to Congressional \n     concerns about the time, cost, and lack of results associated \n     with this and previous ecosystem planning efforts. The \n     language instructs the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land \n     Management to include in the Environmental Impact Statement \n     (EIS) information on economic and social impacts at the sub-\n     basin level. The conferees are aware that this may result in \n     additional time and cost, but are willing to make this \n     investment so that the people most affected by these \n     decisions will have a better understanding of the impacts \n     when the final EIS is implemented.\n       The conference agreement also requires a report to Congress \n     on potential implementation costs and potential impacts on \n     resource and commodity production in the Interior Columbia \n     Basin. To date this project has cost taxpayers $90 million. \n     The Administration has estimated that implementation of the \n     plan could cost an additional $135 million per year. It is \n     certainly legitimate for Congress to seek more information \n     about such costs and impacts prior to finalization of the \n     plan. The language gives the Administration flexibility to \n     perform its analysis in an efficient manner.\n\n                   President's northwest forest plan\n\n       The Administration has complained about language included \n     in the Statement of Managers requiring that 757 million board \n     feet be offered for sale under the Pacific Northwest Forest \n     Plan, of which ten percent must meet the Administration's \n     definition of ``other wood.'' This language uses the \n     Administration's own figures, and is simply included to \n     provide some level of accountability to ensure that the \n     Forest Service lives up to its commitments.\n\n\n                           natural resources\n\n                 Lake Clark national park and preserve\n\n       The Senate bill included a provision extending the statute \n     of limitations of certain Alaska Native Village Corporations \n     and the area Regional Corporation to bring suit against the \n     Department of the Interior with regard to certain land claims \n     under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. This provision \n     was acceptable to the Administration. A second provision \n     added in conference would have required future litigation on \n     this issue to be considered in trial de novo, and would have \n     required that certain elements of such litigation be \n     construed to the benefit of the Native Corporations. Sen. \n     Stevens strongly believed this amendment to be appropriate \n     from the standpoint of fairness to the Native Corporations, \n     but the Administration also felt strongly that the additional \n     provisions were contrary to the agreements that the \n     Department of the Interior had reached with the Native \n     Corporations regarding land selections.\n       The conference report includes the Senate provision \n     extending the statute of limitations, as well as language \n     allowing additional evidence to be introduced in any \n     litigation that may ensue. The language included in the \n     conference report has been agreed to by the Administration.\n\n                     Rulemaking on hardrock mining\n\n       The Administration objected to the Senate Appropriations \n     Committee's provisions in section 339 which would have \n     prohibited Department of the Interior's use of funds for a \n     rulemaking to update rules on surface management of hardrock \n     mines until the Secretary of the Interior established a \n     Federal-State advisory committee that would have prepared a \n     consensus report for Congress on the relationship of State \n     and Federal surface management policies. In response, section \n     339 has been amended to permit the Interior Department to \n     develop a rulemaking on hardrock mining upon the \n     certification by the Secretary of the Committees of \n     jurisdiction in the House and Senate that the Department has \n     consulted with the governor of each state that contains \n     public lands open to location under the General Mining Laws. \n     The publication of proposed regulations shall not occur \n     before November 15, 1998 and regulations shall not be \n     finalized prior to 90 days after publication of the proposed \n     regulations.\n\n                             Grizzly bears\n\n       The conference agreement does include a limitation on funds \n     for the reintroduction of grizzly bears in the Selway-\n     Bitteroot area of Idaho and Montana. This provision was \n     adopted by unanimous voice vote during Senate committee \n     markup and was not contested on the Senate floor. At the \n     request of the Administration, however, the language has been \n     changed to make clear that the Environmental Impact Statement \n     on reintroduction can proceed to a Record of Decision. Since \n     the Administration has stated that actual reintroduction is \n     unlikely to take place in fiscal year 1998, it is unclear \n     what substantive objection remains.\n\n                           Alaska subsistence\n\n       The Administration strongly objected to a provision in the \n     House bill that would have extended a moratorium on the \n     assumption of Federal control over fisheries management in \n     Alaska pursuant to the Alaska National Interest Lands \n     Conservation Act. The conference agreement incorporates a \n     compromise between Members of the Alaska delegation, the \n     Administration, the State of Alaska and other elected \n     officials in Alaska that will facilitate resolution of the \n     subsistence issue. This provision is directly relevant to the \n     appropriations process, as the cost to the Federal government \n     of assuming management responsibilities would be substantial.\n\n            World heritage and man in the biosphere programs\n\n       The House voted to prohibit the use of funds for the World \n     Heritage and Man in the Biosphere programs, a provision to \n     which the Administration has strongly objected. The \n     conference agreement does not prohibit the use of funds for \n     the World Heritage program, which has grounding in prior \n     statute and treaty, but does prohibit the use of funds to \n     nominate sites under the Man in the Biosphere program until \n     that program is specifically authorized by Congress. \n     Authorizing legislation addressing these issues is under \n     active consideration by Congress, and it is reasonable for \n     the Appropriations Committee to prohibit the use of funds for \n     the Man in the Biosphere program until U.S. participation in \n     the program is authorized.\n\n                      Pennsylvania avenue redesign\n\n       The conference agreement prohibits the Administration from \n     expending Interior bill funds for redesign of Pennsylvania \n     Avenue between 15th and 17th Streets, N.W., without the \n     approval of the Appropriations Committees through the \n     reprogramming process. The Administration objected to the \n     original version of this provision on the grounds that it \n     might have prevented the implementation of security measures \n     to protect the White House. While such was not the intent or \n     effect of the amendment as originally proposed, the amendment \n     has been modified at the request of the White House.\n       The Treasury Department has received over $51 million in \n     direct appropriations since 1996 specifically for security \n     around the White House. The provision in the Interior bill is \n     directed at funds that would be spent by the Park Service, \n     primarily for beautification of the area. The Administration \n     has chosen an option for the redesign that would cost over \n     $50 million. The details of this plan\n\n[[Page S11256]]\n\n     were only recently released, and have received very little \n     scrutiny. The Appropriations Committee simply wants the \n     opportunity to discuss with the Administration its proposal \n     before a significant amount of Park Service funds is \n     committed to a particular plan of action.\n\n\n                             arts programs\n\n                        Smithsonian Institution\n\n       The Administration objection to the fact that the House \n     bill provided no funds for construction of the National \n     Museum of the American Indian Mall Museum. The conference \n     agreement provides $29 million for the first half of \n     construction costs as proposed in the Senate-passed bill and \n     in the Administration's budget request.\n\n            Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars\n\n       The conferees agreed to fund the Woodrow Wilson \n     International Center for Scholars (WWIC) at the budget \n     request level of $5.8 million, as proposed in the Senate \n     bill. Due to concern about administration of the Center's \n     programs, the House recommended a $1 million appropriation \n     for FY 1998--an amount that would have terminated the \n     Center's operations.\n\n                    National Endowment for the Arts\n\n       The House bill included no funding for the National \n     Endowment for the Arts. The Senate bill included $100 \n     million, a decrease below the request but a slight increase \n     over FY 1997. There was considerable debate about the NEA \n     during conference, but the final result was a compromise that \n     substantially protects the Endowment's current funding level. \n     Certain reforms to the NEA's structure and grant-making \n     processes were adopted, but provisions to expand radically \n     the black grant program or impose an administrative budget \n     cap--two items of particular concern to the Administration--\n     were not among the reforms adopted. The conferees also \n     rejected an effort to reduce the appropriation by $10 million \n     below the Senate level.\n\n\n                     programs for native americans\n\n                      Tribal priority allocations\n\n       The conference agreement provides funding for BIA Tribal \n     Priority Allocations (TPA) at the Administration's requested \n     level, the level included in the Budget Agreement. Within \n     that amount, the conference agreement requires that all \n     federally-recognized tribes be provided at least the minimum \n     level of TPA recommended by the BIA, a goal supported by the \n     BIA and Interior Department but missing from the President's \n     request.\n       The TPA language included in section 118 of the conference \n     report represents a serious attempt to respond to the \n     Administration's concerns about the original Senate language, \n     while still addressing the fact that discretionary \n     appropriations are limited, and that the TPA pro rata \n     allocation is inequitable and unresponsive to the disparate \n     needs of the tribes. Currently, 309 of 526 Federally-\n     recognized tribes do not receive the minimum recommended \n     level of TPA. The Administration has not requested measures \n     to rectify the inequitable distribution of TPA among the \n     tribes. The Senate proposed a new distribution method based \n     on a number of factors to measure the relative means of \n     tribes. Despite universal agreement that the current \n     distribution method of TPA is archaic and has resulted in \n     great financial disparity among the tribes, the \n     Administration opposed the Senate's proposal.\n       The Conference report provides full funding for TPA at the \n     requested level to be distributed as follows: All pro rata \n     TPA programs will be funded at the fiscal year 1997 level \n     adjusted for all fixed costs and internal funding transfers; \n     all formula-funded TPA programs will be funded at the \n     requested level; all Federally-recognized tribes will receive \n     at least at the minimum level of $160,000 in TPA funds as \n     recommended by the BIA; and any remaining funds will be \n     distributed based on recommendations of a task force, which \n     shall include tribal leaders, to be established by the \n     Secretary of the Interior.\n\n                      Taxation of tribal revenues\n\n       Contrary to Administration complaints that the Congress \n     would add such a provision to the bill, the conference report \n     contains no provision that would prohibit the Secretary of \n     the Interior from taking land into trust for any tribe that \n     had not entered into a binding agreement with State and local \n     governments regarding the tribe's collection and payment of \n     State and local sales and excise taxes on retail purchases \n     made on the land by non-tribal members.\n\n                           Sovereign immunity\n\n       The Senate bill originally contained a provision that would \n     waive the sovereign immunity of Indian tribes accepting \n     certain Federal funds. The Administration strongly objected \n     to this provision, which was removed during Senate floor \n     consideration in response to commitments from the Chairman of \n     the Senate Indian Affairs Committee to conduct hearings on \n     the issue and to mark up a bill from the Committee during the \n     next session of Congress.\n\n                             Indian gaming\n\n       The Conference Report contains the Senate-passed provisions \n     at section 129 concerning approval of Tribal-State compacts \n     for Indian gaming. The Administration opposed this language \n     in a September 30, 1997 letter to Congress. The \n     Administration is reminded, however, that the amendment was \n     modified by its sponsors in response to concerns that the \n     original version would have resulted in Federal law \n     preempting State law. The Conferees are concerned that the \n     States affected by Indian gaming within their borders are \n     kept out of the decision-making process with regard to Indian \n     gaming. Section 129 prohibits the Secretary of the Interior \n     from unilaterally approving any initial Tribal-State compacts \n     for class III gaming entered into on or after the date of \n     enactment of the Interior Appropriations Act. Section 129 \n     does not affect Secretarial review or approval of a renewal \n     or revision of, or amendment to, existing tribal-State \n     compacts.\n       The Conferees modified section 131 as passed by the Senate, \n     which the Administration opposed. As passed by the Senate, \n     section 131 would have prevented the National Indian Gaming \n     Commission (NIGC) from taking action to change its current \n     regulations to define certain types of new electronic \n     gambling. As modified, the provision prohibits the NIGC from \n     issuing draft or final rules, but clarifies that the \n     Commission may gather information during fiscal year 1998 \n     relating to the Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on \n     such regulations it recently published. Given the time \n     required to proceed with information-gathering relative to \n     the Advanced Notice, the year prohibition will not be an \n     undue interference with the Commission in exercising its \n     regulatory and oversight duties on tribal gaming activities.\n       The National Governors Association supports both section \n     129 and section 131.\n\n\n                          department of energy\n\n                          Energy conservation\n\n       The conference agreement provides $612 million for Energy \n     Conservation programs, an amount which is roughly a split \n     between the comparable levels provided by the House and \n     Senate. While the amount provided by the conference agreement \n     is below the budget request, it is $42 million above the FY \n     1997 level--a substantial increase.\n\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Gorton today in bringing \nthe conference report on the fiscal year 1998 Interior appropriations \nbill before the Senate. The Senate completed its action on this bill in \nSeptember. The formal conference was completed on September 30, and \ndiscussion and negotiation regarding a limited number of outstanding \nitems was finally completed just a few days ago. The conference report \nwas filed on October 22, and was approved by the House last Friday by a \nvote of 233-171. Inasmuch as we are now several weeks into the fiscal \nyear, I hope that the Senate will be able to complete its consideration \nof this appropriations measure expeditiously, so that the bill can be \npresented to the President and the agencies can begin implementation of \nthe programs funded for fiscal year 1998 once this bill is enacted.\n  The agreements before the Senate today total $13.8 billion in budget \nauthority, and $13.7 billion in outlays, as scored by the Congressional \nBudget Office. This conference agreement substantially fulfills the \ncommitments for Interior bill programs included in the bipartisan \nbudget agreement of which I had no part and which personally I don't \nrecognize, and incorporated into the budget resolution earlier this \nyear.\n  Mr. President, as with nearly every conference, reaching agreement on \nthis conference report required difficult choices and a search for \nbalance between competing priorities of the House, the Senate, and the \nadministration. This bill provides important resources to address \nimportant needs for our public lands and natural resources, as well as \nfor Indian programs, energy research and development, and our core \ncultural programs. The major legislative provisions of concern have \nbeen modified to address some of the concerns of the administration.\n  Mr. President, Senator Gorton has done an excellent job of \nsummarizing the many factors at work in reaching the agreements \ncontained in the conference report now before the Senate. The \nnegotiations over the special $700 million land acquisition account \nwere protracted, with each side giving some in order to reach a final \nagreement. We do not yet know whether the President will approve or \nveto this legislation. As Senator Gorton has suggested, many changes \nwere made to this bill to reflect the concerns of the administration, \nwhile protecting Congress' role--while protecting Congress' role in \ndetermining the expenditure of funds and proper oversight \nresponsibilities. Just as no Member of Congress got everything he or \nshe might have wanted\n\n[[Page S11257]]\n\nfrom this appropriations measure, neither did the administration. But \nthe overall product is a good one, and I hope it will be enacted. I do \nnot believe that closure on further issues of concern will be easier if \nthe bill is vetoed.\n  Among the highlights of this conference report are these:\n  Funding for the National Park Service remains a priority. The \nrecommendation includes an operational increase of $79 million over the \nfiscal year 1997 level. Other significant park increases are provided \nfor construction and land acquisition.\n  A significant initiative to focus attention on the operational \nrequirements and habitat restoration and maintenance backlogs of our \nnational wildlife refuges is supported, with increased funding of $40.8 \nmillion above fiscal year 1997.\n  As to our Nation's energy research and development programs, the \ninvestment in those programs is continued. Fossil energy research and \ndevelopment is funded at $362.4 million, which is $2.3 million below \nthe fiscal year 1997 enacted level. Increases above the budget request \nare provided to sustain technology development programs intended to \nproduce environmental benefits while improving energy efficiency.\n  On another matter, the conference agreement fully funds the \nPresident's request for tribal priority allocations at $757.4 million, \nan increase of $76.5 million over fiscal year 1997 levels.\n  As to the National Endowment for the Arts, the conference agreement \nincludes $98 million to continue the National Endowment for the Arts. A \npackage of reforms is included in the bill to address concerns over the \nuse of Federal funds in support of the arts. These reforms include an \nincrease on the amount of funds allocated directly to the States; a cap \non the amount of funds that can be awarded to each State from the \ncompetitive grants pool; changes in the structure and composition of \nthe National Council on the Arts; prohibitions regarding grants to \nindividuals; and an emphasis on arts education.\n  With reference to land acquisition, this bill provides a special land \nacquisition account as recommended in the budget resolution. The \naccount is funded at a level of $699 million, which includes $315 \nmillion for the Headwaters Forest, CA, and New World Mine, MT; $22 \nmillion in special payments for affected local areas in California and \nMontana; and the balance is available for priority land acquisitions, \nexchanges, and maintenance to be identified by the Department of the \nInterior and the Forest Service, and for which the committees on \nappropriations will have final approval. The conference agreement \nincludes legislative language establishing initial parameters for the \ncompletion of the two large exchanges.\n  Mr. President, it is my privilege and great pleasure to serve as the \nranking member at the side of our very able chairman, the senior \nSenator from Washington, Mr. Gorton. We have worked closely, as we \nalways have, on the product that we present to the Senate today. In his \nstewardship of this bill as chairman of the committee, Senator Gorton \nhas been very fair, he has been bipartisan in his handling of the many \nprograms and issues which were negotiated in the conference. I commend \nthis conference report to the Senate and urge Senators to support its \napproval.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. \nI ask unanimous consent that the time be charged against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, for how long does the distinguished Senator \nwish to speak? I have no objection. I just think we should know how \nlong he expects to speak.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask for 20 minutes to speak.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/28/senate-section/article/S11253-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11257-S11258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION IN CHINA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I also rise today, as did the Senator \nfrom Minnesota, to discuss the visit of the President of the People's \nRepublic of China, Mr. Jiang Zemin, who arrives in Washington tonight \nfor a state visit.\n  That Mr. Jiang and President Clinton will meet is not in itself \nextraordinary. The promotion of dialog between the United States and \nChina can be a constructive use of our own diplomatic energies. Indeed, \nPresident Clinton has already met Mr. Jiang several times at various \ninternational fora.\n  What strikes me is the kind of visit that is about to take place. It \nis a state visit that involves champagne toasts and 21-gun salutes--all \nthe trappings of honor and prestige. While I do not oppose high-level \ncontact, I feel strongly that the pomp and ceremony of a state visit is \ninappropriate at a time when the human rights situation in China and in \nTibet remains such a serious obstacle to good relations.\n  Simply put, it is my view that an official state visit is premature, \nabsent a stronger commitment from China to improve human rights. I fear \nthat this state visit will actually boost the legitimacy of a regime \nthat brutalizes its own people and jails anyone who dares to complain.\n  In other words, Mr. President, while dialog is important, you don't \nneed champagne toasts and red carpets to have a dialog.\n  Is the memory of the Tiananmen Square massacre so distant that we are \nwilling to clink glasses with China's leaders as though nothing \nhappened in Tiananmen Square? For me, the answer is no. When Jiang is \ngiven a 21-gun salute tomorrow, the South Lawn will sound much like the \nstreets of Beijing did on the night of June 4, 1989.\n  By agreeing to this state visit without receiving any kind of \nconcession in the area of human rights, the administration may be \nsquandering perhaps its strongest source of leverage with Beijing. \nNevertheless, if the administration insists on hosting Jiang Zemin \nright now, the least that can be done is to accord discussion of human \nrights the same priority as the myriad other issues that confront our \nbilateral relations with China. Unfortunately, I don't think that is \ngoing to be the case.\n  As we all know, there are many areas of disagreement between the \nUnited States and China, aside from human rights. The United States' \ntrade deficit with China will likely reach $50 billion this year. China \nhas a long and well-known record of assisting the nuclear programs of \nIran and Pakistan and, as always, the sensitive issue of Taiwan remains \na trouble spot.\n  Arguably, there are some positive signs. China has agreed to make \nsignificant cuts in tariffs as a part of its bid to join the World \nTrade Organization, and Beijing has promised to tighten controls on \nnuclear exports. It is widely reported that an agreement to restart \nUnited States-China cooperation on nuclear power will be the \ncenterpiece of the summit.\n  Mr. President, on human rights there are few, if any, positive signs. \nDespite China's announcement on Saturday that it will sign the United \nNations' Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, I see no \nevidence of real human rights improvement on the ground. The fact that \nhuman rights conditions in China are growing worse, not better, \nindicates that human rights needs to be given top priority.\n  Three years after the President's decision to delink most-favored-\nnation status from human rights, a decision that I have always said was \na mistake, we have seen the reimprisonment of dissidents and increased \nrepression in Tibet. The State Department human rights report makes \nthis very clear. According to the report covering the calendar year \n1996:\n\n       The Government continued to commit widespread and well-\n     documented human rights abuses, in violation of \n     internationally accepted norms, stemming from the \n     authorities' intolerance of dissent, fear of unrest,\n\n[[Page S11258]]\n\n     and the absence or inadequacy of laws protecting basic \n     freedoms . . . Abuses included torture, and mistreatment of \n     prisoners, forced confessions, and arbitrary and lengthy \n     incommunicado detention. Prison conditions remained harsh. \n     The Government continued severe restrictions on freedom of \n     speech, the press, assembly, association, religion, privacy \n     and workers rights.\n\n  Just one year ago, we were witness to yet another example of these \npolicies when Wang Dan, one of the leaders of the 1989 pro-democracy \ndemonstrations in Tiananmen Square, was sentenced to 11 years in \nprison. Also last December, a Beijing court sentenced activist Li Hai \nfor collecting infomation on those jailed after the 1989 Tiananmen \nmassacre.\n  The situation is just as bad in Tibet.\n  Last year, China arrested Ngawang Choepel, a Tibetan musicologist and \nFulbright scholar, and sentenced him to 18 years in prison on trumped-\nup spy charges. China has also intensified its campaign to smear the \nDalai Lama, the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people and a Nobel \nlaureate. Tibetans are not even free to display a photo of the Dalai \nLama, much less show reverence for him. There have been numerous \nreports of Tibetan monks and nuns suffering torture at the hands of \nChinese authorities. The State Department human rights report cites \nthree recent cases of Tibetan monks who died while in jail.\n  Mr. President, despite signing two formal agreements with the United \nStates on prison labor, Chinese prison-labor products continue to \nappear on our shores. Tong Yi, who worked as an assistant to Chinese \ndissident Wei Jingsheng, knows the prison labor system first hand. \nReleased just last year after serving a 2\\1/2\\-year sentence of re-\neducation through labor--a sentence she received, by the way, without \nthe benefit of any kind of trial--Ms. Tong says she was forced to work \nendless hours making products for export.\n  In the rush to reach agreements with China on WTO and proliferation, \nthe United States cannot shove human rights aside. While the United \nStates can and does talk tough on issues such as trade and intellectual \nproperty protection, we must do the same when the conversation turns to \nTiananmen and Tibet.\n  In the run-up to the summit, Mr. Jiang has given several interviews \nduring which he made some disturbing comments on human rights.\n  When Time magazine asked Jiang Zemin about the plight of political \ndissidents Wang Dan and Wei Jingsheng, Jiang responded that Wang and \nWei are criminals, not dissidents. Indeed, it is a crime in China to \npublicly and peacefully criticize the Government as Mr. Wang and Mr. \nWei have done.\n  Mr. Jiang is willing to dismiss questions about human rights because \nhe likely thinks U.S. concerns extend to only a few high-profile \ndissidents. But, in fact, Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan are merely symbols \nof the hundreds, if not thousands, of people in the People's Republic \nof China who are thrown into prison cells for demanding democracy, \norganizing prayer meetings, or for simply displaying loyalty to the \nDalai Lama. These people might not be as famous and Mr. Wang and Mr. \nWei, but they show the same type of courage, and they are every bit as \nimportant.\n  Mr. President, there are three key messages on human rights that \nJiang Zemin must hear loud and clear while he is in Washington.\n  First, Jiang Zemin must realize that people who care about conditions \nin China seek more than the release of a token dissident or two. China \nlikes to play a game where people like Wei Jingsheng are used as \nbargaining chips in the PRC's effort to curry favor with the \ninternational community at key moments. We saw this in 1993, when China \ntried to win a bid to host the year 2000 Olympic Games. Just a week \nbefore the International Olympic Committee was to vote on the matter, \nChina released Wei Jingsheng. As we all know, Beijing lost the bid and, \na few months later, Wei Jingsheng was back in prison, on charges of \nsubversion.\n  We saw this again in 1995 when China suddenly decided to release \nChinese-American human rights activist Harry Wu shortly before the \nFirst Lady was to arrive to address the U.N. women's conference.\n  But, the United States should not get caught in this cynical game.\n  For there to be true friendship between the United States and China, \nChina must implement across-the-board and institutional changes such as \nstrengthening the rule of law and allowing citizens to question \ngovernment policy without fear. Jiang Zemin and other Chinese leaders \nmust realize that United States-China relations will never reach their \nfull potential so long as hundreds, if not thousands, of dissidents \nlanguish behind bars; so long as Tibetan Buddhists are subject to \narrest and torture; and so long as citizens are not free to select \ntheir rulers.\n  Second, the United States must make clear to Jiang Zemin that the \nUnited States will not allow China to redefine the concept of ``human \nrights'' in a way that makes the term meaningless.\n  China's leaders have stated numerous times that the Peoples Republic \nof China is committed to upholding the 1948 Universal Declaration of \nHuman Rights. This document affirms the right of every human being to \nenjoy freedom of expression, freedom of religion, and freedom of \npeaceful assembly. There is no special exception for China or any other \ncountry, nor should there be.\n  Furthermore, article 35 of China's own Constitution states that \n``Citizens of the People's Republic of China enjoy freedom of speech, \nof the press, of assembly, of association, of procession, and of \ndemonstration.''\n  China's late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping was found of saying \n``seek truth from facts.'' Well, the fact is that China denies its \ncitizens the very rights that the Government has vowed to protect.\n  I would like to ask Mr. Jiang if his government ever intends to grant \nits citizens the rights that, according to his country's own \nConstitution, Chinese citizens should already enjoy. Or will China's \narticle 35 remain a meaningless provision, subject to endless caveats \nabout the need for state security, social stability, and the rights of \nthe collective? Will China continue to say it upholds the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights, even though it systematically violates so \nmany of the declaration's principles?\n  If the United States can demand that China fulfill its obligations \nunder the international arms control regime, then the United States \nshould be able to demand just as strongly that Beijing keep its \nobligations under international human rights agreements.\n  Third, Jiang Zemin should know that those of us--in the United States \nand around the world--who demand improvements in human rights are not \ntrying to impose American or Western values on China, nor are we \ndemanding that China be perfect according to some kind of American \nideal. That would not be appropriate.\n  China does often point to many flaws in American society: The high \ncrime rate and the lingering problems of poverty and drugs. China's \nofficial media often refers to the United States political system as a \n``money bags democracy.'' Indeed, proponents of campaign finance \nreform, like myself, find some validity in that Chinese assessment.\n  But what Chinese leaders do not seem to understand is that being open \nabout your problems is a sign of strength, not weakness. China lacks \neven the ability to acknowledge its severe human rights problem. Those \nof us that wish to promote human rights improvements want to encourage \nChina to establish the tools--a free press, open debate, and respect \nfor political and religious minorities--that will ultimately make China \na stronger society and nation.\n  Mr. President, protecting human rights, respecting free speech, and \ntolerating dissent will bestow more legitimacy on China than any summit \nor White House photo-op could ever do.\n  This is what Jiang Zemin needs to hear.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/28/senate-section/article/S11257-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11258-S11275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                        1998--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the conference report.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, may I inquire whether or not there is a \ntime allocation under the standing orders of the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has been allocated 15 minutes.\n\n[[Page S11259]]\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, as chairman of the committee with jurisdiction over \nmany of the agencies funded by this appropriations bill, the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, I rise to express several concerns about \nthe Interior appropriations conference report that is before us today.\n  Included in the conference report are numerous provisions that are \nimportant to my State of Alaska; none more critical than language \nextending a moratorium preventing a Federal takeover of the management \nof Alaska's fisheries until December 1, 1998.\n  Mr. President, last year, the Alaska congressional delegation was \nsuccessful in temporarily preventing the Federal Government from taking \nover the management of our fisheries. That moratorium is about to \nexpire.\n  If this conference report is not adopted, the Federal takeover is \ninevitable, forcing the citizens of my State of Alaska to live with \nfisheries management not seen since territorial days. This is what \nstatehood was all about, Mr. President, giving the people of Alaska the \nauthority to manage our fish and game. We have just about come full \ncircle.\n  I cannot in good conscience turn the clock back on all of the \nadvances that we have made in 38 years since statehood. It is for that \nreason primarily that I am inclined to vote for this conference report.\n  However, Mr. President, I want to express my objection to several \nareas, specifically in the process that has led to the inclusion of \namendments to the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, \nANILCA, as a part of the extension of the moratorium, as a \nconsideration for the moratorium,\n  Mr. President, several months ago the Secretary of the Interior, Mr. \nBruce Babbitt, informed the Alaska delegation that he would recommend a \nPresidential veto of another moratorium extending the prohibition of \nthe Department of the Interior to take over the management of fish and \ngame.\n  The Secretary has now withdrawn the veto threat, but only under the \ncondition that a provision which effectively amends ANILCA title VIII \nbe included in this conference report. The provision also requires that \nthe Alaska Legislature act and the people of Alaska approve the changes \nin a referendum before the amendments to ANILCA are effective. These \namendments were worked out by Alaska's Governor, the Secretary of the \nInterior, and the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. I was not a \nparty to these negotiations, and I believe that there were other \noptions that should have been explored.\n  Nevertheless, Mr. President, rather than a congressional moratorium, \nmy hope specifically would have been for the Secretary of the Interior \nand the Governor to have worked together so that the Secretary could \nhave applied to the court for an extension of time to avoid a Federal \ntakeover, based specifically on progress that was being made. And, \nindeed, Mr. President, there was a good deal of progress.\n  A task force was established by the Governor. That task force met \nseveral times and made its final recommendations. The Alaska Federation \nof Natives held a number of meetings and came up with its seven-point \nproposals. The State house resources committee held statewide hearings. \nAnd the State senate held hearings in September. So there was a good \ndeal of evidence that progress was being made.\n  Perhaps this would have led to a special session and a resolve by the \nlegislature, along with the input from the AFN, to give all Alaskans an \nopportunity to vote on the issue next year.\n  Unfortunately, there was no input by the legislature, the elected \nrepresentatives of the people. My fear is now that some in our State, \nsome Alaskans, will have the unreasonable expectation that future \nmoratoriums can simply be obtained by the delegation--we have done it \nbefore--and the State legislature would therefore have an excuse not to \nfinally resolve the issue.\n  The legislature will have a chance to receive input and provide \nrecommendations on the proposed amendments to title VIII of ANILCA.\n  I tell the people of Alaska that it will be highly unlikely that we \nare going to see another moratorium legislated by Congress. The \nextension of the moratorium will provide the State legislature with an \nadditional 14 months to work toward a resolve on the subsistence issue. \nAs I indicated, the legislature will have the chance to receive input \nand provide recommendations to the proposed amendments of title XIII of \nANILCA.\n  Mr. President, as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, my intention, after the State legislature acts, is to \nconduct hearings here in Washington to cover the context of the \nlanguage in the Interior appropriations bill and to receive input from \nthe legislature and the State of Alaska, native groups, sportsmen's \ngroups, and other interested parties on any further amendments to \nANILCA title VIII that might be appropriate.\n  Mr. President, avoiding a Federal takeover of fish and game \nmanagement is simply critical in my State. When Alaska became a State, \nAlaskans were united in our desire to take over the management of our \nfish and game. Many Alaskans still have vivid memories of the disaster \nof Federal control. Alaska salmon runs plummeted to 25 million fish \nwith Federal bureaucrats in control in Washington, DC. Under State \nmanagement, our runs are increasing and have approached 200 million in \nthe last few years.\n  Alaskans must act now by participating in a process and agreeing to a \nsolution to prevent a Federal takeover of our fisheries and gaining \nback control of our game management. The State, not the elusive Federal \nbureaucrats with no accountability to Alaskans, should manage our fish \nand game. They are responsible to the people of Alaska. And they are \ncertainly accountable in Alaska as to managing the fish and game.\n  A subsistence solution I think must follow four basic principles that \nmust be laid down as objectives.\n  First must be the protection of our resource. It must return and keep \nmanagement of fish and game to the State of Alaska.\n  It must provide all the subsistence needs of rural Alaskans, and it \nmust be fair to all Alaskans.\n  This issue must be resolved while both Congressman Don Young and I \nretain our respective chairmanships of the committees of jurisdiction \non this issue. Some have suggested we simply repeal the Federal \nsubsistence law. But the Clinton administration, of course, would \noppose this and would undoubtedly veto the bill. Even if we did, the \nSecretary of the Interior, Secretary Babbitt, would still have the \nauthority to enforce a Native-only subsistence priority based on his \ntrust responsibilities to Alaska Natives established by Indian law.\n  As I indicated earlier, we have made more progress in the past year \non resolving the subsistence issue than any time in the past. We have \ninvolved the Governor, the Natives, and the legislature in moving \nforward on this issue. These constructive actions are why I support the \nmoratorium contained in the conference report but object to the process \nor lack thereof by which the ANILCA amendments were included without \nthe input of the representatives of Alaska; namely, the State \nlegislature.\n  In the meantime, Mr. President, let me commend and support the \nongoing process in the State to come to a general consensus and put a \nsolution on the ballot in November 1998 so that Alaskans have the \nability to vote on a final solution. This is an Alaskan issue, Mr. \nPresident. It mandates an Alaskan solution. As chairman of the Senate \nEnergy Committee, I stand ready to work on amendments to Federal \nsubsistence in concert with Alaska.\n\n\n                         Ketchikan Health Care\n\n  Another item of note, Mr. President. I want to express my \ndisappointment that the conference report does not contain a provision \nthat prevents the Indian Health Service, IHS, from entering into two \ncontracts for Native health care clinics in the community of Ketchikan, \nAK. This was a provision that passed the Senate and would have \nprevented the Indian Health Service from entering into those two \ncontracts. Mr. President, this is simply a waste of taxpayers' money.\n  Unfortunately, the Indian Health Service declined to exercise their \nadministrative discretion. Although I personally made contacts with the \nadministrator, they refused to exercise their administrative discretion \nto contract with only a single facility. Had\n\n[[Page S11260]]\n\nIHS done so, it would have avoided paying $500,000 a year in additional \nand unnecessary administrative costs that will be borne by the America \ntaxpayer at the expense of health care, in my opinion, for Alaska \nNatives. As we increase our administrative funds that leaves less for \ncare.\n  Instead, Mr. President, the Indian Health Service ducked the cost \nissue, hiding behind the policy of the Indian Self-Determination Act. \nThey are choosing to satisfy two Native entities rather than looking at \nways to deliver the most efficient and the best health care for the \nmoney. It seems incredible that at a time when we have been slowing \nspending and other Federal health programs, Indian Health Service would \nchoose to waste money on administrative overhead instead of making the \ntough health care decisions as to who is best qualified.\n  The final conference report allows for the possibility of two Native \nhealth clinics to be operated within a couple of miles of each other in \nKetchikan, AK. I still fail to see the logic of the decision by IHS to \nauthorize both clinics in a small community, and I intend to pursue \nthis matter again with IHS.\n\n\n                      Strategic Petroleum Reserve\n\n  Further, Mr. President, another area I want to address, is my dismay \nat the recent practice of using the strategic petroleum reserve, or \nSPR, as a piggy bank. The trend continues in this year's Interior \nappropriations bill.\n  Last year we sold oil in the SPR that cost $33 a barrel for $18 to \n$20 a barrel. As a result, we lost the taxpayers almost half a billion \ndollars. But it doesn't look like we have learned our lesson.\n\n  The fiscal year 1998 Interior appropriations bill sells another 207.5 \nmillion dollars worth of SPR oil, a sale that will cost the taxpayers \nan additional $170 million.\n  Buying high and selling low never makes sense. I wonder if we are \nlike the man in the old joke who is buying high and selling low, \nclaiming ``he would make it up on volume.'' This is a complete waste of \ntaxpayers' money, and it must be stopped.\n\n\n                priority land acquisitions and exchanges\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, as chairman of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, I have taken an active interest in how the \nadditional $700 million from the Land and Water Conservation Fund is \nappropriated for priority lands acquisitions and exchanges. I have \nstrongly advocated appropriating moneys from the fund in a manner \nconsistent with the terms and the spirit of the Land and Water \nConservation Act.\n  I want to express my disappointment with how this money was \nultimately appropriated. However, I do want to commend my good friend, \nSenator Gorton, and his extraordinary staff for a job well done and to \nthank him for the efforts that he took to accommodate my concerns with \nthese provisions.\n  Title V of H.R. 2107, as it emerged from conference, differs \ndramatically from the bill which was passed by both the Senate \nAppropriations Committee and the full Senate last month.\n  First, the $100 million that the Senate appropriated for the \nstateside Land and Water Conservation Fund matching grant program has \nbeen eliminated. This is unfortunate. This program provides vitally \nneeded matching funds for State and local parks and recreation \nprojects. Unfortunately, for the fourth year in a row, no moneys are \nprovided for this program, which is universally supported by mayors, \nGovernors, environmental groups, and many others who care about park \nand recreation issues.\n  Second, title V appropriates Land and Water Conservation moneys to \nthe Federal land management agencies for uses not otherwise authorized \nby the Land and Water Conservation Act: namely, critical maintenance \nactivities and mitigation payments associated with the Headwaters \nForest and New World Mine acquisitions. While I do not disagree that \nthe money needs to be appropriated for these purposes, I believe this \nsets a very dangerous precedent for use of the Land and Water \nConservation moneys.\n  Finally, and most significantly, I object to the decision to \nauthorize the Headwaters Forest of New World Mine acquisitions on the \nappropriations bill. It doesn't belong there. It belongs in the \nauthorizing committee. This decision is clearly within the purview of \nthe Energy and Natural Resources Committee and not the Appropriations \nCommittee. If appropriators are allowed to circumvent the authorizers \nas blatantly as they have tried, then what role are authorizers, all \nauthorizing committees, to play in future Congresses?\n  Nonetheless, I again commend Senator Gorton and Senator Stevens, \nalong with the majority leader, for ensuring that the members in my \ncommittee are provided a meaningful opportunity to review the \nauthorizations contained within the bill. I intend to hold them to \ntheir commitment to provide the supplemental appropriations bill as a \nvehicle for any amendments to this authorization reported by the \ncommittee.\n  I also appreciate the fact that the authorization requires the \nadministration to perform appraisals on these acquisitions and provides \ntime for Congress to review the appraisals before the funds \nappropriated for the acquisitions are released. The American taxpayers \nare entitled to know whether or not the Headwaters Forest and the New \nWorld Mine purchases are the great deals that the Clinton \nadministration claims.\n  Mr. President, this is a flawed conference report. But I cannot turn \nmy back on the people of Alaska and vote against it because there are \nmany provisions that benefit the people of my State. Most importantly, \nthis conference report prevents a Federal takeover of fish and game \nmanagement and I will therefore vote for the conference report.\n\n\n                     alaska-specific appropriations\n\n  Mr. President, although the extension of the moratorium contained in \nthis conference agreement is critical to every Alaskan, there are \nseveral other provisions that should not go unnoticed.\n  NPR-A: The conference agreement contains language amending the lease \nterms in the National Petroleum Reserve which allows leases to be \noffered for an initial period of not less than 10 years. In addition, \nthis provision allows for an extension of the lease for as long as the \noil and gas is produced in paying quantities.\n  Additionally, the change will allow lease holders to unitize, \nproviding for more efficient development of the NPR-A area if, in fact \nlease sales are offered next years.\n  PILT: The funding level for the payment in lieu of tax [PILT] program \nhas been raised from $113.5 to $120 million. This is especially \nimportant for Alaska communities especially since Congress last year \nprovided that communities within unorganized boroughs are eligible for \nPILT payments.\n  RS2477: The conference report also makes clear that previous \nappropriations language preventing final rules or regulations from \ntaking effect regarding the validity or recognition of RS2477 claims \nis, in fact permanent law.\n  Glacier Bay: The conference report also ensures safer access to \nGlacier Bay National Park for those people who use the ferry from \nJuneau, including the handicapped and elderly.\n  Stampede Mine: Mr. President, I must commend the appropriators for \nalso including a provision that allows, after 10 years, that the \nUniversity of Alaska will finally get just compensation for mining \nproperties that the Park Service destroyed.\n  Spruce bark beetle: Also included in this conference agreement is an \nappropriation of $500,000 to the U.S. Forest Service to work with the \nstakeholders in Alaska to develop an action plan to manage the spruce \nbark beetle infestation in south-central Alaska, and to rehabilitate \nthe infested areas.\n  Appendix C: The conferees have also provided a 1-year extension for \nfive small villages in the Lake Clark area of Alaska to file a lawsuit \nregarding lands these villages were promised more than 20 years ago \nunder ANSCA.\n  Kantishna: Language is also included in the conference report that \nprovides both claim owners in the park and the National Park Service \nwith an expedited mechanism to resolve these claims. Consenting owners \nwill be allowed to obtain compensation 90 days after enactment of this \nact. However, taking matters will be left to the parties or the court \nsystem to resolve.\n  Red cedar: I am also pleased that in working with Senator Patty \nMurray, we were able to foster greater utilization of Alaska red cedar \nand achieve\n\n[[Page S11261]]\n\ngreater efficiency in Tongass timbers sales in general.\n  Forest Service: This conference report also provides direction to the \nU.S. Forest Service that it not waste any money on expensive forest \nplanning revisions until new regulations concerning forest planning are \nissued.\n\n\n           Title V--Priority Land Acquisitions and Exchanges\n\n  As chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I rise \ntoday to speak about title V of H.R. 2107. Throughout the \nappropriations process, I have taken an active interest in the \nadditional $700 appropriation from the Land and Water Conservation Fund \n[LWCF] for priority land acquisitions and exchanges. While I am \ndisappointed with how this money was ultimately appropriated, I want to \ncommend Senator Gorton and his staff for a job well done and thank him \nfor the efforts he took to accommodate my concerns with these \nprovisions.\n  Since last spring, I have strongly advocated appropriating moneys \nfrom the LWCF in a manner consistent with the terms, and spirit, of the \nLWCF Act. The LWCF provides funds for two purposes: the purchase of \nFederal land by the land management agencies--the Federal-side LWCF \nProgram--and creates a unique partnership among Federal, State, and \nlocal governments for the acquisition of public outdoor recreation \nareas and facilities--the state-side LWCF matching grant program.\n  Title V of H.R. 2107, as passed by both the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee and the full Senate, appropriated LWCF moneys for both of \nthese programs. In that bill, $100 million was appropriated to the \nstateside LWCF matching grant program, with the remainder appropriated \nfor Federal land acquisitions and land exchanges, including $250 \nmillion for the purchase of the Headwaters Forest in northern \nCalifornia and $65 million for the purchase of the New World Mine \nproperty outside of Yellowstone National Park. Both of these \nacquisitions, which were requested by the Clinton administration, were \nmade contingent on the enactment of separate authorizing legislation. \nThey are not land acquisitions otherwise authorized by the LWCF Act and \nraise substantial land policy questions which reach well beyond the \nproperty being acquired.\n  Unfortunately, in conference, the Senate's efforts to reinvigorate \nthe LWCF were undermined. While the total commitment from the LWCF \nincluded in this bill is by the far the largest in nearly two decades, \nno money is provided for the stateside LWCF matching grant program. At \nthe same time, the LWCF moneys appropriated to the Federal land \nmanagement agencies are authorized for uses inconsistent with the LWCF \nAct.\n  Moreover, the conferees chose to authorize the acquisition of the \nHeadwaters Forest and New World Mine property in this appropriations \nbill. As anyone involved with the conference can attest, I objected to \nthis decision and was, at best, an unwilling participant in the process \nto authorize these acquisitions on H.R. 2107. I am left to wonder what \nrole the authorizing committees, and the Senate for that matter, are to \nplay in the writing of the laws which authorize the spending of the \ntaxpayers money and the management of the public's lands. The conferees \ndid include requirements which will provide the authorizing committees \nwith an opportunity to conduct meaningful review of the acquisitions \nand provide protections to the American taxpayers.\n\n\n                 stateside lwcf matching grant program\n\n  The stateside LWCF matching grant program is one of two purposes for \nwhich LWCF moneys can be appropriated. The LWCF Act recognizes that a \nsignificant portion of the annual LWCF appropriation will be spent on \nthe stateside matching grant program and, before the 1976 amendments to \nthe LWCF Act, mandated that 60 percent of the annual LWCF appropriation \ngo to the stateside LWCF matching grant program. The LWCF Act now \nimplies such an appropriation by specifying that ``not less than 40 \npercent of [the annual LWCF] appropriations shall be available for \nFederal purposes.'' 16 U.S.C. 460l-7.\n  Stateside LWCF matching grants have played a vital role in providing \nrecreational and educational opportunities to millions of Americans. \nStateside LWCF matching grants have helped finance well over 37,500 \npark and recreation projects in all 50 States, including campgrounds, \ntrails, and open space. While trips to our national parks create \nexperiences and memories which last a lifetime, day-in and day-out, \npeople recreate close to home. In fiscal year 1995, the last year for \nwhich the stateside LWCF matching grant program was funded, there were \nnearly 3,800 applications for stateside grants. Unfortunately, there \nwas only enough money to fund 500 projects. In the intervening 3 years, \nthe local and State demand for those resources only has increased.\n  That is why stateside LWCF matching grants are so important. \nStateside LWCF matching grants help address the highest priority needs \nof Americans for outdoor recreation. At the same time, because of the \nmatching requirement for stateside LWCF grants, they provide vital \nseed-money which local communities use to forge partnerships with \nprivate entities.\n  Unlike the Clinton administration, and its House counterparts, the \nSenate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, and the Senate, recognized \nthe value of the stateside LWCF matching grant program and appropriated \n$100 million to the program over the next 4 years. The Senate Interior \nAppropriations Subcommittee noted, in its report, that ``resource \nprotection is not solely the responsibility nor the domain of the \nFederal Government, and that States can in may cases extract greater \nvalue from moneys'' appropriated from the LWCF.\n  While this $100 million appropriation would only have met a fraction \nof the demand for stateside LWCF matching grants, it would have helped \nto restore the historic balance between the State and Federal sides of \nthe LWCF. With the action of the Clinton administration and the \nCongress to shut down the stateside LWCF matching grant program in \nfiscal year 1996, the LWCF has become a Federal-only land acquisition \nprogram. The balance created by the LWCF Act--between the State and \nlocal communities and the Federal Government; between urban and rural \ncommunities; between the Western and Eastern States--for the \nacquisition of outdoor recreation resources has been lost. As I have \nexpressed before, I believe the loss of this balance is a tragic \nmistake and only serves to increase the already significant pressure on \nthe Federal Government to meet the recreation demands of the American \npublic. Unfortunately, H.R. 2107 compounds this imbalance.\n  As chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I plan to \ncontinue in the 2d session of the 105th Congress, my efforts to \nreinvigorate the stateside LWCF matching grant program. I intend to \nwork with the members of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee to \nfund the stateside LWCF matching grant program in fiscal year 1999. I \nalso will search to find a permanent source of funding for the \nstateside LWCF matching grant program so that this annual \nappropriations battle can be avoided. The stateside LWCF matching grant \nprogram is too important to the America people for Congress to do \nanything less.\n\n\n                        Federal Use of the LWCF\n\n  The LWCF Act also authorizes LWCF moneys to be used by the Federal \nland management agencies to acquire property, otherwise authorized by \nCongress. Congress envisioned that a substantial part of the LWCF \nmoneys allocated for Federal land acquisition should go toward the \npurchase of privately owned inholdings within the authorized boundaries \nof national parks, forests, and refuges.\n\n  Moreover, because the LWCF Act was enacted to establish a funding \nmechanism for the acquisition and development of outdoor recreation \nresources, LWCF moneys generally must be spent to purchase such lands. \nThe Bureau of Land Management only can use LWCF moneys to purchase \nlands which are primarily of value for outdoor recreation purposes. 43 \nU.S.C. 1748(d). Similarly, in the absence of a specific authorization, \nthe National Park Service only can use LWCF moneys to acquire \ninholdings within national parks for outdoor recreation purposes. 16 \nU.S.C. 460l-9(a)(1). Limitations also exist with respect to Forest \nService and Fish and Wildlife Service use of LWCF moneys.\n  However, even with these limitations, the demand for LWCF moneys is \nsignificant. The four Federal land management agencies have identified \nmore\n\n[[Page S11262]]\n\nthan 45 million acres of privately owned lands lying within the \nboundaries of Federal land management units, including national parks, \nnational forests, and national wildlife refuges.\n  These inholdings increase the operating and management costs of the \nland management units. Much of this acreage is small isolated parcels \nwhich complicate overall resource planning. These inholdings increase \nthe time and cost of management as Federal land management agencies \nmust maintain the boundaries, monitor illegal uses, enforce use \nrestrictions, process requests for special uses, address trespass \nissues, in addition to many other management responsibilities. At the \nsame time, many of these inholders have been waiting decades to receive \npromised compensation from the Federal Government for their property.\n  The National Park Service alone, in its fiscal year 1998 budget \nrequest, estimates that the cost to acquire all the private land \nidentified for acquisition within the authorized boundaries of the \nunits of the National Park System, excluding the Alaska parks, is $1.5 \nbillion. Obviously, the costs to purchase these private lands will only \nincrease,\n  Nonetheless, despite this significant demand for Federal land \nacquisition dollars and the costs associated with inholdings, the \nconferees have chosen to allow LWCF moneys to be spent on uses not \notherwise authorized by the LWCF Act--critical maintenance by the four \nFederal land management agencies. The LWCF Act does not authorize any \nagency--Federal, State, local to use LWCF moneys for operations and \nmaintenance activities. The conferees also authorized $22 million in \nmitigation payments to Humboldt County, CA, and the State of Montana--\nagain, a use not otherwise authorized by the LWCF Act.\n  I am troubled by these decisions which set a dangerous precedent by \nexpanding the purposes for which LWCF moneys can be spent. LWCF moneys \nnot spent on the Headwaters Forest and New World Mine acquisitions \nshould be limited to the purchase of private land now owned by willing \nsellers within the authorized boundaries of existing land management \nunits, consistent with the terms of the LWCF Act.\n\n\n            Headwaters Forest/New World Mine Authorizations\n\n  The conferees also decided to authorize the Headwaters Forest and the \nNew World Mine acquisitions in H.R. 2107. While the Clinton \nadministration has conceded that these acquisitions need specific \nauthorizations, I strongly believe that such authorizations should not \nbe included in an appropriations bill. Rather, such authorizations \nshould be the subject of separate legislation which has gone through \nthe regular authorization process.\n  I want to reiterate that my unwillingness to embrace authorizing \nthese two acquisitions on H.R. 2107 comes not from any personal \nopposition to these purchases. I have repeatedly stated over the past 6 \nmonths that I have not formed an opinion on whether or not these \nproperties warrant inclusion in the Federal estate because I, and the \nmembers of my committee, do not know enough about the acquisitions to \neven form an opinion on their merits. Bills authorizing these \nacquisitions have never been introduced in the Senate and my requests \nfor information from the administration over the past year have been \nlargely ignored. On several occasions I have come to the Senate floor \nto voice my concerns about these acquisitions, but even these efforts \nhave failed to get the attention of the administration. It is this very \nlack of information and cooperation, and the resulting unanswered \nquestions about the acquisitions, which I believe counseled against \nauthorizing these purchases absent a thorough, and open, review by the \nauthorizing committees.\n  Nonetheless, the appropriators chose to proceed differently. And, \nwhile I disagreed with this decision, I again would like to thank \nSenator Gorton for his efforts to ensure that the authorizations \ncontained in H.R. 2107 protect the role of the authorizing committee \nand the interests of the American taxpayer.\n  The conferees provided this protection by prohibiting expenditure of \nthe appropriated funds for 180 days. During this time, if no separate \nauthorizing legislation is reported, the acquisitions will proceed \naccording to the authorizations contained in H.R. 2107. The \nAppropriations Committee has committed to allow any authorizing \nlanguage reported by my committee or the House Resources Committee to \nbe attached to the fiscal year 1998 supplemental appropriations bill.\n  During the 180 day review period, the Secretary of Agriculture and \nthe Secretary of the Interior are to provide Congress with fair market \nvalue appraisals for both properties. This requirement is critical to \nprotect the American taxpayers. The most significant unanswered \nquestions about both properties concern their fair market value. \nBecause the purchase prices for both the Headwaters Forest and the New \nWorld Mine property were the result of negotiation and dependent, in \npart, on other terms, the actual fair market value of the properties is \nunknown. The appraisals must comply with the Department of Justice \n``Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions,'' along \nwith other applicable laws and regulations. The Comptroller General of \nthe General Accounting Office also must evaluate both appraisals. In \nthat review, the Comptroller General should examine the methodology and \ndata used in the appraisals.\n  With respect to the New World Mine, an appraisal is already required \npursuant to the August 1996 agreement. A 1995 National Park Service \nreport estimates the fair market value of the property is less than $50 \nmillion but the Federal Government has agreed to a $65 million purchase \nprice.\n  As to the Headwaters Forest, there is enormous discrepancy as to the \nproperty's value. The owner contends the property now has a value of \nclose to $1 billion. A 1993 Forest Service appraisal values the \nproperty at $500 million. However, a 1996 analysis of the property \nconducted for the Department of Justice concludes that the property has \na value between $20 million, applying current environmental \nrestrictions, and $250 million, without any environmental restrictions. \nThe Federal Government and the State of California have agreed to \npurchase the Headwaters Forest for $380 million.\n\n  To further exacerbate this situation, the Federal tax consequences of \nthe Headwaters Forest acquisition have not been considered. The sale of \nthe Headwaters Forest is conditioned upon the current landowner \nreceiving a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service that it can take \nas a business loss the difference between the appraised value of the \nproperty and the Federal purchase price. The Headwaters Forest \nacquisition will cost the American taxpayers hundreds of millions of \ndollars in lost tax revenues, in addition to the $250 million cash \npurchase price.\n  In the absence of the appraisal requirements, Congress would have \nfound itself in the uncomfortable position of appropriating sums for \nFederal land purchases without any idea whether or not the purchases \nwere good deals for the American taxpayers. This is what the Clinton \nadministration sought. The Clinton administration wanted Congress to \nratify the purchase prices for the New World Mine property and \nHeadwaters Forest in order to avoid complying with the Uniform \nRelocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Act--the act which \nrequires a fair market value appraisal of any private property to be \nacquired by the Federal Government. By requiring the completion of \nappraisals before the expenditure of the appropriated funds, Congress \ncan determine for itself, and the American taxpayer, the fair market \nvalue of these properties.\n  The authorizations contained in H.R. 2107 also require Secretary of \nthe Interior, with respect to the Headwaters Forest acquisition, and \nthe Secretary of Agriculture, with respect to the New World Mine \nacquisition, to submit reports to Congress 120 days after enactment of \nH.R. 2107. These reports must detail the status of the conditions \nimposed in H.R. 2107 on the acquisitions. The reports also will provide \ninformation which Congress can use in reviewing the acquisitions.\n  One of these conditions, imposed on the Headwaters Forest \nacquisition, is the issuance of a incidental take permit under the \nEndangered Species Act based on an acceptable habitat conservation plan \n[HCP]. There currently are a number of questions about the status of \nthe Headwaters Forest HCP.\n\n[[Page S11263]]\n\n The Agreement to purchase the Headwaters Forest requires that the \nFederal Government and the property seller agree to an HCP for timber \nharvesting activities which will occur on the remaining 200,000 acres \nowned by the company. In fact, because of difficulties in negotiating \nan acceptable HCP for this property, the timber company sued the \nFederal Government. Because of the significance of the HCP, within 60 \ndays of enactment of H.R. 2107, the Secretary of the Interior and the \nSecretary of Commerce must report to the authorizing committees on \nscientific and legal standards and criteria for species used to develop \nthe HCP. All of these issues will be examined during the 180-day review \nperiod.\n  There are questions, with respect to the New World Mine acquisition, \nabout the amount of land or interests in land the Federal Government \nwill be acquiring. The mining company, which agreed to sell, owns, or \nhas under lease, interests in nearly 6,000 acres outside of Yellowstone \nNational Park. However, the mining company only has fee title to 1,700 \nacres. The remainder is unpatented mining claims. The ownership \nsituation is further complicated by the fact that most of the interests \nin the 6,000 acres are owned by a third party not a signatory to the \nagreement with the Federal Government. In conversations, the mining \ncompany has stated that this third party has agreed to forego her \nrights to develop the mineral reserves of the property for some \nundisclosed price but that she will retain her surface rights. There \nhas been no written verification of this arrangement and it remains \nunclear exactly what interests and interests in land the Federal \nGovernment will acquire for the $65 million purchase price. Again, this \ninformation needs to be provided to Congress so that it can be examined \nduring the 180-day review period.\n  My committee also will evaluate the long-term management plans for \nthe properties. Who will manage the properties? For what purposes? At \nwhat costs? With respect to the Headwaters Forest acquisition, how will \nmanagement responsibilities be divided between the Federal Government \nand the State of California? With respect to the New World Mine \nproperty, how will other mineral containing private property outside \nYellowstone National Park be treated? Should the Federal Government be \nacquiring those properties in order to prevent other mineral \ndevelopment in this area? While an effort has been made to address, at \nleast partially, some of these questions in the context of an \nauthorization on H.R. 2107, a number of them remain unanswered and need \nto be analyzed in greater depth.\n  Again, I would have preferred examining the acquisition of the \nHeadwaters Forest and the New World Mine property through the usual \nauthorization process; thereby, respecting the roles of the \nappropriation and authorizing committees. Nonetheless, the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee will undertake, in good faith, a thorough \nreview of the purchases and, if necessary, report out changes to the \nauthorizations contained in H.R. 2107 at the beginning of next year for \ninclusion in the fiscal year 1998 supplemental appropriations bill. My \ngoal is to ensure that, despite the uncommon circumstances which have \nled us to this point, Congress and the American people can have \nconfidence in the decisions to acquire Headwaters Forest and New World \nMine properties.\n\n\n                       Denali Mining Acquisitions\n\n  Today, the Senate will agree to passage of the conference report for \nH.R. 2107, the Interior appropriations bill for fiscal year 1997. \nContained within this bill is a provision dealing with mining claims in \nDenali National Park. As chairman of the authorizing committee for \nDepartment of Interior activities, I regret that the Department has \ndelayed resolution of this issue until this year. I would prefer to see \nstand-alone legislation to enact this provision in order to allow those \naffected by repeated Park Service delays to be able to testify on the \nrecord about them.\n  Those Denali inholders who wished to sell their inholdings to the \nPark Service have waited for just compensation for some time in some \ncases. Many inholders have been forced to abandon their claims in order \nto avoid paying the annual maintenance fee. Others have lost their \nclaims due to payment of this fee only days late. This is not the way \nto treat Alaskans and it is my personal belief that a taking occurred \nlong ago. As such, the date of taking has not been fixed by this \nprovision.\n  As required by section 202(3)(b) of the Alaska National Interest \nLands Conservation Act, a study of the mineral values of this area was \ncompleted in 1983. This study, known as the DOWL report, clearly \nidentifies the high mineral values of the claims in question. With the \npassage of this legislation, it is my hope that the courts will use \nthis congressionally authorized report as a guide to determining the \nproper valuations.\n  It is my intent to continue to oversee the Park Service's activities \nin regards to this provision to ensure that a resolution to this \nproblem is finally reached. I hope that a nearly 15-year-old problem \nwill finally be resolved.\n  Mr. President, for the record I wish to clarify an important point \nregarding the appropriations bill for the Department of the Interior. \nThat point concerns the Minerals Management Service's rulemaking \nproceedings on the valuation of crude oil from Federal oil and gas \nleases, proceedings which have been underway since January of this \nyear. Those proceedings began with a proposed rule to replace the \nlongstanding practice of valuing crude oil royalties at the lease where \nthe oil is produced with a new system--a system under which valuation \nfor oil from any Federal lease anywhere in the country would begin with \nprices bid for future contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange, or \nNYMEX.\n  Concerned about the fairness of the proposal and the fiscal impacts \nof an ill-considered rule, the managers of the appropriations bill have \ncharged the MMS to continue to meet with representatives of affected \nstates and of Federal leesees. Those meetings should be conducted in a \nmanner to permit a full, careful airing of MMS's proposal and the \nseveral alternatives that have been recommended by States and \nproducers. More importantly, those meetings should be conducted in a \nmanner designed to move the stakeholders in this issue toward \nconsensus.\n  MMS has begun the process of continued consultation by holding a \nseries of workshops in October. I am aware that Secretary Babbitt has \nreceived sharp criticism from some who portray these meetings between \nMMS, States, and producers as backroom sessions, even though notice of \nthose meetings was published in the Federal Register inviting the \npublic to attend. Those critics, however, have already predetermined \nthat MMS's NYMEX-price proposal is the only correct way to value \nroyalty and that MMS must adopt it immediately.\n  The workshops MMS has begun are in fact the beginning of the detailed \nconsultation the managers have directed the agency to undertake. From \nstatements made by representatives of the MMS and of producers, I \ngather that there is disagreement over whether the current regulations \nneed amending to address recent concerns, and significant disagreement \nover how to amend them if amendment is needed. According to statements \nmade by MMS representatives, its rulemaking proceedings arose because \nof the agency's concern that the current regulations allowed large, \nintegrated oil companies to value royalties by using their own posted \nprices, the prices they publicly state they will pay to purchase oil \nfrom third parties.\n  The workshops MMS has begun are the first real effort directly to \naddress and fix the problems MMS and State representatives have \nidentified from their audits. I was disappointed to learn, however, of \nMMS's announcement that the workshops would be limited to 30 days. \nWhile the managers expect the agency to continue to work with dispatch, \nthe haste of the workshops evidently has resulted from political \npressure MMS is receiving from certain quarters. A few workshops in 30 \ndays cannot adequately explore how to restore confidence in all \nquarters that the royalty valuation program is fairly collecting the \nfull value of production at the lease.\n  For my part, I intend to ensure that the agency carries out the \ncharge the managers have given it. If necessary, I will hold oversight \nhearings next year to assure that the agency explains why the current \nregulations are not working, that it explains how whatever alternative \nit then is pursuing assures\n\n[[Page S11264]]\n\nthat the public is receiving royalties based on the fair market value \nof the oil at the lease, and that it reports on its efforts to resolve \nthe issues by consensus.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I have authority from Senator Byrd to \nyield myself time on this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I will engage the distinguished manager \nof the bill in a short colloquy, but let me start off by saying that \nthere are parts of this bill that are confusing because any bill of \nthis magnitude obviously has some things that are hard to understand \nwithout knowing precisely what was intended. These are fairly arcane \nquestions, usually not very entertaining to anybody except those of us \nwho deal with issues affecting the Forest Service and the Department of \nthe Interior.\n  Question No. 1. As I understand it, the U.S. Government will pay $250 \nmillion for the Headwaters Forest as provided in the bill; correct?\n  Mr. GORTON. Correct.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. There is a provision in the bill that says before the \nPresident can spend that money, the $315 million, which includes both \nthe New World Mine and the Headwaters Forest, before the President can \nspend that money to acquire those two properties, the authorizing \ncommittees of the House and the Senate have 180 days from the date of \nenactment of this bill in which to take action. If they take no action, \npresumably the President would be authorized to go ahead and make the \npurchase?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The second question: Do the authorizing committees have \nthe authority under this bill to determine additional conditions under \nwhich the money can be spent?\n  Mr. GORTON. Only by reporting a bill and having that bill passed and \nsigned by the President.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Now, if the President were to veto the bill, because it \ncontained some fairly stringent conditions that he found odious and the \nCongress did not override it, would the President still have authority \nto go ahead and make the purchase?\n  Mr. GORTON. He would.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Another question: We appropriate $700 million in this \nbill from the Land and Water Conservation Fund; is that correct?\n  Mr. GORTON. $699 million.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. That is close enough.\n  So, the $699 million we are appropriating, under current law, the \nappropriate agencies, the Forest Service or the Department of the \nInterior, would have the right to spend other funds unrelated to \nHeadwaters Forest and the New World Mine to make the normal kinds of \npurchases that they have always made; is that correct?\n  Mr. GORTON. Subject to approval of the Appropriations Committees of \nboth Houses.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The committees?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Right.\n  Now, there is a provision in here that says Headwaters Forest must be \nappraised, through a normal appraisal, the appraisal submitted to the \nGAO within 30 days, et cetera.\n  My question is, if the appraisal came out that the Headwaters Forest \nwas worth more than $250 million, would the President have the \nauthority to spend more money out of the Land and Water Conservation \nFund to pay the appraised price?\n  Mr. GORTON. I do not believe so. I believe that the President, the \nadministration, believes it has a binding contract under which it would \nnot have to pay more even though the appraisal came out higher, more \nthan the $250 million.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. So we are only authorizing under this bill, and subject \nto the 180 days within which the committees have to act, we are only \nauthorizing the expenditure of $250 million for Headwaters Forest?\n  Mr. GORTON. Correct.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. If the appraisal came out more than that and Mr. Hurwitz \ndecided he wanted the appraised value, we could not pay him the \nappraised value; is that correct?\n  Mr. GORTON. The administration could not without coming back to the \nCongress.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. On another subject, Mr. President. With regard to the \npayment to the State of Montana, there is a provision in this bill--and \nI will not read the whole provision--but it says essentially that not \nlater than January 1, the year 2001, but not prior to 180 days from \nenactment--the Secretary and the Governor of Montana will negotiate \nwith the understanding that the Federal Government owes them $10 \nmillion in mineral resources for the loss of the New World Mine; is \nthat essentially correct?\n  Mr. GORTON. Owes them a minimum of $10 million.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. A minimum?\n  Mr. GORTON. They could negotiate a higher figure than that.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. That brings me to the point. If the Secretary and the \nGovernor of Montana cannot agree prior to this date on something \nsimilar to $10 million, then the Governor of Montana is within his \nright to demand the so-called Otter Creek tracts, which are tracts of \nland with a considerable amount of coal underneath them; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Now, I wonder if the Senator has seen some figures \nprovided by the Greater Yellowstone Coalition as to what the Otter \nCreek tracts are worth. Let me preface that statement by saying I think \nthe people who are following this bill are under the assumption that we \nare going to pay Montana $10 million to offset any economic loss they \nsustained as a result of our purchase of the New World Mine. There are \ngoing to be some jobs lost, and so on, that they would have otherwise \ngotten. Now, if the Governor of Montana is smart--and I assume he is--\nhe is not going to negotiate very seriously on this for $10 million \nbecause he knows if there is no agreement, he gets the Otter Creek \ntracts. The Otter Creek tracts are estimated to have a value of $4.26 \nbillion.\n  Now, if the U.S. Government were to lease those lands to somebody \nunder the Mineral Leasing Act, we would charge them a 12.5-percent \nroyalty. Half of the royalty from that coal would go to the State of \nMontana and the other half would go to the Federal Treasury. If the \nGovernor of Montana is very shrewd, and he can bottle up negotiations \nand not take the $10 million, which most people assume he is going to \nbe getting, and the State of Montana will wind up with the Otter Creek \ntracts and own all the coal outright * * * not just get the 12.5-\npercent royalty. Does the Senator from Washington know what the Federal \nshare of the royalty from this coal would be?\n  Mr. GORTON. No.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. It is $266 million. Does that disturb the Senator? \nAssuming my figures are correct, would that disturb the Senator from \nWashington?\n  Mr. GORTON. Well, one has to assume--if you take an assumption that \nthe gross revenues are going to be x dollars and that a royalty \nagreement would be 12.5 percent of x dollars, then you simply have an \narithmetic calculation. There are wide differences of opinion as to the \nvalue of those tracts. For example, the demand from the State of \nMontana, through its junior Senator and its Congressman, were for twice \nthis amount of money. It seems to me that there were losses to the \nState of Montana and that this was an appropriate transfer. I think I \nwould have had a very different view, personally at least, toward the \ntransfer had this transfer been from the people--that is to say, the \nUnited States of America--to some private entity. As it is, it is a \ntransfer not to the Governor of the State of Montana, as we tend to \npersonalize this, but to the State. It remains a limited public asset, \nbut a public asset nevertheless. Now, this was a matter which consumed \na considerable amount of time.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I know it was.\n  Mr. GORTON. In negotiations over this, it was set up, very bluntly--\nand I can put this on the record because it is obviously the case--so \nthat if the President feels that is somehow or another totally unwise \nand doesn't mind making the government of the State of Montana unhappy, \nthis provision is subject to a line-item veto. It was set up in that \nfashion. The President doesn't have to veto the whole bill or the whole \n$700 million in the land and water conservation fund. So if he feels it \nis disproportionate in some respect, we never have to go through these \nnegotiations at all.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Senator, if I may, here are the figures furnished me on\n\n[[Page S11265]]\n\nthe point I am trying to make. This is a real bonanza for the State of \nMontana--and I have nothing against them and their two Senators; they \nare two of the dearest friends I have in this body. So it always causes \nme grief when somebody is getting something, just as I am under this \nbill, to say these things. Here is the figure given to me. The Otter \nCreek tracts contain 533 million tons of coal. The current price of \nsuch coal is $8 a ton. It would come to $4.26 billion, and if you take \n12.5 percent of that, you come out with about $266 million in royalties \nthat the State could get. Mr. President, that is a lot more than the \n$10 million that I think most Senators in this body think we are giving \nthe State of Montana.\n  So I wanted to raise that point because, as you know, \nthe administration is pretty concerned about this bill. I don't know \nthat the President would veto it. If he were to veto that particular \nprovision under the line-item authority that he now has and the Supreme \nCourt later determined that the line-item veto is unconstitutional, \nthen this is still a viable provision and his line-item veto of it \nwould not stand.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Of course, the same thing is true with respect to all the \nother line-item vetoes, which I think would certainly be representative \nof millions of dollars. The President is exercising that power that was \ngiven to him by the Congress, and we will find out later whether or not \nthey were valid. That would do no more or less than to set this out as \na separate item. There is, however, a difference between the sale price \nof a mineral once it has been taken out and processed and worked on and \nthe value of that same mineral while sitting in the ground. Those two \nare by no means equivalent.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Senator, you and I have talked about this in private. I \nthink it is well to get this on the record also. You may have alluded \nto this in your opening remarks. But another item that I think the \nadministration is terribly concerned about is the provision in the bill \nthat says ``no funds can be spent to revise forest plans until new \nfinal interim or final rules for forest land management planning are \npublished in the Federal Register.'' You know, of course, under the \nnational forest management plan, they are required to update the plans \non the forests periodically. It is my understanding that some 42 plans \nwould be blocked until the Forest Service publishes new final interim \nor final rules for forest land management planning. I can tell you that \nis costing the administration considerable pain. Would the Senator like \nto elaborate on that?\n  Mr. GORTON. I will comment on that. Obviously, the regulations in \nthese forest plans have a tremendous impact not just on the Federal \nGovernment and management of the Forest Service, but very obviously on \nthe communities and the areas in which these forests are located. The \nregulations and the rules that we are talking about have been under \nreview for 8 years; that means through two administrations. Evidently, \nthey must be rather controversial because they seem to have been about \nready to promulgate and just before the elections, both in 1992 and \n1996, they were withdrawn. Now we have gone just about a year after the \nlast election. And we have been deeply concerned that so many millions \nof dollars have been spent on plan revisions that may just be thrown \ninto the wastebasket when these regulations do come out.\n  So the design of this provision in the bill is to see to it that an \nadministration, after 8 years and these two delays, comes up with final \nor at least interim regulations--something that it ought to be able to \ndo within a relatively short period of time. Even so, in spite of \nthat--and that was really what we asked them to do here in the Senate--\nbecause the administration had reservations on it, we have two \nexceptions to it. One is, in any forest in which a notice of intent to \nrevise was published in the Federal Register before October 1 of this \nyear--that is to say, where they were ready to do so; and second, where \na court order has directed that a revision must occur. So in those two \ninstances--and they are pretty big exceptions--this mandate doesn't \napply at all. In the other case, all we are saying is, at least give us \ninterim rules and regulations so that the forest plan revisions will be \nconsistent with them when they come out.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. One final question and a remark. I see the Senator from \nNew Mexico on the floor. He and I have talked about this privately. \nThere is a grazing provision in this bill that is of some concern to \nme. There is a court order in New Mexico regarding grazing rights, and \nthere is a provision in here that says that none of the funds may be \nused by the Forest Service to carry out a court order. As I told him, I \nam not going to get into that, but I think that has a little bit of \ndanger. Just for the record, I will let the Senator say what he said to \nme privately about that provision.\n  Mr. GORTON. I yield to the Senator from New Mexico for that purpose.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator that I did not come to the floor \nto interfere with your work or even to answer this question, but since \nI am here----\n  Mr. BUMPERS. If you choose to answer, by all means, do.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Actually, Senator, I think I have explained it to \nSenator Gorton when I asked him to do this. Essentially, it does \nnothing more than say, for the remainder of this year, which is almost \ngone, the court order that could have forced some of the small ranchers \nto take their cattle off ranch land and set them aside while they do a \nnew evaluation, we said that cannot happen in that manner until after \nthis year is past, which is like a month or two. That is all it does.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I think March 1 was the date.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If that's the date, that's the date.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Let me say this to the distinguished Senator from \nWashington, whose friendship I treasure. First of all, he has worked \ntirelessly to craft this bill, and there have been many conflicting \nforces pulling him in one direction or another. I know it has not been \neasy. He has always been very accommodating to me and I want to thank \nhim profusely for that. More importantly, I want to tell him I was \nmoved a moment ago by the very nice things he said about the role I \nplayed in the integration of my little school in Charleston, AR, at \nthat time, with a population of 1,200. It was the very first school in \nthe Old Confederacy to integrate after the Supreme Court decision in \nBrown versus Board of Education. He very generously put a $50,000 \nappropriation in here to do a feasibility study about establishing a \nnational historic site in that community to commemorate this historic \nevent. I express my deep and profound gratitude to him for that. He \nalso agreed to include $150,000 for a similar designation for Central \nHigh School, which was the scene of one of the most, if not the most, \ndangerous situations in the United States since the Civil War.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Pennsylvania is on the floor. I will \nyield 7 minutes to him.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his kind \ncomments earlier, as well as for his tremendous support of the issue \nwhich I rise to talk about in the bill. He has been very cooperative, \nto the nth degree, in making sure this funding is in the bill. What I \nam talking about is actually an increase in the amount of funding for a \nnational park that I think is one of the most significant and important \nnational parks we have in this country, the Gettysburg National \nBattlefield, a battle which represents the high-water mark of the \nconfederacy. It is in my State of Pennsylvania. I have had the \nprivilege of being there on many occasions and, for the most part, they \nhave been very sad occasions. They are times when I have to go up and \nlook at the state of disrepair of the battlefield, the absolute \nhorrendous conditions in which some of the most significant Civil War \nartifacts are kept. They are kept in basements that are damp. There is \nrot on most of the artifacts, uniforms, soldiers' diaries, \narcheological artifacts, and historical photographs. They are rotting \naway because we have absolutely no place to put them. We also have many \nfarmhouses that were there used during the battle, which are crumbling \nand falling apart because we don't have any money to fix them.\n  Mr. President, there was an article in the Washington Post today on \nGettysburg, and there was one in USA Today also on Gettysburg. One \nreferred to the\n\n[[Page S11266]]\n\n``next battle of Gettysburg,'' which is the attempt by the Park \nService--I think a very important attempt--to relocate the visitors' \ncenter, which sits on Cemetery Ridge right in the middle of the Union \nline. New facilities are desperately needed given the condition of the \nartifacts I mentioned, to restore the battlefield to its intended \ncondition, which should be its condition at the time of the battle, and \nto move the visitor center to another location in or near the park. The \nproposal referred to in the news articles is to move the visitors' \ncenter to a location in the park where there was no fighting that \noccurred and where no one died.\n\n  The primary reason for the Park Service seeking a public-private \npartnership to build the new facilities is, No. 1, the current \nfacilities are located in a place where they should not be and to \nprovide better preservation and restoration of the artifacts and \nmonuments. I visited the battlefield a month ago and reviewed some of \nthe cannon carriages. There are some 400 cannons of which 380 are in \nabsolute horrible condition. In fact, they are breaking apart, \ncracking, and the paint is chipping off. You have little kids running \naround on the battlefield climbing on top of the cannons with paint \npeeling away. If that happened in a city, or in a house, all the \ninspectors in the world would say that you have to do something to \nrepair these cannon carriages.\n  But we don't have the money, at least not until today. As much as the \nfunding today will help, Gettysburg also needs the new visitor center, \nand they need the private-public partnership because there just isn't \nenough money in the budget to build a new facility. We can't get the \ncapital funds.\n  This new proposal, however, is meeting with some controversy from \npreservationists who feel we should leave things alone. If we leave \nthings alone, though, Gettysburg won't be here very much longer--at \nleast the historical documents and artifacts and monuments. I was at \nthe Pennsylvania monument recently, one of the largest at the park. It \nis a grand thing. It is a dome-shaped monument. You can walk through it \nand under it--but not when it rains because it leaks, the water drips \nright down on you. You walk around and you see monuments that you can't \neven make out who it is a monument to anymore because they are just \nworn.\n  That is no condition for this hallowed ground to be in. I, again, \nthank the Senator from Washington because I came to him with this plea \nafter being, frankly, shocked and emotionally moved, after having been \nto that battleground on several occasions, and pleaded with him to do \nsomething about this state of the battlefield. He said, ``Tell me what \nyou need and we will make sure that we fight for it.'' And through the \nprocess he was there every step of the way and did fight valiantly, and \nwe have succeeded in getting an additional million dollars.\n  But I will be very honest with you. That is a start. We also need to \nmove forward with this new visitor center. I know it may be \ncontroversial. I know people are saying we have to wait and see. I am \nwilling to listen to the preservationists and to those who have \nconcerns about the new location being proposed by the Park Service. But \nwe cannot delay long. We need to move forward to construct, No. 1, a \nsuitable place for us to keep these artifacts. If we do not move \nforward and build a new facility that has the kinds of conditions, \nwhether it is humidity, temperature, sunlight, and other things, to \nadequately display the park's treasures, they will be lost. One such \ntreasure is the cyclorama painting that was painted back in 1880's. \nToday, the canvas is rippled. It is being destroyed, damaged by time, \nby humidity, by the misconstruction of the building when it was first \nput in. We need to act now to preserve and restore it.\n  Today is a first step. I commend the committee and the Senator from \nWashington. We have made a first step today. We need to be vigilant on \nthis. We need to come back and work further for more aid for this park \nand others to make sure that we can keep these hallowed grounds in a \ncondition that we can be proud of and that we can preserve for \nposterity.\n  So I rise to make my colleagues aware of the reasons for which this \nappropriation was targeted, and I encourage the President to be \nsupportive of this additional appropriation. I also encourage him to do \nall he can to make sure on the Executive side that we move forward with \nthe Park Service in some way quickly to get this new visitor center \nconstructed, so we can begin to turn this park around to preserve our \nterrific assets, as well as to present a much better historical \neducational opportunity for people who come to visit the park.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair.\n  There are a number of riders attached to this conference report which \nshould be cause for concern by my colleagues. I am most troubled by the \nconferees' treatment of the Forest Service purchaser road credit \nprogram.\n  During this body's consideration of the Interior appropriations bill, \nI offered an amendment to eliminate this environmentally destructive \nsubsidy. It failed by a single vote. A similar amendment in the House \nalso failed by a single vote.\n  The purchaser road credit program allows the Forest Service to \nsubsidize the road construction costs of timber companies by granting \ncredits to them equal to the estimated cost of the roads they need to \naccess their timber. Timber purchasers can then use the credit to pay \nfor the timber being harvested. Last year these ``purchaser credits'' \nwere valued at nearly $50 million.\n  In the House-passed version of the Interior appropriations bill, a \nlimit of $25 million was placed on the value of purchaser credits that \nmay be offered by the Forest Service in fiscal year 1998. The \nconference report before us today eliminates this cap entirely. The \nSenate report accompanying the bill ``directs the Forest Service to \ncontinue the timber purchaser credit program without change'' and makes \nit clear that ``the committee has not specified the ceiling for the \namount of purchaser credits that can be offered'' to timber companies. \nThe result of this language is an open-ended subsidy for the timber \nindustry.\n  Mr. President, in spite of the conferees' decision to expand this \nsubsidy, I intend to send a letter to the administration urging them to \nuse their discretionary authority to abolish this wasteful and \nenvironmentally unsound program, and I urge my colleagues to join me in \nthis effort.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the \nfloor.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am grateful to the Senator from \nWashington for the manner in which he has handled this bill as the \nchairman of the subcommittee for Interior appropriations.\n  I presented to the conference at a very late moment an amendment, \nwhich is amendment No. 128, that modifies the regular amendment that \nwas in the original House bill dealing with the problems associated \nwith management of Alaska fish and game.\n  I want to tell the Senate, in July at our request the Secretary of \nthe Interior came to Alaska and met at Senator Murkowski's house with \nme and Congressman Young, with the Governor, the attorney general, and \nmembers of what we know as the Governor's task force on subsistence. We \nagreed then to try to work together to assure that Alaska, along with \nall other States, would continue to manage fish and game on Federal \nlands within its borders.\n  It is a very difficult problem for us, but very clearly Secretary \nBabbitt has carried through with the commitments he made at that time, \nand we have worked toward finding a resolution to these problems.\n  This task force did come up with a report. It is a very interesting \ntask force. It is made up of the Governor and Lieutenant Governor, \nGovernor Knowles and Lieutenant Governor Ulmer, also the speaker of the \nhouse, Gail Phillips; the president of the senate, Mike Miller; a \nformer Republican Governor, Jay Hammond; and the\n\n[[Page S11267]]\n\nformer Republican attorney general, Charley Cole. Byron Mallot, \nDirector of the Alaska Permanent Fund, who has held leadership roles in \nAlaska Native organizations, was also on that task force.\n  This task force worked hard over the summer and came up with some \nrecommendations. We hoped those recommendations would be presented to a \njoint session of the Alaska Legislature this year. That was not \npossible. When it was really evident it could not be done, I asked the \nconference to adopt this amendment. It is covered on pages 94 and 95 of \nthe conference report, and I will not comment at large about it.\n  But I do want the Senate to know and the Record to show that we have \ndone our best to meet this. Senator Murkowski has just said he is going \nto hold some hearings, and Congressman Young may hold some hearings. I \ndo hope they will hold them. I hope they will hold them in Alaska. \nThere are a lot of Alaskans who want to be heard on the matter of what \nshould be done. The Congress may be asked to adopt further amendments \nnext year.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n              APPENDIX C STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS EXTENSION\n\n  Mr GORTON. Will the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee yield for a question?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. GORTON. The conference report contains an amendment dealing with \nland selection rights of five Alaska Native village corporations \ninvolved in the so-called appendix C conveyance issue. Would the \nchairman provide some background on this issue and explain Congress' \nintentions on how this provision should be interpreted by the courts.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The lands at issue were selected by five Alaska Native \nvillage corporations pursuant to the 1971 Alaska Native Claims \nSettlement Act. The lands were selected in 1974, pursuant to an \nagreement among the villages, a full 6 years before the creation of \nLake Clark National Park. For years, the Department followed a course \nof processing village land selections outlined in both appendix A and \nappendix C of the agreement. This prior course is well documented \nincluding formal conveyance decisions and reservation of easements.\n  In the 1990's, the Department changed its course effectively denying \nthe village corporations the land to which they are entitled. This \nprovision is designed to allow the Native corporations to challenge the \nDepartment's refusal to convey them their land in a court of law. While \nthe Alaska congressional delegation believes the Native people are \nentitled to the land, the Department of the Interior disagrees. We have \nagreed to allow an objective third party decide, based on the facts of \nthe case and an interpretation of the 1974 agreement, whether the \nNative people are entitled to the lands in appendix C.\n  Because the Interior Department has taken so long to process the \nvillagers land claims, the statute of limitations for challenging the \nDepartment has almost expired. To allow a suit to be filed, the \nconference report extends the statute of limitation through October 1, \n1998, under which the five village corporations and Cook Inlet Region, \nInc., the regional corporation, may bring litigation challenging the \nDepartment's refusal to convey the appendix C lands to the village \ncorporations.\n  The amendment clarifies that if litigation is brought by the village \ncorporations or Cook Inlet Region, Inc, it shall be filed in the U.S. \ndistrict court. The court trial permitted in this amendment will result \nin a fresh hearing on the merits of the case.\n  The court record will not be limited to the current, incomplete \nadministrative record, but shall consider new evidence introduced that \nis relevant to the interpretation of the agreements and conveyances in \ndispute. The language allowing introduction of new evidence was \nproposed by the Office of Management and Budget. This will provide for \na neutral hearing on the total circumstances of the dispute.\n  A fresh look at the case prompted the Anchorage Daily News, the daily \nnewspaper in Alaska's largest city with a strong record of \nenvironmental advocacy to endorse conveyance of the appendix C lands to \nthe villages. I ask unanimous consent that the editorial be printed in \nthe Record.\n\n             [From the Anchorage Daily News, Oct. 24, 1997]\n\n          First Principles Interior, Do Right in Land Dispute\n\n       A long-standing land dispute between the U.S. Department of \n     the Interior and Cook Inlet-area Native village corporations \n     should be settled in the corporations' favor, either through \n     a deal brokered by Sen. Ted Stevens or, better yet, through \n     direct action by Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt.\n       Until Secretary Babbitt steps in, Interior lawyers and \n     high-level bureaucrats will keep fighting with five village \n     corporations and Cook Inlet Region Inc., the Native regional \n     powerhouse that has intervened for its member village \n     corporations. The dispute centers on roughly 29,000 acres of \n     land on the west side of Cook Inlet. The Natives say they're \n     entitled to the acreage, but the department wants to add the \n     disputed parcels to Lake Clark National Park and Preserve.\n       On this matter, the Clinton administration unfortunately \n     appears to be more intent on locking up another corner of the \n     state than respecting the will of Congress as expressed by \n     the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act.\n       The 1971 act created Native-owned corporations--both \n     regional and village--to manage settlement money and land. \n     Plain and simple: It is wrong that, over 20 years later, a \n     handful of village corporations in Southcentral Alaska are \n     still awaiting title to selected acreage.\n       Both sides look to a 1976 agreement to bolster their \n     respective arguments. The agreement was supposed to sort out \n     competing government and Native interests through land \n     trades. It summarized how trades would take place and in what \n     order lands would be selected and conveyed. Aside from minor \n     amendments, the document hasn't changed--but the feds and \n     Natives have reached different conclusions about what it \n     says.\n       Sen. Stevens has unsuccessfully tried several times in \n     recent years to end the dispute in the corporations' favor. \n     His latest attempt suffered a setback Thursday when it was \n     cut out of a Department of the Interior budget bill. While it \n     is commendable that Alaska's senior senator has gone to bat \n     for a just cause, it is unfortunate that his latest effort \n     was special-interest legislation attached to the coattails of \n     a bigger bill.\n       The preferable alternative: Secretary Babbitt can and \n     should direct his staff to convey the disputed acreage to the \n     five Cook Inlet-area village corporations via Cook Inlet \n     Region Inc. While he and park proponents may not like the \n     results--after all, the land can be used for commercial \n     purposes--the anticipation of what may happen later should \n     not stop him from doing the right thing now.\n       If, after nearly three decades, a just portion of an \n     aboriginal land settlement is circumvented by clever \n     bureaucrats, then the integrity of Congress will have been \n     compromised so that a national park can be expanded.\n       The right and only call for Secretary Babbitt to make is to \n     lay this old chapter of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement \n     Act to rest and turn over title of the disputed land to its \n     rightful owners.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. It is my view that the amendment the conferees agreed to \nrequires a full trial to be held if a lawsuit is filed and allows the \nparties to introduce all relevant evidence. Do you agreement with that \ninterpretation?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes. It is the intent of the amendment that a trial on \nthe merits be conducted in the U.S. District Court if the villages \ndecide to file suit. Such a trial would be held in lieu of an \nadministrative hearing conducted by the Department of the Interior and \nin lieu of a court appeal of any administrative decision that was \nlimited to the current, incomplete administrative record.\n  The court must hear all relevant evidence related to the \ncircumstances surrounding the land selections and conveyances and \nshould not be limited to hearing only the views of the Interior \nDepartment or reviewing the limited administrative record that \ncurrently exists. Nor, in my opinion, should it defer to any prior \ndecision that was not based on a hearing and a full review of the \nfacts.\n  In order to ensure justice for the parties, it is necessary that the \ncourt have all relevant evidence available to it. Since this dispute \nhas a complex fact pattern that stretches over 20 years, the case \nshould not be resolved on a motion for summary judgment.\n  The lands sought by the village corporations were originally selected \nin 1974. The selections were accomplished with the assistance of \nofficials at the Bureau of Land Management. The village corporations \nhave never varied in their selection priorities, and the selection \npriorities must be honored by the Federal Government. Those of us who \nare familiar with the history of this dispute understand that the \npurpose of the Deficiency Agreement was to give effect to the land \nselections made by the village corporations.\n\n[[Page S11268]]\n\n  The lands should be conveyed to the villages in the priority order in \nwhich they were selected, the same requirement that applies to all land \nconveyances made to Native corporations under the Alaska Native Land \nClaims Settlement Act. It is important to read all provisions of the \nagreements in question in the context in which they were negotiated and \nin light of the legislative purpose the agreements served to fulfill \nvillage land selection rights.\n  I regret that litigation may be necessary in this case. I am \ndisturbed that the Department of the Interior decided to change its \ninterpretation of the conveyance requirement and is using a very \nlimited interpretation of the Deficiency Agreement to clear title to \nthe appendix C lands. The Department is attempting to acquire more land \nfor Lake Clark National Park. However, it is important to note that the \nboundaries of Lake Clark National Park were not expanded to potentially \ninclude appendix C lands until 6 years after the original land \nselections were made by the village corporations in 1974. As a result, \nthe appendix C lands are not park lands by virtue of the prior valid \nNative land selections.\n  Since enactment of ANCSA, there has been a substantial amount of \nlitigation regarding interpretation of the statute, but no case has \nbeen heard that is directly on point with respect to appendix C. \nFurther no opinion--including Court of Claims cases--has been issued \ninterpreting the Deficiency Agreement based on a full hearing of all \nthe relevant evidence. It is one purpose of this amendment to ensure \nthat the district court's resolution of the present matter will not be \nbound by any decision or opinion not based on a full review of the \nlegal and factual record. The court must take a new look at the dispute \nafter reviewing a full and complete record.\n  Mr. GORTON. The Interior Department has not responded to the \nauthorizing committees' requests in either the House or the Senate for \nresolution of this matter. As chairman of the Senate Energy Committee, \ncan Senator Murkowski elaborate?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. During the past Congress, both the House Resources \nCommittee and the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee held \nhearings on this dispute. We heard from members of the villages seeking \ntheir lands as well as from the Department of the Interior. At the end \nof the Senate hearing in September 1996, I asked if the Department of \nthe Interior was willing to work with the villages to come to a \nresolution. While its initial indication was yes, more than 6 months \nlater, no action had been taken.\n  On January 2 of this year, Chairman Young and I wrote to Secretary \nBabbitt requesting again that appropriate department policy level \nofficials meet with the affected villages and the regional corporation \nas soon as possible to negotiate a resolution acceptable to the \nadministration and the Alaska Native corporations. Again, there was no \nserious effort to seek a resolution.\n  Having no indication that the Department was willing to even try to \nnegotiate a settlement of this dispute, Chairman Young and I wrote to \nChairman Stevens on April 25 asking him to include language in the \nInterior appropriations bill to ensure conveyance of the disputed land \nto the villages.\n\n\n           CHANGES TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE ALLOCATION\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, section 205 of House Concurrent \nResolution 84, the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year \n1998, allows the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to adjust the \nallocation for the Appropriations Committee to reflect new budget \nauthority and outlays provided for priority Federal land acquisitions \nand exchanges.\n  I ask unanimous consent that revisions to the 1998 Senate \nAppropriations Committee budget authority and outlay allocations, \npursuant to sec. 302 of the Congressional Budget Act, in the following \namounts, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the revisions were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                     Budget authority       Outlays     \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCurrent allocation:                                                     \n    Defense discretionary.........    269,000,000,000    266,823,000,000\n    Nondefense discretionary......    255,550,000,000    283,243,000,000\n    Violent crime reduction fund..      5,500,000,000      3,592,000,000\n    Mandatory.....................    277,312,000,000    278,725,000,000\n    Total allocation..............    807,362,000,000    832,262,000,000\nAdjustments:                                                            \n    Defense discretionary.........  .................  .................\n    Nondefense discretionary......       -700,000,000       -257,000,000\n    Violent crime reduction fund..  .................  .................\n    Mandatory.....................  .................  .................\n    Total allocation..............       -700,000,000       -257,000,000\nRevised allocation:                                                     \n    Defense discretionary.........    269,000,000,000    266,823,000,000\n    Nondefense discretionary......    254,850,000,000    282,986,000,000\n    Violent crime reduction fund..      5,500,000,000      3,592,000,000\n    Mandatory.....................    277,312,000,000    278,725,000,000\n    Total allocation..............    806,662,000,000    832,126,000,000\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to explain the need for a \nreallocation in funding authority for the Appropriations Committee that \nis being filed today.\n  I regret that this reallocation is necessary because it was \navoidable.\n  Section 205 of the fiscal year 1998 budget resolution provided for \nthe allocation of $700 million in budget authority for Federal land \nacquisitions and to finalize priority land exchanges upon the reporting \nof a bill that included such funding.\n  The Senate-reported Interior appropriations bill included this \nfunding in title V. As chairman of the Budget Committee, I allocated \nthese funds to the Appropriations Committee, which in turn provided \nthem to the Interior Subcommittee.\n  If the conferees had adopted the Senate language, I would not be here \nwithdrawing this funding allocation. However, the conferees modified \nthe Senate language to provide only $699 million for land acquisitions, \nand to expand the use of these funds for the following purposes:\n  Critical maintenance activities are added as an allowable activity \nunder this title V funding;\n  Ten million dollars is provided for a payment to Humboldt County, CA, \nas part of the Headwaters land acquisition; and\n  Twelve million dollars is provided for repair and maintenance of the \nBeartooth Highway as part of the Crown Butte/New World Mine land \nacquisition.\n  The Senate Budget Committee provided clarifying language to the \nconferees on the Interior appropriations bill during their meeting on \nSeptember 30. This language simply restated that monies provided in \ntitle V, when combined with monies provided by other titles of the bill \nfor Federal land acquisition, shall provide at least $700 million for \nFederal land acquisitions and to finalize priority land exchanges.\n  This language, which I urged be included throughout the past 2 weeks \nwhile final language was drafted, would have ensured that the section \n205 allocation remained in place for this bill.\n  The chairmen decided to include, however, language which attempts to \ntrigger the additional $700 million by amending the budget resolution. \nThis language causes a violation under section 306 of the Budget Act \nbecause it affects matters within the jurisdiction of the Budget \nCommittee.\n  Since this language will not become effective until the bill is \nsigned into law, and the conferees did not clarify that $700 million is \nincluded in the bill for land acquisition and priority land exchanges, \nI have no choice but to withdraw the additional allocation of funding \nprovided in section 205 of the budget resolution.\n  I worked diligently as a member of the conference to complete this \nimportant bill, working with my good friend, the senior Senator from \nWashington, who chairs this subcommittee.\n  The inclusion of a simple proviso would have avoided this problem. I \nregret that the chairmen of the conference chose not to do so, and that \nthis withdrawal of funding is now necessary.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the \nprovisions included in the final version of the Interior appropriations \nbill be printed in the Record, along with a letter I sent to the \nchairman of the full Appropriations Committee about these issues at his \nrequest.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Changes to the Fiscal Year 1998 Interior and Related Agencies \n              Appropriations Bill Since Formal Conference\n\n\n           $700 million land acquisition and maintenance fund\n\n       The conference agreement for the fiscal year 1998 Interior \n     and Related Agencies Appropriations Act provides an \n     additional $699 million for priority land acquisitions and \n     exchanges, and for reducing the maintenance backlogs of the \n     Federal land management agencies. This special appropriation \n     was first\n\n[[Page S11269]]\n\n     referenced by the balanced budget agreement this Spring \n     between the Congress and the Administration, which provided \n     an additional $700 million for priority land acquisitions and \n     exchanges. The Senate version of the Interior Appropriations \n     bill included the special appropriation for land acquisition; \n     the House version did not.\n       A portion of these funds will be used to acquire two \n     specific pieces of land--the Headwaters Forest in California \n     and the Crown Butte/New World Mine property near Yellowstone \n     National Park. Both of these acquisitions are high priorities \n     of the Administration. Congress, in appropriating funds for \n     these two acquisitions, has stipulated conditions that ensure \n     the wise use of Federal taxpayer dollars, the development of \n     State and local partnerships, and the appropriate use of \n     proper procedures--including valuations, public appraisals \n     and adherence to the National Environmental Policy Act.\n       These two Administration projects will require up to $315 \n     million in Federal funds--up to $250 million for the \n     Headwaters Forest and up to $65 million for Crown Butte/New \n     World Mine. The State of California will provide $130 million \n     for the Headwaters Forest acquisition. The Headwaters \n     acquisition will be accompanied by a single payment of \n     $10,000,000 for Humboldt County, California, to help offset \n     lost tax revenues and cover anticipated increases in public \n     health and safety costs incurred by the County. The Crown \n     Butte/New World Mine acquisition will be accompanied by an \n     additional Federal expenditure of $12,000,000 to improve and \n     maintain the Beartooth Highway. The conference agreement also \n     directs that a Federal/State study be undertaken to identify \n     and encourage mineral resource development in the State of \n     Montana. Bill language also directs a $10 million transfer of \n     Federal mineral rights to the State of Montana.\n       Both the Headwaters Forest and the Crown Butte/New World \n     Mine acquisitions are delayed for 180 days, during which time \n     the conditions that govern these acquisitions will be \n     reviewed by the Congressional authorizing committees and may \n     be modified through additional legislation. To the extent \n     that the appraisal process causes a delay, the 180 day period \n     will be extended by an equivalent number of days.\n       The remainder of the $699 million will be used for other \n     priority land acquisitions and for critical repair and \n     restoration needs of the four land management agencies: \n     National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau \n     of Land Management, and U.S. Forest Service. The Secretaries \n     of Agriculture and the Interior will submit requests to the \n     House and Senate Committees on Appropriations for approval \n     for the use of the traditional land acquisition and \n     maintenance funds. The Secretaries are encouraged to \n     emphasize projects that reduce their critical maintenance \n     backlogs and to select land acquisitions which complete a \n     unit, consolidate lands for more efficient management, or \n     address critical resource needs.\n\n\n                   pennsylvania avenue modifications\n\n       Amendment #158 has been modified, as requested by the \n     Administration, regarding the limitation of expenditures of \n     funds in this bill to implement changes to Pennsylvania \n     Avenue in front of the White House.\n\n\n                     national park service housing\n\n       The report language has been slightly modified to require \n     the Secretary of the Interior to appoint a review committee, \n     a majority of whose members are not employees of the National \n     Park Service, to review the construction practices of the \n     National Park Service and to submit no later than April 15, \n     1998, a report of their findings and recommendations to the \n     House and Senate Committees on Appropriations.\n\n\n             lake clark national park and preserve, alaska\n\n       Amendment #68 has been modified, as requested by the \n     Administration.\n\n\n        Summary                                             In Millions\nHeadwaters...................................................up to $250\nCrown Butte....................................................up to 65\nHumboldt Co..........................................................10\nBeartooth Hwy........................................................12\nOther land/maintenance..............................................362\n                                                       ________________\n                                                       \n                                  [Dept. of the Interior: $272 million]\n                                     [U.S. Forest Service: $90 million]\n    Total..................................................$699 million\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                      Committee on the Budget,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 23, 1997.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ted: I regret that I have to bring to your attention \n     two Budget Act violations that will lie against the \n     conference report on the Interior and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations bill.\n       The conference report fails to meet the terms of section \n     205 of the FY 1998 budget resolution (H. Con. Res. 84) \n     regarding priority land acquisition funding. Therefore, I \n     must withdraw the additional $700 million for priority land \n     acquisition and exchanges to the Appropriations Committee for \n     consideration of the conference report on the Interior bill. \n     Assuming the Appropriations Committee reduces the section \n     302(b) allocation for the Interior bill by this amount, the \n     conference report on the Interior bill would violate section \n     302(f) of the Budget Act.\n       The Interior bill also would amend the FY 1998 budget \n     resolution to relax the requirements of section 205. Because \n     this provision affects matter in the Budget Committee's \n     jurisdiction, it would cause another violation under section \n     306 of the Budget Act. If a point of order is raised under \n     either one of these sections, it takes 60 votes in the Senate \n     to waive either of these points of order.\n       At the Administration's insistence, the Balanced Budget \n     Agreement included $700 million in spending for priority land \n     acquisition and exchanges. I worked for a more flexible \n     mechanism to allocate funding for priority land acquisition, \n     but the White House insisted on very restrictive language. As \n     a result, section 205 of the FY 1998 budget resolution \n     provides that the $700 million will only be made available to \n     the Appropriations Committee if the Interior Appropriations \n     bill provided $700 million for priority land acquisition and \n     exchanges.\n       The Senate-passed Interior bill met the budget resolution's \n     requirements by providing $700 million for land acquisition \n     activities. During the conference on the Interior bill, the \n     Senate language was modified and I provided some additional \n     language to the conferees that would have ensured $700 \n     million was spent on land acquisition, thereby meeting the \n     budget resolution's requirements. Instead, the tentative \n     conference agreement included language amending the budget \n     resolution. My staff has been in touch with both Senator \n     Gorton's staff and your staff to indicate that the tentative \n     conference agreement on the Interior bill would violate the \n     Budget Act. Even so, the conferees chose to ignore my \n     suggestion.\n       The Interior conference report provides $699 million for \n     land acquisition. Of this funding, it provides that the money \n     can be used for purposes other than land acquisition, \n     including maintenance activities, PILT payments, and highway \n     improvements. While the Interior conference report attempts \n     to trigger the additional $700 million by amending the budget \n     resolution, I cannot take this language into account until \n     the Interior bill becomes law.\n       If we took language amending the budget resolution into \n     account for determining budgetary levels, the budget \n     resolution and our efforts to enforce a balanced budget plan \n     would become meaningless. Instead of making the hard choices \n     to live within the budget resolution's levels, committees \n     could simply rely on the precedent that would be established \n     in the Interior bill and amend the budget resolution to \n     assert they had complied with budgetary limits. Finally, the \n     budget resolution is a congressional document that does not \n     require the President's signature and I think it is \n     inappropriate to amend the budget resolution through a law.\n       I recognize the extraordinary effort you and Senator Gorton \n     have put into writing an Interior bill that can pass both \n     Houses and be signed by the President. I also realize that \n     the issue is not the total level of spending, but how this \n     additional $700 million will be spent. My concern is with the \n     precedent to amend a budget resolution that will be \n     established by the Interior Appropriations bill, which is \n     avoidable, and that is why I attempted to resolve this issue \n     during the Interior conference to avoid any Budget Act \n     violations.\n       I regret that I have to withdraw the additional allocation \n     to the Appropriations Committee for land acquisition funding, \n     but I have no choice.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Pete V. Domenici,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I also object to the inclusion of \ndirected scorekeeping language in this bill. If the Senator took \nlanguage amending the budget resolution into account for determining \nbudgetary levels, the budget resolution levels and our efforts to \nenforce a balanced budget plan would become meaningless.\n  Instead of making the choices necessary to live within the budget \nresolution levels, committees could simply rely on a precedent to \nassert, or ``deem,'' that they had complied with the budgetary limits, \neven though they hadn't.\n  Such action would undermine the budget discipline of the Senate.\n  Since the directed scorekeeping language will not become effective \nuntil the bill is signed into law, and the conferees did not clarify \nthat $700 million is included in the bill for land acquisition and \npriority land exchanges, I have no choice but to withdraw the \nadditional allocation of funding provided in section 205 of the budget \nresolution for land acquisition and exchanges.\n\n\n                    miccosukee settlement amendment\n\n  Mr. MACK. I rise today to thank my colleague, Senator Gorton, for \nincluding language in the fiscal year 1998 Interior appropriations bill \nconcerning a settlement between the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of \nFlorida and the State of Florida. The Mack-Graham amendment is a clear, \nnoncontroversial piece of legislation that finalizes the settlement \nbetween the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida and the State of \nFlorida with regards to land takings claims.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I, too, thank Senator Gorton for his support to include \nthis provision in the final bill. Do I correctly understand that title \nVII of the\n\n[[Page S11270]]\n\nInterior appropriations bill will ratify the settlement agreement \nsigned by the State of Florida and the Miccosukee Tribe in 1996?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator is correct. I understand the Mack-Graham \namendment is in accordance with congressional findings that the \nsettlement agreement requires the consent of Congress in connection \nwith land transfers. I concur with my colleagues from Florida that the \nMiccosukee Settlement Act of 1997 expresses the desire of Congress to \nresolve the dispute between the State of Florida and the Miccosukee \nTribe.\n\n\n  Bureau of Land Management's Wild Horse and Burro Management Program\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I wish to engage in a colloquy with the \nchairman and ranking member of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee \nregarding funding for the Wild Horse and Burro Management Program \nwithin the Bureau of Land Management.\n  Mr. GORTON. Certainly.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I understand that the conferees to the Interior bill \nagreed to provide $15,866,000 for the wild horse and burro program for \nfiscal year 1998. That amounts to the same funding level for the \nprogram as was provided for fiscal year 1997.\n  Mr. GORTON. That is correct.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I want to congratulate my colleagues, Senator Gorton and \nSenator Byrd, for balancing the competing interests that are presented \nby the programs of the Interior bill, all of which have very vocal \nconstituencies. I would like to clarify that, if the Bureau of Land \nManagement believes that the funding provided in this bill is \ninsufficient to carry out the objectives of wild horse and burro \nmanagement, procedures for reprogramming must be followed by the \nAgency. Is it the managers' intention that funding not be reallocated \nabsent the involvement of the House and Senate Appropriations \nCommittees?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator is correct. If the BLM believes that it needs \nmore money at any time during fiscal year 1998 for the wild horse and \nburro program, or any other BLM program, there are reprogramming \nguidelines which must be followed.\n  Mr. BYRD. My colleague, Senator Gorton, is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to engage the chairman in a \ncolloquy. As the chairman knows, the Senate provided $100 million from \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund for the stateside matching grant \nprogram. I want to thank the chairman for recognizing the interests of \nover 30 Senators to revitalize this program. When the Land and Water \nConservation Fund was created, the State matching program was launched \nto assist States in the acquisition of parks and recreation facilities. \nThis is as it should be. The Land and Water Conservation Fund was \ncreated on the premise that revenues generated by the depletion of our \nNation's energy resource should be reinvested in the conservation of \nour resources through land acquisition for Federal, State and local \npriorities. The matching grants have helped finance over 37,500 park \nand recreation projects throughout the United States. These are \nprojects each one of us can identify in our home States that are now \nused as ballparks, hiking trails, river access, and greenspace. \nAlthough the conference report does not set aside funds for the State \nmatching program, the Interior Department may use part of the $700 \nmillion appropriation for this purpose. Is that correct?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes, that is correct. The conference report states that \nthe $700 million appropriation may be used for priority land \nacquisitions, land exchanges, and other activities consistent with the \nLand and Water conservation Fund Act of 1965. The original provisions \nof that act make it clear--that available resources can and should be \nredistributed to the American people through State and local \ndecisionmaking.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Am I correct then that under existing authority, the \nSecretary of the Interior may use these funds for the State matching \nprogram with the approval of the House and Senate Appropriations \nCommittee? As the chairman is aware, the National Conference of Mayors, \nthe Western Governors Association, and the National Association of \nGovernors urged Congress to appropriate funds for this program. You \nhave already stated your commitment to the budget agreement that \nallocated the $700 million for land acquisition. Do you agree that \nrevitalization of the State matching program could be a component of \nthe Interior Department project list sent to the Appropriations \nCommittees for use of this Land and Water Conservation Fund \nappropriation?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senate bill made it clear that the State matching \nprogram should be a priority for use of these funds. Although the \nconference report does not set aside funds for this program, numerous \nSenators expressed their concern about the future of the State program. \nThe need for this program is evident in requests from every State for \nFederal assistance to invest in State and local recreation resources.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the chairman for clarifying this point. I also \nwant to commend the chairman for his work on the entire Interior \nAppropriations bill for fiscal year 1998.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I also rise to explain section 120 of the Interior \nappropriations bill, which provides a right of action for owners of \nmining claims in the area in Denali National Park and Preserve known as \nthe Kantishna Mining District. This provision is designed to bring an \nend to nearly 20 years of uncertainty surrounding the future of these \nclaims, and it will ensure that the owners of the claims receive just \ncompensation in return for their interests.\n  The plan envisioned by this provision addresses the unique needs of \nboth sides of the debate over the future of mining at Denali National \nPark and Preserve. The American people, through the National Park \nService, will receive the title to lands within the Denali National \nPark and Preserve and near its crown jewel--Mount McKinley. With this \nprovision, we are assured that those lands will be held for the benefit \nof all Americans. In return, the owners of mining claims who \nparticipate in the program will be fairly compensated for the loss of \ntheir interest that has been uncompensated since mining was effectively \nterminated in the mining district many years ago.\n  At this time I wish to clarify my understanding of the provision. We \nhave provided a way for the Secretary of the Interior to take title to \nmining claims inside Denali National Park, following procedures \noutlined in the Declaration of Taking Act. We have also identified the \nmechanism by which the owners of the mining claims who choose to \nparticipate and transfer title to their claims are to be compensated \nfor the loss of their claims. The Congress has not, however, fixed the \ndates as of which the claims at issue were taken, as that is a factual \nquestion best left to the parties to determine or, if necessary, for \nresolution by the jury in proceedings under section 120. Moreover, it \nis our intention that any action that is brought either by the \nSecretary or affected claim owners be conducted in accordance with the \nsubstantive and procedural law of the Declaration of Taking Act, except \nwhere inconsistent with claim owners' rights under section 120, and the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, including the claimaint's right to \nhave a trial by jury.\n  Mr. GORTON. I yield back the remainder of my time and ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I yield myself so much of the 10 minutes \nI use as I had allocated to me in the unanimous-consent agreement to \nmake an explanation of why I intend to vote against the Interior \nappropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, the House voted on July 10 to cut off funding for the \nNational Endowment for the Arts for fiscal year 1998. It was expected \nthat if we would come to Washington to reduce the size of Government, \nwe would at least stop funding the kind of offensive art that has been \nthe subject of so many disputes that have attended the existence of the \nNational Endowment for the Arts.\n  Senator Helms and I offered an amendment to eliminate funding for the \nNEA, but it did not pass in the Senate. The Senate voted on September \n17\n\n[[Page S11271]]\n\nto increase the NEA's current $99.5 million budget to $100 million. \nThen on September 30, the conferees to the Interior appropriations bill \nprovided $98 million for the NEA for fiscal year 1998.\n  So the House voted zero; the Senate voted an increase to $100 \nmillion; and we have compromised on $98 million. That simply does not \nreflect the kind of discipline the American people expect at a time \nwhen we are taxed at the highest level in history. Americans spend more \nmoney in taxes now than ever before in the history of this country on a \npercentage basis. Congress should not be in the business of subsidizing \nspeech, of saying to one artist, ``Your art is good,'' and to another \nartist, by implication, since it did not qualify for the Federal \nfunding, ``Your art is bad.''\n  I do not believe Congress should be telling people what to like and \nwhat not to like. The genius of a democracy is not the values of the \ncentral Government imposed on the people. The genius of a democracy is \nthe values of the people imposed on the central Government.\n  Congress has no constitutional authority to create or fund the NEA, \nand in my judgment it is wrong for us to continue to fund it. Although \nfunding for the NEA is small in comparison to the overall budget, \nelimination of this agency sends the message that Congress is taking \nseriously its obligation to restrict the Federal Government's actions \nto the limited role envisioned by the Framers of the Constitution. \nNowhere does the Constitution grant any authority that could reasonably \nbe construed to include promotion of the arts.\n  This is a time when we have a high demand on our citizens for taxes, \nand for us to take money to promote the notion of art that someone in \nWashington thinks is great and to try to impose that on the people \nthrough the so-called ``governmental seal of approval'' is an \ninappropriate expenditure of public resources.\n  I am particularly disappointed because we have a situation where the \nCongress of the United States could have compromised at least far more \nsubstantially to protect the people and did not. The House at zero, the \nSenate at $100 million, the compromise at $98 million. That is simply \nan inappropriate way for us to conclude, and for that reason I intend \nto vote against the National Endowment for the Arts as part of this \nbill, and I will vote against this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The question is on \nagreeing to the conference report. The yeas and nays have been ordered. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Interior \nappropriations conference report. I do so with great respect for its \nmanagers, Senators Byrd and Gorton and in recognition of the difficult \njob which they have faced in bringing this bill together. They have \ndone a fine job juggling this contentious bill and I applaud them for \ntheir efforts.\n  Mr. President, I'd like to talk a minute about worthwhile Federal \ninvestments contained in this bill. First, let me talk about the \nNational Endowment for the Arts. This agency makes a real difference in \nMontana. It allows groups like Shakespeare in the Parks to go to over \n50 Montana towns, including Birney, a town of only 17.\n  Every year, the cast and supporters of Shakespeare in the Parks clear \na spot on Poker Jim Butte and put on a show. Citizens come from the \nnearby reservation, area ranches, and over the border from Wyoming to \nsee classic Shakespeare works. It's a real community gathering and \nballoons the size of Birney for the day. And make no mistake, it \nprobably wouldn't happen without NEA funding. This bill funds this \nvaluable program.\n  I have been a longtime advocate of preserving the quality of life we \nin Montana and in America enjoy. This Interior bill also goes a long \nway toward preserving some of the last, best places for our children. \nFirst, it dedicates $1.5 million to help finish the Gallatin II land \nexchange near Bozeman, MT. Next, it earmarks $1 million for purchasing \neasements and land in the Blackfoot Valley.\n  This area isn't far from where I grew up. I've hunted, fished, and \nhiked in those hills and I can tell you of its beauty. We can be proud \nthat because of this investment, our children will have the same access \nto this region that I did as a boy.\n  Mr. President, our rivers are under attack by a malady known as \nwhirling disease. This parasitic condition causes the deterioration of \nfish muscles, eventually causing the fish to die. It has been found in \nmany Blue Ribbon Montana rivers and is slowly spreading across the \nWest. Our critical fisheries are at risk and Western States are faced \nwith the potential loss of millions of dollars in tourism and fish \nagricultural revenues. Scientists at Montana State University's Fish \nTechnology Center are hard at work today identifying the causes of this \ndisease and potential cures.\n  It is cutting edge science and it is making a difference. This bill \nrecognizes that and funds this research at an appropriate level.\n  The Interior Appropriations bill also contains $699 million in \nincreased funding for the land and water conservation fund. This will \nhelp our Nation to acquire environmentally critical lands including a \nnumber of parcels that have been rated as a high priority in Montana. \nSpecifically, the bill provides $65 million in land and water \nconservation funding to acquire the New World Mine property next to \nYellowstone National Park.\n  If built, this mine would have harmed Yellowstone National Park. It \nwould have polluted waters flowing into the park and would have harmed \nthe park's wildlife herds. Montanans overwhelmingly opposed \nconstruction of this mine.\n  Last year, when the Clinton administration, local citizens, and the \nmining company reached an agreement that would keep the mine from being \nbuilt, the entire region breathed a sigh of relief.\n  And now it is time to finish that agreement.\n  The New World agreement provides that the Federal Government will \npurchase the property from the mining company, thus protecting \nYellowstone for our children. But its benefits don't stop there. The \nagreement also requires the mining company to spend $22.5 million to \nclean up historic mining pollution in the area. This not only improves \nthe environment, it also creates jobs for Montana. That is truly a win-\nwin solution.\n  As this bill moved through Congress, I worked hard to ensure that the \nmoney would be included to complete the New World agreement. And I am \nglad that has been done.\n  As part of the New World negotiations, we were able to further \nprotect the local economy in Montana by appropriating $12 million to \nrepair the area's main highway leading into Yellowstone National Park. \nCharles Kuralt called the Beartooth Highway the most beautiful road in \nAmerica. With the money contained in this bill, we will be able to \nmaintain that highway, enhance the local economy, and ensure that the \nAmerican people continue to have access to the treasures of Yellowstone \nNational Park.\n  The agreement reached between me, the administration, and House and \nSenate negotiators is truly in the best interests of Montana and of the \nNation. It protects Yellowstone, cleans up the environment, creates \njobs, and helps provide public access to our Nation's first national \npark.\n  However, the final version of the Interior appropriations bill also \ncontains a provision that we did not agree to. It requires the transfer \nof $10 million or more worth of coal to the State of Montana. This \nprovision was outside of the scope of the agreement that we negotiated \nwith the White House and the other Members of Congress.\n  I support the development of coal in eastern Montana. But I also \nunderstand that the White House objects to the inclusion of this coal \ntransfer. I expect that the White House will attempt to remove this \ncoal either through a full veto of the bill or through a line-item veto \nof the coal transfer.\n  Coal was not included in our negotiated agreement on New World \nbecause the White House objected to its inclusion and because of fears \nthat it could jeopardize the New World agreement. Now that Congress has \nincluded coal in the final bill, I hope that this issue does not stand \nin the way of our ability to complete the New World\n\n[[Page S11272]]\n\nagreement. It would be a crime to get this close to completing the \nagreement only to have it fall apart--jeopardizing Yellowstone, MT jobs \nand the Beartooth Highway as well.\n  So, Mr. President, we are nearing the conclusion of a long process. I \nhope that all parties will continue to work with me to complete the New \nWorld agreement as expeditiously as possible. And I urge my colleagues \nto join me in supporting this measure that will achieve the successful \nprotection of this national treasure.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as we approach the end of this session, \nthe Congress will be asked to consider the remaining 6 appropriations \nbills in relatively short order. Clearly, it is important to pass these \nannual spending bills in a timely fashion to preclude the inconvenience \nand expense of delaying unnecessarily essential government programs. \nHowever, in our haste to adjourn, it would be a disservice to the \nAmerican taxpayer to ignore the wasteful spending contained in these \nbills.\n  The Interior appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998 is filled with \nnumerous earmarks and set-asides for low-priority, unnecessary, and \nwasteful spending projects.\n  For example, this bill contains three directed land transfers which, \nto the best of my knowledge, have not been screened through the normal \nprocess at the General Services Administration. Two of these \nprovisions--dealing with the Bowden Fish Hatchery in West Virginia and \ncertain BLM lands in Nevada--specifically state that Federal property \nwill be given away without compensation. Certainly, one can \nlegitimately question whether these are good deals for the American \ntaxpayer, or just for those residing in the affected States.\n  Another provision of the bill, section 136, directs the Army to build \na bridge across the Bull River in Alaska. This bridge is to provide \naccess to the Golden Zone Mine for students at the School of Mineral \nEngineering at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. In addition, the \nArmy is directed to donate, free, two 6x6 vehicles for the use of the \nuniversity. The provision does not specify how much the Army is \nsupposed to pay for these large, all-terrain vehicles, nor does it \nprovide a cost estimate for the bridge. This single provision could \ncost the Army tens of millions of dollars.\n  The bill sets aside $800,000 for the World Forestry Center for \ncontinuing scientific research on land exchanges in the Umpqua River \nBasin region in Oregon.\n  I am disappointed that the conferees decided to earmark almost half \nof the $699 million provided for priority land acquisitions and \nexchanges in title V of this bill. The Senate bill contained earmarks \nto which certain Members of this body objected very strenuously, and \nthese earmarks are included in the conference agreement, together with \ntwo new earmarks.\n  I am concerned that the conferees also chose to delete the Senate \nprovision which outlined specific criteria for determining the highest \npriority acquisitions and exchanges that would be accomplished with \nthese additional dollars. I plan to pursue the establishment of \nobjective, consistent criteria so that the limited funds available for \nensuring the preservation of our natural resources are spent wisely.\n  Finally, the conferees have included the usual requirement that all \ncontracts awarded using funds provided in this bill should be expended \nin full compliance with all of the protectionist Buy America provisions \nthat Congress has enacted over the years. These laws and regulations \nare anti-free trade and cost American taxpayers millions of dollars \nevery year due to lack of free and fair competition of these contracts.\n  Now, let me turn to the report language.\n  Once again, the conferees have made clear that they endorse the \nlanguage contained in either the House or Senate report, unless they \nmention it in the conference report. This ensures that every earmark \nand set-aside that is not specifically addressed by the conferees \nremains in place.\n  Let's look at some of the earmarks in the conference report itself.\n  --$100,000 earmarked from land management funding for the Alaska Gold \nRush Centennial.\n  --$700,000 earmarked from wildland fire management funding for a type \nI hot-shot crew in Alaska, and $1.925 million for redevelopment of the \nobsolete fire center in Billings, MT.\n  --$400,000 of Fish and Wildlife Service funding for Alabama \nsturgeons.\n  --$400,000 for the Preble's Meadow jumping mouse.\n  --$300,000 for research on whirling disease.\n  --$450,000 in various accounts earmarked for the Lewis and Clark \nTrail, including technical assistance and office funding.\n  --$2 million for an Alaska mineral and geological data base, and \nanother $2 million for the Alaska minerals at risk project.\n  --$500,000 for a project at Purdue University in Indiana to improve \nfine hardwood trees.\n  I note with interest that, in order to fit all of the earmarks into \nthis bill, the conferees had to agree to account totals that exceed the \nlevels in either the Senate or House bills. In seven different \naccounts, the conferees agreed to funding which exceeded the amounts in \neither bill. Altogether, the conferees added $188 million more than the \nHouse had provided for these accounts, and $90.6 million more than the \nSenate had provided. Technically, these accounts are outside of the \nscope of the conference, a practice which I understand is not unheard \nof, but which is all the most disturbing when it is done merely to \naccommodate earmarks for these low-priority projects.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list of objectionable provisions be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n Objectionable Provisions in Conference Agreement on H.R. 2107, Fiscal \n                 Year 1998 Interior Appropriations Act\n\n                             Bill Language\n\n       Earmarks of construction funds, as follows: $500,000 for \n     the Rutherford B.

These are, I am sure, interesting projects, and important \nto the people who will be working on them. However, these earmarks--\nlike the hundreds of other earmarks too numerous to mention today--were \nadded to this conference agreement without benefit of the normal, \nmerit-based review process that would ensure that these are the highest \npriority uses for the funding provided in this bill. Absent that \nprocess, it is difficult to believe that there are not other more \npressing needs for Federal funds than these projects.\n  Mr. President, I want to stress that I have highlighted only those \nprojects that I find objectionable in this $13.8 billion measure. \nCertainly, the funding provided in this bill is essential for the \nessential operations of the Department of the Interior and the other \nFederal agencies charged with preservation and management of our lands \nand natural resources. It also contains funding that is vitally \nimportant to our native American tribes, particularly for Indian \neducation.\n  One provision that I am pleased to see included in this conference \nagreement is the $800 million environmental fund authorized in title IV \nof the bill. This provision establishes a National Parks and \nEnvironmental Improvement Fund financed from oil lease revenue awarded \nto the Federal Government by the U.S. Supreme Court this year. Interest \nfrom the fund, estimated to be $50 million annually, will be used to \nfinance high-priority capital improvement projects for national parks, \nprovide grants to States for park planning and acquisition, and fund \nmarine environmental research. Providing for these unmet capital needs \nwill ensure that our most coveted natural resources are preserved and \nprotected for future generations.\n  I must say, however, that I am sorry that the conferees included in \nthe language authorizing the Parks Improvement Fund a special setaside \nfor the State of Louisiana for oil and gas drainage in the West Delta \nfield. This provision was not included in the original Senate language, \nnor was any other special location-specific set-aside. I am \ndisappointed that even this provision was marred by special-interest \nlanguage.\n  Mr. President, I intend to support this bill because it provides new \nauthorities and much-needed funding for many programs. However, I will \nurge the President to consider exercising his line-item veto to \neliminate the low-priority, unnecessary, and wasteful spending that the \nCongress has added to this bill without benefit of a merit-based, \nprioritization review process.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference \nreport on the fiscal year 1998 Interior appropriations bill.\n  This conference report contains both authorization and appropriations \nfor the all-important Headwaters Forest acquisition in northern \nCalifornia.\n  Mr. President, California's ancient redwood forests are among our \nNation's most valued treasures, which is why the battle to preserve \nthem has reached a fever pitch in recent years.\n  The Headwaters Forest, nearly 3,000 acres located in Humboldt County, \nis one of the last remaining ancient redwood groves still in private \nhands. The land is owned by the Pacific Lumber Co., which is owned by \nthe Maxxam Corp.\n  Over the past decade there have been over a dozen attempts to save \nthis ancient redwood grove. All have failed.\n  Five attempts at Federal legislation failed.\n  Three attempts at State legislation failed.\n  Three statewide bond measures to raise funds to acquire the redwoods \nwere rejected by California voters.\n\n[[Page S11274]]\n\n  Two State legislative measures to reform California forestry \nregulations, one that would have restricted logging on private lands, \nand another that some said was not restrictive enough, both failed.\n  With the background, last year I was asked to see if I could \nfacilitate an agreement between the property owner and the State and \nFederal Governments. After more than 100 hours of intense negotiations, \nan agreement was reached for the State of California and the Federal \nGovernment to jointly purchase the Headwaters Forest from Pacific \nLumber Co.\n  Under the Headwaters agreement, the governments will purchase the \n3,000-acre Headwaters Forest and the 425-acre Elkhead Springs Grove, \nplus nearly 4,000 additional acres of adjacent land to serve as a \nbuffer. In all, approximately 7,500 acres would be acquired and \nprotected.\n  The price under the Headwaters agreement is $380 million, of which \nthe Federal Government will contribute $250 million and the State will \ncontribute $130 million.\n  Without the Federal funding to complete this agreement, there is no \nagreement. And if there is no agreement, the Pacific Lumber Co. will \nproceed with its huge taking lawsuit against the Federal Government for \nthe cost of any regulations that prevent the company from logging its \nold growth redwoods. In the end, the real losers will be the American \ntaxpayers who will possibly pay even more if Pacific Lumber wins its \ntaking lawsuit. That is why this conference report is so important. It \nprovides the $250 million federal share for Headwaters.\n  Specifically, this Headwaters package includes: Appropriation of $250 \nmillion for the Federal purchase of the Headwaters Forest; \nappropriation of $10 million for a payment to Humboldt County, CA; and \na prohibition on the expenditure of $250 million for 180 days from date \nof enactment.\n  This will allow a period of time for the authorizing committees to \nreview the issues associated with the Headwaters transaction and \nrecommend any changes in the authorization if necessary. The funding \nwill be available at the end of the 180 days.\n  The conference report also provides an authorization to purchase the \nHeadwaters Forest. While many believe the Department of the Interior \nhas more than sufficient authority to acquire the property, I know that \nothers disagree and have insisted on authorizing legislation. The \nauthorization is contained in this conference report.\n  Specifically, this bill authorizes the Headwaters acquisition with \nthe following conditions: The State of California provides $130 million \nfor its share of the costs, the State of California approves a \nsustained yield plan for the Pacific Lumber Co. property, a habitat \nconservation plan is approved and an incidental take permit is issued \nto Pacific Lumber, an appraisal of the lands to be acquired is done and \nreviewed by the Comptroller General, Pacific Lumber Co. dismisses its \nlawsuit against the Federal Government, a report is made to Congress on \napplicable HCP standards, Humboldt County is eligible for payment in \nlieu of taxes [PILT] payments for Federal lands acquired, 50 percent of \nmanagement costs in excess of $100,000 will come from non-Federal \nsources, development of a management plan, with consideration of \nmanagement by a trust, and expiration of the authorization on March 1, \n1999.\n  If asked, is this authorization exactly what I would have drafted, \nthe answer is no. But it gets the job done. And that is what is \nimportant.\n  I firmly believe that the Headwaters agreement is our last best hope \nto preserve these magnificent ancient redwoods. I urge my colleagues to \napprove this conference report.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to commend my colleagues for their \nwork on the conference report on the Interior appropriations bill for \nfiscal year 1998.\n  There are a few provisions of this bill that do not relate to matters \nof appropriations which would be more properly addressed by the \nauthorizing committees of the Senate, and thus, I feel compelled to \nregister concern that measures that are clearly substantive in nature--\nsuch as a comprehensive settlement of the claims of the Miccosukee \nTribe of Florida--do not belong in this or any other appropriations \nbill.\n  I raise this matter because in last year's Omnibus Appropriations \nAct, there was a provision that singled out one Indian tribal \ngovernment for disparate treatment--namely, to strip that tribe of \nbenefits and privileges that have been authorized for all other tribes \nin the country under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. I speak of the \nprovision affecting the Narragansett Tribe of Rhode Island.\n  Last year's provision came before this body over the strenuous and \nadamant objections of the Narragansett Tribe, without the benefit of \nany hearings, in the absence of any record that would serve to justify \nthis unusual action on the part of the Congress, and with no \nconsultation with the affected tribe.\n  The Narraganset Indian Tribe advises us that this provision has \nforever changed the lives of the members of that tribe, and has wrought \ndevastating effects on the potential for the development and growth of \nthe tribal economy.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to the day when the Congress acts to \nrectify the effects of last year's appropriations bill as it relates to \nthe Narragansett Tribe.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is my intention to vote in favor of the \nConference Report making appropriations for the Department of the \nInterior and related agencies, but I do so with some reservations. I \ncommend the appropriations conferees for negotiating a multitude of \nvery contentious issues, but I am particularly concerned with several \nanti-environmental provisions that remain in the report.\n  The Balanced Budget agreement provided $700 million above the \nPresident's request for the Land and Water Conservation Fund and I am \nvery pleased that the appropriators were able to honor that agreement. \nLand and water conservation funds and the matching State grant program \nhave been very important to Connecticut's ability to acquire land and \nenhance recreation areas and parks. Without this funding, local \ncommunities will continue without the assistance they so deserve to \nacquire open space and further develop recreational areas. \nUnfortunately, Senate language providing $100 million in grants to \nStates for land acquisition was not included in the conference report.\n  A portion of the Land and Water Conservation Fund will be used to \npurchase the Headwaters region in California and the New World Mine in \nMontana, subject to authorizing conditions. Although I recognize that \nthe State of Montana will feel some adverse economic repercussion from \nthe New World Mine purchase, I am dismayed that a proposal of $10 \nmillion to the State of Montana could be counted against the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund.\n  When the Senate initially debated the Interior appropriations bill, I \nwas pleased to join many of my colleagues in voting for an amendment to \neliminate funding for timber road purchaser credits for timber sales, \nbut the amendment failed by the narrowest of margins. There is growing \nsupport for the elimination of all taxpayer subsidies for Forest \nService logging road construction, and the House included language \nrestricting the amount of timber purchaser credits. Unfortunately, the \nconferees dropped the House provision.\n  Finally, the provision reducing the effectiveness of the law \npertaining to the export of Federal timber benefits a few large timber \ncompanies in the West. It was never suitably discussed by the \nauthorizing committee.\n  While these are a few of my concerns, there are many provisions in \nthe bill which merit my support. The Silvio Conte refuge and the \nStewart McKinney refuge in my State received much-needed funding for \nland acquisition. Congress authorized the expansion of the McKinney \nrefuge in 1990, and in the ensuing years, Federal appropriations have \nenabled the refuge to acquire 413 of the 454 acres available. Because \nthe budget for the National Park Service was sufficiently funded, Weir \nFarm, the only national park in Connecticut, should receive an increase \nin its operating budget to meet its rising visitor service demands.\n  Mr. President, as you know, I am a strong backer of the arts and I am \npleased that the appropriators provided\n\n[[Page S11275]]\n\n$98 million for the National Endowment of the Arts. The NEA was a \nmarked agency, identified by the other body for elimination. In fact, \nthe other body voted to zero out all funding and tried to extinguish \nthe NEA. But together with my colleagues in the Senate, another round \nof efforts to dismantle or eliminate the NEA was stopped. When the bill \ncame out of conference with the House, the NEA had been saved. As \nevidenced by a series of strong bipartisan votes in the Senate in favor \nof the NEA, my colleagues and I were able to save this national agency \nand preserve a Federal role for the arts.\n  During the Senate debate over NEA funding, I cosponsored with the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens from Alaska, \na Sense-of-the-Senate resolution asking the Congress to examine \nalternative sources of funding for the NEA. I believe it is time to \ngive the NEA a secure future and preserve a national cultural endowment \nfor generations to come. My hope is that the Congress will address this \nissue in the future.\n  And so it is for these reasons that I support the Interior \nappropriations conference report. I commend the conferees on a job well \ndone.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, this morning the Senate was once \nagain blocked from considering campaign finance reform legislation. As \na result, the ISTEA reauthorization bill has been delayed.\n  What happened today was clear. Intense opposition to any \nconsideration of campaign finance reform legislation has precluded \nconsideration of one of the most important measures to come before the \nSenate this year, the ISTEA reauthorization bill. ISTEA has been \nderailed for the time being because the majority party has refused to \nagree to even schedule a debate on campaign finance reform. They have \nrefused the will of a majority of the Senate to engage in a debate over \nan issue that goes to the very heart of our Government and our \ndemocratic process.\n  The 48 Senators who voted against cloture today did not vote to kill \nthe ISTEA reauthorization bill, as some have claimed. We did not cast \nour votes against cloture because we objected to this critically \nimportant highway and transit bill. Rather, we cast our votes against \nthe obstructionist techniques that have been used to block debate on \ncampaign finance reform legislation. We refused to cast our votes to \nend debate because there has, as of yet, not been debate over campaign \nfinance reform.\n  Several weeks ago, the Senate engaged in a mock debate over the \nissue. It was not a real debate. Not a single amendment was offered. \nNot a single vote was taken. It is the business of the Senate to \nconsider amendments and vote on issues and debate concerns of the \nAmerican people. None of that has happened. It was as undemocratic a \ndebate as I have yet seen in the Senate, and I know that the American \npeople expect more from us.\n  They are frustrated and disillusioned with the current election \nprocess. We need to get Americans back into the system and get them \ninvolved in decisions that affect their lives. We need campaign finance \nreform to restore the American people's faith in the electoral process. \nToo many people believe that the current system cuts them off from \ntheir Government.\n  A League of Women Voters study found that one of the top three \nreasons people do not vote at all is the belief that their vote will \nnot make a difference. We saw the result of that cynicism in 1994 when \njust 38 percent of all registered voters headed to the polls. We saw it \nagain in 1996 when only 49 percent of the voting age population turned \nout to vote, the lowest percentage of Americans to go to the polls in \n72 years.\n  According to a Gallup poll conducted early this month, 59 percent of \nAmericans believe that elections are generally for sale to the \ncandidate who can raise the most money. When you consider how much \nmoney it costs to finance a modern campaign, you can understand the \nfrustration. According to recent Federal Election Commission figures, \ncongressional candidates spent a total of $765.3 million in the 1996 \nelections, which was up 5.5 percent from\n\n[[Page S11276]]\n\nthe record-setting 1994 level of $725.2 million.\n  That figure does not include the huge amounts of so-called soft money \nspent by the political parties. In the first 6 months of the 1997-98 \nelection cycle, $35.4 million in soft money contributions to political \nparties was raised, outpacing the same period in the 1995-96 cycle.\n  I would take a step further to remind my colleagues that there is \neven softer money than that with the independent expenditures and, of \ncourse, individual, wealthy people just write themselves a check and \nsend themselves a thank you note, and that goes into the system. It is \nno wonder that Americans are clamoring for campaign finance reform. It \nis no wonder they believe their voices are overshadowed by special \ninterests with the ability to fill campaign coffers. It is \ndisheartening, Mr. President, that the majority has denied us the \nopportunity to debate this issue. It is more disheartening that they \nhave denied us the chance to debate legislation to help keep the doors \nof democracy open for all Americans. They have refused to enter into a \ndialog with the American people about the contorted rules which govern \ncampaigns, and about the urgent need to reform the system. They have \nrefused a most reasonable request from a majority of Senators--an \nagreement that the Senate will take up consideration of campaign \nfinance reform legislation, under normal procedures and normal rules, \nwith amendments and votes and deliberations on the issues, sometime \nnext year.\n\n  Mr. President, we did not cast our votes today against cloture \nbecause we are confident that the McCain-Feingold campaign finance \nreform legislation could be enacted into law, or because every one of \nus thinks it is the ``end-all, be-all'' of campaign finance reform \nlegislation, but because we believe it is imperative that the Senate \nengage in a real debate over this issue. We believe the Senate has a \nresponsibility to consider this issue. We believe that what has \nhappened here over the last several weeks as parliamentary blockage \nafter parliamentary blockade has been erected in front of efforts to \ndebate campaign finance reform has been an abrogation of the democratic \nprocess.\n  It is the business of the Senate to debate measures, offer up \namendments, and vote on issues, and the Senate has done none of the \nabove with respect to campaign finance reform.\n  It appears that, for the moment, the majority has succeeded in \nblocking debate over campaign finance reform legislation. I have no \ndoubt, however, that this issue will ultimately come up, if for no \nother reason than the American people are fed up and frustrated with \nthe current system.\n  It also appears that, for the moment, the majority has derailed \nconsideration of the ISTEA reauthorization bill. Let there be no \nillusions, however, that ISTEA is dead. It is not dead. This \nlegislation is too important to simply wither. It will be taken up for \nconsideration and we will enact legislation to provide our States and \ncommunities with at least the $180 billion in highway and transit funds \nthat this legislation promises.\n  I must admit that I have mixed feelings about delaying consideration \nof ISTEA. For my State of Illinois, and indeed, for the Nation's \ntransportation system, delay may give us an opportunity to rework some \nof the provisions of the current ISTEA reauthorization bill that \ninadequately treat those regions of the country that are essential to \nthe movement of our Nation's commerce.\n  For the most part, I believe the authors of this ISTEA \nreauthorization bill have done an excellent job crafting a bill that \nstrengthens many environmental provisions, allows States greater \nflexibility to support Amtrak, increases funding for a variety of \nsafety initiatives, increases funding for intelligent transportation \nsystems, and preserves the Department of Transportation's important DBE \nprogram. It is a bill that preserves many of the most important aspects \nof the original ISTEA, and that strengthens many other important \nprovisions, and I commend them for their hard work and diligent efforts \nin this regard.\n  This ISTEA reauthorization bill, however, fails to allocate funds in \na manner that adequately meets the needs of our Nation's intermodal \ntransportation system. It does not recognize and provide sufficient \nfunds to areas of the Nation that are responsible for the majority of \nour Nation's commercial traffic. It does not adequately address the \nrelationship between transportation and our economy.\n  In 1991, when Congress enacted ISTEA, we stated:\n\n       It is the policy of the United States to develop and \n     National Intermodal Transportation System that is \n     economically efficient and environmentally sound, provides \n     the foundation for the Nation to compete in the global \n     economy, and will move people and goods in an energy \n     efficient manner. . . . The National Intermodal \n     Transportation System must be the centerpiece of a national \n     investment commitment to create the new wealth of the Nation \n     for the 21st century.\n\n  That is what the authors of the original legislation stated as a \ngoal. If the next ISTEA does not follow this important declaration, if \nit does not provide adequate funding to maintain and improve the \ncorridors and areas that are responsible for our Nation's commerce, the \neffects of our negligence will ripple throughout every sector of our \neconomy.\n  My home State of Illinois serves as the transportation hub for our \nNation's commerce. It is home to the world's busiest airport and two of \nthe world's busiest rivers. It is where the Nation's freight railroads \ncome together to move goods from one side of the country to the other. \nIt is the center of the Nation's truck traffic. If you add up the value \nof all truck shipments in the Nation, Illinois' has by far the largest \nshare of any State. If you count the ton-miles of truck shipments that \npass through States on their way to their final destinations, Illinois \nhas by far the largest share of any State.\n  Illinois' roads, therefore, must bear the weight of the largest share \nof the Nation's commercial activity. The ISTEA reauthorization bill \ndoes not recognize the burden this responsibility places on our roads. \nAccording to a recent study from the Surface Transportation Policy \nProject, Illinois has the second worst urban roads in the country. The \nnewspapers all report headlines like: ``Illinois Roads in Shambles''; \n``Highways on road to ruin''; ``Illinois' roads among the worst in the \nNation''; ``Roads in dismal shape.''\n  These headlines are not surprising when you consider that Chicago is \nthe Nation's largest intermodal hub. It is literally the transportation \nnexus of the Nation. It is only appropriate, therefore, that the \nnational Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act recognize \nthis fact and adequately provide for the enormous needs that go along \nwith our status as the transportation hub of the Nation.\n  Mr. President, I am confident that when the Senate does take up the \nISTEA reauthorization bill, we will be able to work together on a \nsolution that provides funds to areas with the greatest needs. I am \nalso confident that the Senate will ultimately take up, consider, and \nenact serious campaign finance reform legislation. These issues are \nsimply too important for there to be any other outcome.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/28/senate-section/article/S11275-4", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11276-S11277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          THE IRAN MISSILE PROLIFERATION SANCTIONS ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am joining a large bipartisan group of \nSenators in cosponsoring S. 1311, the Iran Missile Proliferation \nSanctions Act of 1997.\n  This bill addresses one of the most pressing national security \nproblems we face--Iran's efforts to acquire technology that will enable \nit to build weapons of mass destruction. Certain Russian entities have \nengaged in some level of cooperation with Iran, and, while the Russian \nGovernment does not appear to be aware of these activities, the effect \nis the same--putting very dangerous technology in the hands of a regime \nthat intends to destabilize.\n  Mr. President, all Americans share the goal of stopping these \ntechnology transfers, but there are clear differences on how to achieve \nit. The administration has launched an aggressive diplomatic onslaught, \npressing the Russian Government to do all it can to halt these \nactivities. Vice President Gore and Secretary of State Albright are \nfully engaged in this effort. In addition, the President has appointed \ntop diplomat and former Ambassador\n\n[[Page S11277]]\n\nFrank Wisner as his personal envoy to the Russians on this issue. \nAmbassador Wisner has made several trips to Russia seeking a crackdown \non exports of sensitive technology and has scheduled another visit in \nseveral weeks.\n  I am hopeful this legislation will help the administration in its \nefforts to impress upon the Russians just how seriously the U.S. \nCongress takes this issue. Diplomacy clearly plays a critical role in \nthese situations, but so does the tough approach laid out in this bill. \nThe sanctions it provides will send a clear message to Russian entities \ninvolved in these technology exchanges that they will face heavy costs \nif they choose to proceed with business as usual.\n  The Senate version of the bill is not without its problems, however. \nSpecifically, the bill does not include a provision allowing the \nPresident to waive the bill's sanctions if he finds it necessary to do \nso on national security grounds. The House version of the legislation \ndoes include a waiver, and I am hopeful that any final bill will \ninclude one. The President needs this discretion in dealing with this \nextremely difficult situation.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to continuing to work with the \nadministration and Members on both sides of the aisle to address this \ncritical threat. It is imperative that we all work together in an \neffort to prevent Iran from acquiring such dangerous and destabilizing \ntechnology.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/28/senate-section/article/S11276-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I take the floor at this time for several \nreasons, one being that the Senate would be on the ISTEA bill if the \nregular order were called for at this point. No other legislation is \nbefore the Senate. Consequently, I feel it is appropriate to be talking \nabout the ISTEA bill.\n  Second, three of my colleagues, Senators Gramm of Texas, Baucus, and \nWarner, and I have introduced an amendment to the ISTEA bill and we \nhave explained that amendment and discussed it upon more than one \noccasion. As we have explained, our amendment provides that 90 percent \nof the funding will be distributed on the same basis as in the ISTEA \nbill before us, and that 10 percent would be allotted for discretionary \nas is the case in the ISTEA bill before us. In the amendment, which I \nhave coauthored with the other three Senators, I have provided that in \nthe 10 percent discretionary portion, $2.2 billion would be allotted to \nthe Appalachian regional highways--$2.2 billion of the $3.1 billion in \ndiscretionary funding. The overall amount of funds that would be \nprovided by our amendment would be $31 billion.\n  The basis of our amendment is that inasmuch as the 4.3-cent gas tax \nhas been ordered by the Senate to go into the trust fund as of October \n1 this year, that money should be spent for transportation purposes.\n  The American people, being under that impression, and having every \nright to be under that impression because of the legislation that was \npassed recently stating that the 4.3-cent gas tax would go into the \nhighway trust fund, that would be broken down as follows: 3.45 cents \nfor highway funding and 0.85 percent would be for mass transit.\n  There is a considerable amount of confusion, some of which I think \nhas been deliberately spread, some of which may be accidental. There is \nsome misinformation that has been spread about the amendment that my \nthree colleagues and I have sponsored. So I believe at this time, there \nshould be some discussion so as to clarify our amendment, what it \nreally will do, what it will not do, and also it is my opinion that we \nshould understand what the Chafee-Domenici amendment will do and what \nit will not do.\n  My colleagues who are coauthoring my amendment and I have taken the \nfloor on at least two occasions to describe our amendment. And most \nrecently, during the time of the last discussion of my amendment, Mr. \nChafee presented me with a copy of the Chafee-Domenici amendment.\n  However, I haven't heard any explanation of that amendment as yet. I \nthink we ought to have an explanation before we act on the bill, one \nway or another, and certainly before sine die adjournment. I hope that \nwe will get a 6-year highway bill, but with each passing day, the \nprospects of such are by that degree diminished.\n  But in any event, I would want Senators to have a better \nunderstanding of my amendment and certainly the amendment by Senators \nChafee and Domenici before we go out or before we leave this subject \nentirely.\n  I have called for Mr. Chafee and Mr. Domenici. I wasn't able to \ncontact Senator Domenici, but I was able to contact Senator Chafee. I \nwanted to let them know that I hoped we could use this time, when no \nother Senator is seeking recognition, to discuss this matter and \nparticularly to have some explanation of the Chafee-Domenici amendment.\n  Mr. Chafee was in the Intelligence Committee at the time and was busy \nthere, but he very kindly came to the floor and has indicated to me--he \nis here on the floor now and he can speak for himself--that on \ntomorrow, he will seek some time to discuss and explain the amendment \nthat he and Mr. Domenici have offered.\n  At this time then, Mr. President, I want to say a few words about the \nAppalachian Regional Highway System, because that figures very \nimportantly in the amendment which I have offered for printing, and I \nthink that the Members of the Senate ought to have a better \nunderstanding of the background of that particular subject matter. I \nalso want to direct some comments to today's edition of Congress Daily \nto an item therein which bears the headline: ``DOT Study, Domenici-\nChafee Letter Hit Gramm-Byrd Plan.''\n  There are some inaccuracies in that article, and I hope to address \nsome of my remarks to those inaccuracies. I also would be pleased if \nthe other three cosponsors of our amendment could come to the floor \nand, likewise, make some remarks.\n  All three offices have been alerted, and it is my understanding that \nthose Senators will come at such times as they can be free from other \nappointments. I apologize for, in a way, for\n\n[[Page S11278]]\n\ntaking the floor at this time. I know that the other cosponsors are \nvery busy, and I know also that Mr. Chafee and Mr. Domenici are busy, \nbut I shall proceed.\n  First of all, let me address my comments briefly to the Appalachian \nDevelopment Highway System.\n  Mr. President, when I was a member of the West Virginia House of \nDelegates 51 years ago, West Virginia had only 4 miles of divided four-\nlane highways--4 miles! Let me say that again. The entire State of West \nVirginia had only 4 miles of divided four-lane highways in 1947, the \nfirst year in which I served as a member of the West Virginia \nLegislature.\n  I can remember an article that appeared in the Saturday Evening Post \nby a Mr. Roul Tunley, on February 6, 1960. I was a Member of the U.S. \nSenate then. That was my second year in the U.S. Senate. In Mr. \nTunley's article, he said this: ``Its''--meaning West Virginia's--``Its \nhighway system is several decades behind that of its neighbors.'' I \nhaven't forgotten that quotation. I have been carrying it around up \nhere somewhere in my gray matter now for these 37 years.\n  I cannot forget it. It is etched into my memory. The Saturday Evening \nPost, a national publication, said, in an article by Roul Tunley, with \nreference to West Virginia's highway system: ``Its highway system is \nseveral decades behind that of its neighbors.''\n  Now, Mr. President, those words have, as I say, been etched into my \nmemory. They have been burned into my memory, virtually seared into my \nmemory.\n  I was a Member of the other body when the Interstate System was \ninaugurated. President Eisenhower was in his first term.\n  In any event, in 1956, which was during the 84th Congress, Congress \npassed legislation to provide for a gas tax to be placed into the \nhighway trust fund. I was a Member of Congress at that time.\n  In 1965, 9 years later, Congress passed the Appalachian Regional \nDevelopment Act. It provided for an Appalachian regional highway \nsystem. That was 1965. It was fiscal year 1966; in other words, \ncalendar year 1965, when Congress appropriated its first moneys toward \nthe Appalachian regional highway system--1965, fiscal year 1966. It has \nbeen a long time ago.\n  So, over 30 years ago, Congress enacted legislation saying to the \npeople of Appalachia, the people of the 13 States in Appalachia, that \nan Appalachian highway system was going to be established and funded.\n  West Virginia is the only one of the 13 States that is wholly within \nAppalachia. But contrary to the understanding of a good many people, I \nsuppose, West Virginia is not the only State in Appalachia. During \nthese intervening 32 years, West Virginia's Appalachian system has \nbecome 74 percent complete. For the entire Appalachian region, however, \nthe highway system is something like 78 or 79 percent complete.\n  Now, the Interstate System all over this country is 100 percent \ncomplete--virtually 100 percent. That is something like 43,000 miles, I \nbelieve.\n  But the Appalachian highway system remains, a good bit of it, yet to \nbe completed. West Virginia, as I say, is 74 percent complete. The \nother States in the Appalachian region are about 78 or 79 percent \ncomplete. So West Virginia is behind the region as a whole.\n  A great many people have criticized me over the years for acting in \nmy Appropriations Committee to get moneys for West Virginia's \nAppalachian corridors. But as chairman of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, I provided not only money for West Virginia's Appalachian \ncorridors but also funding for Appalachian corridors in all of the 13 \nStates of Appalachia. Nothing was said about that by my critics. But \nthat is neither here nor there at the moment. I just mention it in \npassing.\n  The point is that while the Interstate System has been completed all \nover this country, the Appalachian highway system is yet to be \ncompleted. The people in Appalachia have been promised for 31 years \nthat that system would be completed. It isn't completed yet. So they \nhave been living on a prayer and a promise, in considerable degree. \nAbout one-fourth of the system--one-fifth to one-fourth of the system--\nis not yet complete. And I think it is about time we fulfilled our \npromise that Congress made to the millions of people who live in \nAppalachia that their system at some point would be completed, too.\n  Now, Mr. President, I see on the floor my friend, Senator Gramm. If \nhe would like to speak for a moment----\n  Mr. GRAMM. No. Go ahead.\n  Mr. BYRD. He indicates that I should go ahead.\n  So, with the passage of the Appalachian Regional Development Act by \nCongress in 1965, the Appalachian Development Highway System got its \nstart by providing smaller regional centers in the Appalachian region \nwith four-lane expressway links to the Interstate Highway System. The \nnew corridors were devised to open areas with development potential \nwhere commerce and communication had previously been inhibited by a \nlack of access.\n  On June 17, 1965--32 years ago, and then some--the first Appalachian \ncorridor construction project in West Virginia was contracted for a \nsection of corridor D, U.S. 50 in Doddridge County that is between \nParkersburg, WV, and Clarksburg, WV.\n  The Appalachian corridor highway construction era really picked up \nsteam in West Virginia following the November 1968 approval by the \nvoters of a $350 million road bond, the proceeds of which were used to \nprovide the State's matching share for corridor construction.\n  During these years, for the most part, funding has been directed \ntoward all four uncompleted corridors, D, G, H and L. When the \nIntermodal Surface Transportation and Efficiency Act, ISTEA of 1991, \ncame along, I asked that language be included authorizing the \ncompletion of the Appalachian system. And that was done.\n  The Appalachian Development Highway System in West Virginia comprises \na total of 428.9 miles of roadway, completed or under construction, in \ndesign or in corridor location study phase.\n  In the case of the Appalachian system, I think it would be \ninformative to point out that Appalachia's rugged terrain has made \nroads very expensive to build. Early roads usually followed the \ntopography, that is, they followed streams, valleys and troughs between \nmountains, and the resulting highways were characterized by very low \ntravel speeds, long distances due to winding road patterns, often very \nunsafe road conditions, roads built to poor design standards, unsafe, \nshort-sight distances, and extremely high construction costs which \nfurther discouraged commercial and industrial development.\n  Now, I should say that miles constructed, alone, do not really \nmeasure the impact of a development highway system. Its success is \nmeasured in how it allows the region to be opened up for development \nand how it allows for the improvement of its inhabitants' condition.\n  A 1987 survey taken by the Appalachian Regional Commission showed \nthat between 1980 and 1986, 560,000 jobs were created in the \nAppalachian counties with a major highway, compared with 134,000 jobs \ncreated in those counties without a major highway. It is clear the \nhighways are the lifeline and the lifeblood of the Appalachian region. \nThe idea of a regional interconnected network of highways is as vital \ntoday as it was in 1965. It has the same purpose as the Appalachian \ncorridor system which was created 32 years ago.\n  The National Highway System was designed to provide an interconnected \nsystem of principal arterial routes which would serve major population \ncenters--water crossings, ports, airports, other intermodal facilities \nand travel destinations--while meeting national defense requirements \nand serving interstate and interregional travel.\n  A factor which is often overlooked in connection with Appalachian \nregional highways is the factor of safety. It is important that States \nin Appalachia have modern, safe roads. Current accident rates on the \nhighways in the area of corridor H --if I may take one example, in West \nVirginia--are above the Statewide average. The accident rates along in \nthat area are above the Statewide average. The State of West Virginia \nitself has accident rates which are above the national average. Because \nmuch of the State's road system was built in the 1930s, the existing \nroads reflect a happenstance response to topography rather than \nstrategic planning.\n\n[[Page S11279]]\n\n  Shortly, I will yield to Senator Gramm, but while I am on this \naspect, namely, the Appalachian highways in the ISTEA amendment which \nSenator Gramm, Senator Warner, Senator Baucus, and I have introduced, \nthe Appalachian regional highways, along with various trade corridors \nand bridge repairs constitute 10 percent of the total--the total being \n$31 billion; 10 percent being $3.1 billion--the 10 percent being \nprecisely the same breakdown as in the ISTEA bill that is before the \nSenate. In that bill, 90 percent goes to formula funding and 10 percent \nto discretionary to be determined by the Secretaries of Interior and \nTransportation.\n  So, I simply wanted to say for the record that Congress and the \nFederal Government promised to the people in the 13 States of \nAppalachia 32 years ago a highway system that would be modern, that \nwould be safe, and that would contribute to the commerce and \ncommunication, economy and upbuilding of that region and the well-being \nof its people, and that promise has not been fulfilled yet. I think it \nis about time we consider fulfilling the promise that Congress made to \nthe people of Appalachia. That is what I am attempting to do in this \namendment, to go a long way in halfway fulfilling the promise.\n  The promise--$2.2 billion, and $300 million in the bill itself--is \n$2.5 billion, and it is estimated that the total cost of completing the \nAppalachian regional system in the 13 States of Appalachia is something \nlike $6 billion to $7 billion, the Federal share, and the Federal share \nis 80 percent.\n  So in this particular ISTEA bill, which would be for the next 6 \nyears, of course, we would only take advantage of 5 years because the \nfirst year of the 6 years is already underway. It started on October 1 \nof this year and the gas tax just began going into the trust fund as of \nOctober 1 of this year. Consequently, we would not see that money until \nnext year, so it would be 5 years out of the 6-year life of this ISTEA \nbill that we would provide something like $2.5 billion for the \nAppalachian Regional Commission highways in 13 States--not just in West \nVirginia, 13 States. Hopefully, the next ISTEA bill, 6 years down the \nroad, would make further provision and perhaps at some point in the \nnot-too-distant future the people of Appalachia could look up and see \ntheir modern, safe, highway system completed, and the rest of the \ncountry, including the Congress, could look the people of Appalachia in \nthe eye and say, ``We kept our promise.''\n  That is what I am fighting for here today. That is why I hope to \nreach the ears and the hearts of my colleagues so that they have a \nbetter understanding of why this money is being provided in our \namendment.\n  Mr. President, there may be an attitude around, and at times I have \nsensed an attitude, to the effect that the people of Appalachia have no \nright to expect appropriations for an Appalachian Regional Commission \nsystem, and that moneys spent in one region of the country for highways \nis to the disadvantage of the voters, the taxpayers, the people of \nother regions of the country. There seems to be such an attitude in \neditorials and columns and so forth over the years; that what the \npeople in Appalachia are getting by way of highway funding is pork and \nthat they were actually getting more than their share. A lot could be \nsaid about that.\n  But this attitude that appropriations projects in one section of the \ncountry benefit only that section, they don't benefit the whole \ncountry, and, therefore, should not be made, and that it is unfair to \nfocus funds on a particular area, a particular State or a particular \nregion of a country, that that is an unwise, unfair and unjustified \nexpenditure of the taxpayers' money, I want to address that.\n  I want a Senator who is far better known than I am to address the \nmatter for me, and I will call on none other, therefore, than Daniel \nWebster. I refer to his reply to Hayne. He took 2 days to reply to \nSenator Hayne, namely on the 26th and 27th of January, 1830. Hayne had \nspoken on Thursday and Friday of the previous week. Webster had taken \n12 or 13 pages of notes, and over the weekend, he thought about his \nspeech, and then on the following Tuesday and Wednesday, the 26th and \n27th, he made his speech.\n  He addressed Senator Hayne, as well as Senator Hayne's statements and \ncharges, namely that the people of the whole country should not have to \npay for internal improvements that occur in a particular State.\n  So Webster took the floor on that occasion and spoke as follows. I \nhave gone back and read Webster's speech, and I will quote from it \nprecisely. This is Daniel Webster:\n\n       I look upon a road over the Alleghanies, a canal round the \n     falls of the Ohio, or a canal or railway from the Atlantic to \n     the Western waters, as being an object large and extensive \n     enough to be fairly said to be for the common benefit.\n\n  Let me say that again:\n\n       I look upon a road over the Alleghanies--\n\n  He is talking about my country when he talks about a road over the \nAlleghenies, the Allegheny Mountains. That is a part of Appalachia. \nAppalachia extends farther, a larger area than the Alleghenies. But \nWebster said:\n\n       I look upon a road over the Alleghanies, a canal round the \n     falls of the Ohio, or a canal or railway from the Atlantic to \n     the Western waters, as being an object large and extensive \n     enough to be fairly said to be for the common benefit. The \n     gentleman--\n\n  Meaning Mr. Hayne--\n\n     thinks otherwise, and this is the key to his construction of \n     the powers of the government. He may well ask what interest \n     has South Carolina in a canal in Ohio. On his system, it is \n     true, she has no interest. On that system, Ohio and Carolina \n     are different governments, and different countries; connected \n     here, it is true, by some slight and ill-defined bond of \n     union, but in all main respects separate and diverse. On that \n     system--\n\n  Mr. Hayne's system--\n\n       On that system, Carolina has no more interest in a canal in \n     Ohio than in Mexico. The gentleman, therefore, only follows \n     out his own principles; he does no more than arrive at the \n     natural conclusions of his own doctrines; he only announces \n     the true results of that creed which he has adopted himself, \n     and would persuade others to adopt, when he thus declares \n     that South Carolina has no interest in a public work in Ohio.\n\n  May I interpolate. The same thing has been said about the Appalachian \nHighway System, or at least implied. Why should people build highways \nacross those rugged mountains, those stream valleys that have been \nthere for millions of centuries? Why should the taxpayers of America \npay for highways to cut through those Allegheny Mountains? Why should \nwe have to do that?\n  Webster says, as he said to Hayne, ``the gentleman thinks \notherwise.''\n  And he said:\n\n       Sir, we narrow-minded people of New England--\n\n  Webster is referring to himself and others from that area--\n\n       Sir, we narrow-minded people of New England do not reason \n     thus. Our notion of things is entirely different. We look \n     upon the states, not as separated, but as united. We love to \n     dwell on that union, and on the mutual happiness which it \n     has so much promoted, and the common renown which it has \n     so greatly contributed to acquire. In our contemplation, \n     Carolina and Ohio are parts of the same country; states, \n     united under the same general government, having \n     interests, common, associated, intermingled.\n\n  ``Having interests, common, associated, intermingled.''\n\n       In whatever is within the proper sphere of the \n     constitutional power of this government, we look upon the \n     states as one.\n\n  That's Webster. ``. . . we look upon the States as one.'' Now listen \nto what he says to those who would criticize the expenditure of public \nmoneys for internal improvements. By the way, that was one of the main \nplanks in Henry Clay's ``American System,'' which advocated a national \ntariff, internal improvements, and a national bank. Clay was \ninstrumental in getting funds for the old Cumberland Road, the old \nnational road. The next time that the distinguished Presiding Officer \ndrives from Washington over to Wheeling, WV, he will travel on the old \nnational road, the old Cumberland Road.\n  It was begun in the year 1811, and that was the gate to the Midwest \nand the West. By 1838, Congress had appropriated a total of $3 \nmillion--think of it, $3 million--toward the construction of that old \nnational road, the old Cumberland Road. Begun in 1811, by 1838, \nCongress had appropriated the enormous sum of $3 million of the \nnational taxpayers' money for construction on the old Cumberland \nRoad. And Henry Clay had a great deal to do with the appropriations of \nthose funds for that old Cumberland Road.\n\n  Well, now continuing with Webster.\n\n[[Page S11280]]\n\n  I am sure that Henry Clay, if he were in the Senate, would make my \ncase for the Appalachian regional highway system.\n  Clay on one side--oh, I would like to have him here; that great \nSenator from Kentucky would make my case--and Webster would also make \nmy case, those two great Senators, because they saw the beauty and the \nwisdom and the justice and the fairness in committing the national \nresources to the development of a section of the country, not just one \nState. But even Webster would go so far as to say, if it were just in \none State he would not stand up here and ask why he should support it.\n  But let him speak for himself here.\n\n       We do not impose geographical limits to our patriotic \n     feeling or regard; we do not follow rivers and mountains, and \n     lines of latitude, to find boundaries, beyond which public \n     improvements do not benefit us. We who come here, as agents \n     and representatives of these narrow-minded and selfish men of \n     New England, consider ourselves as bound to regard with an \n     equal eye the good of the whole, in whatever is within our \n     powers of legislation. Sir, [he addressed the Chair, ``Sir''] \n     if a railroad or canal, beginning in South Carolina and \n     ending in South Carolina, appeared to me to be of national \n     importance and national magnitude, believing, as I do that \n     the power of government extends to the encouragement of works \n     to that description, if I were to stand up here and ask, What \n     interest has Massachusetts in a railroad in South Carolina? I \n     should not be willing to face my constituents.\n\n  Oh, I wish he were here to defend our case. We have been promised for \n32 years that this system would be completed. It is not completed yet. \nAnd when we seek justice in relation to the completion of that system, \nwe bear the slings and arrows of fortune and the criticism of those who \nwould say, ``Well, why? You're getting less money than those people in \nAppalachia. Those people in those 13 States of Appalachia are getting a \nlittle more than you are.'' What kind of statesmanship is that? That is \na shortsighted statesmanship in the eyes of Daniel Webster.\n\n       I should not be willing to face my constituents. These same \n     narrow-minded men would tell me, that they have sent me to \n     act for the whole country, and that one who possessed too \n     little comprehension, either of intellect or feeling, one who \n     has not large enough, both in mind and in heart, to embrace \n     the whole, was not fit to be intrusted with the interest of \n     any part.\n\n  Webster--talking about internal improvements.\n\n       Sir, I do not desire to enlarge the powers of the \n     government by unjustifiable construction, nor to exercise any \n     not within a fair interpretation. But when it is believed \n     that a power does exist, then it is, in my judgment, to be \n     exercised for the general benefit of the whole. So far as \n     respects the exercise of such a power, the States are one.\n\n  One; e pluribus unum!\n\n       It was the very object of the Constitution to create unity \n     of interests to the extent of the powers of the general \n     government. In war and peace we are one; in commerce, one; \n     because the authority of the general government reaches to \n     war and peace, and to the regulation of commerce. I have \n     never seen any more difficulty in erecting lighthouses on the \n     lakes, than on the ocean; in improving the harbors of inland \n     seas, than if they were within the ebb and flow of the tide; \n     or in removing obstructions in the vast streams of the West, \n     more than in any work to facilitate commerce on the Atlantic \n     coast. If there be any power for one, there is power also for \n     the other; and they are all and equally for the common good \n     of the country.\n  Now, Mr. President, I would like to yield, without losing my right to \nthe floor, to my colleague, Senator Gramm of Texas, for such comments \nas he may wish to make on this subject matter, and I ask unanimous \nconsent to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me first thank our dear colleague, Senator Byrd. I \nthink he is giving us a lesson on the history of funding for highways \nthat is long overdue and is not generally understood. I want to thank \nhim for giving me an opportunity to sort of butt in the middle of his \nspeech and really focus on something that I think is important and that \nreally is part of what the Senator is saying, but I think sort of sets \nit in perspective. I think maybe by explaining the big picture first \nand then having the Senator explain the portion of it related to \nAppalachia, I think people will have a clearer view of where we are.\n  Let me begin with Appalachia, then go to the debate about funding. I \nthen want to talk about an amendment that continues to be referred to \nin these ``Dear Colleague'' letters that are being mailed. Senator \nByrd, I was shocked. The letter today shows that our amendment is \nproducing 43 States who are losers, and you can imagine my \nconsternation when I discovered that my own State was one of the \nbiggest losers. So perhaps we are not doing as good a job as we thought \nif we could believe these numbers, but let me assure you, do not \nbelieve these numbers.\n  Now, let me first talk about the highway bill and how it works. How \nthe highway bill works, as it was reported out of committee to the \nSenate, 90 cents out of every $1 that is provided in the highway bill \ngoes to the States in a formula. The amendment that Senator Byrd and I \nhave written does not change that formula whatever. We took the \ncommittee's judgment--we are not trying to become the highway \nsubcommittee through our amendment--we took their formula and allocated \nthe money by exactly the same formula, only we allocated $31 billion \nmore in budget authority, $21 billion more in outlay than they \nallocated. I will explain where that came from in just a moment.\n  Under their bill, 10 percent goes to the overhead of the Department \nof Transportation and it funds the Appalachian Regional Highway System, \nit funds the emerging international trade corridors, it funds all of \nthe research projects that are part of the highway system, and it funds \nthe functioning of the Federal highway department and the \nadministrative expenses.\n  The amendment that I have offered with Senator Byrd does not change \nthe allocation of funds as far as 10 percent going to the Department \nand 90 percent going to the States. So when we add an additional $31 \nbillion in budget authority and $21 billion in outlays, not wanting our \namendment to substitute for the wisdom of the committee, we took \nexactly the same allocation, 90-10, for this new money that they had \nfor the old money.\n  Now, if you listen to the critics of our amendment, they have zeroed \nin on Senator Byrd and on the Appalachian region, and it's as if this \nis a whole new area of funding. Well, this is where I think the \nconfusion comes from, and I think I can straighten it out pretty \neasily.\n  First of all, President Clinton, when he submitted the highway bill, \nproposed $2.3 billion for these 13 States to be funded by the Secretary \nout of the 10 percent of the money set aside for the Secretary's use. \nHe proposed $2.3 billion, even though his bill authorized over $31 \nbillion less than our amendment will provide. So remember this number. \nThe President proposed $2.3 billion for the 13 States of Appalachia to \ncomplete their system, which is over 75 percent already complete, while \nproviding $31 billion less money than we are providing. Only our \namendment provides only $2.2 billion.\n  So if it is the purpose of the Senator from West Virginia to somehow \nexploit his colleagues, I would have to say that he is doing a very \npoor job of it, because the reality is that our amendment provides an \nadditional $2.2 billion for Appalachia, which is less money than the \nPresident requested. He requested $2.3 billion when he was spending $31 \nbillion overall less than we are spending. The reality is that our \namendment contains less money for Appalachia than the President \nrequested.\n  Second, the House, when they wrote a 3-year bill in committee, \nprovided $1.05 billion for Appalachia; but that's only for 3 years. In \nfact, if you run it out to 6 years, they would have provided \napproximately $2.5 billion for these 13 States and for this funding of \nhighways within those 13 States, which was in the President's budget \nand which has been in every highway bill that we have funded in the \nrecent past.\n  So the reality is that, while people don't want to debate the real \nissue here, which is spending the highway trust fund, we have added \nless money to Appalachia, using the formula of the committee, than the \nPresident requested when he was spending $31 billion less. We have \nrequested less money for these 13 States than the House provided in its \nbill.\n  So I hope this puts that issue to bed. When the President requested \nmore, when the House provided more, when this has been an ongoing line \nitem in the highway bill for many years, and when it was a line item in \nthe original bill, and when we took the committee's\n\n[[Page S11281]]\n\noverall allocation of funds, the point I am making is that the \nallocation of funds here is basically in line with what the President \nrequested and what the House has done. The Senator has explained to us \nthat the highway project in these 13 States is 75 percent complete. \nSurely, no one believes they should be left uncompleted. But the \nSenator is roughly asking for the same amount of money that was \nprovided by the President, that was provided by the House, even though \nthe President was providing $31 billion less overall.\n  Now, having, I hope, put that to bed, to anybody who wants to debate \nthe issue I would have to say--and I want to be sure that I am always \nkind to our colleagues--that it is frustrating to me to try to debate \nan issue when we are having so much trouble getting people to focus in \non that issue.\n  I want to give you an example. There was a ``Dear Colleague'' letter \nsent today with this headline: ``Final Analysis Complete; 43 States \nLose Under Byrd-Gramm.'' As I said, unfortunately, my State is one of \nthe biggest losers in the country, losing $28 million. Now, what are we \nlosing relative to? Well, what we are losing relative to is the so-\ncalled Domenici-Chafee amendment, which I have here, and what they are \nsaying is that if you provided $21 billion more in outlays, and if you \ndon't fund the overhead of the Department of Transportation, then you \nwould have additional funds to provide to States. But guess what? They \ndon't provide an additional penny. They put out all these tables about \nwhat Domenici-Chafee would provide. But when you take their amendment \nand turn to the section entitled ``additional funding,'' and you turn \nto page 2, they have the amounts. The amounts referred to in paragraph \n1 are as follows: ``(a) for fiscal year 1999, zero; for fiscal year \n2000, zero; for fiscal year 2001, zero; for fiscal year 2002, zero; for \nfiscal year 2003, zero.''\n\n  So their amendment provides no additional budget authority for \nhighways whatsoever. In fact, their amendment is convoluted. They go on \nand say: ``In general, there shall be available from the highway trust \nfund such sums as are provided in paragraph 2.'' But paragraph 2, as I \njust read you, says zero for 1999, zero for 2000, zero for 2001, zero \nfor 2002, and zero for 2003. So they will provide such sums as in \nparagraph 2, but there aren't any sums in paragraph 2.\n  If you read the fine print in their letter--you see, there is fine \nprint here that says--and, of course, Senator Byrd would have picked it \nup because he picks up fine print. I am not sure how many of our \ncolleagues did. Here is what it says, in short: ``If the Appropriations \nCommittee funds highway programs at $29 billion or greater. . .''--it \nalso should say: ``and if we authorize such moneys to be spent in the \nfuture.'' But it does not say that. Then if you should allocate it the \nway they would, not as Senator Chafee allocated it in his own \ncommittee, with the 90-10 split, you would have a different allocation.\n  But the point I want people to understand is that all these charts \nare being sent out about how money would be spent. When you read their \namendment, they are not spending any money. They are not providing one \nadditional penny for highway construction; yet, they keep putting out \ntables showing what would be provided if someone at a later time and a \nlater place decided to provide it.\n  What Senator Chafee and Senator Domenici are really saying is: Don't \nauthorize highway spending in the highway bill. Don't let the trust \nfund, which is collected as a tax on gasoline, be authorized to be \nspent on highways. Wait and let a budget be written in the future, and \nthen if at that time it is decided to spend the money for the purpose \nthat the tax was collected, then we will spend the money.\n  Senator Byrd and I disagree. We wrote a highway bill 6 years ago. \nHave we ever changed the authorization in 6 years under that highway \nbill? The answer is no. We have had to live with it every single day. \nWe are now trying to write a highway bill for the next 6 years, and \nSenator Chafee and Senator Domenici say don't write a highway bill for \nthe next 6 years. Leave funding at the level that was set out in the \nbill that would let the highway trust fund rise to $90 billion by the \nend of the highway bill, and then in the future, if we decide that we \nought to quit misleading the American people in telling them that these \ntaxes that are paid at the pump go to build highways, then in the \nfuture in some budget resolution we could provide that the money would \nbe spent.\n  But so that no one misunderstands, not one penny of additional \nhighway funds are provided in the so-called Chafee-Domenici amendment. \nThere is only one amendment that takes the highway trust fund that \npeople pay into when they go and fill up their car and fill up their \ntruck and they shell out their hard-earned money on gasoline taxes, and \nwe say to them, well, now, look, it's for your own good. We are \nspending it on highways, so this is not a tax. It is a user fee.\n  Senator Chafee and Senator Domenici say, well, look, we don't want to \ndo that. We want to build it up in the trust fund so that it can be \nspent on other things. In fact, as Senator Chafee said in a speech in \nthe Senate Chamber on October 9, he ``cannot support the proposition of \nspending the 4.3-cent gasoline tax.''\n  That is a perfectly legitimate position. He cannot support it. But \nSenator Byrd and I can support it, and we do support it. What our \namendment does is it starts telling the American people the truth. And \nthat truth is they are paying this gasoline tax. We claim it is going \ninto the trust fund to build roads, and yet we have before us a highway \nbill that doesn't spend a penny of that 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax on \ngasoline so that it can go to other uses.\n  Senator Byrd and I say we collect the money on gasoline, on the tax \nat the pump, and we put it into the trust fund. We have been telling \npeople that was for roads, and our amendment simply does what we say we \nare going to do. That is, we are going to spend it on roads.\n  So if you believe that the highway trust fund ought to be spent on \nother things, you should vote against our amendment. You ought to \nsupport people who are opposing it. But if you believe that the highway \ntrust fund, which is funded with a gasoline tax, ought to be used to \nbuild roads, which is what we claim we are doing, if you think it is \nfundamentally wrong, some might say dishonest, to build up a surplus of \n$90 billion in a highway account so the money can be spent for other \nthings, then there is only one amendment that is going to fix it. That \namendment is the amendment that I am offering with Senator Byrd.\n  So in regard to our amendment, there have been a handful of \ncriticisms, and I want to respond to one of them and try to do it \nbriefly so I can get out of the way and let Senator Byrd go back to \ngiving us a history lesson on highway construction and about the \nfairness of the underlying permanent law related to highway \nconstruction.\n  Let me outline what these criticisms are. First of all, I want to \nremind my colleagues that 83 Members of the Senate voted on a \nresolution I offered as part of the budget resolution that called on us \nto put the 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline, which had been going to \ngeneral revenues, in the highway trust fund and spend it for highways. \nMr. President, 83 Members of the Senate voted for that resolution. \nThen, in the tax bill that was passed this year, we took the 4.3-cent-\na-gallon tax on gasoline and put it where every other permanent tax on \ngasoline since we have had a trust fund has gone. We put it into the \nhighway trust fund to spend it on highways.\n  Then when the highway bill came out of committee, while we had put \n4.3 cents per gallon into the trust fund, about $7.2 billion a year \nwhen you count mass transit and highways, not one penny of it had been \nspent on highways. Not one penny of it. Under the original bill, the \nsurplus would have built up to $90 billion, which means in our unified \nbudget all that money would have been spent on something else.\n\n  Now, Senator Byrd and I have tried to have a debate on the substance \nof the issue, and the substance of the issue is we believe that the \ntrust fund made up of taxes on gasoline ought to go for the purpose \nthat we tell the American people it is going for, and that is to build \nroads. We have offered an amendment to do that. Our amendment is as \nstraightforward as it can be. It allocates the money on the same \nformula the committee allocates the money going to the States. It has \nthe same amount of money being allocated\n\n[[Page S11282]]\n\nby the Secretary. And it is straightforward in terms of what it funds.\n  Now, the two criticisms that have been leveled are, No. 1, that \nsomehow this is unfair because of funding for highways under a program \nwhich has existed since--when was the Appalachian highway program \nadopted?\n  Mr. BYRD. 1965.\n  Mr. GRAMM. 1965?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. That somehow because it provides funds for a program that \nbecame law in 1965, it is unfair. Well, as I have mentioned before, our \namendment does provide $2.2 billion for that purpose. It also provides \nmoney to seven donor States that, because of a quirk in the formula, \nended up actually getting less under the committee bill, and with the \nsupport of the chairman of the subcommittee and the ranking member we \nalso fix that.\n  And finally, rather than just claiming we were doing something for \ninternational trade corridors, we actually provided money for it. The \nold bill claimed it spent $125 million per year for international trade \ncorridors, but Senator Byrd saw in the fine print that it did not \nreally provide any money. It just claimed to provide money. \nUnfortunately, that is something that is done.\n  Our bill does not claim to provide money it does not provide. It is \ninteresting that this criticism would be made. But the point is in the \nfirst attack on the 13 States of Appalachia, our amendment provides \n$2.2 billion of funding. The President requested $2.3 billion. The \nHouse passed a level of $2.5 billion. I find it very hard to justify it \nis a criticism that we are providing roughly the money that was \nrequested by the President when his bill contained $31 billion less and \nroughly the same amount of money provided by the House.\n  The final criticism is that the opponents of the bill keep putting \nout tables about what their amendment is estimated to do in fiscal year \n2000.\n  First of all, their amendment does not do anything in the year 2000, \nnor does it do anything in any other year during the highway bill \nbecause, as I noted earlier, on page 2 of their bill where, under the \ntitle of additional funding, they say their additional funding is zero \nfor the year 2000, for 1999, 2001, 2002 and 2003. And why they picked \nthe year 2000 I don't know. The point is there is only one amendment \nthat provides more money for highway construction in the year 2000. \nThere is only one amendment that provides more for 1999, 2001, 2002, \nand 2003, and that is the Byrd-Gramm amendment.\n  Now I just have to say that I get frustrated with everybody looking \nat these tables and Senator Byrd and I having to spend our time \nexplaining to them where these numbers came from. These numbers are \nbasically made up, that's where they came from. There is nothing in \ntheir amendment that provides any additional money. What these numbers \nare based on is that, if we decided in the year 2000 to provide more \nmoney, that you could make up a table and show how we might divide it. \nI suggested to Senator Byrd that maybe we might want to make up a table \nthat said if you took the whole $1.6 trillion that the Government \nspends and we decided to spend it on highways, we might show how much \nin highway funding our Presiding Officer's State would get.\n  But would it make any difference? The point is, it would make \nabsolutely no difference, because we are not proposing to take all the \nmoney spent by the Federal Government and spend it just on highways. \nBut it would be as legitimate as the table where you are making up \nfigures about what you may do in the future. Listen, when you are \ntalking about the future and you are not committing to it in the \npresent, you can make up any tables you want to make up.\n  But the point is, we are not making up numbers. We have written an \namendment that will require that we have a full authorization of the \n4.3-cent-per-gallon tax on gasoline, so that when people go in and fill \nup their tanks and they look up there and they see this gasoline tax \nthey are paying, they will know that the 4.3-cent-per-gallon tax has \nbeen put into the trust fund and that we are going to spend it on roads \nand that when they are paying that tax, they are allocating that money \nto build roads, and that is what we told them we were going to do.\n  So, I don't know if we will have any more of these tables. This is \nthe second set of tables we have had. I don't quite know where the \nnumbers come from and why there are these differences from the last \ntable. But I can assure you that if I were going to do something, the \nlast thing I would do would be to cheat my State. I am not in the habit \nof doing that, and I think if people look at this, they would find that \nwe are not in the habit of doing that as individual Members. So I think \nit just doesn't make sense on the surface.\n  So, I thank Senator Byrd, and I hope my colleagues now will focus on \nthe fact that our funding for Appalachia is roughly what the House did \nand what the President requested with less money; that we are providing \n$31 billion more of budget authority by spending the gasoline tax on \nroads--something we promised to do and have not done--we are spending \n$31 billion more on roads in terms of authorizing the expenditures so \nwe can compete each year for that money.\n  There is no other amendment that provides a penny. So, if you want to \ntake a promise that someday in the future we might get around to \nfunding roads, if that is good enough, then you might not be for our \namendment. But if you really believe we ought to spend highway trust \nfunds on roads, there is only one amendment you are going to get a \nchance to vote for that will spend a penny more on highways, and that \nis the Byrd-Gramm amendment.\n  So, I thank my colleague. I am very proud to cosponsor this amendment \nwith him. I think, if anybody will look at the merits, that this is a \ntruth-in-government amendment and there is nothing fake about it. There \nis no hidden agenda in it. It is simply an amendment that takes the \nformula written by the committee for allocating funds for the States \nand allocating funds between the discretionary fund of the Secretary \nand the allocation of funds to the States. Those are formulas that we \ndidn't write; we simply took them from the committee.\n  Our amendment is very straightforward. I think if people will look at \nit, what it is trying to do, and will debate it on its merits, it will \ncome down to an honorable choice between two legitimate positions. One \nposition says let's continue to take money out of the highway trust \nfund and spend it on other things. That is one position. The other \nposition is let's spend the highway trust fund on highways. That is the \nposition Senator Byrd and I take. I believe it is the position that the \nmajority of Members take, and I would like to get the vote and the \ndebate focused around the choice. I think we want to do that, in all \nfairness to our opponents, because we think we will win. If it's on \nsomething else, we don't know what will happen. But I think, if it's \nthis clear choice, the people are going to be with us.\n\n  I thank Senator Byrd for yielding. I appreciate it very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to have yielded \nto the distinguished Senator, and I just as deeply appreciate his \nstatement. I hope the Senators will read it. It is needed, I think, to \ndisabuse Senators from what they are being told by Congress Daily and \nby letters and tables that are being distributed. I don't accuse anyone \nof acting in bad faith. I am in no position to do that. But certainly \nmisstatements should be corrected, and I hope will be, beyond what Mr. \nGramm has already said.\n  Mr. President, Senator Chafee earlier said--he told me that we would, \non tomorrow, get the floor and speak with reference to the Chafee-\nDomenici amendment. I have been insisting to them that their amendment \nbe explained. The amendment which I offered on behalf of myself and my \nthree distinguished colleagues was explained, and we were criticized \nbecause we had mentioned, on the 9th, I believe, of October, before the \nrecess, that we were going to offer such an amendment, but we didn't \nactually have it ready by then so a considerable amount of discussion \nwent forth as to why we didn't have it, to the effect that Senators \ncouldn't comment on what they couldn't see.\n  But on that same day I believe Senator Domenici indicated that he was \ngoing to offer an amendment, and, of course, we didn't get to see that \nuntil\n\n[[Page S11283]]\n\none day this week. So we haven't heard an explanation of it yet. I want \nan explanation of it. Just as we attempted to do our best explaining to \nour colleagues and to the American public what our amendment does, I \nthink the American people ought to have an explanation right here on \nthis floor as to what the Chafee-Domenici amendment does. That will \ngive us a chance, perhaps, to refute some of the misinformation that is \nbeing bandied about.\n  As I say, I don't ascribe to anyone any intentions to go with \nmisinformation, but I think the public and our colleagues have a right \nto expect us to clear up some of the confusion. So, for now I'll not \nsay any more along that line because, as I say, Mr. Chafee has \nindicated we'll talk some tomorrow, and he indicated that he would \nyield to me for some comments at that time. I hope that Mr. Baucus and \nMr. Warner will also have a chance to comment at that time, \nparticularly with reference to the statement by Congress Daily of \ntoday.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent to speak \nfor up to 45 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/28/senate-section/article/S11277-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11283]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. DeWINE.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a bill I have \nintroduced. That bill is called the Ricky Ray Hemophilia Relief Fund \nAct. I introduced this legislation in the last Congress and again this \nyear. I introduced it along with my distinguished colleague from \nFlorida, Senator Bob Graham. A House companion measure has been \nintroduced by our friend, Congressman Porter Goss.\n  Mr. President, the purpose of this bill is to deal with the terrible \ntragedy within the hemophilia community that was brought about by the \nHIV contamination of the blood supply and blood products during the \n1980's. A number of Americans suffered terrible harm because they \nrelied on the Federal Government to protect the blood supply.\n  Mr. President, those of us who are backing this legislation believe \nthat the Federal Government has a moral duty to help these Americans.\n  Let me first talk about the role of the Government in this tragedy.\n  The Ricky Ray Hemophilia Relief Fund Act of 1997 recognizes that the \nFederal Government has a responsibility for protecting the safety of \nthe blood supply in this country and a responsibility for regulating \nblood products.\n  Mr. President, during the 1980's, our Government failed to meet this \nobligation to the hemophilia community of this country. The Federal \nGovernment failed in its obligation. People affected by hemophilia--\nchildren, adults, and the family members who cared for them--had a \nright to expect the Nation's blood supply system to work. That system \nrelies upon many organizations, both public and private. It relies on \nmany organizations to collect and process, distribute, monitor, and \nregulate the blood supply and blood products.\n\n  Unquestionably, the Federal Government bears the greatest and the \nultimate responsibility for blood safety through its surveillance, \nresearch, and regulation functions. That is why, Mr. President, in 1973 \nthe Assistant Secretary for Health announced the national--national--\nblood policy which then became, according to a report by the Office of \nTechnology Assessment, ``The focal point around which blood banking \npolicy has evolved over the last decade.''\n  Mr. President, this is the U.S. Government's national blood policy--\nthe U.S. Government's national blood policy--a policy the U.S. \nGovernment undertook, a policy on which the American people should have \nbeen able to rely. The very fact that we have a national policy \nindicates a level of responsibility, a level of importance and \ninvolvement that we really don't see in most other areas of consumer \nprotection. This policy is what gives the Federal Government a unique \nresponsibility for the blood supply in this country.\n  Mr. President, these functions--surveillance, regulation, and \nresearch on blood--are carried out through the Public Health Service. \nThe Centers for Disease Control hold responsibility for surveillance of \npotential threats to blood safety. The National Institutes of Health \nare responsible for biomedical research on emerging threats and \nimproved technologies for prevention. Mr. President, these two agencies \nwork in conjunction with the Food and Drug Administration, the FDA, \nwhich through its regulatory authority and powers of inspection, \nproduct recall, guidelines, and fines, holds primary responsibility for \nthe safety of the blood supply and blood products under the Food, Drug \nand Cosmetic Act. Together, Mr. President, these agencies form the \nbackbone of our Nation's blood safety system.\n  Mr. President, the awful truth is that this system failed. It failed \nto protect people with hemophilia or their families from deadly \ndisease. That is why we have introduced this bill. Members of the \nSenate don't have to just take my word for it nor just the word of the \nfamilies in the hemophilia community. Rather, in 1993, Mr. President, \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services opened an investigation, an \ninvestigation into the events leading to the transmission of HIV to \nindividuals with hemophilia.\n  One of the key questions that was asked and that they were asked to \naddress at the time was this: Did the Government provide an adequate \nand timely response to the warning signs of the 1980's, the warning \nsigns of HIV as it related to the blood supply in this country?\n  The Secretary contracted with the Institute of Medicine, IOM, a \nprivate nonprofit organization that provides health policy advice under \na congressional charter granted to the National Academy of Sciences. \nMr. President, after 18 months of investigation, the IOM published its \nreport in 1995. This report was entitled ``HIV and the Blood Supply: An \nAnalysis of Crisis Decisionmaking.'' Mr. President, the report found \ninadequacies in the Government's effort. It found ``a failure of \nleadership'' that led to the HIV infection of more than one-half of the \nNation's hemophilia population. This IOM report and its panel of \nexperts from across the country found that the transmission of the HIV \nvirus and AIDS revealed a weakness in the Federal Government's system \nfor ensuring the safety of the Nation's blood supply.\n\n  The Institute of Medicine was specifically not charged with laying \nblame, but in its final report it was highly critical of the Government \nagencies responsible for protecting the safety of the blood system in \nthis country. It identified several areas where the Federal Government \nspecifically failed to curtail the impact of HIV. Mr. President, the \nIOM found that the Government ``consistently adopted the least \naggressive options for slowing the spread of HIV within the hemophilia \ncommunity.'' Let me repeat: This report, this official report, found \nthat the Government ``consistently adopted the least aggressive options \nfor slowing the spread of HIV within the hemophilia community.''\n  Time after time when decisions were made in the face of the unfolding \nHIV crisis, tragically, the wrong decisions were made about the blood \nsupply. When faced with decisions about deferring donors or recalling \nproducts or testing for other known diseases, we know now that the \nGovernment officials made the wrong decisions.\n  Let me talk about these decisions and about what happened. First, the \nFederal Government failed to take adequate steps to screen blood \ndonors. Knowing that AIDS was transmitted through blood, the Government \ndid not\n\n[[Page S11284]]\n\ndo all it could, did not do all it could have done to screen blood \ndonors.\n  In January 1983 experts at the Centers for Disease Control met with \nrepresentatives from the other Government agencies to consider \navailable data on the spread of HIV and to develop at that time \nstrategies for prevention. Those experts in the Centers for Disease \nControl concluded that AIDS was transmitted by sexual contact and \nthrough blood, and they made recommendations for enhanced screening of \nblood donors, including the use of a surrogate hepatitis test to screen \nfor potentially HIV-infected blood.\n  In other words, Mr. President, in January 1983 the Government knew \nthat AIDS was transmitted through blood. Now, by that time 12 persons \nwith hemophilia had already been diagnosed with HIV and some 10 deaths \nhad already occurred.\n  Let's go back now to that specific meeting in January 1983 that I \njust referenced. At that meeting, experts from the Centers for Disease \nControl estimated that intensified screening of blood donors would \neliminate over 75 percent of AIDS-infected donors from the blood pool, \nand they estimated that requiring a surrogate blood screening test \nwould detect 90 percent of donors with AIDS. Tragically, however, Mr. \nPresident, both of these recommendations were rejected by the other \nGovernment officials at this meeting. These two very specific \nrecommendations were rejected again later that year in December 1983, \nrejected by the Food and Drug Administration's Blood Products Advisory \nCommittee. These recommendations were never implemented.\n  Let me talk about the second fact. Second, Mr. President, the Federal \nGovernment failed to recall potentially contaminated blood and blood \nproducts. In two separate instances, the FDA missed opportunities to \nget potentially dangerous products off the shelf. In the first \ninstance, knowing that a blood product might have been made with AIDS-\ntainted blood, the Government failed to automatically recall that \nproduct. In January 1983, the FDA decided not to automatically recall \nhemophilia clotting-factor products linked to donors suspected of \nhaving AIDS supposedly because of concerns about the impact on the \navailability of clotting factor and its cost.\n  In July 1983, FDA failed to act. By the following year, 1984, 83 \ncases of persons with hemophilia were diagnosed with HIV, and 81 deaths \nhad, by that point in time, occurred.\n  In the second instance, Mr. President, knowing that there was now a \nway to make the blood products safe, the Government failed to take the \npotentially unsafe products off the market until, incredibly, 4 years \nhad passed.\n  Mr. President, by 1985, heat-treated product was available--heat-\ntreated product, meaning that the virus was inactivated.\n  Back in the late 1970's, the process of heat treatment of clotting \nfactor had been developed in Europe, providing hope that the HIV virus \ncould be inactivated. Now, while FDA moved quickly through 1983 and \n1984 to license new manufacturing processes for the heat treatment of \nclotting factor, by 1985, heat-treated factor had been as effective in \ninactivating HIV. However, Mr. President, tragically, the FDA did not \nact to recall the untreated products. It waited until 1989, some 4 \nyears later.\n  Meanwhile, those dangerous products were left on the shelf to cycle \nthrough the system, and all that time a method of making those products \nsafe was readily available.\n  Let me turn to the third essential fact. Third, Mr. President, the \nFederal Government failed to act quickly to trace and to notify \npotential recipients of AIDS-contaminated blood and blood products. \nKnowing that transmission of HIV-infected blood products led to HIV \ninfection, knowing some of the blood was contaminated, and knowing \npeople were using it, the Government failed to immediately notify the \npeople who were at risk. Recipients became infectious immediately, but \nappeared healthy, of course, for approximately 4 or 5 years, during \nwhich time their spouses or sexual partners were at risk of acquiring \nHIV. If nothing else, Mr. President, once the signals were clear, the \nGovernment should have done more to alert people to these risks not \njust to their own health, but to the health of their loved ones, their \nspouses, and their children.\n  It was in 1988 that President Reagan issued a Presidential directive \nto formulate Federal policy for tracing the recipients of possibly \ninfected blood products.\n  However, tragically, the FDA did not issue recommendations for \npatient notification until 1991--some 3 years later. Now, by that time, \n2,040 persons with hemophilia had been diagnosed with HIV, and more \nthan 1,500 members of the hemophilia community in this country had died \nof HIV. For the hemophilia community, Government action came too late--\nmuch too late.\n  Mr. President, these are the reasons why I believe that this country \nand this Congress has a moral obligation to help these families. Our \nRicky Ray bill would authorize the establishment of a trust fund to \nprovide $125,000 in compassionate payment to eligible individuals or \nfamilies of persons with hemophilia and AIDS. The trust fund would be \nadministered by the Secretary of Health and Human Services and would \nsunset 5 years after it is funded.\n  Mr. President, approximately 7,200 people with hemophilia--nearly \nhalf of all persons with hemophilia in the United States--were infected \nwith HIV through the use of blood clotting products.\n  These products came from as many as 20,000 donors, sometimes even \nmore. These concentrates expose individuals with inherited bleeding \ndisorders to a high risk of infection by blood-borne viruses, such as \nhepatitis.\n  Because of the hemophilia community's reliance on blood products, the \nCenters for Disease Control monitors the hemophilia community to aid in \nthe detection of emerging viruses or pathogens that could affect all \nAmericans. Problems in the blood supply tend to show up in the \nhemophilia community first--so they serve really as a kind of ``distant \nearly warning system'' for our blood supply. It is a crude but accurate \ncomparison to say that this community is the proverbial ``canary in the \nmine shaft.'' They serve in that function for the rest of us.\n  During the 1980's, when the Nation's blood supply and blood-derived \nproducts became contaminated with the AIDS virus, HIV was detected in \nthree men with hemophilia, providing early evidence that this disease \ncould be transmitted through blood--thus affecting a far broader cross-\nsection of our population. We now know that this was to mean the \ndevastation of the hemophilia community.\n  Mr. President, more than 80 percent of people with severe hemophilia \nand half of all persons with hemophilia were infected with HIV during \nthe 1980's through the use of HIV-contaminated blood products. In some \ncases, due to a lack of education and outreach, their wives, husbands, \nchildren, and partners became infected as well.\n  The impact of HIV on the Nation's hemophilia population has been \ntruly devastating. The HIV contamination of the blood supply has caused \nsignificant emotional and financial losses to these families.\n  Our bill would make a gesture of compassion to these American \nfamilies. It would also acknowledge that the Government played a role \nin this crisis and, therefore, has incurred some obligation.\n\n  Eligible individuals, or their families, would be required to \ndocument the use of blood products between July 1982 when the first \ncases of persons with hemophilia contracted AIDS were reported to the \nCenters for Disease Control and December 1987, when the last \nmanufacturer recall of blood products occurred.\n  This bill, which has been referred to the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee, already has the bipartisan support of 35 Members of this \nbody.\n  In coming to the Senate floor this evening, it is my hope that I will \nbe able to answer some of the questions that have been raised about \nthis bill, and to ask those of our colleagues who have not yet \ncosponsored this bill to consider doing so after hearing the facts that \nI will be laying out in a moment.\n  Let me talk for a minute about how I came to introduce this bill. In \ndoing that, let me tell you a little bit about the bill's name sake--\nRicky Ray. Ricky Ray and his brothers were born with hemophilia. This \nis a rare genetic condition, impairing the ability of\n\n[[Page S11285]]\n\nblood to clot effectively. This disorder affects, today, about 20,000 \nAmericans.\n  People with hemophilia historically had a short lifespan and \ntypically faced numerous hospital stays and complications.\n  Hemophilia was also frequently associated with crippling. Persons \nwith hemophilia would suffer internal bleeding, leading eventually to \nthe destruction of their joints and muscle tissues, because no \neffective treatment existed.\n  But this changed in the 1970's, with the development of clotting \nfactor concentrates, which are derived from blood. It was also changed \nby the introduction of comprehensive care that allowed many individuals \nwith hemophilia to begin to manage their bleeding episodes at home.\n  Clotting factor eliminated the need for frequent and costly \nhospitalization and ensured that even persons with severe hemophilia \nwould be able to attend school, obtain full-time employment, and enjoy \ngreatly increased life expectancy. Clotting factor changed the lives of \npersons with hemophilia, especially for children like the Rays, who, \nunlike their grandfathers and uncle, could now see a future involving a \nlong and healthy life.\n  When clotting factor was introduced, it was treated as a miracle \ndrug. People were encouraged to use it not just in case of a life-\nthreatening bleed but also as a part of their daily lives--a preventive \nmeasure. It is just a slight exaggeration to say that people were \nencouraged to treat early and to treat often.\n  The great promise of this new treatment, however, proved short lived \nwhen, tragically, it was found to be an effective means to transmit the \nvirus known as HIV. Ricky Ray was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1986. He \nwas only 9 years of age. He had contracted HIV through the use of this \nremarkable new treatment, this clotting factor. His two brothers \ncontracted HIV as well and so did 72 other members of the hemophilia \ncommunity across this country.\n  Ricky Ray and his brothers were kicked out of school. They were \nkicked out of school because of their HIV status, and then, when their \nparents won a decision in court to readmit them, arsonists set their \nhouse on fire. Instead of giving in to anger, Ricky Ray became a \nspokesperson promoting understanding about HIV. And he did this until \nhis death in 1992 at the age of 15.\n  I personally became involved with the hemophilia community when I met \na father from Ohio whose son Christopher had severe hemophilia. John \nWilliams was the primary caregiver for his son. John accompanied \nChristopher to his doctor's appointments and learned how to infuse his \nchild with the medicine that would control his bleeding disorder. John \nalso shared anguish and pain with his 8-year-old little boy when he \nthen later was diagnosed with AIDS.\n\n  John was determined, as all parents would be, to help Christopher \nsurvive. John accompanied Christopher to the National Institutes of \nHealth campus every few weeks for the latest in treatment options and \nbreakthrough technologies.\n  Throughout this experience, the constant thought in the father's mind \nwas that he had infused his own son with the medicine that would \neventually kill him. He often thought that he had been negligent in \nsome way. Had he perhaps missed a crucial piece of information that \ncould have saved Christopher? Had he missed an important news story or \nwarning? Was there anything he could have done to save his son?\n  For 5 years, the father, John, shared in his young son's battle. Then \nin October 1994, Christopher died of complications from AIDS. He had \njust entered the 10th grade and was contemplating college plans, a \ndream that, of course, was never fulfilled.\n  This legislation is really about people. It is about people and their \nstrength in facing tragedy, the devastation of an entire community of \npeople that today has come to be represented by a courageous boy from \nFlorida by the name of Ricky Ray.\n  The concerns that I raise today have been raised repeatedly by the \nhemophilia community in this country. Unfortunately, the legal system \nhas not been an effective means to address these concerns nor to \nprovide the assistance to infected individuals, and there are several \nreasons why.\n  The first has to do with what's called blood shield laws. Whenever \nthe Federal Government writes product liability laws of any kind, we in \nthe Congress insert a standard exemption for blood and blood products. \nWe, therefore, defer to the States to regulate in this area, and in \ndoing so we affirm the State blood shield laws that are prevalent \nthroughout this country.\n  Forty-seven different State jurisdictions have exempted blood and \nblood products from strict liability or implied warranty claims on the \nbasis that blood and blood products are services, not products. Now, \nthis classification is more than just a question of semantics. It means \nthat plaintiffs must prove negligence rather than simply use of the \nblood was the proximate cause of the injury they suffered, which is the \nstandard for other products.\n  In 1976, blood banks began receiving exemptions from liability even \nunder a negligence standard with the passage of blood shield laws. In \n1977, the courts began extending this exemption from liability to blood \nproduct manufacturers on similar grounds. They did all of this because \nthe States believed the need for an available blood supply, for surgery \nand other medical procedures, outweighed the relatively minor risk of \nhepatitis. The rationale was that blood product manufacturers should be \nexempt from product liability, since blood products are unavoidably \nunsafe, because the risk of hepatitis simply could not be eliminated.\n  There is a much higher standard of proof for consumers of blood and \nblood products. The ability of individuals in this community, the \nhemophilia community, therefore, to seek resolution in the court system \nhas been severely curtailed by these State blood shield laws.\n  If that were not enough, there are other legal problems confronting \nthese hemophilia victims and their families. Just a couple of examples. \nFirst, collecting evidence for suits against manufacturers is \nextraordinarily difficult. Most individuals that became infected with \nHIV had a severe form of hemophilia that meant they were infusing \nthousands of units of clotting factor on a monthly and sometimes weekly \nbasis. These individuals were understandably unable to determine \nexactly from which manufactured lot the product that infected them \ncame.\n  Second, hemophilia families also face the problem of statute of \nlimitations. All States have them, and they prohibit individuals from \nprevailing in litigation if the suit was not filed within a few years \nof the alleged tort. To the hemophilia community, many individuals were \ndiagnosed after the prescribed period in the statute of limitations and \nwere unable to take any action.\n  Just as significantly, they are also battling a disease with a long \nand often symptom-free incubation period. This makes statutes of \nlimitation even less defensible and imposes a much greater burden on \nthis community.\n  All this does not mean that the hemophilia community, these people \nwho have suffered so, has not tried. They have. Hundreds of suits have \nbeen filed against the manufacturers of clotting factor. In some States \nthe hemophilia community has even been successful in rolling back the \nstatute of limitations.\n  Recently, many members of the hemophilia community gave up their \nright to continue to pursue the manufacturers through the courts, and \nthey did this by agreeing to a class action settlement.\n  This settlement brings recognition to the HIV infection of the \nhemophilia community and provides some relief to the community for \ntheir suffering. But this is not to say that the community was holding \nout until recently for something better. Victims were unable to meet \nthe especially high liability standards established by the blood shield \nlaws. It appears that increasing momentum for the Ricky Ray bills in \nthe House and Senate pushed the negotiations into a final phase.\n  Senators may ask about the private settlement proposal as offered by \nfour manufacturers of clotting factor concentrates in 1996, an offer \nthat was made in April 1996. This settlement, which has been approved \nby the U.S. District Court of Northern Illinois, will provide each \nperson infected with HIV through the use of clotting factor $100,000. \nThe settlement proposal was\n\n[[Page S11286]]\n\ndrafted so the payment would be contingent upon obtaining certain \nprotections for recipients receiving means-tested benefits such as \nMedicaid.\n  So for this reason, when we reintroduced the Ricky Ray bill this \nyear, I included a second title in the bill to protect the eligibility \nfor individuals receiving Medicaid and SSI upon receipt of the \nsettlement claim.\n  The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 included a provision related to the \nprivate settlement protecting the eligibility of individuals receiving \nMedicaid benefits. Unfortunately, no similar protection for SSI \neligibility was included.\n  I support the settlement between the hemophilia community and the \nmanufacturers of clotting factor and see it as the first step in \naddressing the ongoing responsibility that the companies have to the \ncommunity they serve. I do not believe that the victims--in looking for \ncompensation--should be limited to seeking from private companies. This \nshould not be an exclusive remedy. It should not be seen as an \nexclusive remedy, very bluntly, because the Government shares the \nblame. And private settlements are inadequate.\n  As to the specific figure at which we have arrived--$125,000--I think \nthis is an eminently reasonable compensation, when you consider that \nthe average cost of care for patients with severe hemophilia--per \nyear--is $100,000.\n  Let's look at how some other governments have dealt with this \nproblem.\n\n\n                    Compensation in other Countries\n\n  Many other developed countries have established compensation programs \nto assist individuals with blood-clotting disorders who were infected \nwith HIV by contaminated blood products.\n  In some countries, such as Australia, France, Germany, Japan, Spain, \nand the United Kingdom, assistance has come from combined public and \nprivate sources. Specifically, in Japan, the government--and the same \npharmaceutical companies we are dealing with here in the United \nStates--agreed to provide, together, payments of $430,000 to victims of \nhemophilia-related AIDS. The government shouldered 44 percent of the \nburden, and the pharmaceutical companies paid the rest.\n  In other countries, such as Canada, Denmark, Hong Kong, Italy, \nPortugal, and Switzerland, assistance has been provided directly from \nthe government.\n\n\n                               Precedents\n\n  Some of my colleagues have raised concerns that passage of the Ricky \nRay relief legislation may set a legal precedent. What kind of \nprecedent is there? In fact, the U.S. Congress has a history of \nrecognizing the country's responsibilities to aggrieved individuals and \nhas provided relief for these victims.\n  It is my intention, in the next few minutes, to lay out the \nprecedents in some detail. But I would like to point out, first and \nforemost, that blood is unique. The Federal Government and, by its \npermission, State governments, regulate the blood supply in a unique \nway.\n  Because the Government has a unique responsibility in the case of \nblood, passage of the Ricky Ray Relief Act will not set a precedent. It \nwould, rather, represent another extraordinary circumstance in which \nCongress has determined that injured parties should receive \ncompensation for injuries sustained as a result of Government action or \ninaction.\n  Individuals in the hemophilia community are prevented from recovery \nfrom the Federal Government under the Federal Tort Claims Act [FTCA], \nwhich is designed to be the exclusive means of compensation for \ninjuries sustained as a result of the negligence of the Federal \nGovernment. Because the Federal Tort Claims Act includes an explicit \nexemption from claims that arise directly as a result of the ``exercise \nor performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary \nfunction,'' victims are barred from recovery for the inaction of the \nFDA in its regulation of blood products. They are barred under this \nact.\n\n  But Congress has acted to compensate individuals when it determines \nthat remedy under the Federal Torts Claims Act and other statutes is \ninadequate. Congressional passage of the Ricky Ray Act would represent \nanother instance of Congress recognizing the appropriateness of \ncompensating victims unable to recover under the Federal Tort Claims \nAct.\n  Let me discuss two relevant precedents. One of the first major claims \nmade after the passage of the Federal Tort Claims Act was the claim \nmade on behalf of the victims of the explosion of two cargo ships \ncontaining ammonium nitrate fertilizer in the harbor of Texas City, TX, \nin 1947. In this case, the Supreme court held, in Dalehite v. United \nStates, 346 U.S. 15 (1953), that the Federal Government was not liable \nbecause the plaintiffs could not prove negligence. Additionally, a \nclaim of absolute or strict liability was rejected because the Court \nfound that the Federal Tort Claims Act did not allow recovery on that \nbasis. Despite--and, in part, because of--the Supreme Court's explicit \nrejection of the claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 2 years \nlater, the Congress passed legislation providing settlement of claims \nresulting from the explosion. This legislation established the \nprecedent that Congress may pass legislation authorizing compensation \nwithout finding the Government at fault.\n  Let me turn to another example that closely reflects the hemophilia \nsituation in the mid-1980's in this country. Congress combined relief \nfor two different populations of victims in one statute--the Radiation \nExposure Compensation Act. One group was made up of uranium miners who \nwere seeking compensation for the adverse health effects they had \nexperienced while working in private mines--private mines. The second \ngroup, known as ``downwinders,'' was made up of individuals who lived \ndownwind of atomic test sites and were exposed to radiation. Neither \ngroup was able to recover from the Federal Government in court. Both \nfailed.\n  The courts had previously ruled against the uranium miners in Begay \nv. United States, 591 F.Supp. 991 (1984), and against the downwinders \nin Allen v. United States, 816 F2d 1417 (1987). The courts found that \nthe Government could not be held liable for injuries because its \npolicies were protected by the discretionary function exception in the \nFederal Tort Claims Act.\n  In Begay, the plaintiffs had asserted that various government \nagencies were actionably negligent in leaving the responsibility for \nuranium mine safety--outside Federal enclaves like Indian \nreservations--to the States. They also asserted that these agencies \nwere negligent in failing to enforce rigid radiation safety levels in \nthe Indian reservation mines--and that all the Federal agencies \ninvolved were themselves negligent in failing to establish and enforce \nrigid radiation safety standards in the underground uranium mines in \nthe 1940's, 1950's, and early 1960's.\n  The court in Begay suggested that the miners seek redress from the \nU.S. Congress. This is what the Court said:\n\n       This tragedy of the nuclear age . . . cries for redress. \n     Such relief should be addressed by the Congress as it was in \n     the Texas City explosion following the decision of the \n     Supreme Court in Dalehite.\n\n  In the Allen case, the downwinder plaintiffs had singled out the \nalleged failure of the Government to fully monitor offsite fallout \nexposure, and to fully provide the necessary public information on \nradioactive fallout. As in the Begay case, the court found no \nobligation to compensate on the basis of failing to monitor or warn. A \nconcurring opinion in Allen noted that the court's hands were tied:\n\n       While we have great sympathy for the individual cancer \n     victims who have borne alone the costs of the Atomic Energy \n     Commission's choices, their plight is a matter for Congress. \n     Only Congress has the constitutional power to decide whether \n     all costs of government activity will be borne by all the \n     beneficiaries or will continue to be unfairly apportioned, as \n     in this case.\n\n  In 1990, Congress did in fact provide relief to these two groups \nthrough the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, Public Law 101-426. \nThe circumstances that led to the passage of the Radiation Exposure \nCompensation Act are, I believe, very instructive.\n  In that case, the States failed to require that the private mine \noperators follow Federal health and safety standards. As a result, \npeople got sick. They could not recover from the private mine \noperators--nor could they recover from the Federal Government. Those \nindividuals were compensated later through congressional legislation, \nthrough action by the House and the Senate.\n  The facts are clear. In that case, little or nothing was done by the \nStates to force the private mine operators to\n\n[[Page S11287]]\n\nimprove ventilation in their mines. Although the Public Health Service \ndemonstrated that adequate mine ventilation would be relatively \ninexpensive--and the Atomic Energy Commission had developed effective \nradiation level controls, which were available for all State and \nFederal agencies--the mine operators successfully resisted efforts to \nsubstantially reduce radiation levels by improved ventilation \ntechniques. Through legislation, compensation was ultimately made to \nindividual miners who worked for private mine operators that were not \nsubject to Federal radiation safety requirements.\n  These precedents bring us directly to the Federal Government's \nresponsibility for the blood supply in this country and bring us \ndirectly to this bill.\n  The evidence in the IOM study that I referenced previously on blood \nsafety clearly demonstrates that, in a number of instances, FDA failed \nto mandate certain Federal patient safety requirements for private \nprocessors of blood products, failed to act on recommendations from the \nCenters for Disease Control concerning screening blood donors, failed \nto mandate recall of hemophilia clotting factor, and failed to \nimplement a 1988 Presidential directive to trace recipients of possibly \ninfected blood, failed to do that for 3 long years. Passage of the \nRicky Ray Hemophilia Relief Act does not set a new precedent, but--on \nthe contrary--is fully consistent with the earlier precedents set by \nCongress to provide compensation for injury when remedy could be found \nby no other means.\n\n\n                        how to pay for ricky ray\n\n  As this bill is written, the Ricky Ray Act provides $125,000 for each \neligible individual, and so, with an estimated 7,200 \naffected individuals, the total cost of the bill is estimated at $900 \nmillion.\n\n  In order to identify individuals and determine their eligibility, \npayments authorized by the legislation will likely occur over several \nyears. This would result in at least two smaller annual appropriations \nrequests.\n\n\n                      Support for This Legislation\n\n  As I stated earlier, the Ricky Ray Hemophilia Relief Fund Act has the \nsupport of 35 of our Senate colleagues and the support of 257 Members \nof the House of Representatives.\n  The legislation is also endorsed by the American Red Cross, the \nAmerican Association of Blood Banks, America's Blood Centers and AIDS \nadvocacy organizations such as the National Association of Persons with \nAIDS and the AIDS Policy Center.\n  In her letter to the National Hemophilia Foundation, American Red \nCross President Elizabeth Dole stated:\n\n       The American Red Cross supports a comprehensive approach to \n     addressing the needs of those infected with HIV or other \n     transmissible agents through the use of blood components or \n     blood products. For individuals with hemophilia who were \n     infected with HIV before 1985, the American Red Cross \n     believes that finalization of the manufacturers' settlement \n     offer, coupled with the government-funded compensation \n     program outlined in the Ricky Ray legislation, will provide \n     an effective means of immediate help.\n\n  A host of other developed countries have established compensation \nprograms to assist individuals with blood-clotting disorders who were \ninfected with HIV by contaminated blood products.\n  I believe it is now time for the United States--and for this \nCongress--to take action as well. I encourage my colleagues to \ncosponsor this legislation, to join the 35 other Members of this body \nwho have already signed on as cosponsors. The Senate Labor Committee is \nscheduled to have a hearing on this bill on Thursday of this week. \nChairman Hyde will be bringing the House bill before the full House \nJudiciary Committee tomorrow. I would invite my colleagues to examine \nthe hearing record, and learn more about the need for this bill. I \nbelieve the case has been made and the case is clear: The Federal \nGovernment has a moral duty to help those Americans who counted on the \nFederal Government to protect the blood supply. No, Mr. President, this \nbill cannot reverse the tragedies, but it can serve to demonstrate that \nthe Federal Government can be held accountable for its actions.\n  Mr. President, we often hear that bad things happen to good people. \nThat is something that governments and Congresses will never be able to \ncure. But in this case, when bad things happened to good people, the \nU.S. Government played a part in the problem. The U.S. Government \nshould now play a part in the solution--and do something to help these \nAmerican families.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/28/senate-section/article/S11283-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nWYCHE FOWLER'S CONFIRMATION AS UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO SAUDI ARABIA\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate my good \nfriend and former colleague Wyche Fowler on his confirmation as United \nStates Ambassador to Saudi Arabia. This is a great and well-deserved \nhonor for the former Senator from Georgia. Even more important, it is a \nblessing for America.\n  Because his was a recess appointment, Wyche Fowler already has served \nwith great distinction and success for over 1 year in Saudi Arabia. \nPresident Clinton appointed him to this post just days before the June \n25, 1996, terrorist bombing of the United States military residence in \nDahran. Although he took the ambassadorship at one of the most tenuous \nmoments in United States-Saudi diplomatic relations, Wyche embraced the \nchallenge and helped cement the United States relationship with Saudi \nArabia, one of our most important allies.\n  Wyche was sworn in as Ambassador on August 16, 1996. His appointment \ncame at an important moment in the relationship between the United \nStates and Saudi Arabia. Despite the difficulties that have surrounded \nthe bombing investigation, he has served his country well and protected \nAmerican interests in the region with tenacity and skill.\n  Of course, Mr. President, this is no surprise to those of us who have \nfollowed Wyche Fowler's career of public service or worked closely with \nhim during his 16 years in Congress. Elected to the Senate in 1986, \nWyche served on the Appropriations, Budget, Energy, and Agriculture \nCommittees. As assistant floor leader, he helped fashion a bipartisan \nconsensus on major public policy issues. Many of us remember Wyche \nFowler as an unusually reflective Member of this body, who talked often \nof conserving our natural resources and energy sources. I can remember \nlistening with humor and fascination as he used electric toothbrushes \nto point out the danger of decadent applications of technology.\n  Before becoming the first Atlantan elected to the Senate, Wyche \nFowler represented Atlanta's First District in the House of \nRepresentatives. First elected in 1977, he served on the Ways and Means \nand Foreign Relations Committees, as well as the Select Committee on \nIntelligence and the Congressional Arts Caucus.\n  Wyche's legislative record is long and distinguished: he tried to \nstop oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and protect \nnational wetlands; recodified and strengthened the national historic \npreservation law; established joint public/private ventures in \nalternative energy; and ensured interest-free relief for farmers in the \nFarm Credit System overhaul.\n  The consensus-building skills Wyche learned in Congress have stood \nhim in good stead in Riyadh. Just as valuable, Mr. President, is his \naffable personality. All his colleagues in the House and Senate \nremember Wyche Fowler as a genial and charismatic fellow, not to \nmention a great singer of hymns and a superb storyteller. In fact, \nWyche used to entertain us with the same country songs he performed as \na teenager on an Atlanta talent show. Though the Saudis may not \nappreciate country ballads, I am sure that they will find Wyche Fowler \nevery bit as hard-working, engaging, and honest as the people of \nGeorgia and his colleagues have.\n  And, Mr. President, Wyche is genuinely fascinated by Saudi Arabia's \npeople and culture. He has begun to learn Arabic, and already has \nindulged his enthusiasm for Arabian history and archaeology by trekking \non camel through the deserts of Saudi Arabia's Empty Quarter.\n  America is fortunate to have Wyche Fowler as its Ambassador to Saudi \nArabia. His diplomatic skills will see us successfully through a \ndelicate and vital period in our relations with that nation. In this \ninstance, Mr. President, Georgia's loss was the Nation's gain.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/28/senate-section/article/S11287-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11288-S11289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11288]]\n                  RETIREMENT OF GENERAL SHALIKASHVILI\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on September 30, our Nation witnessed a \nchanging of the guard with the retirement of the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, Gen. John Shalikashvili.\n  General Shali, as he is affectionately known, served this country \nwith honor and distinction for 39 years, rising from the rank of \nprivate to the top military post in our Nation, a record that will \ninspire the next generation.\n  For the past 4 years, as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, he has been \nthe principal military adviser to the President of the United States \nand the Secretary of Defense during a period when we witnessed a \nproliferation of new and unknown threats throughout the world.\n  Those in the Senate who have had the privilege of working closely \nwith him during these years of new challenge will always remember and \nadmire his honesty, his sound judgment, and--most importantly--his \nconcern for the men and women of our Armed Forces and their families.\n  During the traditional farewell ceremony at Fort Myer, General Shali \nwas honored with the award of the Medal of Freedom and the earned \nrecognition of President Clinton and Secretary of Defense Cohen. I ask \nunanimous consent that the speeches of Secretary Cohen and President \nClinton from General Shali's farewell ceremony be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the speeches were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Remarks of William Cohen, U.S. Secretary of Defense at Farewell \n   Ceremony for Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, September 30, 1997\n\n       Secretary Cohen: Mr. President, Mrs. Clinton, Vice \n     President Gore and Mrs. Gore, Secretary Albright, General \n     McCaffrey, members of Congress, the service secretaries and \n     service chiefs and combatant commanders and spouses, foreign \n     dignitaries and honored guests. Let me pay particular note of \n     former secretary of defense, Bill Perry and Lee, and also \n     former deputy secretary John White and Betty.\n       Welcome, all of you, and thank you for joining Janet and me \n     in paying tribute to two very special people, John \n     Shalikashvili and his wife, Joan.\n       Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes said, alas, gentlemen, that \n     is life. We cannot live our dreams. We're lucky enough if we \n     can give a sample of our best, and if in our hearts we can \n     feel it's been nobly done.\n       Well today, we express our gratitude to a man who has given \n     more than a sample of his best, he's also lived his dreams. \n     His dreams have taken him from the streets of Warsaw that he \n     knew as a child to the corridors of Washington he has walked \n     as chairman, and none of us know how much of our lives are \n     determined by chance or choice or by the guiding hand of \n     providence.\n       And John Shalikashvili, we only know that he has stood at \n     the crossroads of key moments of history. He was there, a boy \n     of three, when Hitler's tanks rolled into Poland from the \n     west. He was there, a boy of eight, when Stalin's columns \n     rolled in from the east. He was there with his family, \n     fleeing to Germany when he first met the American forces \n     that he would one day come to command.\n       He was there on the free side of Berlin, the Berlin Wall, \n     when George Marshall built a bridge of help and hope across \n     the Atlantic. Well, John and his family crossed the bridge to \n     a place called Peoria, in the heart of America, and John took \n     America to heart.\n       To learn the language, he turned to a legend, John Wayne. \n     Imagine this teenage boy in terms of what he saw in those \n     early movies. Perhaps a calling in ``The Sands Of Iwo Jima,'' \n     perhaps the courage of ``The Rider Of Destiny,'' perhaps the \n     character of ``The Quiet Man,'' whose words speak volumes.\n       Well, this boy grew into a man who would create his own \n     legend. A man of great heart, and yes, true grit. When the \n     times called for bravery and boldness in Vietnam, Major Shali \n     was there leading his comrades against the Viet Cong, winning \n     the bronze star for valor.\n       When the times called for a firm hand with a human touch to \n     help the Kurds of Iraq, General Shali was there providing \n     comfort and compassion to the sick and to the suffering. When \n     the times called for a new supreme allied commander in Europe \n     with a touch and toughness of a warrior diplomat, General \n     Shali was there reshaping the alliance to meet the demands of \n     a new era.\n       And then the times called for a new chairman of the joint \n     chiefs of staff, a chairman who could marshal our forces and \n     harness them wisely in a brave new world of great expectation \n     and uneasy peace. And President Clinton wisely chose General \n     Shali, the right man for our time, but also a man with the \n     timeless qualities of military leadership set forth by the \n     first chairman, Omar Bradley.\n       The qualities of firmness, not harshness; understanding, \n     not weakness; humanness, not intolerance; generosity, not \n     selfishness; pride, not egotism.\n       Bradley's litany of leadership can be seen shining in \n     Shali's eyes, etched in his brow and painted in the ribbons \n     that brighten his chest and tell his epic story.\n       Dwight Eisenhower once warned General Bradley that being \n     chairman was the hardest job in Washington.\n       Mr. President, I'm not sure whether Eisenhower issued that \n     warning before or after he became president. But surely, it \n     has remained one of the hardest jobs in Washington. And for \n     Chairman Shali in his time it was the job of building a \n     military force that was both smaller and better that would \n     remain the best trained, the best led, the best equipped \n     force in the world. It was a job of responding to threats \n     while shaping the world for the better; bringing more \n     democracy to more nations, more stability to more regions, \n     and thus, more security to our nation.\n       And the service of John Shalikashvili in the cause of \n     freedom has come full circle. The boy who fled his home of \n     Poland for freedom is helping to welcome Poland back home \n     into the family of free nations. Something that has made the \n     job a little less difficult has been the helping hand, the \n     wise counsel and yes, the deep friendship of the vice \n     chairman of the joint chiefs, General Joe Ralston.\n       The president, General Shali and I rely upon Joe Ralston on \n     a daily basis. And our nation is safer and more secure \n     because of his devotion to duty.\n       And another person serving at Shali's side is a hero, as we \n     have indicated, in her own right, Joan Shalikashvili.\n       If being chairman of the joint chiefs is the hardest job in \n     Washington, then being married to him has to be the second \n     hardest. And Joan--through 31 years of love and dedication \n     you two have been there for our troops and their families. No \n     ship has been too far, no base too remote, no soldier too \n     junior than devoting your life to the quality of their lives.\n       And so, for the miles that you've traveled and the lives \n     you've touched, we are all profoundly grateful.\n       On the wall in my office hangs a portrait of Joshua \n     Chamberlain who fought in the Civil War with legendary \n     gallantry and generosity of heart. Chamberlain once spoke of \n     developing the kind of character which allows ordinary people \n     to become extraordinary or heroic. He said, we know not of \n     the future and cannot plan for it much. But we can hold our \n     spirits and our bodies so pure and so high, we may cherish \n     such thoughts and such ideals and dream such dreams of lofty \n     purpose that we can determine and know what manner of men we \n     will be whenever and wherever the hour strikes that calls us \n     to noble action.\n       General Shali, long after the sound of those cannons and \n     the celebration of this day have faded, you can take comfort \n     in knowing that as a result of who you are and what you've \n     given and what all of us have received, that whenever and \n     wherever the hour strikes that calls us to noble action, the \n     men and women of America's military, following your example, \n     will always be there. And they too will give a sample of \n     their best. And like you, they will know in their hearts it's \n     been nobly done.\n       Thank you.\n       (Applause)\n                                                                    ____\n\n\nRemarks of President Clinton at Farewell Ceremony for Chairman of Joint \n                  Chiefs of Staff, September 30, 1997\n\n       President Clinton. Mr. Vice President, Secretary Cohen, \n     Secretary Albright, Secretary Gober, National Security \n     Adviser Berger, Director Tenet, General McCaffrey, to the \n     service secretaries, the joint chiefs, the unified commanders \n     in chief, the members of Congress, the members of our armed \n     forces, to all the friends of General Shalikashvili who are \n     here today, including former Secretary Perry, former chairmen \n     and members of the joint chiefs, former officials of the \n     Department of Defense, we all come together in grateful \n     tribute to John and Joan Shalikashvili.\n       This is, frankly, a bittersweet day for me. I am full of \n     pride but also some regret. For the last four years I have \n     counted on Shali for his wisdom, his counsel, his leadership. \n     He has become an exceptional adviser and a good friend, \n     someone I knew I could always depend upon when the lives of \n     our troops or the interests of America were on the line, and \n     I will miss him very much.\n       General Shali is a great American with a great American \n     story. A childhood seared by war, he has given his life to \n     the cause of peace.\n       From an immigrant learning English, he has become the \n     shining symbol of what America is all about. He's never \n     forgotten what his country gave him nor has ever stopped \n     giving back to it. His service to our nation spanning 39 \n     years rises from the ranks of Army private to the highest \n     military officer in the land.\n       Of course, the road even for him has not always been \n     smooth. I am told that after a grueling first day at Officer \n     Candidate School, Private John Shali sneaked out of his \n     barracks looking for a place to resign. Our nation can be \n     very grateful that probably for the only time in his entire \n     career, he failed in his mission.\n       I am convinced that when future students look back upon \n     this time, they will rank John Shalikashvili as among the \n     greatest chairmen of the joint chiefs of staff America ever \n     had.\n\n[[Page S11289]]\n\n       Greatness is something that cannot be bestowed like a \n     medal, a ribbon, a star. It cannot be taught or bought. It \n     comes in the end only from within. General Shali has said \n     that the three indispensable traits of a great leader are \n     confidence, care and character. He ought to know. He embodies \n     them.\n       His confidence shines in a sterling record of innovation \n     and achievement--managing the downsizing of our forces while \n     upgrading their capability and readiness; upholding the most \n     rigorous standards for the use of those forces in the world \n     where threats to our survival have faded, but threats to our \n     interests and values have not; dramatically improving joint \n     doctrine and training and taking joint planning far into the \n     future for the very first time; and of course, helping bring \n     Europe together at last in liberty, democracy and peace.\n       One of the proudest moments of my presidency was standing \n     with Shali in Warsaw as we celebrated NATO's enlargement and \n     welcomed the people of his original homeland back home to the \n     family of freedom.\n       And if the baseline measure of a chairman's competence is \n     successful military operations, Shali has filled a resume \n     that would turn others all a drab with envy.\n       In the last four years, our troops have been tested in more \n     than 40 operations. From Bosnia to Haiti, the Taiwan straits, \n     Iraq, Rawanda, Liberia and more, our armed forces have \n     performed superbly with Shali at the helm.\n       Our troops trust him because they know him, how much he \n     cares for them. They have seen that caring in his constant \n     contact with our service men and women; in the way he warms \n     their hearts with his pride in them; and the humility, the \n     honesty, the graciousness, the respect he always shows to \n     others; in the wonderful way he listens--even to bearers of \n     bad news.\n       Our troops know that he never expects their gratitude or \n     applause, but he does want to sharpen their capabilities, \n     improve their welfare and lift their morale, and in his most \n     important duty, to make sure that whenever they go into \n     danger, the planning is superb, the risks are minimized, and \n     every reasonable measure is taken to ensure their success and \n     safe return.\n       For Shali, caring transcends our obligations even to one \n     another. He believes in America's unique ability to help \n     others around the world, sheltering freedom, defending \n     democracy, relieving fear and despair.\n       He knows that what sets our troops apart is not just their \n     courage, strength and skill, but also the ideal they serve, \n     the hope they inspire, the spirit they represent.\n       As some may recall, during the crisis in Haiti, Shali \n     visited with refugees in the camps observing and listening \n     with quiet understanding, the quiet understanding of one who \n     had also been in that position. And he ordered improvements \n     to make those camps as comfortable as possible, to alleviate \n     boredom and brighten hopes and bring toys to the children at \n     Christmas.\n       That story also reveals something about his character, a \n     clear sense of what is right and wrong, a man who's \n     conscience is always his guide.\n       I'll miss a lot of things about Shali, but perhaps most of \n     all, I'll miss the integrity he always displayed in being my \n     closest military adviser.\n       In every conversation we have ever had, he never minced \n     words, he never postured or pulled punches, he never shied \n     away from tough issues or tough calls. And most important, he \n     never shied away from doing what he believed was the right \n     thing.\n       On more than one occasion, many more than one occasion, he \n     looked at me. I could see the pain in his eyes that he \n     couldn't tell me what I wanted to hear and what he wished he \n     could say. But with a clear and firm voice and a direct \n     piercing gaze, he always told me exactly what he thought the \n     truth was.\n       No president could ever ask for more.\n       Shali has had the support of a proud and dedicated family.\n       His son, Brandt; his brother, himself a distinguished green \n     beret veteran; his sister; and of course, there are his dogs. \n     I understand that they are the only living creatures who have \n     never obeyed his orders.\n       And most importantly, there is Joan. Joan, you have been a \n     terrific support for our men and women in uniform.\n       They know you are always looking out for them and their \n     families, from around the corner to around the world. You \n     were the chairman's personal inspector general. When it came \n     to how families are cared for, no one had more commitment, a \n     better eye or a bigger heart, and we thank you.\n       General, very soon now, you and Joan will be settling into \n     your new home in Washington State. You can tuck your uniform \n     into a drawer. You can carry an umbrella. You can even grow a \n     beard.\n       Maybe you'll actually even open that hardware store you'd \n     been talking about. I don't know if you know the first thing \n     about power tools or mixing paint, but the brand you have to \n     offer is the top of the line.\n       Our nation is safer. Our armed forces are stronger, and our \n     world is a better place because of your service. Thank you \n     for all you have done.\n       God bless you, and Godspeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/28/senate-section/article/S11288-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/28/senate-section/article/S11289-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 4:30 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 1227.

A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \npermit grants for the national estuary program to be used for the \ndevelopment and implementation of a comprehensive conservation and \nmanagement plan, to reauthorize appropriations to carry out the \nprogram, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n\n\n             the national estuary conservation act of 1997\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today, Senators Graham, Mack, \nSarbanes, Lautenberg, and I are introducing the National Estuary \nConservation Act. I rise to draw this country's attention to our \nnationally significant estuaries that are threatened by pollution, \ndevelopment, or overuse. With 45 percent of the Nation's population \nresiding in estuarine areas, there is a compelling need for us to \npromote comprehensive planning and management efforts to restore and \nprotect them.\n  Estuaries are significant habitat for fish, birds, and other wildlife \nbecause they provide safe spawning grounds and nurseries. Seventy-five \npercent of the U.S. commercial fish catch depends on estuaries during \nsome stage of their life. Commercial and recreational fisheries \ncontribute $111 billion to the Nation's economy and support 1.5 million \njobs. Estuaries are also important to our Nation's tourist economy for \nboating and outdoor recreation. Coastal tourism in just four States--\nNew Jersey, Florida, Texas, and California--totals $75 billion.\n  Due to their popularity, the overall capacity of our Nation's \nestuaries to function as healthy productive ecosystems is declining. \nThis is a result of the cumulative effects of increasing development \nand fast-growing year-round populations which increase dramatically in \nthe summer. Land development, and associated activities that come with \npeople's desire to live and play near these beautiful resources, cause \nrunoff and stormwater discharges that contribute to siltation, \nincreased nutrients, and other contamination. Bacterial contamination \ncloses many popular beaches and shellfish harvesting areas in \nestuaries. Also, several estuaries are afflicted by problems that still \nrequire significant research. Examples include the outbreaks of the \ntoxic microbe, Pfiesteria piscicida, in rivers draining to estuaries in \nMaryland and Virginia.\n  Congress recognized the importance of preserving and enhancing \ncoastal environments with the establishment of the National Estuary \nProgram in the Clean Water Act Amendments of 1987. The program's \npurpose is to facilitate State and local governments preparation of \ncomprehensive conservation and management plans for threatened \nestuaries of national significance. In support of this effort, section \n320 of the Clean Water Act authorized the EPA to make grants to States \nto develop environmental management plans. To date, 28 estuaries across \nthe country have been designated into the program. However, the law \nfails to provide assistance once plans are complete and ready for \nimplementation. Already, 17 of the 28 plans are finished.\n  As the majority of plans are now in the implementation stage, it is \nincumbent upon us to maintain the partnership the Federal Government \ninitiated 10 years ago to insure that our nationally significant \nestuaries are protected. The legislation we are introducing will take \nthe next step by giving EPA authority to make grants for plan \nimplementation and authorize annual appropriations in the amount of $50 \nmillion. To insure the program is a true partnership and leverage \nscarce resources, there is a direct match requirement for grant \nrecipients so funds will be available to upgrade sewage treatment \nplants, fix combined sewer overflows, control urban stormwater \ndischarges, and reduce polluted runoff into estuarine areas.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1321\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Congressman Joe \nKennedy is the sponsor of a companion bill in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  As a Senator, Paul Tsongas worked skillfully to guarantee that \ntechnology and environmental concerns are at the forefront of our \ncountry's priorities. He was an extraordinary leader who understood the \nimportance of addressing the serious energy and environmental \nchallenges we face at home and around the world. Today, we honor his \ncommitment to these important priorities by proposing a national \nfellowship program to support graduate students in science and \nengineering.\n  As a nation, we need to do more to encourage the best students to \npursue graduate studies in these basic fields, which are so essential \nto a strong future for the Nation. As much as 50 percent of economic \ngrowth is attributed to technological innovation. The Paul E. Tsongas \nFellowship will support the modern pioneers who will keep the Nation at \nthe cutting edge of the technology revolution.\n  The fellowship is modeled on the successful Office of Naval Research \nGraduate Fellowship Program, which over the past 15 years has provided \nfellowships to 592 graduate students in 11 disciplines, and has made \nsignificant contributions to research. The Tsongas fellowships in \nscience and engineering can\n\n[[Page S11291]]\n\nmake a comparable contribution in these fields. They will enhance our \nefforts to improve educational opportunity for students, and strengthen \nour country's economy by investing wisely in the future.\n  The Tsongas fellowships will be a living memorial to one of the \noutstanding Senators of our time, and I hope that Congress will act \nquickly on this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1322\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Paul E. Tsongas Fellowship \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.\n\n       It is the purpose of this Act to encourage individuals of \n     exceptional achievement and promise, especially members of \n     traditionally underrepresented groups, to pursue careers in \n     fields that confront the global energy and environmental \n     challenges of the 21st century.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to regulate concentrated animal feeding operations \nfor the protection of the environment and public health, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                   THE ANIMAL AGRICULTURE REFORM ACT\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, today I am introducing the Animal \nAgriculture Reform Act, a bill that for the first time sets tough \nenvironmental standards governing how large livestock and poultry \noperations handle their animal waste. Animal waste pollution is a \nnational problem that demands a national solution.\n\n  Nationwide, 200 times more animal manure is produced than human \nwaste--five tons for every person in the\n\n[[Page S11292]]\n\nUnited States--making large livestock operations the waste equivalent \nof a town or city. For example, 1,600 dairies in the Central Valley of \nCalifornia produce more waste than a city of 21 million people. And \nright here outside of Washington, DC, the annual production of 600 \nmillion chickens on the Delmarva Peninsula leaves as much nitrogen as a \ncity of almost 500,000 people.\n  The shrinking number of farms producing an ever greater share of \nanimals means that too much manure is produced in some areas of the \ncountry to be put on land without causing water pollution. Nitrogen and \nphosphorous in animal manure are valuable crop nutrients--but in \nexcessive levels in water they are serious pollutants.\n  High levels of nitrogen and phosphorous cause the excessive algae \ngrowth of algae, whose bacterial decomposition uses up oxygen in the \nwater and kills fish. Animal waste also carries parasites, bacteria and \nviruses--and can pollute drinking water with nitrates, potentially \nfatal to infants.\n  While towns must have sewage treatment plants, excess waste from \nlarge-scale animal feeding operations is simply stored indefinitely or \nover-applied on land. That means water pollution from over-application, \nand the ongoing risk of pollution and even massive spills from stored \nwaste.\n  In 1995 in North Carolina 35 million gallons of animal waste were \nspilled, killing 10 million fish. And last year more than 40 animal \nwaste spills were recorded in Iowa, Minnesota and Missouri, up from 20 \nin 1992.\n  In 1997, the toxic microbe Pfiesteria, whose increased presence is \nlinked to excessive nutrients in the water, killed approximately 30,000 \nfish in the Chesapeake Bay and approximately 450,000 fish in North \nCarolina. Major attacks by harmful microbes in U.S. coastal and \nestuarial waters between 1972 and 1995 have doubled--and excessive \nnutrients are the suspected catalyst.\n  In the Gulf of Mexico, farm runoff including animal waste is linked \nto the formation of a so-called ``dead zone'' of hypoxia (low oxygen)--\nup to 7,000 square miles of water that cannot support most aquatic \nlife.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency's regulations in this area have \nnot been revised since they were written in the 1970s, and they do not \ngo nearly far enough to address current animal waste problems.\n  Animal waste management practices must include limiting the \napplication of both phosphorous and nitrogen to amounts that can be \nused by crops. In addition, environmentally sound standards are needed \nfor the handling, storage, treatment and disposal of excess animal \nwaste.\n  Under my bill, large animal feeding operations must submit an \nindividual animal waste management plan to USDA designed to minimize \nthe risk of surface and ground water pollution. My bill would require \nthat USDA work with farmers in developing plans to address potential \nproblems before they happen. USDA will do this by establishing \nguidelines and providing technical assistance and information to \ndevelop farm-specific plans to be approved on an individual basis.\n  I am using the term animal waste, but it is important that we \nrecognize that manure is a valuable resource for farmers who need \nnutrients for their crops. Promoting wise use of manure for crop \nnutrients is the guiding principle of my bill. For a plan to be \napproved, an operator must agree to apply animal waste to land only in \namounts meeting crop nutrient requirements. Furthermore, liquid waste \nthat cannot be safely used for nutrients or another environmentally \nsound use must be treated in accordance with waste water treatment \nstandards.\n  My bill also applies sound technical standards to the construction of \nall new earthen manure lagoons to prevent leaks and spillage of animal \nwaste. Existing earthen manure lagoons are given a reasonable phase-in \nperiod to meet appropriate standards.\n  In addition, my bill puts the burden of complying with these \nrequirements on the animal owners. The bill would prevent animal owners \nfrom using contracts or similar arrangements to avoid responsibility \nfor animal waste management.\n  The bill covers operations with an approximate one-time animal \ncapacity above 1,330 hogs; 57,000 chickens; 270 dairy cattle; or 530 \nslaughter cattle. Each animal owner with at least that many animals \nmust submit a waste management plan to USDA for approval, whether or \nnot the animals are kept in one place. Animal feeding operations under \nthose sizes will qualify under USDA's Environmental Quality Incentives \nProgram for additional technical and cost-share assistance to implement \nanimal waste management plans.\n  I want to be clear that my bill does not interfere with the role of \nEPA and the States in monitoring pollution, or is it a substitute for \nEPA strengthening its current regulations. I see it as an essential \npart of a cooperative approach to the problem by both EPA and USDA--and \nI look forward to EPA's proposals in this area. I also look forward to \nreviewing the recommendations of the National Environmental Dialogue on \nPork Production, which is working on these issues in great detail.\n  We must take strong action now to halt the pollution of our water \nfrom animal waste and other farm runoff. Other issues that are outside \nthe scope of this bill also need to be addressed, including management \nof municipal and industrial wastewater and more careful application of \ncommercial fertilizers. My proposal is one part of a national solution \nto our water quality concerns.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LOTT:\n  S. 1324. A bill to deauthorize a portion of the project for \nnavigation, Biloxi Harbor, MS; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n\n\n                      deauthorization legislation\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1324\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n                 section 1. biloxi harbor, mississippi.\n\n       The portion of the project for navigation, Biloxi Harbor, \n     Mississippi, authorized by the River and Harbor Act of 1960 \n     (74 Stat. 481), for the Bernard Bayou Channel beginning near \n     the Air Force Oil Terminal at approximately navigation mile \n     2.6 and extending downstream to the North-South \\1/2\\ of \n     Section 30, Township 7 South, Range 10 West, Harrison County, \n     Mississippi, just west of Kremer Boat Yards, is not \n     authorized after the date of enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Rockfeller, Mr. Burns, and Mr. \n        Hollings):\n  S. 1325. A bill to authorize appropriations for the Technology \nAdministration of the Department of Commerce for fiscal years 1998 and \n1999, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n\n\n THE TECHNOLOGY ADMINISTRATION AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEARS 1998 \n                                AND 1999\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a bill to authorize \nappropriations for the Technology Administration [TA] of the Department \nof Commerce for fiscal year 1998 and 1999. This bill funds activities \nin the National Institutes of Standards and Technology [NIST].\n  I am keenly aware of my responsibilities to the American people for \nensuring that the people's money is spent wisely. I have a \nresponsibility to exercise prudent fiscal management over programs that \ncost taxpayers millions of dollars each year. Each program must be \nexamined, and wasteful, ineffective programs must be changed or \neliminated. I also have a responsibility to make appropriate long term \ninvestments that will help Americans create the technology and wealth \nof tomorrow. I view both of these duties as part of the principle of \n``wise stewardship'. The TA legislation represents a challenging \napplication of wise stewardship. This bill covers some of the most \nproductive and necessary areas of governments, as well as a few of the \nmost controversial.\n  There is no question that the work done by NIST's Standards \nLaboratory is essential to U.S. commerce. These laboratories house of \nthe best scientific minds in the world. A perfect example is the award \nof the 1997 Nobel Prize for Science to Dr. William Phillips in the area \nof low temperature physics. His accomplishment, as well as the \nachievements of the world class scientific cadre at NIST are reminders \nof\n\n[[Page S11293]]\n\nthe necessity for investment in the Standards Laboratory, the people \nmost of all, but the buildings and infrastructure as well. This \nlegislation provides for continued investment into this research and \nthose services\n  The reauthorization bill contains a provision to add accountability \nand controls to the new Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive \nTechnology [EPSCoT] program. Modeled after National Science \nFoundation's successful and effective EPSoR program, the goal of EPSCoT \nis to increase the technological competitiveness of these States that \nhave historically received less Federal research and development funds \nthan the majority of the States. While I believe that the aims of this \nprogram are good, we cannot afford to put this or any other Federal \ngrant program on automatic pilot. Our legislation contains a \ngraduations criteria, that moves a State out of the program when that \nState has become competitive. The bill contains a provision that \nmandates periodic evaluation of this program. Using this data we can \ntell if and when the program ceases to be effective. If that happens we \nhave the information needed to see if the program can be fixed, or \nshould be terminated.\n  This legislation contains provisions for two programs that have been \nparticularly contentious: the Advanced Technology Program [ATP], and \nthe manufacturing Extension Program [MEP]. Both are technology \nenhancement programs designed with the intent of increasing the ability \nof U.S. firms to compete in the global marketplace.\n  Under existing law each MEP center is funded for a maximum of 6 \nyears. This legislation removes the hard and fast sunset provision and \nreplaces it with a 2-year renewal cycle. Each center must win renewal, \nand with it eligibility for Federal funds by receiving a satisfactory \ngrade from this new biennial review. If the center is not fulfilling \nits expectation for assistance of manufacturing technology, then it \nwill fail its review and will not be able to receive Federal funding.\n  The Advanced Technology Program has been improved under this \nlegislation. Large companies will no longer be able to participate as \nsingle applicants. They must partner with one or more small businesses \nin order to be eligible to apply for an ATP grant. This provision \nmaximizes the benefit of this program by encouraging the transfer of \ntechnology and expertise from large businesses to the most dynamic \nsection of our economy--small business. The legislation also takes \nsteps to ensure that ATP does not displace private venture capital. \nfinally, the bill takes an important step to continued evaluation and \npossible evolution of the program. It instructs the Department of \nCommerce to commission the National Academy of Sciences to study the \neffectiveness of the Advanced Technology Program. In addition the study \nwill investigate alternative methods for the Federal Government to help \nkeep U.S. businesses competitive.\n  Finally, the TA NIST reauthorization bill creates a new educational \nresource for the country. There has never been a time in our country's \nhistory when science and technology has been more important. It is \nplaying an increasingly critical role in our economy, and most of all \nto our economic future. It is all too clear that our children are not \nwell enough prepared to take their places as part of the world's \nscientific leaders. As the recent NAEP and TIMSS science results show, \nthere is a gap between our children's science abilities and those from \nother countries. In this bill, we have created the Teacher Science and \nTechnology Enhancement Institute Program to help bridge that gap. The \nprogram is structured to afford primary and secondary educators the \nchance to become reacquainted with science. Armed with fresh \nexperiences, the teachers will be better equipped to excite our \nchildren about technology and scientific inquiry. This is an investment \nthat we cannot afford to pass up.\n  I believe that this legislation embodies the concept of wise \nstewardship. The bill reflects input that we have received from my \ncolleagues in the Senate, the House and the administration. More \nimportantly, we have heard from constituents from my own State of \nTennessee, as well as businesses, professional groups and academia from \naround the country. I am sure that the result will not please everyone. \nI believe, however, that it represents a necessary step in the constant \nevolution of these Federal programs. I take my congressional oversight \nobligations extremely seriously. Creating responsible, fair, timely \nauthorizing legislation is a key part of that obligation. I believe \nthat this legislation meets these requirements. I hope you will join me \nin honoring our obligation to the American people by supporting this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues \nSenator Frist, Senator Hollings, Senator Burns in introducing \nlegislation to reauthorize the programs of the Technology \nAdministration for fiscal years 1998 and 1999. This bill reauthorizes \nthe Office of Science and Technology Policy as well as the NIST labs \nand facilities about the President's budget request. It also funds the \nAdvanced Technology Program at $198 million and the Manufacturing \nExtension Program at $111 million.\n  It is noteworthy that after several hearings on ATP, and after \nassessing Secretary of Commerce Daley's detailed review of the program, \nwe are now putting forward a bill that continues to authorize this \nimportant form of investment in America's economic competitiveness. As \nI, along with many others in this Chamber, have stated before, this \nprogram supports American industry's own efforts to develop new, \ncutting-edge technologies which create the new industries and jobs of \nthe 21st century.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that ATP does not, and I repeat, does not \nfund the development of commercial products. Instead, this program \nprovides matching funds to both individual companies and joint ventures \nfor pre-product research on high-risk technologies which have the \npotential to place U.S. industry as the leader in new industrial areas. \nThis high-risk, high-reward strategy has already led to the creation of \nnew U.S. industries based on information transfer, biotechnology, and \nnew materials synthesis.\n  In spite of the merits of this program ATP has been criticized by \nsome Members for the past 4 years of the program's 6 years of \nexistence. This year Secretary Daley undertook a 60-day review to \nassess the ATP's performance and evaluate these criticisms. The \nDepartment of Commerce solicited comments from more than 3,500 \ninterested parties and took into account comments provided by both \ncritics and supporters of the program. fact, Senators Lieberman, \nDomenici, Frist and I joined together and provided one of the 80-plus \ncomments the Department received. I would like to take a moment and \ncommend Secretary Daley for the job he did in undertaking this review. \nAs we all know, there is not a department or program that can't be \nimproved. And as a long time and avid supporter of ATP I believe, that \nafter 6 years of operation, experience would suggest that there should \nbe some areas that can be improved. This review has done just that. The \nrecommendations that Secretary Daley has put forth further strengthens \na strong and productive program. I agree with his suggestion to place \nmore emphasis on small and medium-size single applicants, joint-\nventures, and consortia. This bill adopts that recommendation by \namending the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act to \ndefine a large business as one with gross annual revenues in excess of \n$2.5 billion and prohibits such businesses from participating in ATP \nprograms as single applicants.\n  In addition, I was pleased to see the added emphasis by the Secretary \non the need for an EPSCoT program, based on the EPSCoR model, which \nwould enhance technology development in the 18 States that have \ntraditionally been under-represented in Federal R funding. EPSCoT \nwould provide the opportunity for States which have been able to build \ninfrastructure capable of supporting high-tech research to use this \ninfrastructure to its maximum advantage. Studies have shown that \nstrengthening the competitive performance of research laboratories, \nusually universities, in an underdeveloped area, which is the purpose \nof EPSCoR, is often not sufficient to establish new, high-tech \ncompanies. EPSCoT seeks to assist in technology\n\n[[Page S11294]]\n\ntransfer to the local economy by encouraging links between \nuniversities, local businesses, and local and State governments. Unlike \nATP, which focuses on the national economic interest in research and \ndevelopment, EPSCoT focuses on allowing under-represented States the \nopportunity to participate in the technological revolution that is \nsweeping the global economy. In order to help the success of the \nprogram, Governors, business leaders and researchers were consulted \nabout the importance of technology transfer for economic development. \nThis bill provides statutory language to implement the Secretary's \nproposal of creating the EPSCoT program.\n  Secretary Daley's review could not have been done at a better time. \nAfter 6 years of existence, a thorough and complete review of the \nprocess has shown that is it competently managed, produces positive \nresults and has been working to achieve it's stated objectives. The \nproposals set forth in this review strengthen a very strong program \nthat is one of the cornerstones to the Nation's long-term economic \nprosperity. The bill we are introducing today provides the necessary \nchanges to existing law to implement many of the recommendations. I \nencourage my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE:\n  S. 1326. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for Medicaid coverage of all certified nurse practitioners and \nclinical nurse specialists services; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                   THE MEDICAID NURSING INCENTIVE ACT\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Medicaid \nNursing Incentive Act, a bill to provide direct Medicaid reimbursement \nfor nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists.\n  This legislation eliminates a groundless and counterproductive \nanomaly in Medicaid payment policy. Under current law, State Medicaid \nprograms can exclude certified nurse practitioners and clinical nurse \nspecialists from Medicaid reimbursement, even though these \npractitioners are fully trained to provide many of the same services as \nthose provided by primary care physicians. This loophole is both \ndiscriminatory and shortsighted; it severs a critical access link for \nMedicaid beneficiaries.\n  The ultimate goal of this proposal is to enhance the availability of \ncost-effective primary care to our Nation's most needy citizens.\n  Studies have documented the fact that millions of Americans each year \ngo without the health care services they need, because physicians \nsimply are not available to care for them. This problem plagues rural \nand urban areas alike, in parts of the country as diverse as south \ncentral Los Angeles and Lemmon, SD.\n  Medicaid beneficiaries are particularly vulnerable, since in recent \nyears an increasing number of health professionals have chosen not to \ncare for them or have been unwilling to locate in the inner-city and \nrural communities where many of the beneficiaries live. Fortunately, \nthere is an exception to this trend: nurse practitioners and clinical \nnurse specialists frequently accept patients whom others will not treat \nand serve in areas where others refuse to work.\n  Studies have shown that nurse practitioners and clinical nurse \nspecialists provide care that both patients and cost cutters can \npraise. Their advanced clinical training enables them to assume \nresponsibility for up to 80 percent of the primary care services \nusually performed by physicians, many times at a lower cost and with a \nhigh level of patient satisfaction.\n  Congress has already recognized the expanding contributions of nurse \npractitioners and clinical nurse specialists. For more than a decade, \nCHAMPUS has provided direct payment to nurse practitioners. In 1990, \nCongress mandated direct payment for nurse practitioner services under \nthe Federal employee health benefits plan. The Medicare Program, which \nalready covers nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialist \nservices in rural areas, was modified under this year's Balance Budget \nAct to provide coverage for these services in all geographic areas. The \nbill I am introducing today establishes the same payment policy under \nMedicaid.\n  Mr. President, the ramifications of this issue extend beyond the \nMedicaid Program and its beneficiaries: there is a broader lesson here \nthat applies to our search to make cost-effective, high-quality health \ncare services available and accessible to all Americans.\n  One of the cornerstones of this kind of care is the expansion of \nprimary and preventative care, delivered to individuals in convenient, \nfamiliar places where they live, work, and go to school. More than 2 \nmillion of our Nation's nurses currently provide care in these sites--\nin home health agencies, nursing homes, ambulatory care clinics, and \nschools.\n  In places like South Dakota, nurses are often the only health care \nprofessionals available in the small towns and rural counties across \nthe State.\n  These nurses and other nonphysician health professionals play an \nimportant role in the delivery of care. And, this role will increase as \nwe move from a system that focuses on the costly treatment of illness \nto one that emphasizes primary and preventive care and health \npromotion.\n  But, first, we must reevaluate outdated attitudes and break down \nbarriers that prevent nurses from using the full range of their \ntraining and skills in caring for patients. In 1994, the Pew Health \nProfessions Commission concluded that nurse practitioners are not being \nfully utilized to deliver primary care services. The commission \nrecommended eliminating fiscal discrimination by paying nurse \npractitioners directly for the services they provide. This step will \nhelp nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists expand access \nto the primary care that so many communities currently lack.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will support the measure I am \nintroducing today, recognizing the critical role that nurse \npractitioners and other nonphysician health professionals play in our \nhealth care delivery system, and the increasingly significant \ncontribution they can make in the future. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe full text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1326\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to grant normal trade relations status to the \nPeople's Republic of China on a permanent basis upon the accession of \nthe People's Republic of China to the World Trade Organization; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                 the china trade relations act of 1997\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today for myself and Senators Hagel, \nThomas, John Kerry, and Akaka to introduce legislation that will grant \nnormal trade relations to the People's Republic of China on a permanent \nbasis when China accedes to the World Trade Organization.\n  Today, President Jiang arrives in Washington for the first bilateral \nsummit in 8 years. Exchange at the highest levels is critical to the \nmaintenance of\n\n[[Page S11295]]\n\nany of our important bilateral relationships. It is even more crucial \nin our relationship with the world's largest country, fastest growing \neconomy, and most important rising power.\n  Mr. President, this body has spent a great deal of energy debating \nUnited States policy toward China, cresting each year with the struggle \nover renewal of normal trade relations. I have always supported such \nrenewal, and viewed the annual debate as a singularly unproductive \nmeans of moving the United States toward a coherent China policy. I say \nthat because, besides regular high-level exchange, normal trade \nrelations with China are essential to any coherent China policy, one \nthat keeps our economy strong and engages Beijing in constructive \nreform.\n  Currently, the United States is negotiating with China over the \npackage of measures Beijing must implement to comply with the strict \nmarket-based rules of the World Trade Organization. Until the United \nStates is satisfied with commitments from China on such issues as lower \ntariff levels and enhanced market access, and assured that Beijing can \nand will carry out those commitments, China will not gain entry to the \nWTO.\n  The concessions China must make to gain United States approval are \nsignificant and will dramatically affect large segments of China's \neconomy. The single most important economic benefit Beijing will derive \nfrom membership in the World Trade Organization is permanent normal \ntrade relations--also known as most-favored-nation trading status--with \nevery other WTO member. As a practical matter, however, every member \neconomy of the World Trade Organization, except the United States, has \nalready conferred on China permanent normal trade relations. Moreover, \nthe United States has provided normal trade relations to China 1 year \nat a time for more than 15 years. However, until China is specifically \nremoved from the limitations of title IV of the Trade Act of 1974, \nBeijing cannot receive permanent normal trade relations from the United \nStates, whatever China's status in the WTO.\n  The resulting ambiguity over China's trade status with the United \nStates hinders Beijing's willingness to make the significant \nconcessions necessary to complete a commercially viable WTO accession \npackage. A clear signal from the United States that China will, in \nfact, gain permanent normal trade relations upon its accession to the \nWorld Trade Organization will provide Beijing an incentive to make \nthose concessions.\n  Mr. President, it is crucial that we understand that China's \nmembership in the WTO under commercially viable terms is wholly in the \ninterest of the United States. That is because China will be forced to \nopen its markets significantly to American trade and investment. And \nmore fully open markets represent the best approach to reducing our \ncurrent trade deficit with China. China's membership in the World Trade \nOrganization will also make Beijing fully subject to the market-\noriented disciplines of the WTO. Finally, our bilateral trade disputes \nwith China will be subject to multilateral resolution mechanisms, in \naddition to the means we already have available under United States \ntrade law.\n  China is the world's 10th largest trading country. It is the largest \neconomy not in the World Trade Organization. Regardless of its WTO \nstatus, China will have a major influence on the future development of \nthe world trading system. I believe the time has come for Congress to \nrecognize the importance of integrating China into the global economy.\n  Our bilateral economic relationship is the most important means we \nhave of integrating China fully into the world economy and the \ninternational political order. The United States is one of the top five \nsources of foreign investment in China. That investment is not limited \nto the special economic zones, but now takes place throughout China and \nacross every major industry. Our businesses are linked in investment \nand in trading relationships that provide a vehicle for common effort \nand common understanding at the most practical and personal levels.\n  China also represents a growing economic and political influence in a \nregion of critical importance to the United States. The Asia-Pacific \nregion now represents over 40 percent of world trade and 53 percent of \nworld gross national product. Trans-Pacific trade is more than twice as \nlarge as trans-Atlantic trade. The Asia-Pacific region economies, \nincluding the United States and China, are becoming increasingly \ninterdependent. The region now represents the largest market for United \nStates exports--over $130 billion by some estimates. The predicate to \nour ability to encourage China to play a constructive role in the \nregion is our willingness to redefine our bilateral economic \nrelationship through the WTO accession process and the normalization of \nour trade relations under United States law.\n  A China more fully immersed in global capitalism is more likely to \nbehave in ways compatible with American interests and international \nnorms. We have seen this reality throughout Asia as countries have made \nmajor reforms in opening their economies and joined us at the table of \ndemocratic freedom. Moreover, without permanent normal trade relations, \nnot only will we have less influence over the role China chooses to \nplay on the global stage, we will also be left on the sidelines of \nChina's economic growth.\n  We cannot passively accept abuses of human rights, religious \npersecution, or the many other problems we have with China that must be \naddressed and corrected. But neither must we neglect the many issues \nand problems where our interests converge, including the stability in \nthe Asia Pacific that undergirds the region's economic growth, peaceful \nresolution of the urgent troubles on the Korean Peninsula, and \naddressing the transnational concerns posed by environmental \ndegradation, narcotics trafficking, and crime.\n  A relationship premised on cooperation in areas of shared interest \nalso provides us a better opportunity to discourage Beijing from \ntransferring missiles and other arms to Iran, Iraq, Burma, and other \nrogue regimes, persuade China to reduce tensions in the Taiwan Straits, \nand encourage Beijing to maintain freedoms in Hong Kong and foster \ngreater human rights in China.\n  Mr. President, Congress and the American people must understand what \nis at stake in the bilateral relationship and how best to move China in \na direction that is in our best interest and the best interest of the \nAmerican and Chinese people. The summit taking place this week and this \nlegislation, I believe, can provide the United States and China the \nimpetus to move toward a far more mutually productive relationship.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join with the \ndistinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, as an \noriginal cosponsor to his legislation to strengthen the President's \nhand in opening up China's market to American exports. I commend \nChairman Roth for his leadership on trade issues. This bill would \nextend permanent most-favored-nation trading status to China upon that \ncountry's accession to membership of the World Trade Organization under \ncommercially viable terms.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the annual debate over so-called most-\nfavored-nation trading status for China has become counterproductive. \nIt is time for the United States and China to transcend this flawed \nprocess. It is time for trade relations between our two countries to be \nbased on the normal commercial standards that one would expect between \ntwo of the world's great trading powers.\n  This legislation would greatly strengthen the President's hand in \nachieving trade negotiations with China. It would do this by giving the \nPresident the authority to grant China permanent MFN status upon that \ncountry's accession to the WTO under normal commercial arrangements. As \nlong as the Congress merely promises to consider granting permanent MFN \nstatus after China has agreed to accept WTO obligations, the \nPresident's leverage in trade negotiations with China will be weakened.\n  I would like to emphasize that I do not support China's entry into \nthe World Trade Organization under any special arrangement that would \nallow China to avoid full compliance with WTO standards. However, \nChina's accession to the WTO under normal commercial arrangements would \nbe good\n\n[[Page S11296]]\n\nfor the United States and good for the world trading system. It would \nrequire China to adhere to international trading standards. And should \nChina fail to live up to its WTO obligations, we would then have access \nto the WTO's multilateral dispute resolution mechanisms. As long as \nChina remains outside of the WTO, our only recourse for resolving our \ntrade disputes with China is through the threat of often less effective \nbilateral actions, such as threats of section 301 trade sanctions.\n  But once China becomes a member of the WTO under a viable commercial \nprotocol, the rules of the WTO require other WTO nations to grant \npermanent MFN to China. If we do not, we lose much of the benefit of \ngetting China to accept WTO rules. This is because the United States \nwould be denied access to the WTO's dispute resolution process for \nforcing China to live up to its agreements. That is why this bill is so \nimportant.\n  There are a great number of common misunderstanding over the annual \ndebate on so-called most-favored-nation trading status for China. First \nof all, the archaic term ``most favored nation'' is itself misleading. \nMFN status is not, as many believe, some special trade benefit. It is \nnot even the most favored trading status that we maintain with other \ncountries. The United States grants much more favorable trade status to \nmany other countries, including Canada, Israel, Mexico, the countries \nof the Caribbean, and a host of other nations--more than 130 in all--\nthat benefit from special trade programs. All MFN status means is that \nwe are willing to maintain some semblance of regular trade relations \nwith that country. This is demonstrated by the fact that only six \ncountries in the world do not have MFN status.\n  What is more, under current trade laws, there is no middle ground \nbetween full MFN trading status with average tariffs of 4 percent, and \nthe disastrous 1930's-era Smoot-Hawley tariffs that average over 50 \npercent. Let there be no doubt about the consequences of repealing MFN \ntrading status for China: it would mean a virtual end to United States-\nChina trade relations.\n  United States trade with China is important. Throughout the ages, \ncommerce has been a driving force of modernity and the spread of \nwestern ideas. Withdrawing from China will not bring the kind of change \nwe are all seeking in that still autocratic system. Isolating China \neconomically would have a disastrous and counterproductive result.\n  Nevertheless, there are serious trade issues between the United \nStates and China that need to be resolved. This bill will make their \nresolution more likely. Nebraska is a major exporting state, with total \nexports last year of $2.45 billion of which $1.5 billion was food or \nagricultural products. Nebraska's meat exports to the world, primarily \nbeef, grew 89 percent in the first half of this decade. United States \nbeef exports to China, however, are severely constrained by China's 80 \npercent tariffs. These levels must come down in the context of the WTO \nnegotiations. China also maintains a wide range of trade restrictions \nthat are illegal under WTO rules. These illegal trade barriers include \nunscientific health laws that entirely prohibit certain types of U.S. \nwheat exports.\n  Mr. President, aggressive United States efforts to negotiate China's \nentry into the WTO under normal commercial arrangements is clearly in \nour national interest. The United States continues to run a large, \npersistent trade deficit with China. Last year, our deficit reached $39 \nbillion, and it is expected to be higher this year. But the way to \nreduce that deficit is not by closing off our borders and cutting off \nexport markets, but to work aggressively to open those markets, \nparticularly the China market.\n  Export jobs pay 13-16 percent more than average American jobs. \nExports are the future of our Nation, and we need to have China's \nmarket opened to American goods, services, and agricultural \ncommodities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 1328. A bill to amend the Communications Satellite Act of 1962 to \npromote competition and privatization in satellite communications, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n THE COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITE COMPETITION AND PRIVATIZATION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I introduce the Communications \nSatellite Competition and Privatization Act of 1997. This bill amends \nthe Communications Satellite Act of 1962 in order to promote full \ncompetition in the global satellite communication services market by \nfully privatizing satellite communications. It is my intention that the \nintroduction of this bill in the Senate will spur debate on this \nimportant issue. It is my goal to work with all of my colleagues and \nall other interested parties to address the issues presented in this \nbill.\n  In 1962, the United States and other countries around the world \nrecognized the increasingly important role the new and emerging \nsatellite technology could play in facilitating worldwide \ncommunications. In enacting the Communications Satellite Act of 1962, \nCongress sought to improve the global communications network by \nimplementing a global, commercial communications satellite system, \nexpeditiously. INTELSAT, Inmarsat, and Comsat emerged as the network \nthat would connect Americans to countries throughout the world.\n  INTELSATE, Inmarsat, and Comsat have undoubtedly fulfilled their \nmissions and have provided us with valuable services. Through their \ncommunications network, they have connected us whether we are on land \nor on water, by voice, video, and data transmissions, and across \ncontinents. They have also played a pivotal role in pioneering the \ndelivery of satellite communications.\n  However, in the 35 years since the act has been adopted, the \nmarketplace has changed and the time is now ripe for us to revisit the \nact and put in place a policy that will take the industry and the \nAmerican consumers into the future. Today, many U.S. and foreign \nsatellite systems participate in the global satellite marketplace. \nThere are also an increasing number of satellite systems seeking \nauthority to participate in the marketplace. As additional satellite \nsystems enter the marketplace, competition must continue to flourish \nand consumers must obtain needed services at reasonable prices. The \ntreaty-based status and intergovernmental structure of INTELSAT, \nInmarsat, and Comsat must not hinder the ability of these carriers to \neffectively compete in the future and must not distort competition in \nthe marketplace.\n  Today, many individuals in the government and in industry, nationally \nand worldwide are working on the privatization of INTELSAT and \nInmarsat. There is a recognition that the status quo will not benefit \nthe marketplace nor will it benefit INTELSAT and Inmarsat, or Comsat. \nMy introduction of this bill is intended to establish a framework in \nwhich the Senate can begin a larger discussion of the issues and \nultimately craft legislation that promotes the delivery of state-of-\nthe-art satellite communications and brings innovations and cost \nreductions to the public. I encourage my colleagues to join with me in \nsupporting a policy that will continue to allow our satellite industry \nto grow and flourish and for consumers to receive the benefits of such \nadvancements.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1328\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to laud the Senate \npassage of H.R. 672. This legislation, which was introduced by \nCongressman Coble in the House of Representatives, is the counterpart \nto legislation I introduced in the Senate on March 20 of this year--the \nCopyright Clarification Act of 1997 (S. 506). The Copyright \nClarification Act was reported unanimously by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee on April 17.\n  The purpose of these bills is to make technical but needed changes to \nour Nation's copyright laws in order to ensure the effective \nadministration of our copyright system and the U.S. Copyright Office. \nThe need for these changes was first brought to my attention by the \nRegister of Copyrights, Marybeth Peters, and I want to thank her for \nher outstanding work.\n  Among the most important amendments made by H.R. 672 is a \nclarification of the Copyright Office's authority to increase its fees \nfor the first time since 1990 in order to help cover its costs and to \nreduce the impact of its services on the Federal budget and the \nAmerican taxpayer. This clarification is needed because of ambiguities \nin the Copyright Fees and Technical Amendments Act of 1989, which \nauthorized the Copyright Office to increase fees in 1995, and every \nfifth year thereafter. Because the Copyright Office did not raise its \nfees in 1995, as anticipated, there has been some uncertainty as to \nwhether the Copyright Office may increase its fees again before 2000 \nand whether the baseline for calculating the increase in the consumer \nprice index is the date of the last actual fee settlement, 1990, or the \ndate of the last authorized fee settlement, 1995. H.R. 672 clarifies \nthat the Copyright Office may increase its fees in any calendar year, \nprovided it has not done so within the last 5 years, and that the fees \nmay be increased up to the amount required to cover the reasonable \ncosts incurred by the Copyright Office.\n  Although H.R. 672 does not require the Copyright Office to increase \nits fees to cover all its costs, I believe it is important in that it \nprovides the Copyright Office the statutory tools to become self-\nsustaining--a concept that I promoted in the last Congress. Currently \nthe Copyright Office does not recover the full cost of its services \nthrough fees, but instead receives some $10 million in annual \nappropriations.\n  Several studies have supported full-cost recovery for the Copyright \nOffice. For example, A 1996 Booz-Allen and Hamilton management review \nof the Library of Congress recommended that the Copyright Office pursue \nfull-cost recovery, noting that the Copyright Office has been subject \nto full-cost recovery in the past and that the potential revenues to be \nderived from pursuing a fee-based service was significant. A 1996 \ninternal Copyright Office management report prepared by the Library of \nCongress also recommended full-cost recovery for copyright services. \nThe Congressional Budget Office has also suggested full-cost recovery \nfor the Copyright Office as a means of achieving deficit reduction. \nThese recommendations were endorsed by the General Accounting Office in \nits recent report, Intellectual Property, Fees Are Not Always \nCommensurate with the Costs of Service.\n\n  It is my understanding that the Copyright Office has embraced the \ngoal of achieving full-cost recovery for its copyright services. H.R. \n672 will provide the authority to achieve that goal, and by passing \nthis legislation this year, the Copyright Office will be able to move \nexpeditiously to adjust their fees for the coming year.\n  I also want to note the importance of the amendment which the Senate \nhas adopted to H.R. 672 to overturn the Ninth Circuit's decision in La \nCienega Music Co. v. ZZ Top, 53 F.3d 950 (9th Cir. 1995), cert denied, \n116 S. Ct. 331 (1995). My colleagues will recall that Senator Leahy and \nI introduced this legislation in March of this year as a provision of \nS. 505, the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1997.\n  In general, La Cienega held that distributing a sound recording to \nthe public--by sale, for example--is a publication of the music \nrecorded on it under the 1909 Copyright Act. Under the 1909 act, \npublication without copyright notice caused loss of copyright \nprotection. Almost all music that was first published on recordings did \nnot contain copyright notice, because publishers believed that it was \nnot technically a publication. The Copyright Office also considered \nthese musical compositions to be unpublished. The effect of La Cienega, \nhowever, is that virtually all music before 1978 that was first \ndistributed to the public on recordings has no copyright protection--at \nleast in the Ninth Circuit.\n  By contrast, the Second Circuit in Rosette v. Rainbo Record \nManufacturing Corp., 546 F.2d 461 (2d Cir. 1975), aff'd per curiam, 546 \nF.2d 461 (2d Cir. 1976) has held the opposite--that publish \ndistribution of recordings was not a publication of the music contained \non them. As I have noted, Rosette comports with the nearly universal \nunderstanding of the music and sound recording industries and of the \nCopyright Office.\n  Since the Supreme Court has denied cert in La Cienega, whether one \nhas copyright in thousands of musical compositions depends on whether \nthe case is brought in the Second or Ninth Circuits. This situation is \nintolerable. Overturning the La Cienega decision will restore national \nuniformity on this important issue by confirming the wisdom of the \ncustom and usage of the affected industries and of the Copyright Office \nfor nearly 100 years.\n  In addition to these two important provisions, H.R. 672 will: First, \ncorrect drafting errors in the Satellite Home Viewer Act of 1994, which \nresulted from the failure to take into account the recent changes made \nby the Copyright Tribunal Reform Act of 1993, and which mistakingly \nreversed the rates set by a 1992 Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel \nfor satellite carriers; second, clarify ambiguities in the Copyright \nRestoration Act dealing with the restoration of copyright protection \nfor certain works under the 1994 Uruguay Round Agreements Act; third, \nensure that rates established in 1996 under the Digital Performance \nRights in Sound Recordings Act will not lapse in the event that the \nCopyright Arbitration Royalty Panel does not conclude rate-setting \nproceedings prior to December\n\n[[Page S11302]]\n\n1, 2000; fourth, restore definitions of jukebox and jukebox operator, \nwhich were mistakingly omitted when the old jukebox compulsory license \nwas replaced with the current negotiated jukebox license; fifth, revise \nthe currently unworkable requirement of a 10-day advanced notice of \nintent to copyright the fixation of live performances, such as sporting \nevents; sixth, clarify administrative issues regarding the operation of \nthe Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels; seventh, provide needed \nflexibility for the Librarian of Congress in setting the negotiation \nperiod for the distribution of digital audio recording technology \n[DART] royalties; and, eighth, make miscellaneous spelling, \ngrammatical, capitalization, and other corrections to the Copyright \nAct.\n  Mr. President, this is important legislation, and I am pleased the \nSenate has acted to approve it prior to adjourning this fall. I wish to \nthank my colleagues and to encourage the House to accept the Senate \namendment and to forward H.R. 672 to the President for his signature \nwithout delay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/28/senate-section/article/S11301-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AWARDING THE CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL TO THE ``LITTLE ROCK NINE''\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. \n1283, legislation to award the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest \nhonor Congress can bestow upon civilians for acts of public service and \npatriotism, to those civil rights leaders history will remember as the \n``Little Rock Nine.''\n  As all of my colleagues are aware, on September 25, 1957, nine young \nstudents, in the face of unspeakable hostility and hatred, voluntarily \nintegrated Central High School in Little Rock, AK. In doing so, they \nconfronted not only an angry mob assembled in fierce opposition, but \nalso an entrenched culture of bigotry and racism.\n  In today's day and age, lofty terms like valor, heroism, and bravery \nare used so frequently and in such a casual context the proper impact \nof their meaning has unfortunately been devalued. However, it is \nsometimes within the most ordinary acts, such as a child's steps \nthrough a schoolhouse door, in which the most extraordinary instances \nof courage can be found.\n  Jean Brown Trickey, Carlotta Walls LaNier, Melba Patillo Beals, \nTerrence Roberts, Gloria Ray Karlmark, Thelma Mothershed Wair, Ernest \nGreen, Elizabeth Eckford, and Jefferson Thomas are all civil rights \npioneers. In addition, however, to serving as national symbols as \nracial progress, each deserve individual recognition for the dignity \nand grace they displayed on that September morning 40 years ago.\n  Mr. President, awarding the Congressional Gold Medal to the ``Little \nRock Nine'' would provide this long overdue honor to these exceptional \npeople. As a U.S. Senator, it is my pleasure to cosponsor this \nlegislation. As an American, it is my privilege to have the opportunity \nto say thank you to nine men and women who, in pursuit of their own \neducation, taught the rest of the nation an invaluable lesson about \nracial equality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/28/senate-section/article/S11302-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DeWINE.

Mr. President, I take the Senate floor today to mark \nthe anniversary of a noble and courageous effort made on behalf of our \nNation by some of the brave residents, of our then very young State of \nKansas.\n  Mr. President, 135 years ago today in the year 1862, the first Kansas \ncolored infantry were the first union black troops of the Civil War to \nengage in combat--October 28th and 29th at Island Mound, or Toothman's \nMound, near the town of Butler in Bates County, MO, near my hometown.\n  The intrepid first Kansas colored infantry's contribution at \nToothman's Mound helped prompt President Abraham Lincoln to issue the \nEmancipation Proclamation barely 2 months later and inspired hundreds \nof thousands of other black soldiers to take up arms in the cause of \nUnion and free soil--undoubtedly influencing the outcome of that war \nand perhaps proving decisive in preserving government of the people, by \nthe people, and for the people in the world as we know it.\n  Let me emphasize, the survival of our experiment in self-government \nwas at stake, and these individuals paid the price to ensure that our \nConstitution would not perish from the Earth.\n  One of the easy mistakes when reading history is to assume that the \noutcome of great struggles was inevitable. This is not so. History is \ncontingent, dependent on the choices and actions of real people. Things \nmight have been very different if a few brave people hadn't acted as \nthey did.\n  Without the sacrifice of our Founders we might never have known \nindependence, certainly not in the form we now enjoy--and without the \nsacrifices of subsequent generations, most especially of people like \nthose who served in the first Kansas colored infantry, our forebearers \nmost precious gift--liberty under law--would be lost.\n  Mr. President the example of service, dedication, and courage set by \nthe first Kansas colored infantry at the very moment of our Nation's \ngreatest need should be always with us as we carry on our work here in \nthe crucible of liberty.\n  Mr. President, those soldiers had reason to doubt America's promise \nof liberty and justice for all. But when freedom called they answered, \nand we are forever in their debt.\n  In these often selfish and cynical times, we should pause and \nthankfully remember the first Kansas colored infantry. The blows they \nstruck for freedom and Union, place us forever in their debt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/28/senate-section/article/S11303-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--NOMINATION OF WILLIAM E.
