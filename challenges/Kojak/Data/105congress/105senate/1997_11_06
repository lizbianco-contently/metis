Mr. President, this morning, the Senate will debate the \nnomination of Ronald Lee Gilman, of Tennessee, to be a U.S. circuit \njudge for the sixth circuit. At the conclusion of debate, at \napproximately 9:40 a.m., the Senate will conduct a rollcall vote on the \nconfirmation of the nomination. Following that vote, the Senate will \ndebate the conference report to accompany H.R. 1119, the Department of \nDefense authorization bill, for up to 4 hours, as under the previous \norder. So we assume then that vote will occur on or about 2 o'clock. \nAlso under the order, a vote on the adoption of the conference report \nwill occur at the expiration of time. Again, we assume that will be \naround 2 o'clock.\n  Amtrak reform, D.C. appropriations bill, the FDA reform conference \nreport, the intelligence authorization conference report and any other \nadditional legislative or executive items that can be cleared will be \ntaken up. I understand that we are just about ready to call up the D.C. \nappropriations bill. I think that there was an FDA conference report \nyesterday. Hopefully, they resolved their problems. After the DOD \nauthorization bill, we then should be able to move to the intelligence \nconference report. We will also continue to try to move Executive \nCalendar nominations. I believe yesterday we moved about 20 \nnominations. We will have a vote this morning on Mr. Gilman to be a \nsixth circuit court judge. We should expect to have further votes \nduring the day in addition to the two at 9:40 a.m. and approximately 2 \no'clock. We will advise Members when a time is set for future votes. I \nyield the floor, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/06/senate-section/article/S11795-5", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback).

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \ngo into executive session and proceed to the consideration of the \nnomination of Ronald Lee Gilman, of Tennessee, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Ronald Lee \nGilman, of Tennessee, to be U.S. circuit judge for the sixth circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 10 minutes debate on the \nnomination.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand that on the nomination, there \nis 5 minutes reserved to a side, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I don't see the distinguished chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee, so I will take the 5 minutes on this side.\n  Obviously, this is a case where, I assume, Ronald Gilman will be \nconfirmed, and I congratulate him.\n  I am pleased that the majority leader has decided to take up the \nnomination of Ronald L. Gilman to be a judge for the Sixth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. Mr. Gilman currently works as a partner for Farris, \nMathews, Gilman, Branan & Hellen, P.L.C. in Memphis, TN, an adjunct \nprofessor of trial advocacy for the University of Memphis Law School, \nan arbitrator and mediator for the American Arbitration Association in \nNashville, TN, an arbitrator and mediator for the National Association \nof Securities Dealers in Chicago, IL, and as a dalkon shield referee \nfor the Private Adjudication Center in Cary, NC. The ABA gave Mr. \nGilman its highest evaluation--a unanimous well qualified rating.\n  In addition to his paid legal service, Mr. Gilman currently \nvolunteers on behalf of the Memphis, TN and American Bar Associations, \nthe Association of Attorney-Mediators and the Commercial Law \nAffiliates.\n  I congratulate Mr. Gilman and his family, and I look forward to his \nservice on the Sixth Circuit of the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals.\n  I am also delighted that the Judiciary Committee plans to consider 15 \njudicial nominations at its executive business meeting today. I am \nhopeful that these nominations may be considered by the full Senate \nbefore we adjourn for the year.\n  Mr. President, we have seen this time and time again where judges are \nheld up because people are concerned about them, we are told, and then \nwe have a rollcall vote on them and virtually every Senator votes for \nthem. I mention this because no matter how many times we are told that \nwe have to look very carefully at these judges, that they have concerns \nabout them, it is obvious the Senate is not concerned about them and \nthe Senate votes for them.\n  The same thing has happened with Bill Lann Lee. It is a case where \nthe whole Senate would vote for Bill Lann Lee, that he would be \nconfirmed overwhelmingly as Assistant Attorney General for the Civil \nRights Division, but a small ideological group has decided that while \nthey could not defeat Bill Lann Lee on the floor, a minority of the \nminority would try to defeat him and vote to block him in committee.\n  It seems the Republican leadership is determined to sacrifice Bill \nLann Lee to narrow ideological politics. If the Republican leadership \nwere to allow the Senate to vote on this outstanding nominee, a \nmajority of the Senate, Republicans and Democrats, would vote to \nconfirm him. Unfortunately, the press accounts this morning are that \nconservative Republicans have decided to block him by a minority of the \nminority. They have vowed not to allow this nomination to be considered \nby the Senate before adjournment this year.\n  This is not democracy. This is not the Senate at its best. This is \nthe Senate at its worst, twisting the rules. The reason the Republican \nleadership gives for trying to kill this nomination is that Bill Lann \nLee agrees with the President. It is not so much about Bill Lee as Bill \nClinton. The President won election, and he won reelection. For the \nSenate to refuse to proceed to this nomination because Mr. Lee honestly \ntestified that he would adhere to policies of equal justice consistent \nwith those of the President is wrong.\n  Mr. President, can we have order, please? I cannot hear myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be order in the body. Any \nconversations will please be taken off the floor. The Senator may \nproceed.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair. The Republican leaders were prodded \ninto this by the narrow ideological extreme right of their party and \nits allies. They have not brought forward their own bill on affirmative \naction. They want to talk about it, but they have not brought it \nforward because they know a majority of Republicans and Democrats would \nnot vote for it.\n  The Proposition 209 case is over. The Supreme Court has ruled on \nthat. The good people of Houston rejected efforts to abandon those \npreviously discriminated against. So there is nothing left for the \nextreme right except one trophy, and that trophy is Bill Lann Lee.\n  What kind of an example does this set? What kind of signal does this \nsend? Bill Lee's life story is an American success story. He is the son \nof immigrants who struggled against discrimination. His father fought \nwith the American forces in World War II. He spent his professional \ncareer working to solve civil rights problems and diffuse conflict. His \nrecord of achievement is exemplary. He is a man of integrity and honor, \nas even those opposing him have to concede.\n  When he said to the Judiciary Committee that quotas are illegal and \nwrong and he would enforce the law, no one should have any doubt about \nhis resolve to do what is right. He is a person with great problem-\nsolving skills. Such matters are too important to be used for political \npurposes or as wedge issues to divide people. What is promising about \nthis nomination is that Bill Lee is the person with the credentials, \ncredibility and creativity to help move America and all Americans \nforward.\n  Any fairminded review of his 23-year career shows him to be well-\nsuited to head the Civil Rights Division. It shows where he has been \nand where the law has been and how we have moved forward to refine \nremedial approaches to discrimination and its vestiges. One measure of \nthis extraordinary individual are the testimonies of support provided \nby so many of his litigation opponents over the years, support based on \nhis fairness and good sense, support from Democrats and Republicans \nalike.\n  Just this summer, the Senate moved forward to confirm another \nAssistant Attorney General, someone who had expressly declined to \nfollow the language of the Telecommunications Act House-Senate \nconference report and raised concerns among a number of Senators. We \nwere told that the standard to be employed in evaluating these nominees \nwas not to hold a nominee hostage to policy differences with the \nadministration but to vote for the nominee, if well-qualified, to \npermit the Justice Department to proceed with a confirmed division \nchief, and for us in Congress to move forward and work with the \nadministration in the formulation and implementation of effective \npolicies.\n  Unfortunately, with this nomination, that of the first Asian-American \nto head the Civil Rights Division, the rules are being changed and the \nstandards are being moved. First, it appeared that the Republicans \nwished to raise their concerns with the nominee and point out their \ndifferences with administration policy, as is traditionally done. Then \nthe focus was on Mr. Lee's possible involvement in Supreme Court \nconsideration of the California proposition 209 case. When Mr. Lee came \nforward and recused himself from involvement in that case, the \nsuggestion was made that the Department of Justice abstain from filing \na brief in that case should certiorari be granted.\n  That suggestion was properly rejected. Indeed, I would think that the \nSupreme Court would be likely to request the views of the U.S. \nGovernment if they were not tendered in an amicus brief. Surely \nimposition of this suggested gag rule on the United States on issues of \nsignificance and concern in\n\n[[Page S11797]]\n\norder to confirm a nominee who would not even be involved in \nformulating the U.S. position would have been ill-advised.\n  This week the Supreme Court denied review in the California \nproposition 209 case. If Bill Lee's recusal did not clear the way for \nhis confirmation surely, one would have thought, this action by the \nSupreme Court removed the immediate obstacle that had been fastened on \nby the opposition. Instead, the grounds for opposition shifted. It now \nappears that in order to be confirmed to lead the Civil Rights \nDivision, the nominee must not only commit to uphold the law but \ndisavow the President who has nominated him to serve in this \nadministration. Before we are done I expect that the nominee would be \nrequired to endorse S. 950, a bill that the Senate has not considered \nnor the Congress enacted.\n  I think it beneath Senators to suggest that this fine nominee ought \nbe rejected because a previous, unqualified Republican nominee had been \nrejected by the committee. Tit for tat may be the rule in the alley, \nbut should not govern the actions of the U.S. Senate. Nonetheless, \nthere seems to be a lot of pay back motivating those opposing this fine \nman.\n  I regret that a narrow, ideological litmus test is being proposed \nthat would require nominees to disavow remedies and approaches that the \nSupreme Court has held to be constitutional and necessary to enforce \nour commitment to equal opportunity. It is the administration's \ncommitment to affirmative action and equal justice that would have to \nbe sacrificed. I know that Bill Lee would not compromise his commitment \nto enforce the law and to seek equal justice for all Americans.\n  Moreover, if accepted by a partisan majority, that political litmus \ntest will know no natural limit. It could infect the confirmation of \nthe Associate Attorney General, the Solicitor General and all other \nnominations.\n  I regret that some have decided to oppose this good man. He would, in \nmy view, enforce the law, use his problem-solving skills and proven \nability to move the country forward and build on the progress that we \nhave been able to make in remedying past discrimination over the last \nseveral years. It appears now that for this nomination to prevail in \nCommittee it will take a profile in courage by a couple Republican \nmembers. I urge each member to consider his or her vote carefully and \nwhat it means for this nomination, for the country and for standards \nbeing created for future nominations.\n  There is a place to consider the important issues involved in the \ndebate over race relations in the country and the constitutionality of \naffirmative action that the Supreme Court has held to be \nconstitutional. That should not be the issue with respect to the vote \non this nominee, however.\n  When Bill Lee appeared before the Committee with his family he \ntestified candidly about his views, his work and his values. He \narticulated to us that he understands that as the Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for the Civil Rights Division his client is the United States \nand all of its people. He told us poignantly about why he became a \nperson who has dedicated his life to equal justice for all when he \nspoke of the treatment that his parents received as immigrants. Mr. Lee \ntold us how in spite of his father's personal treatment and \nexperiences, William Lee remained a fierce American patriot, \nvolunteered to serve in the United States Army Air Corps in World War \nII and never lost his belief in America.\n  He inspired his son just as Bill Lee now inspires his own children \nand countless others across the land. They are the kind of everyday \nheroes to whom we sing praises.\n  Mr. Lee told us:\n\n       ``My father is my hero, but I confess that I found it \n     difficult for many years to appreciate his unflinching \n     patriotism in the face of daily indignities. In my youth, I \n     did not understand how he could remain so deeply grateful to \n     a country where he and my mother faced so much intolerance. \n     But I began to appreciate that the vision he had of being an \n     American was a vision so compelling that he could set aside \n     the momentary ugliness. He knew that the basic American tenet \n     of equality of opportunity is the bedrock of our society.''\n\n  I know that Bill Lee will remain true to all that his father taught \nhim and hope that the momentary ugliness of people opposing his \nnomination based on an ideological litmus test of people distorting his \nachievements and beliefs and of some succumbing to narrow partisanship \nwill not be his reward for a career of good works. Such treatment \ndrives good people from public service and distorts the role of the \nSenate.\n  I have often referred to the Senate as acting at its best when it \nserves as the conscience of the Nation. In this case, I am afraid that \nthe Senate may show no conscience.\n  I call on the Senate's Republican leadership to end their targeting \nof Bill Lann Lee and to work with us to bring this nomination to the \nfloor without obstruction so that the Senate may vote and we may \nconfirm a fine person to lead the Civil Rights Division into the next \ncentury.\n  Why this exemplary Asian-American is singled out, a man who has shown \nfar more qualities than most people and could easily be confirmed, I \ncannot understand. To allow somebody's career, to allow somebody who \nhas lived the American dream, to allow somebody who has demonstrated \nwhat is best about this country, to allow the Senate to react to what \nis worst about this country in defeating him is absolutely wrong. It is \na shame on the Senate. It is a shame on the country. It is a shame on \nall of us if we allow this to happen. The worst part of that shame, Mr. \nPresident, is that if the Senate were allowed to vote on Bill Lann Lee, \nhe would be confirmed, because most Senators in both parties would not \nallow this shame to go on. Why an ideological ultraright would stop it \nI cannot understand.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that recent editorials on this \nmatter from the Los Angeles Times, the New York Times, and the \nWashington Post be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, Nov. 6, 1997]\n\nPolitics of the Partisan Kill--Hatch Plays the Executioner in the Bill \n                        Lee Confirmation Process\n\n       Sen. Orrin G. Hatch's manipulation of Bill Lann Lee's \n     confirmation process was a callous performance, nearly a \n     political beheading for no apparent reason beyond the fact \n     that Lee is President Clinton's choice as the nation's top \n     civil rights official.\n       The Utah Republican himself acknowledged Tuesday that Lee, \n     nominated to head the Justice Department's civil rights \n     division, is ``an able civil rights lawyer with a profoundly \n     admirable passion to improve the lives of many Americans.''\n       The GOP game seems to be to torpedo even the most \n     outstanding appointments out of petulance that the Democrat \n     in the White House has the nominating power. The Senate \n     Judiciary Committee, headed by Hatch, has turned to stalling \n     or harassment in the cases of many worthy nominees to the \n     federal bench, for instance; this continues at a time when \n     one in nine judgeships are vacant.\n       Lee, with 23 years of experience in civil rights law, is \n     well respected and qualified to do the job, but Hatch painted \n     the Los Angeles attorney as a poster boy for affirmative \n     action. Ridiculous.\n       The senator says that much of Lee's work has been devoted \n     to ``constitutionally suspect, race-conscious public policies \n     that ultimately distort and divide citizens by race.''\n       Distorted view of the law? Lee has worked long and \n     vigorously within the civil rights statutes to uphold the \n     law. He opposed California's Proposition 209 but has said he \n     would support the law of the land, including this week's \n     controversial U.S. Supreme Court decision to let stand \n     Proposition 209, California's ban on race and gender \n     preferences in public hiring and university admissions.\n       Hatch's opposition could doom Lee's appointment unless two \n     Republicans join the committee's eight Democrats in today's \n     scheduled vote on Lee, who would be the first Asian American \n     to manage the 250-lawyer division. Even if the Judiciary \n     Committee does not recommend Lee, the full Senate should get \n     the opportunity to vote on the nomination. Clinton \n     administration officials, who belatedly mounted a full-court \n     press for their nominee, believe that Lee could be confirmed \n     by a floor vote.\n       Barring that, Clinton could courageously circumvent the \n     Senate and put Lee in the job by making a ``recess \n     appointment'' after Congress shuts down Friday for its annual \n     Christmas break. Lee warrants Senate confirmation. He should \n     not be made a political scapegoat.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the New York Times Nov. 6, 1997]\n\n                       Affirmative Action in Play\n\n       The Supreme Court's most momentous decision of the current \n     term may turn out to be its refusal this week to hear a \n     challenge to the constitutionality of California's anti-\n     affirmative-action initiative, Proposition 209. The Court's \n     sidestep allows California to proceed unimpeded with its \n     rollback of remedies that are, regrettably, still needed to\n\n[[Page S11798]]\n\n     address the nation's persistent problem of race and gender \n     discrimination. It may also encourage other states to follow \n     California.\n       Had it taken the case, this Court might well have agreed \n     with the Ninth Circuit's decision upholding Proposition 209, \n     which applies to affirmative action programs in public \n     education, employment and contracting. But the opposing \n     arguments are also weighty and deserved a timely and \n     respectful airing by the justices.\n       In the absence of any guidance from the Supreme Court, the \n     nation is now embarking on a far-reaching legal and social \n     experiment that holds as much potential to exacerbate racial \n     differences as to minimize them. Clearly, many fair-minded \n     Americans are uncomfortable with race-based preferences. But \n     they cannot feel sanguine that alternative steps, such as \n     basing affirmative action on income instead of race, will be \n     adequate to preserve black access to the elite public \n     universities, and the career opportunities and higher pay \n     that follow from it.\n       The only encouraging development on this contentious issue \n     was seen in Houston, the nation's fourth-largest city, in \n     Tuesday's elections when voters defeated a measure similar to \n     Proposition 209 that would have prohibited affirmative action \n     in Houston's contracting and hiring. The heavy minority \n     turnout for the city's mayoral election was evidently a big \n     factor in mobilizing opposition, as was a clearly worded \n     measure that avoided inflammatory and misleading language. \n     Houston's retiring Mayor, Bob Lanier, a wealthy white \n     developer, did the nation a service by emphasizing the unfair \n     result if affirmative action were eliminated. ``Let's not \n     turn back the clock to the days when guys who look like me \n     got all the city's business,'' he urged voters.\n       It was hoped that the Supreme Court's refusal to take up \n     Proposition 209 would at least persuade Senator Orrin Hatch \n     to clear President Clinton's nomination of Bill Lann Lee as \n     Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. Earlier Mr. \n     Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, broached \n     the idea of trading Mr. Lee's confirmation for a promise from \n     the Administration not to file a brief with the Court in \n     support of the challenge. Once the 209 challenge was dead, \n     however, Mr. Hatch announced he would vote against Mr. Lee \n     anyway, based on his affirmative-action views.\n       Yet those views are also the President's, and no one, not \n     even Senator Hatch, disputes that Mr. Lee is well qualified. \n     Mr. Hatch seems to be abusing the confirmation process to \n     bolster his standing with the right wing of his party. \n     Sensible Republican senators need to join quickly with their \n     Democratic colleagues to make sure that Mr. Lee's nomination \n     survives this offensive kind of end-of-session maneuvering.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 24, 1997]\n\n                           The Lee Nomination\n\n       In July, the president nominated Bill Lann Lee, western \n     regional counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational \n     Fund, to be assistant attorney general for civil rights. The \n     post had then been vacant for half a year. On Wednesday, Mr. \n     Lee had his confirmation hearing. The nomination now should \n     be approved.\n       The choice of Mr. Lee has drawn some limited opposition, as \n     civil rights nominations by either party almost always seem \n     to do these days. In this case, however, even opponents, some \n     of them, have acknowledged that, from a professional \n     standpoint, Mr. Lee is qualified. The issue is not his \n     professional competence. The objection is rather to the views \n     of civil rights that he shares with the president, and which, \n     in the view of the critics, should disqualify him.\n       Mr. Lee's views appear to us to be well inside the bounds \n     of accepted jurisprudence. He is an advocate of affirmative \n     action, as you would expect of someone who has spent his \n     entire professional career--23 years--as a civil rights \n     litigator. The president has likewise generally been a \n     defender of such policies against strong political pressures \n     to the contrary. But Mr. Lee himself observed that the \n     assistant attorney general takes an oath to uphold the law as \n     set forth by the courts, and so he would. The range of \n     discretion in a job such as this is almost always less than \n     the surrounding rhetoric suggests.\n       Mr. Lee over his career has brought a considerable number \n     of lawsuits in behalf of groups claiming they were \n     discriminated against, and has sought and won resolutions \n     aimed at making the groups whole, somehow defined. It is that \n     kind of group resolution of such disputes that some people \n     object to, on grounds that the whole object of the exercise \n     should be to avoid labeling and treating people as members of \n     racial and other such groups. There is surely some reason for \n     the discomfort this group categorizing generates. But the \n     court's themselves continue to uphold such actions in limited \n     circumstances. And Mr. Lee has won a reputation for resolving \n     such cases sensibly. Los Angeles's Republican Mayor Richard \n     Riordan is one who supports the nomination. ``Mr. Lee first \n     became known to me as opposing counsel in an important civil \n     rights case concerning poor bus riders in Los Angeles,'' he \n     has written. ``The work of my opponents rarely evokes my \n     praises, but the negotiations could not have concluded \n     successfully without Mr. Lee's practical leadership and \n     expertise . . . Mr. Lee has practiced mainstream civil rights \n     law.''\n       There are lots of legitimate issues to be argued about in \n     connection with civil rights law. Mr. Lee's nomination is not \n     the right vehicle for resolving them. Senators, including \n     some who no doubt disagree with some of his views, complain \n     with cause about the continuing vacancies in high places at \n     the Justice Department. This is one they should fill before \n     they go home.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired as far as the amount of \ntime allocated on this nomination. There are 5 minutes controlled by \nthe majority. But the 5 minutes to the Senator's side has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is there time in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on the nomination of Mr. Gilman of \nTennessee.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks of the \nSenator from Vermont. This is a sad day. I have only been a Member of \nthis body for less than a year.\n  I cannot remember, though, any nominee who has come before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee who had a more compelling personal story about his \nlife and his family. Bill Lann Lee is an extraordinary man, the son of \nChinese immigrants. His parents came to this country penniless and \nstarted a hand laundry in New York.\n  His mother, who sat with him at the confirmation hearing, sat in the \nwindow of that hand laundry her entire life in front of a sewing \nmachine. His father, working in that hand laundry, refused to teach \nBill Lann Lee and his brother the skill of ironing clothes because he \nwas determined they would not follow him in his footsteps in that \nlaundry.\n  As Senator Leahy has said, Bill Lee's father, who could have been \ndeferred because of age from serving in World War II, volunteered, put \nhis life on the line, and came back with the experience of being \ntreated, as he said, ``as an American.'' That is what Bill Lee told us.\n  Then Bill Lee, given a chance to attend Yale and Columbia Law School, \ngraduated with high honors and, instead of going with a prestigious law \nfirm and making a lot of money, he devoted his life to finding \nopportunity and education and employment for everyone in this country.\n  That this Senate--that the Senate Judiciary Committee, and a small \ngroup in that body, would turn down this opportunity for such a fine \nman to serve this country is truly disgraceful.\n  I believe that we owe it to Mr. Lee to give him a chance to serve, as \nhe has already served this country in so many ways. To take out on Mr. \nLee some feelings about President Clinton is totally unfair. I hope the \nSenate Judiciary Committee will give him this opportunity to serve.\n  Just last week or so, we all queued up to talk about human rights to \nthe President of China. Now we have a chance to vote on human rights in \nputting a well-qualified person in the job as Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for Civil Rights. We are going to determine whether those \nspeeches that were given by Republicans and Democrats were only tourist \nfare for President Jiang.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is taking \nup the nomination of Ronald L. Gilman of Memphis to be United States \ncircuit judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. I \nwant to thank Chairman Hatch of the Judiciary Committee for taking up \nand reporting this nomination so promptly and the majority leader for \nscheduling a vote on it so soon after the nomination was reported to \nthe Senate. The Sixth Circuit currently has two vacancies, so it is \nimportant to my State and the others in the circuit that this vacancy \nget filled quickly.\n  Ron Gilman is a native of Memphis, where he was raised. After \nattending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard Law \nSchool, he returned to Memphis in 1967 and since then has spent his \nentire legal career at the leading Tennessee law firm of Ferris, \nMathews, Gilman, Branan and Hellen. I might point out that the Mathews \nin that firm name is former Senator Harlan Mathews.\n  Mr. Gilman rapidly became established as a leader of the Memphis bar,\n\n[[Page S11799]]\n\nserving as president of the Young Lawyers Division of the Memphis Bar \nAssociation and president of the Young Lawyers Conference of the \nTennessee Bar Association. He subsequently served a term as president \nof both the Memphis and Tennessee Bar Associations.\n  Mr. Gilman is eminently qualified to serve as a judge. His legal \ncareer has been as distinguished as it has been multifaceted. He has \npracticed criminal law, civil litigation, particularly commercial \nlitigation, general business law, and estate planning. Most recently, \nhe has spent a good deal of his practice involved in alternative means \nof dispute resolution, often serving as an arbitrator and mediator. \nFrom a background such as his, I think we can safely expect that Mr. \nGilman will bring to the bench the legal practitioner's bent for common \nsense and careful application of the law rather than an ideological \napproach to the law.\n  Mr. Gilman is not only one of Tennessee's most distinguished lawyers, \nbut a leader in the Memphis community as well, having served leadership \nroles with the Boy Scouts, the Memphis Jewish Home, and Memphis Senior \nCitizens Services, among other groups. He is a recipient of the Sam A. \nMyar, Jr. Memorial Award for outstanding service to the legal \nprofession and the Memphis community.\n  This nomination enjoys widespread and bipartisan support. Both \nRepublican Representative Ed Bryant and Democratic Representative \nHarold Ford, Jr., support the nomination. The entire Tennessee legal \ncommunity supports the nomination. I have heard not a single negative \nword about Mr. Gilman's nomination, and I urge my colleagues to vote in \nfavor of this nomination.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield back the time on this side. I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Ronald Lee Gilman, of Tennessee, to be \nU.S. circuit judge for the Sixth Circuit? On this question the yeas and \nnays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe).

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of the conference report accompanying the \nbill (H.R. 1119) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 1998 for \nmilitary activities of the Department of Defense, for military \nconstruction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, \nto prescribe personnel strengths for such fiscal year for the Armed \nForces, and for other purposes.\n\n  The report will be stated by the clerk.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     1119), have agreed to recommend and do recommend to their \n     respective Houses this report, signed by majority of the \n     conferees.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to the consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of October 23, 1997.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 4 \nhours for debate to be equally divided in the usual form.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the conference report for the National \nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998 is before the Senate \nnow. This is an important component of the national security \nlegislation that the Congress must pass each year.\n  The Armed Services Committee worked hard this year to produce a bill \nthat will authorize the appropriation of $268.2 billion for \nprocurement, research and development, test and evaluation, operation \nand maintenance, working capital funds, military personnel, military \nconstruction and family housing within the Department of Defense, and \nfor the weapons programs of the Department of Energy and the civil \ndefense. This is an important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, there are some Senators who will suggest that the \nSenate should reject this bill in order to protect interests in their \nStates. This is a very large bill with over 600 legislative provisions. \nThe conference report is nearly a thousand pages. In order to reach \nagreement on a bill of this magnitude, a lot of compromise is required. \nThe conference report includes many programs and policies essential to \nthe Department of Defense and the Nation. However, not everyone got \neverything that they wanted. As the committee prepared for our markup, \nwe received letters of request from 99 Senators. The committee tried to \naccommodate as many of these requests as possible, consistent with our \nnational security needs. Mr. President, neither South Carolina nor \nMichigan got everything Senator Levin and I wanted for our States.\n  Defeating the Defense authorization bill because three or four \nSenators did not get everything they wanted would be the ultimate in \npartisanship over statesmanship. Let me explain what the Nation would \nlose if there is no Defense authorization bill this year.\n  I believe the single most controversial issue in the conference \nreport is the policy with regard to depots. In the area of \nprivatization, the bill includes an important compromise that provides \nfor open competition for the work at the closing depots at Kelly and \nMcClellan Air Force Bases. If the bill is not enacted, the opportunity \nto support full and open competition and to resolve a longstanding and \nvery contentious issue will be lost. The bill would also change the \ncurrent 60-40 public/private split in The Department of Defense depot \nmaintenance to 50-50, giving The Department of Defense greater \nflexibility to achieve an optimal mix of public and private \ncapabilities.\n  Mr. President, negotiating the compromise on the depot issue was a \ndifficult and complex three-way negotiation. Senator Levin and I worked \ntogether in a totally bipartisan manner to ensure a fair resolution \nthat provided for fair and open competition. We are in total agreement \non the compromise. I want to commend Senator\n\n[[Page S11800]]\n\nLevin, and members of his staff, for their tireless efforts and \ncooperation in achieving this compromise.\n  I know that some Senators believe that they should have gotten more, \nbut there are equally as many Senators from States on the other side of \nthe issue who believe they gave up a great deal more. I hope that we \nagree that open competition will be in the best interests of the public \nand private sector and the Nation. Secretary Cohen has indicated that \nhe can support the depot compromise. I urge my colleagues to put \nparochial interests aside and work with us to implement this compromise \nsuccessfully.\n  Mr. President, I could talk for hours about the important legislative \nprovisions that the Department of Defense and our service men and women \nwill be denied if we permit this conference report to be defeated. I \nwill spare my colleagues that recitation, but I do want to highlight \nsome of what we will lose.\n  Without the Defense authorization bill, the military pay raise will \nbe less than our service members deserve. The bill includes a 2.8-\npercent pay raise for military personnel. If the bill is not enacted, \nthe pay raise for military personnel will be limited to 2.3 percent. \nFederal civilians will receive at least a 2.8-percent pay increase \nwhile our military personnel on duty throughout the world will receive \na pay raise 1 percent below the inflation rate. Denying military \npersonnel what I would describe as a minimal pay raise is shameful.\n  The bill includes authority for significant increases in the special \npay and bonus structure designed to respond to critical recruiting and \nretention problems highlighted by the Department of Defense. Specific \ngroups that would be affected include military aviators, nuclear-\nqualified officers, dentists, military members on overseas tours, \nmilitary members receiving family separation allowances and/or \nhazardous duty assignment pay, and military members serving in hardship \nduty locations. Reducing military pay raises while failing to increase \nthese bonuses through defeast of the Defense authorization bill will \npunish those who expect us here in the Congress to look out for them. \nWe will be repudiating the commitments we have made to improving the \nquality of life for military personnel and their families.\n\n  Mr. President, I assure my colleagues that, unless this bill is \npassed, we will see increases in career personnel leaving the military \nservices. They will see our action as a breach of faith and I cannot \nblame them.\n  The bill provides authority for the Department of Defense to begin \nconstruction on the fiscal year 1998 military construction projects \nincluding quality of life and training-related facilities. If the bill \nis not enacted, construction cannot begin. Some may believe that since \nthe military construction and family housing projects are funded in the \nMilitary Construction Appropriations Act, they do not need the \nauthorization in the conference report. Let me assure my colleagues \nthat is not correct. Both an authorization and an appropriation are \nrequired for military construction projects.\n  The conference report includes an exception to the cost limitation \nfor one Seawolf submarine. Without this legislation, the Navy will have \nto stop work on the SSN-23 later this calendar year. This could lead to \nsignificant payments to the shipyard and people who work on the Seawolf \nSubmarines and those who supply materials for the submarines will be \nlaid off. Not only does the Nation need the capabilities of these \nadvanced submarines, the employees and the communities in which these \npeople live will be tragically affected. We cannot allow this to \nhappen.\n  In the conference report, we re-authorized the acclaimed National \nGuard Youth Challenge Program. The bill would make permanent the \nauthority for this important and popular community and youth-oriented \nprogram. If the bill is not enacted, the Department of Defense must \nterminate support for this popular program. Many disadvantaged youth in \nall our States will be denied the opportunities this worthwhile program \nprovides.\n  The President, and most of us here in Congress, strongly profess our \nsupport for counterdrug activities. The bill includes provisions that \nwould extend the 1-year authority to provide counterdrug assistance to \nMexico and would create a new 5-year authority to provide riverine \ncounterdrug assistance to Colombia and Peru.\n  The bill would establish two new assistants to the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, representing the interests of the National Guard \nand the Reserves. This is important legislation designed to ensure that \nthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has the benefit of the best \nadvice with regard to all the reserve forces, in particular as it \npertains to their unique capabilities and requirements.\n  Mr. President, I could go on for hours on the good things in this \nbill. Some may propose stripping out some of the provisions I have \ndiscussed today and introducing separate legislation in order to avoid \ndenying our service members key benefits. This is a shortsighted and \nunacceptable notion. The conferees worked very hard for many weeks to \ncraft a bill that includes those items they agree are essential to the \nnational security. To fracture this process would be irresponsible. \nThose who may propose such legislation will be trying to take care of a \nfew at the expense of many. This is not our way. I will strongly object \nto any such proposals.\n  Mr. President, suggestions to defeat the Defense authorization \nconference report because of the compromise on depot maintenance are \nirresponsible. This bill is important to the young men and women who \nserve in our military forces. The bill includes pay raises and \nincreases to special incentive pay, including vital aviator bonuses. \nProvisions in this bill affect every aspect of our national defense \nincluding quality of life initiatives, modernization, and readiness. I \nremind all Senators that all military construction projects require an \nauthorization as well as an appropriation and cannot be executed \nwithout this bill.\n  All members of the Armed Services Committee support this bill, both \nDemocrat and Republican. The Military Coalition, a consortium of \nnationally prominent military and veterans organizations representing 5 \nmillion current and former members of the seven uniformed services, \ntheir families and survivors, strongly endorses enactment of this bill. \nI ask unanimous consent that a letter signed by the leaders of the 22 \norganizations be included in the Record at the conclusion of my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the House of Representatives has already \npassed this bill by a veto-proof majority of 286 to 123. The leaders of \nthe Defense Department have indicated that they can make this \ncompromise work and that they need this bill passed. It is hard for me \nto believe that any Senator would oppose the entire Defense \nauthorization bill at a time when American troops are deployed in \nBosnia and serious trouble appears to be brewing again in Iraq.\n  I strongly encourage all Senators to vote for this bill. We must send \na strong signal to the White House to demonstrate to the President that \nthis bill which is so important to our national security should be \nsigned. We must show the young men and women in uniform serving our \nNation around the world, men and women many of whom will spend yet \nanother Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday season away from home in \nservice to their Nation, that we are strongly behind them.\n  Mr. President, I might add that the conference report is the outcome \nof a great deal of hard work by Members and staff. I want to especially \nthank staff on both sides for all that they did to promote this bill. I \nam confident that without their good work we couldn't have brought to \nthe floor such an outstanding bill. I want to commend Les Brownlee and \nDavid Lyles for the excellent work, and other members of the staff who \ncooperated with them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                        The Military Coalition\n\n                                 Alexandria, VA, October 30, 1997.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Military Coalition, a consortium of \n     nationally prominent military and veterans organizations, \n     representing five million current and former members of the \n     seven uniformed services plus their families and survivors, \n     is writing to strongly endorse enactment of H.R. 1119, the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for FY 1998.\n\n[[Page S11801]]\n\n       Several of the provisions of the bill are vital to \n     maintaining a high level of military readiness among the men \n     and women of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast \n     Guard, Public Health Service and National Oceanic and \n     Atmospheric Administration. Others would offer significant \n     improvements in health programs, compensation protections for \n     deploying members, and survivor benefits programs, to name a \n     few.\n       Now that the conferees have made their judgments concerning \n     defense priorities and resource allocation, the Coalition \n     believes strongly that this legislation should be enacted as \n     quickly as possible. The unformed servicemen and women, whose \n     selfless dedication to this Nation frequently puts them in \n     harm's way, need Congress' support, and that support can best \n     be rendered at this time by passing H.R. 1119.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           The Military Coalition.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the chairman of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee in bringing the conference report \non the DOD authorization act to the Senate floor this morning. It has \nbeen a long and difficult conference in which we had to address and \nfinally resolve some very difficult issues.\n  First, I want to congratulate Chairman Thurmond on the successful \nconclusion of the conference and thank Senator Thurmond for the open \nand bipartisan spirit in which he conducted this conference on the \nSenate side. Without his leadership, this conference report wouldn't be \nhere. He had to make some difficult decisions. He did that on a \nbipartisan basis, and I want to commend him for it.\n  I thank the chairman and the ranking member on the House side, \nCongressmen Spence and Dellums, for their cooperation.\n  We worked hard to reach a fair conclusion on the issues in the \nconference. I think we have succeeded. There are some provisions in the \nbill that I don't agree with. But, overall, I think we reached a good \ncompromise on the major issues. And I hope the President will sign this \nbill.\n  Let me start with the action that we took to begin the implementation \nof the Quadrennial Defense Review. These are important steps. There \nhasn't been a lot of focus on them. But these are important actions \nwhich we took. The QDR, the Quadrennial Defense Review, was completed \nin May. The conference report begins to implement some of the \nrecommendations of the QDR.\n  For example, the conference report would permit reductions in Active \nand Reserve and end strengths below the fiscal year 1997 level, as the \nDepartment of Defense continues to restructure and streamline both \ncombat and support functions in an effort to free up funds for the \nservices' modernization priorities.\n  Second, the conference report calls for annual reductions of 5 \npercent in headquarters staffing over the next 5 years in an effort to \nreduce the so-called tooth-to-tail ratio.\n  The conference report would provide funding for a number of the \nArmy's Force XXI initiatives. The QDR set a goal of ``digitizing'' an \nentire Army Corps by 2004--and the funding in this bill will continue \nthat process.\n  Finally, the conference report would make some positive changes in \nthe area of privatization of depot maintenance work recommended by the \nQDR by permitting the privatization of up to 50 percent of such work, \nin lieu of the 40 percent cap currently imposed by law.\n  Mr. President, I think it is very unfortunate that Congress has not \nfollowed the QDR recommendation to give the Defense Department \nauthority to conduct more base closure rounds. We lost that battle on \nthe Senate floor this year, but this issue is just simply not going to \ngo away. I think more and more people are going to realize that we are \ngoing to have to close some unnecessary bases if we are going to free \nup money for other important needs, including the modernization of our \nforces.\n  The bill also takes a number of important steps to improve the \nquality of life of our troops.\n  For example, the conference report includes a 2.8-percent pay raise \nfor active duty military members. If the bill were not enacted, this \npay raise would be limited to 2.3 percent because of the statutory link \nbetween military and civilian pay raises. However, Federal civilians \nwill receive an average .5 percent in locality pay that is not \navailable to active duty military, in addition to their 2.3-percent pay \nraise.\n  So the 2.8-percent pay raise for active duty military is fair, it is \nneeded, and it is dependent upon the passage of this conference report.\n  The conference report also includes authority for significant \nincreases in special pay and bonuses available to respond to critical \nrecruiting and retention problems which have been highlighted by the \nDepartment of Defense. If the bill were not enacted, these authorities \nwould not be available to the Department. Specific groups that would be \naffected include aviators, nuclear-qualified officers, dentists, \nmilitary members on overseas tours, military members receiving family \nseparation allowances and/or hazardous duty assignment pay, and \nmilitary members serving in hardship duty locations. Those increases in \nthose special pay and bonuses are critically necessary. They are \ndependent on the passage of this bill.\n  The conference report includes significant reforms of the existing \nstructure for housing allowances and subsistence allowances for \nmilitary members. These reforms would simplify the management of these \nallowances and better target the allowances to those individuals in \ngeographic areas with the greatest need.\n  The conference report provides authority for the Department of \nDefense to begin construction on fiscal year 1998 military construction \nprojects, which include a number of important quality-of-life and \ntraining-related facilities. As our chairman has said, if this bill is \nnot enacted, construction of these projects cannot begin, and they are \nneeded. And these are quality-of-life issues.\n  The conference report terminates the Reserve Mobilization Insurance \nProgram. If the bill is not enacted, the Department of Defense will \ncontinue to lose $10 to $12 million per month as deployments and \nobligations continue.\n  Mr. President, I am particularly pleased that the conferees agreed to \nauthorize the full budget request of $382 million for the Defense \nDepartment's Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, and $158 million for \nthe related programs in the Department of Energy.\n  The House bill also contained some very restrictive provisions that \nwould have made it difficult for these programs to continue in the \ncoming year. I am pleased that those provisions were either dropped or \nmodified by the conferees. Combating the threat of proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction is one of the greatest national security \nchallenges that we face. And the cooperative threat-reduction programs \nare on the front line of our efforts to meet this challenge.\n  Those programs are an investment in America's security. Those \nprograms make it less likely that there will be a proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction. Those programs are a very, very cost-\neffective way of reducing probably the greatest threat that America \nfaces. I am glad that we were able to fully fund the budget request \nand, again, either eliminate or modify some needlessly restrictive \nprovisions on the use of those funds.\n  There were three issues that we had to deal with in conference that \nthe administration said, if we didn't resolve satisfactorily to them, \nwould result in a veto of this bill.\n  First, Bosnia;\n  Second B-2's;\n  And, third, depots.\n  All three of these issues were raised by provisions in the House \nbill. And, after a lengthy battle, we have successfully addressed each \none of them.\n  First, on the issue of Bosnia, I think we had a good outcome. The \nadministration again said they would veto a bill that included a funds \ncutoff for United States military presence in Bosnia. We avoided that \noutcome with a provision similar to the one in the Department of \nDefense appropriations conference report that authorizes the President \nto override a funds cutoff if he certifies that the continued presence \nof American troops in Bosnia after June 30, 1998, is required to meet \nUnited States national security interests.\n  But, equally important in my view is the sense-of-Congress language \nwhich I sponsored in the Senate that says clearly it is the sense of \nthe Congress that, one:\n\n[[Page S11802]]\n\n  First, United States ground combat forces should not participate in a \nfollow-on force in Bosnia after June 1998;\n  Second, that a western European Union-led or a NATO-led force, \nwithout the participation of United States ground combat forces, may, \nindeed, be a suitable follow-on force; and that a western European \nUnion-led force could be under the European Security and Defense \nIdentity initiative;\n  Third, this language provides that the United States may decide to \nprovide appropriate support to a follow-on force, including command and \ncontrol, intelligence, logistics, and, if necessary, a Ready Reserve \nforce in the region;\n  And, fourth, this language provides that the President should inform \nour NATO allies of this sense-of-Congress language and strongly urge \nthem to prepare to provide for such a follow-on force.\n  The second veto issue was the B-2 bomber. On this issue, we believe \nthat we avoided a veto threat by following the appropriations \nconference outcome. We authorized a total of $331 million either for \nprocurement of additional B-2 aircraft or for maintenance and upgrade \nof the current B-2 fleet. We left it up to the President to decide \nwhich option to select.\n  I obviously hope and expect that the President will decide not to buy \nany more B-2's.\n  That clearly is the position of the Senate, and I hope he makes the \ndecision quickly so that we can put this issue behind us and so the Air \nForce can begin to spend the money on what is needed, which is to fix \nsome of the problems with the current B-2 fleet. The senior military \ncivilian leaders of the Defense Department have said repeatedly that we \ndon't need and cannot afford any more B-2's.\n  Now, on depot maintenance, which is the most difficult issue that we \nfaced, it took the longest time to resolve in this conference, and that \nissue is how do we allocate depot maintenance work of the closing air \nlogistics centers at Kelly and McClellan Air Force Bases. With a lot of \njobs at stake, there are obviously strong feelings on both sides of \nthis issue. And those feelings are understandable.\n  I think we all ought to realize that people who have an interest in \ntheir home States are going to fight strongly for those States and for \nwhat they perceive as fairness for their home States. That is why we \nare here--at least one of the reasons we are here--to represent \nstrongly the interests of our own State. And so the kind of strength \nthat we faced in the feelings on this issue was understandable and it \nis understandable.\n  The Depot Caucus representatives of the depots that remain open felt \nthat the President had ignored the spirit of the base closure process \nby pursuing a policy of privatizing the work at Kelly and McClellan, \nand that was the so-called privatization or privatizing-in-place \napproach. The Senators from Texas and California fought equally \nstrongly to ensure that the work could remain at the closed depots.\n  Now, I will state candidly that I disagreed with the assertion of the \nDepot Caucus that the Base Closure Commission prohibited privatization \nin place at Kelly and McClellan, and I have said this before, that in \nmy judgment the 1995 Base Closure Commission left it up to the \nDepartment of Defense to decide how to redistribute the Kelly and \nMcClellan work. The Commission's recommendation explicitly directed the \nDepartment of Defense to ``Consolidate the workloads to other DOD \ndepots or to private sector commercial activities as determined by the \nDefense Depot Maintenance Council.'' So there was an either/or in the \nCommission recommendation--either consolidate the work loads to other \nDOD depots or to private sector commercial activities.\n  I also disagreed with the legislation which was proposed by the Depot \nCaucus which was included in the House bill which would have prohibited \nthe Department from privatizing in place until the three remaining Air \nForce depots were operating at 80 percent of capacity--in effect \nprohibiting the Air Force from keeping any of the work in California or \nTexas.\n  I voted against that proposal in our committee, and I voted against \nit in conference because I felt that it was one sided. Had that \nprovision remained in this bill, I would not be supporting the \nconference report. But as the present Presiding Officer fully knows, \nthat provision is not in this conference report. What we have instead \nis a provision that is aimed at providing a level playing field for \ncompetition between the closed depots and the depots that remain open.\n  Now, I have always believed that competition results in the best \nvalue to the Department of Defense and to the taxpayers, and I believe \nit is the right solution to the depot dispute.\n  The conference language includes seven specific criteria to help \nensure that the Air Force does not tilt the playing field. These \nrequirements were written by Members and staff who are neutral in the \nfight between the closed bases and the remaining air logistics centers. \nNow, I reiterate, Members who actually voted against the position of \nthe Depot Caucus in conference took the lead in drafting this \ncompromise, and our sole objective was to ensure a fair competition and \neach of these requirements was included for that purpose.\n  We had some objections from both sides of the issue in the Congress \nand from the administration about almost every proposal that was ever \nput on the table, but the bottom line is that we believe this \ncompromise is fair. We believe the Department of Defense can make it \nwork fairly. I support the compromise because I believe it will lead to \nthe fair and open competition that is the best and perhaps the only \nanswer to this dispute.\n  We have heard several arguments from opponents of this provision. \nFirst, one draft of the compromise bill language contained a sentence \nwhich stated that ``appropriate consideration may be given to \ndifferences in cost or performance risk associated with the location of \nperformance.''\n  In the final version, the bill language was replaced with report \nlanguage which stated:\n\n       The Department would be expected to consider real \n     differences among bidders in cost or capability to perform \n     the work based on factors that would include the proposed \n     location or locations of the workloads. The consideration of \n     such differences does not constitute ``preferential \n     treatment.''\n\n  Both the bill language in the earlier version and the report language \nin the final version gave the Department the flexibility to consider \nboth cost and risk factors associated with the location of performance. \nBoth are consistent with the Department of Defense's current practice, \nand I just simply cannot see any substantive difference between them.\n  Second, opponents of the fair competition compromise oppose a \nprovision authorizing teaming agreements between the public depots and \nprivate contractors. In my view, such teaming arrangements simply give \neach offeror, each bidder, the opportunity to put together its best \nbid. The Deputy General Counsel of the Department of Defense, who also \nnow happens to be the nominee to be the new Under Secretary of the Air \nForce, recently testified before the Armed Services Committee that he \ncould not see anything anticompetitive about public/private teaming \narrangements. If teaming agreements result in better bids and better \nvalue for the Department of Defense and the taxpayer, then it seems to \nme we should encourage these arrangements and not prohibit them.\n  Third, opponents of the compromise language have said that it would \nunfairly stack the deck against Texas and California by permitting the \npublic depots to fudge their bids by hiding overhead costs. In fact, \nthe fair competition provisions specifically require the Department to \nconsider all direct and indirect costs that will result from the \nvarious offers. So, far from permitting the depots to hide costs, the \nprovision requires the Department of Defense to consider all costs.\n  The statement of managers states that the Department should consider \nall savings including ``any overhead savings, i.e., reduced \nadministrative costs, more efficient utilization of facilities that \nwould result from the consolidation of work loads for the remaining \npublic facilities.''\n  However, it is up to the Department of Defense to determine what \noverhead savings, if any, may result from a particular offer. Nothing \nin the conference report or the statement of managers permits or \nencourages any offeror to hide costs or authorizes the Department to \nconsider any overhead savings that it has not determined to be valid.\n\n[[Page S11803]]\n\n                        senior military colleges\n\n  The last issue I want to mention is a provision in the House bill \nthat the conferees agreed to over my objections involving the so-called \nsenior military colleges. This provision would require the Army to \nguarantee graduates of the ROTC programs at the six senior military \ncolleges--North Georgia College, the Citadel, Virginia Military \nInstitute, Virginia Tech, Norwich University, and Texas A \nassignments to active duty if they request it, provided, however, they \nare physically and medically qualified, and are recommended by the \nprofessor of military science at their school.\n  The effect of this provision is that graduates from the senior \nmilitary colleges will be assigned to active duty even if there are \nbetter qualified officers graduating from ROTC programs at other \ncolleges and universities across the nation. I realize that this is not \na major provision when compared to other issues in the conference. It \nis, however, a major issue in terms of principle, and I intend to make \nsure that everyone understands what this provision does.\n  This provision codifies in law a quota system to give preferential \ntreatment to a small group of ROTC graduates without regard to where \ntheir performance and potential stacks up when compared to graduates \nfrom other ROTC programs. The Army's own figures show that, when all \nROTC graduates--including the senior military colleges--were arranged \nin an order of merit, a number of graduates from the senior military \ncolleges each year ranked below the cutoff line for active duty.\n  Since 1990, 268 graduates of senior military colleges have been \nassigned to active duty despite being below the cutoff point for ROTC \ngraduates offered active duty assignment in the Army's order of merit \nlist. This list ranks all ROTC graduates. The conference provision \nclearly will disadvantage those graduates of ROTC programs who are not \noffered the same exceptional consideration as is offered to the \ngraduates of the senior military colleges.\n  Instead of guaranteeing equal treatment and open competition for \nassigning all ROTC graduates to active duty, the conference provision \nestablishes in law a formal vehicle to maintain a quota system of \npreferential treatment for the graduates of six specific colleges and \nuniversities.\n  I will be trying to correct this unfairness in the future.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to conclude by thanking the chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee, Senator Thurmond, for the open and \nbipartisan manner in which he conducted the conference on this bill. \nWhile we were not able to agree on every issue, Senator Thurmond and \nhis staff have made every effort to include the minority at every stage \nof the deliberations.\n  I would also like to express my appreciation to the staff of the \nArmed Services Committee on both the majority and minority sides for \nthe tremendous effort that they have put into this bill and this \nconference. I think all Members of the committee know that this bill \nwould not have been possible without the outstanding work of Les \nBrownlee, David Lyles, and their dedicated supporting cast. I also want \nto extend my thanks to the staff of the House National Security \nCommittee and the House and Senate Legislative Counsels for their help \nin preparing this large bill.\n  Mr. President, this is a good conference report that strengthens our \nnational security. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.\n  Mr. President, I will yield the floor at this time.\n  I yield my good friend from Connecticut such time as he may need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair and I thank my friend and colleague \nfrom Michigan.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor to urge our colleagues to support \nthis fiscal year 1998 national defense authorization bill. I am proud \nto be a member of the committee from which this bill has emerged, the \nSenate Armed Services Committee. I particularly wish to thank our \nchairman, Senator Thurmond, and our ranking Democrat, Senator Levin. \nThese are two extraordinarily able, wise Members of the Senate who have \nworked together very well to produce this bill that meets our national \nsecurity needs.\n  We all know that we are in a post-cold war period. Perhaps the needs \nof defense are less in the minds of the public, but these are not \nmatters that should be decided by public opinion polls. These are \nmatters of national security, at the very root of why governments are \nformed, and they call out for leadership by those who have been given \nthe privilege of serving, leadership in the interest of national \nsecurity by all of us across party lines, across both Chambers of \nCongress, across Pennsylvania Avenue between the Congress and the White \nHouse to do the best that we can to provide for our national defense \ntoday and, in some ways even more difficult, particularly at a time of \nrelative security such as we are in today to make the investments that \nare necessary so that we will meet the multiple possible threats to our \nsecurity in the decades ahead. This bill I think does about as well as \nwe could do at this point, and I am therefore proud to be here to urge \nour colleagues to support it.\n  I want to state first that this is a bipartisan bill. There are a lot \nof things that happen around the Capitol that are much too partisan. \nSomehow we come here and we feel as if we have suddenly been placed on \ntwo teams on either side of the tug-of-war and you have to get on your \nside, and sometimes on all sides we lose a bit of sight of what the \nproblem is and the urgency of working together in the national interest \nacross party lines.\n  I am very proud that on the Armed Services Committee, of course, \nthere are disagreements, sometimes they tend to split more partisan \nthan at other times, but as this bill, the product of the better part \nof a year's labor of the Armed Services Committee of the Senate, shows \nwe have gotten together. We have come halfway across the bridge on a \nwhole host of issues and problems, matters of real concern, and the \nfeeling is we have had our voices heard both in the committee, in the \nChamber and in conference.\n  This bill really represents an act of bipartisanship. Because so much \nattention is focused on the partisanship around here, I think it is \nimportant to note that with some satisfaction and again thank the \nbipartisan leadership of the committee for having made that possible.\n  Second, Mr. President, this is a bill that is a compromise and that \nhas compromises in it. As a conferee on the Senate side, I must admit \nthat the conference negotiations over this bill were protracted, \ndifficult. There was much give and take. But in the end, which is again \nthe nature of this process at its best, we were able to overcome many \nobstacles, some of which seemed intractable at times, all of which \narose from what initially appeared to be difficult to reconcile \npositions. And despite these obstacles, the end result I think is a \ngood bill that achieves the goal of adequately providing for our \nnational defense.\n  It is not a perfect solution, but we rarely achieve perfect solutions \nhere. The question is will we be willing to bend a bit to get to a \npoint where we have any solutions, and I think this bill does. It \nreflects compromise, the kinds of compromises that are honorable and \nmake our political system unique and produce results. In the end, I \nwould probably say that none of the conferees, House or Senate, were \ncompletely satisfied but none were completely disappointed neither, and \nthe end result is a bill that moves us forward.\n  I do want to say in a more targeted way that the bill protects the \nSenate position on two controversial issues, Bosnia and the B-2.\n  Mr. President, the third basic point is that this bill has provisions \nthat are essential to maintaining our military strength and \nparticularly in providing adequately for our men and women in uniform, \nthe finest fighting force in the world. But they will not continue to \nbe so unless we provide for them.\n\n  Let me cite a few of the matters in the bill that are so critical. \nThere was some discussion of what would normally be unthinkable, that \nwe might not pass a DOD authorization bill this year. But that would \nhave been done at great peril and loss.\n\n[[Page S11804]]\n\n  This bill, for instance, provides authority for adequate funding for \ncritical equipment procurement and R, research and development. I am \nprivileged to serve as the ranking Democrat on the Subcommittee on \nAcquisition and Technology, chaired by my friend and colleague from \nPennsylvania, Senator Santorum. There are some very important \ninvestments here that will provide dominance for the American military \na decade or two from now. All of the glory that we achieved, the \nvictory that we achieved in the gulf war, so much of it was made \npossible by research and development that began, not in 1990 or 1991 \nwhen we fought the war, but in the 1970's. This budget provides the \nsame kind of first investments in future military dominance.\n  Second, the bill provides authority for the Department of Defense to \nbegin construction of fiscal year 1998 military projects, construction \nprojects which include quality of life, and training-related facilities \nwhich are so critical, both to the morale of our forces and their \ncapacities.\n  Third, the bill provides lower end strength levels and increased \nflexibility for managing personnel strength. That is very important to \nthe commanders.\n  Fourth, the bill includes significant reforms of the existing \nstructure for housing allowances and subsistence allowances for members \nof the military.\n  Fifth, the bill includes authority for significant increases in the \nspecial pay and bonus structure, designed to respond to critical \nrecruiting and retention problems, particularly in the Air Force.\n  Sixth, the bill includes a 2.8-percent pay raise for active duty \nmilitary members--it is not a lot, but at least an increase--a pay \nraise of 2.3 percent for Federal civilians, and an additional 0.5 \npercent increase in locality pay.\n  It is a big bill. It is an important bill. It achieves some things \nthat would not be achievable were this bill not passed.\n  Senator Levin was speaking when I came into the Chamber. He was \nspeaking about the depot issue. Obviously, there has been a lot of \nconcern about that over the last several weeks--months, in fact. Today, \nas we consider this bill, some are still suggesting that the depot \nprovisions of the bill may invite a Presidential veto. I certainly hope \nnot. I hope such a veto is not being seriously considered within the \nWhite House because it would be profoundly harmful to our national \ndefense by delaying authorizations such as those I have just described, \nwhich are critical for maintaining our current military readiness as \nwell as delaying investments in our future military strength by way of \ncritical procurement and R programs.\n  The depot provisions of the bill provide, in my opinion, a level \nplaying field among current Government depots and those which are being \nprivatized. I understand the intense feelings in the various localities \naffected by this. But here again, across party lines, the best effort \nwas made to achieve a compromise. These provisions on depots in the \nbill, I think, are fair and equitable to all sides involved in this \nextremely complex issue. No one set of interests prevailed. No one side \nachieved all their end goals. At the same time, no side walked away \nwithout retaining some of their core objectives here. In a very real \nsense, the depot provisions of this DOD authorization bill reflect the \nlong and detailed, bipartisan effort of all of the conferees. I \nhonestly believe that the conferees produced the very best possible \nlegislation, not only generally but particularly on this issue which \nwas so divisive and was thought to be possibly fatal to the chances of \nthe overall bill, so important to our national defense, even passing.\n  So, I say, respectfully, that any move to veto this bill because of \nthe depot provisions would be very unfair and unwise. A veto would \nfreeze other provisions in the bill for an unacceptable length of time, \nand there is no guarantee that what would follow would be a solution \nany better for the parties involved intimately than the one already \npainstakingly worked out.\n  Last, a veto might act to dismantle current support for the bill and \nopen up partisanship on a host of other issues, partisanship or \nparochialism, divisiveness, on a host of other issues which have \nalready been resolved in the underlying bill through a lot of hard \nwork.\n  Let me say, finally, that I know there are many in Congress, some in \nthe country, who feel we are still spending too much for defense. As \nhard as we on the committee struggled to authorize, as closely as we \nworked with the appropriators, the fact is--and I think it is important \nto point this out to our colleagues and to the public--this represents \nthe continuation of more than a decade of defense budgets that have \nbeen lower in real dollars than the previous year. I believe this is \nthe 13th straight defense budget of the United States of America that \nhas been lower, in real dollars, than the preceding year's.\n\n  First, I say that to say to those who say the military industrial \ncomplex, whatever, the hawkish people here, are not recognizing the \nchange in the post-cold-war years and are still spending as much, that \nis just not true.\n  Second, just look at the newspapers. Look at the instability in the \nMiddle East with Saddam Hussein again acting against America's \ninterests, against the world's interests. Probably, as the news today \nsuggests, people in the U.N., not the United States, are alleging that \nSaddam Hussein is taking the action he has to try to frustrate \ninspection for the reason that we would guess--to conceal behavior, \ndevelopment of systems in his country that are not only a breach of the \nagreement he made to end the gulf war but which could be disastrous for \nthe security of American personnel in that region, for the security of \nour allies, for the overall balance of power in that region. Look at \nthe acts of terrorism that continue throughout the world.\n  Even consider the efforts that the President made and has been \nmaking--they were highlighted last week because of the visit of the \nPresident of China, Jiang Zemin--an effort to try to find a course of \npeace, cooperation, integration; not to treat the Chinese as if they \nwere our enemies inevitably--which is probably the best way to make \nthem our enemies--but to try to build cooperative relations. That is \nthe kind of effort that can only be made if we feel strong enough \nmilitarily to know that if our optimistic view does not work, we have \nthe strength to protect our security interests and those of our \nallies--in this case in the Pacific region.\n  There is a lot of change going on within our military structure, a \nlot of adjustment to the changing threats that we face, the reduced \nresources available. The outgoing immediate past Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, General Shalikashvili, presided over the presentation \nof a visionary document, ``Joint Vision 2010.'' Where should we be in \nthe year 2010? How can we get our services to work better together? How \ncan we take advantage of the enormous leaps forward in technology?\n  The Quadrennial Defense Review, completed earlier this year, which \nwas authorized in the DOD authorization bill for this year, fiscal year \n1997, created, in my opinion, the broadest involvement within the \nPentagon of personnel post cold war, about what the shape of the future \nthreat is and what we need to face it. The National Defense Panel, also \nan independent panel created in the DOD bill last year, is in the final \nstages of its work. It is a Team B that we created of retired military \npersonnel, outside experts and independent thinkers to provoke us, to \nmake sure that we are doing everything we can to produce the best \ndefense at least cost, that we are taking advantage of new \ntechnologies, of new forms of management.\n  Mr. President, the military cannot be any more immune than the rest \nof the world to the changes occurring. I have told this story probably \ntoo many times. It goes back some months now. One day earlier this \nyear, the lead story in the Wall Street Journal was how General \nElectric, which happens to be headquartered in my State, was going to \nbe reporting record profits--billions. What was the focus of attention \nwithin that company, under a visionary, demanding president, Jack \nWelch? ``How can we change to make sure that we continue to be as \nsuccessful in the future as we are today?'' Nobody who sits still is \ngoing to remain successful and strong. That is as true of our military \nas it is of any great institution in the private sector.\n  That process is beginning. The Armed Services Committee has played\n\n[[Page S11805]]\n\na leading role in encouraging it. We have to keep that moving, as this \nbill does. So, overall this bill is a good bill, and it is an important \nbill, and it is a necessary bill. So I urge my colleagues across party \nlines to vote for the bill with a strong show of support as we send it \neventually to the President with the very urgent hope, and I think the \nstrong case, that the President will sign this bill knowing that it \ntruly serves the primary goal of our Government, which is the national \nsecurity.\n  Mr. President, I again thank the chairman of the committee for his \nextraordinary leadership and the ranking Democrat, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I commend the able Senator from \nConnecticut on his excellent remarks on this subject.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask the time be \nequally charged to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I am not here to necessarily engage the \nchairman and the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator suspend? Who yields time?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Will the Senator from Michigan yield--this won't take \nlong.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to yield--how much time?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Fifteen minutes. You may want more than 15 by the time I \nget through.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the Senator from Arkansas 15 minutes. We don't \nknow how time is going to be allocated, that is our problem.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I will try to make this short.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 15 minutes to my friend from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized for 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, from 1993 to 1997, the Navy retired seven \nLos Angeles class attack submarines--seven in that 4-year period. In \nthat same period, we were in the process of building three Seawolf \nsubmarines at a cost of $13.2 billion. Not one of those submarines that \nwe have decommissioned, all of which had a 30-year life expectancy, not \none that we retired had less than 12 years left on its life expectancy, \nand several of them had 14 years left on their life expectancy.\n  In that same period of time, we retired two nuclear-powered guided-\nmissile cruisers, the Virginia and the Mississippi. Both of those ships \nhad 20 years left on their life expectancy. And just last month, the \nNavy decommissioned another Virginia class guided missile cruiser, the \nU.S.S. Arkansas. That ship is near and dear to my heart because my wife \nBetty christened it. The U.S.S. Arkansas, incidentally, had sailed for \nonly 18 years, and had a life expectancy of 20 years left on it. CGN-\n41. That stands for cruiser, guided missile, nuclear.\n  In that same period of time, 1993 to 1997, we decommissioned five \nfrigates, everyone of which had anywhere from 14 to 16 years left on \ntheir 35-year life expectancy.\n  In that same period of time, we also decommissioned nine guided-\nmissile frigates, every one of which, but one, had a 21-year life \nexpectancy left.\n  Now, Mr. President, the Navy and the Pentagon has told the Defense \nSubcommittee on Appropriations on which I sit, as does the Presiding \nOfficer, that tight budgets were requiring them to do more with less \nand that we are wearing out our ships and exhausting our crews because \nof the high operating tempo we are demanding of them.\n  I have had reason to reevaluate what those officials have told us. \nFirst, Congress added $720 million to the 1998 defense budget to \nincrease from three to four the number of DDG-51 Arleigh Burke class \ndestroyers we will buy this year. The Arleigh Burke destroyer is a very \nfine ship, and it carries the Aegis air defense system. But let me \nrepeat that this extra ship cost $720 million.\n  Secondly, I learned, as I said, that the Navy would retire the U.S.S. \nArkansas while it still has 20 years of useful life left. That ship is \nnow being broken up for scrap.\n  You have to ask yourself, why are we retiring perfectly good \nmultimission surface ships when the cost for a comparable new ship is \nstaggering? So I decided to look into this early warship retirement, \nand here are some of the things I have learned.\n  Those ships that I mentioned that we retired between 1993 and 1997, \nthe five regular frigates and nine guided-missile frigates and the two \nnuclear-powered guided-missile cruisers and the Los Angeles attack \nsubmarines, all of those ships, as I said, had 12 to 21 years left on \ntheir lives. During that same period of time, Congress appropriated \nabout $18 billion to acquire two new submarines and 16 Arleigh Burke \ndestroyers.\n  It seems to me that this is awfully penny-wise and pound-foolish to \nbe retiring these ships and spending so much to replacing them with \nfewer ships. We could keep a lot more ships in service at a lot less \ncost if we canceled or delayed procurement of just one or two of the \nsubmarines or destroyers the Navy plans to buy over the next 4 years.\n  Listen to this. It costs $200 million to refuel a Los Angeles class \nsubmarine and about $30 million a year to operate it. So the Navy could \nrefuel three Los Angeles attack submarines and operate them until the \nyear 2014, 16 to 17 years from now, for the price of buying one New \nAttack Submarine.\n  In addition, it costs about $25 million a year to operate a guided-\nmissile frigate. So, for the cost of the one Arleigh Burke destroyer \nthat we added to the fiscal 1998 budget, the Navy could operate three \nPerry class frigates until the year 2007.\n  I know that the Los Angeles class submarine is not quite as good as a \nSeawolf, or New Attack Submarine. I know a guided-missile cruiser or \nfrigate is not quite as capable as an Arleigh Burke destroyer, but \nthose older classes were good enough for the cold war when they were \nexpected to cope with a highly sophisticated air and sea threat from \nthe Warsaw Pact.\n  Here are some comments by Admiral J. Paul Reason, the Commander in \nChief of the Atlantic fleet. You don't have to listen to what I have to \nsay, but listen to what the commander of the Atlantic fleet has to say, \nAdmiral Reason. He says, according to the Norfolk Virginian-Pilot, that \nthe fleet might be better served by cheaper ships in greater quantity: \n``I would rather have three hulls that have one-third the capability of \nan Arleigh Burke.''\n  If from a pure military standpoint three cheaper ships are sometimes \nbetter than one expensive new one, why are we spending money \nmothballing or scrapping perfectly good ships with a 20-year life \nexpectancy and then spending staggering sums to build new ones?\n  Mr. President, I am not going to pursue this. The question is very \nsimple. I intend to get into it in depth next year when we have \nhearings before the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee with the Navy. \nBut I will tell you--and I serve notice on them right now--I will tell \nyou what I think is going on. I don't think that the reasons given us \nare legitimate. They make no sense to me. I am not, admittedly, a Navy \nman, but when you look at the dollars and cents and when you look at \nthe threat and you look at the life expectancy on magnificent ships--I \ncan vouch for the U.S.S. Arkansas, I have been on it more than once, \nand it hasn't been that long ago when it was the state of the art. And \nI don't buy this business that we have to pay any price to get the \nabsolute added technological edge on every one of our systems.\n  This is a terribly expensive program the Navy is undertaking, doing \naway with perfectly good ships, with long lives left, to replace then \nwith fewer hugely expensive ships. I agree with the admiral down in \nNorfolk when he says that sometimes he would rather have three cheaper \nships that will do one-third of the job than have one ship to replace \nthem.\n  So I think that what we are doing is retiring perfectly good ships in \norder to keep the shipyards of America working.\n  What does that mean? It means we have a lot of people in this body \nwho have shipyards in their jurisdictions, and they want to keep those \njobs busy.\n\n[[Page S11806]]\n\n I understand that. If I had one in my State, I would be wanting those \nworkers to stay busy, too.\n  But I tell you the enormous cost to the taxpayers of this, in my \nview, is nothing short of outrageous. I do not buy the rationale for \nit. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Nebraska, Senator Hagel.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I thank the chairman for his leadership and the leadership \nof the distinguished ranking minority member, Senator Levin.\n\n  Mr. President, it is rather appropriate that we debate this issue \ntoday. Next week is Veterans Day. It is the day, a unique day, when \nAmerica honors the sacrifices and commitments made by our men and women \nwho served in uniform.\n  I rise today to speak in support of the fiscal year 1998 defense \nauthorization bill conference report. As we have debated this important \nbill over the past few months, I couldn't help but wonder whether we \nwould be able to meet our national security challenges in the years \nahead with the current state of our readiness of our current military \nforces.\n  Our national defense ensures the survival of our Nation and our \ninterests around the world. Our national defense is not only the \nprotector of the American people, it is the guarantor of our foreign \npolicy. One of the most important national debates we need to have is \nover what kind of military will be required as the world moves into the \nnext century. Are we making the necessary investments to meet that need \nand will America be strong enough to back up the international \ncommitments being made today by our President?\n  I am very concerned, Mr. President, that we are not making the \nnecessary investments that we will need to make to have the military \ncapability to back up those commitments in 5 to 10 years. While the \ncold war is over, the world is still very dangerous. It is very \nuncertain. It requires a skilled, highly mobile military force \nstructure. Rather than one global enemy that we can work to contain, we \nneed to be able to respond to head off crises in hot spots around the \nworld.\n  Look at our situation today. We have troops in Bosnia. We have a \nmadman in the Middle East whom we already went to war with once, and \nagain he rattles his saber and threatens the peace.\n  We are faced with the continuing menaces, the dilemma in North Korea. \nWe face proliferation, not only of nuclear weapons, but of chemical and \nbiological weapons around the world. What are the issues on the \nhorizon?\n  Next year, this body will make a decision on expanding the security \nblanket of NATO eastward. Difficult decisions still must be made \nregarding Bosnia. The Caspian Sea has the world's second largest oil \nreserves, located in the center of a very turbulent area of the world. \nThe Middle East continues to be in turmoil.\n  What will the future requirements be for the U.S. military? No one \ncan predict with certainty what those requirements will be. But what \nhas made our military the most powerful in the world and has kept the \npeace is the preparedness and the ability of the United States to \nrespond to whatever crisis may develop worldwide.\n  In a turbulent, unpredictable world, we cannot now risk weakness. As \nPresident Ronald Reagan said so clearly--peace through strength. Our \ndedicated men and women in uniform are up to the task, as they have \nalways been up to the task.\n  However, our military has suffered Draconian cuts over the past 10 \nyears. In real dollars--in real dollars, Mr. President--the U.S. \nmilitary, our national defense, has taken far deeper and more dramatic \ncuts than any other area of our Federal budget. Over the last 10 years \nour defense budget has been reduced in real numbers by 40 percent.\n  We are deferring--we are deferring--vitally important weapons \nprocurement systems to meet our needs for the future. That is not \nleadership.\n  Today, I fear we could not repeat what we accomplished during the \nDesert Storm war because of our strength and our readiness, because \nthat has been cut so drastically. Not a comforting thought, Mr. \nPresident, with the current situation in Iraq.\n  Our Armed Forces have been stretched to the breaking point. While the \nadministration has continually proposed reduced spending in our defense \nbudget, the President continues to deploy more and more overseas \nforces. At the same time we have been cutting our national defense \nresources, we have been directing more and larger overseas deployments. \nThis, Mr. President, is very dangerous, with severe long-term \nconsequences for peace and stability worldwide. We are witnessing an \nunhealthy stress in our military today.\n  Since 1989, the Army's missions around the world have increased by \n300 percent--while funding for our primary land forces has decreased by \n38 percent, and the number of soldiers has declined by 35 percent. In \nthe Air Force we face a similar story. Recent press reports indicate \nthat 107 Air Force pilots who were eligible for promotion this year \nfrom captain to major asked not to be considered, they decided to leave \nactive service instead. The senior leadership in the Air Force say they \nhave seen an alarming number of pilots leave the Air Force and are \nconcerned that so many pilots are finding the demands of a military \ncareer on their families so stressful that they are choosing to quit. \nIt is not just about money either. Most say they are not concerned \nabout going in harm's way, but they are concerned about their unit's \nreadiness to face the challenges ahead.\n  I am pleased to note that this bill does begin to reverse the \ndownward trend in defense spending by increasing the administration's \nrequest by $2.6 billion. It is a good start on the road back to \nrestoring our military forces to a complete ability to defend our vital \ninterests around the world--but it is not enough.\n  I understand that some of my colleagues believe that this bill is now \nirrelevant. They say we have passed an appropriations bill already, why \ndo we need an authorization bill? We need this bill to authorize a 2.8-\npercent pay increase for our men and women in uniform. Who among us \nwants to look a soldier in the eye, whom the President has just sent to \nBosnia and say, ``we sent you in harm's way, but you and your family \ndon't merit a pay increase.'' How many of us in the Senate are aware, \naccording to the administration's own data, that compensation for our \nmen and women in uniform currently lags 12.9-percent behind the private \nsector. Without this meager pay increase, our soldiers would fall even \nfurther behind civilian wages, at a time when the administration asks \nthem to do more with less on a daily basis.\n  The pay raise issue alone should be enough justification to support \nthis bill. However, there is more. By the Defense Department's own \nestimates 23,000 service men and women are eligible for food stamps. \nThere is no honor for a nation that asks its men and women in uniform \nto risk their lives to defend it, then asks them to feed their families \nwith food stamps and live in rundown, dilapidated housing.\n  Another reason we need this bill enacted into law involves housing \nfor our military personnel. Denying them appropriate and just \ncompensation is clearly one issue. If we, as a nation can't pay our \nservice members enough, surely we can at least provide them with \ndecent, affordable housing. Here again we are failing our troops. As \nmost of my colleagues are aware, military construction projects require \nboth authorization and appropriation to be executed. If the fiscal year \n1998 Defense authorization bill is not enacted this year, more than $4 \nbillion in military construction projects cannot be executed during the \ncoming year.\n  If we do not provide our men and women in uniform with at least a \ndecent quality of life for them and for their families, how can we \nexpect to recruit and retain the best and the brightest?\n  Signals from the White House indicate that the President is \nconsidering a veto of this bill. I ask him to reconsider. Chairman \nThurmond and the members of his committee have worked tirelessly to \nreach an accommodation with both sides in the depot closure debate. \nThis divisive issue has\n\n[[Page S11807]]\n\nconsumed enough of our efforts. It is time to move on. We are wasting \ntime and draining precious resources away from our Nation's military \nreadiness. Let's show some leadership and get on with our \nresponsibility.\n  In summary, Mr. President, I close with this: National defense should \nnot be a partisan issue. The security of our Nation is not a Democrat \nor Republican issue. It is an American issue. The debate over our \nnational defense should not be driven by economic decisions. It should \nnot be driven by jobs. We must be steely eyed, clear eyed, clear headed \nwhen we make these decisions for our national security.\n  Deferring tough decisions and lack of vision and shortsightedness in \nplanning our national defense will have deadly consequences for the \nfuture of America and the world.\n  I strongly support this bill and strongly encourage my colleagues to \nsupport it as well.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I commend the able Senator from Nebraska for the \nexcellent remarks he made on this subject.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I thank the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I now yield to Senator Kempthorne, the Senator from \nIdaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  First, Mr. President, I commend the leadership that Senator Thurmond \nhas provided as the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. With his \nsteady hand on the wheel, we have brought forward a bill that I think \nall of us can be proud of.\n  I also want to commend the ranking member of the full committee, \nSenator Levin. I believe this is the first year that he has been the \nranking member.\n  But that bipartisan spirit, that really has been the tradition of the \nArmed Services Committee, again is exemplified by these two Senators. I \ncommend both of them for their leadership. You have served this Nation \nwell and national security because of that partnership.\n  Mr. President, I have the great honor of serving as the chairman of \nthe Military Personnel Subcommittee. I say ``honor'' because I feel \nthat that is the committee that deals with the men and women who so \nproudly wear the uniforms of the U.S. Armed Services.\n  I cannot think of a more appropriate and patriotic partner than \nSenator Cleland of Georgia as the ranking member of that subcommittee. \nOur men and women know that when Senator Cleland is involved in any of \nthese issues, their interests are looked out for. I thank him for his \npartnership but also for his friendship as well.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the fiscal year 1998 defense \nauthorization conference report. I want to congratulate again all of \nthe members of the committee who worked so diligently on this. The \nconference report now before the Senate authorizes an increase, for \nexample, in a variety of areas.\n  So what I would like to do, Mr. President, is just have a colloquy \nwith my ranking member of the Personnel Subcommittee, Senator Cleland, \nand address a few of these issues that are included in the defense \nauthorization bill. I add that these are issues that if, for some \nreason, we would lose the defense authorization bill, if it did not \nhave sufficient votes or if upon passage it were vetoed, we would lose \nthese items. So I think it is extremely important for us to underscore \nthis.\n  I would like to start with an area that Senator Cleland and I have \nheld a hearing on, and that deals with the Aviation Officer Retention \nBonus Program. This is something that is critical.\n  So I ask the ranking member to explain what important step we took \nwith regard to the aviation officer retention bonus.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank the chairman very much.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to commend the distinguished Senator \nfrom South Carolina, Senator Thurmond, for being our leader on national \ndefense issues, and the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, \nSenator Levin. They have made a great team. In terms of great teams, I \nthink one of the greatest captains of a team I have ever come across is \nSenator Kempthorne, our distinguished Senator from Idaho. He and I have \nworked together on personnel matters and personnel issues.\n  Mr. President, it is my pleasure to support the defense authorization \nbill for several reasons.\n  One of the reasons is, as the Senator from Idaho has indicated, as my \ncolleagues have read in the newspapers, the Air Force and Navy are \nexperiencing real difficulties encouraging experienced pilots to stay \nin the service. Our Nation has invested, in some cases, up to some $6 \nmillion apiece to train these pilots, and the airlines are now \nbenefiting from that. They are hiring scores of pilots away from the \nmilitary services every month.\n  As part of our effort to retain these highly skilled pilots, the \npending bill increases the pilot bonus from the current $12,000 to \n$25,000, which is paid out over a 5-year period of time. This is a \nmodest increase. It comes from existing Air Force and Navy funds and \nwas requested by the Chief of Staff of the Air Force and the Chief of \nNaval Operations.\n\n  Without the legislative authority to increase the aviation officer \nretention bonus, we will fail to give the services the tools they need \nto keep highly skilled pilots in the cockpit.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Georgia \non that. Again, Mr. President, the fact of the matter is, there is a \ntremendous investment in having the finest pilots in the world, pilots \nthat have been trained to defend this Nation. But many of them--too \nmany of them--are now leaving the Armed Services and they are going \ninto the private sector. We need to have this sort of a program so that \nwe can retain the best pilots in the world in which we have made \nmillions of dollars of investment.\n  The pending bill also authorizes a 2.8-percent pay increase for our \nmen and women in uniform. Again, I ask my friend from Georgia to \nexplain the importance of this particular increase.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. President, without the legislative authorization to increase \nmilitary pay approved in this bill, the pay raise would be limited to \n2.3 percent at the same time you have Federal workers who receive a pay \nraise of at least 2.8 percent. In other words, without the enactment of \nthis bill, we will give civilians working for the Federal Government a \nlarger pay increase, larger pay raise than we give to men and women who \nare out there risking their lives to defend the interests of this \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I once ran a wonderful agency, the Veterans' \nAdministration, and I think our employees, our civilian employees, do a \nwonderful job. But this Defense authorization bill will allow us to \ngive the full 2.8 percent increase that certainly our military people \nrichly deserve.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Again, I thank the Senator from Georgia. And \nreferencing back to what the Senator from Nebraska, Senator Hagel, has \ntalked about, the deployment of our troops currently around the world, \nthe deployment in Bosnia, the dilemma that we are currently facing with \nIraq, the news that continues to come out of North Korea that because \nof the famine, we do not know what is going to happen in North Korea.\n  So we have our troops deployed around the world, ready to put their \nlives on the line. Here we have a situation that, again, if for some \nreason we lose this bill, we are not giving them the full pay increase \nthat they are entitled to. The message that that sends to our men and \nwomen in uniform is not healthy.\n  Mr. President, the bill also authorizes reductions in end strength, \nor manpower, reductions consistent with the Quadrennial Defense Review, \nto allow the services to save funds for badly needed modernization.\n  I ask Senator Cleland, Is it true that if this bill is not enacted \ninto law, the services will be forced to increase current personnel \nlevels to meet the floors established in last year's defense \nauthorization bill?\n  Mr. CLELAND. The Senator is eminently correct. Without the bill, the\n\n[[Page S11808]]\n\nservices will be prohibited from actually reducing personnel, which is \ncalled for in the Quadrennial Defense Review, and the services will be \nforced to add personnel that they have actually determined, Mr. \nPresident, they can live without. We do have an era of tight resources, \nand I think it is unwise of us as a Congress to force the services to \nkeep people they cannot afford.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I add that the Senate conferees fought \nvery hard to retain this important issue in the conference report, \nwhich was requested--and I will underscore this--by the Secretary of \nDefense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  Mr. President, the bill also authorizes a congressional commission on \nmilitary training in gender-related issues. I ask the ranking member to \nexplain some of the history behind this important section of the bill.\n  Mr. CLELAND. The Senator is absolutely right. The bill, in light of \nthe criminal behavior uncovered at Aberdeen Proving Grounds in \nMaryland, responds to strong sentiments in the Congress. Some of those \nstrong sentiments would like to legislate the end of gender-integrated \ntraining. There are equally strong voices against that type of \nlegislation. During our Personnel Subcommittee hearings on this \nparticular issue, the point was raised that a commission created by the \nDepartment of Defense might raise credibility issues in some quarters.\n\n  Responding to such legitimate concerns, the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee adopted the Kempthorne-Byrd amendment to create a \ncongressional commission to report directly to the Congress on this \nvery important issue.\n  Mr. President, here again the Senate conferees had to fight in \nconference to ensure that the commission remained objective.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I thank the Senator from Georgia and underscore what \nhe has said. Again, here is a critically important issue that is facing \nthe military and we want to get to the heart of it and find out what is \nthe extent of the problem, and most importantly what is the extent of \nthe solution.\n  I want to commend the Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, for \nhis leadership on this issue as well.\n  During our hearings this year the subcommittee heard testimony from \nactual recruiters about some of the difficult quality of life issues \nthat they face. The bill authorizes important steps to address how \nrecruiters and other military personnel who are not serving near a \nmilitary hospital receive health care.\n  Again, I ask the distinguished Senator from Georgia to help explain \nthese improvements to our colleagues.\n  Mr. CLELAND. This is one of the issues that I personally have a \nstrong commitment to and that is improving the quality of care in our \nmilitary facilities for our military active duty and retired personnel.\n  The conference report authorizes active duty personnel serving in \nremote locations to receive health care through the Tricare system at \nno expense to that military person or that military family. It will \nallow military personnel and their families to receive quality health \ncare where they live. This provision has real implications for active \nduty personnel and their families. It represents another quality of \nlife improvement contained in the defense authorization conference \nreport.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Again, I thank the Senator from Georgia.\n  Senator Cleland and I had a hearing on this aspect of recruitment. We \nare facing problems with recruitment. Here we are talking about the \nactual recruiters. We need to deal with this aspect so those recruiters \nhave a quality of life they can truly sell to those new individuals as \nto why they should join the services.\n  The defense authorization bill also includes seven provisions \naddressing the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans \nAffairs activities with regard to assisting those suffering from \nPersian Gulf illness. I note, too, Mr. President, that Senator Cleland \nis a former head of the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee held a hearing this spring in \nwhich General Schwarzkopf testified. At that particular hearing I asked \nGeneral Schwarzkopf his thoughts as to what is the cause of Persian \nGulf illness, and his point was he did not know what the cause of \nPersian Gulf illness was nor did he know the extent, but he made the \nvery important point we have to deal with our veterans that have this.\n  The committee remains dedicated to ensuring that the Department of \nDefense, in conjunction with the Department of Veterans Affairs, \ncontinue an aggressive research effort to determine causes and \ntreatment for this debilitating illness.\n  Mr. CLELAND. The Senator is eminently correct. The Persian Gulf \nillness question is one that continues to baffle those of us who try to \ndeal and struggle with it, but it certainly baffles the members of the \nmilitary family that served in the Persian Gulf. Those personnel \ndeserve justice. They deserve treatment when they are ill and they \ncertainly want us to get to the bottom of this question. This is one of \nthe most serious issues facing active duty and retired military \npersonnel, especially those who served in the Persian Gulf.\n  I want to say on behalf of our committee and our great leader, \nSenator Kempthorne, that we take this challenge seriously, and this \ndefense authorization bill will certainly help.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I thank the Senator from Georgia, and I agree totally \nwith the comments about our dedication to this.\n  Mr. President, the bill also includes a very important provision to \ncorrect a mistake made over 50 years ago. Specifically, the bill \nauthorizes retroactive payment of the stipends for Congressional Medal \nof Honor winners who only this year received the award for heroism \nduring World War II. Specifically, the bill authorizes payment to \nVernon J. Baker and the surviving families of Edward A. Carter and \nCharles L. Thomas.\n  Because of racism, seven Americans were denied the Medal of Honor \nthey rightly earned over 50 years ago. Earlier this year in a very \nmoving ceremony at the White House, President Clinton presented the \nMedal of Honor to Vernon Baker and the next of kin of the other \nrecipients, except for one recipient who, because he died so young, had \nno surviving relative. The conference report helps right this wrong. It \nought to be adopted by the Senate and signed by the President of the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. President, I am proud that Vernon Baker, a quiet and dignified \nman, is a resident of the peaceful community of St. Maries in my State \nof Idaho. Vernon Baker has never asked for the retroactive payment of \nthe stipend for the Congressional Medal of Honor, nor has he ever \nsought my assistance. But believe me, his act of bravery in April 1945 \nmakes him more than worthy and he deserves to have this wrong \ncorrected. We are not suddenly providing him or the families of the \nother recipients with a windfall. Instead, we are simply making sure \nthat they receive what should have been provided some 50 years ago.\n  There are other numerous important quality of life provisions in the \npending conference report, including military construction projects \nwhich include family housing. You can recruit the soldier, but if you \nare going to retain him you have to take care of the family. That is \nwhat this addresses. It cannot be initiated without passage of this \nreport.\n  I would like to thank my friend, Senator Cleland, for helping to \nexplain some of the important provisions in the pending conference \nreport and also for the many hours of dedicated service he and the \nother members of this subcommittee put in to make sure that we are \ntaking care of our men and women who wear the uniform of the greatest \nNation in the world.\n  My final point, Mr. President, is simply that, again, if for some \nreason this bill does not become law, all of these quality of life \nissues that we have addressed are lost. That is a terrible message to \nsend to the men and women who are defending the freedom of this Nation \naround the world on behalf of the United States.\n  I yield to my colleague, Senator Cleland, for any additional comments \nhe would like to make.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Regina \nJackson be permitted privileges of the floor for the duration of the \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Let me say I appreciate Senator Kempthorne's remarks\n\n[[Page S11809]]\n\nregarding the Congressional Medal of Honor recipients who were \nbelatedly recognized. Recognition on this issue is much appreciated for \nthose who have gone above and beyond the call of duty in the services \nof this country.\n  Mr. President, in terms of going above and beyond the call of duty \nthat is exactly what the distinguished chairman of this Personnel \nSubcommittee from the great State of Idaho, Senator Kempthorne, has \ndone in regard to bringing me on board as a freshman Senator in making \nme feel welcome, keeping me posted and informed, and including me in \nall of the legislative hearings and in all legislative debates and all \nlegislative matters before our committee. It has made me feel very much \nwelcome and very much a part of things. This was my first year on the \ncommittee and I couldn't have been more fortunate to have gotten a \nbetter chairman than Senator Dirk Kempthorne. I understand he intends \nto return to the great State of Idaho after completing his term in the \nSenate. He will be missed as a dear friend, as a colleague, and as a \ngreat leader. He has one more year to serve and I look forward to \nworking with him next year to make it a very productive year for us \nboth.\n  I also extend my gratitude to the distinguished chairman and ranking \nmember of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Senators Thurmond and \nLevin welcomed me as a brother and a colleague into the committee, \nfollowing in the footsteps of Senator Russell and Nunn in this Senate \nseat. It has been fun to try to tackle the chores that we tackled this \nyear. It wouldn't have been possible without the help that I received \nfrom both of them.\n  I also thank both the majority and minority staff of the committee \nunder the leadership of Les Brownlee and David Lyles. They have all \nbeen of great assistance to me as I have served on the committee. I \ncertainly appreciate the courtesies and hospitalities that their staffs \nhave given me.\n  Mr. President, this is a very important bill for all of the reasons \nSenator Kempthorne and I have discussed. It sets forth the priorities \nfor our national defense in the next year. The very title of the bill \nsuggests its importance--National Defense Authorization Act. It has \ntaken 9 long months to get to where we are today, yet one issue remains \ncontroversial. In spite of numerous concessions made by the Depot \nCaucus, this bill faces the threat of a veto. I do not understand this. \nMuch has been said on this topic so I will be brief.\n  There are at least two significant concessions. First, we agree to \nthe Department of Defense request to continue free and open public-\nprivate competitions for the workloads at Kelly Air Force Base, TX, and \nMcClellan in California, rather than directing the departments to \ntransfer this workload to the main depot which we believe is the intent \nof BRAC. To those who do not believe this is a major concession, this \nwould ratify the mechanism that overrides the BRAC recommendation.\n  I yield to the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, Senator Thurmond.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, Senator Kempthorne and Senator Cleland \nare valuable members of the Armed Services Committee. Both of them are \nexperts on military personnel and I wish to commend them for the \nimportant information they have given the Senate today on that subject.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. THURMOND. I yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to join Senator Thurmond in thanking \nSenators Kempthorne and Cleland for their tremendous work on this \nsubcommittee. I cannot think of any two colleagues that I would feel \nmore comfortable with being chairman and ranking member of that \nsubcommittee.\n  We will, indeed, miss Senator Kempthorne after he leaves this body. \nHe has been a great friend and a really wonderful participant in our \ndebates and deliberations, just as we welcome Senator Cleland as a new \nmember who has made a wonderful new addition to our committee.\n  We thank them both for their work.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I thank the chairman and the ranking member for the \nvery kind remarks.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I commend the chairman on his herculean \neffort to address the myriad of policy issues he has faced this year, \nbut I am wary about the fast track we seem to be on to decrease our \ndefense resourcing while simultaneously increasing our operational \ntempo. I am concerned that because of the dramatic cuts our total force \nhas taken in the past few years, that we are hollowing our force. I am \nconcerned that in spite of our downsizing efforts we are spreading our \nforces out more than any other time in our history.\n  Because of this fact, we must squeeze every ounce of bang for our \nbucks, and I believe that the Reserve components, the Guard in \nparticular, does this very well. Guard units are posted all around the \nworld in addition to performing their duties in their home states. \nGuard members come from all parts of the population, including former \nactive duty members of the active force. They bring with them, a wealth \nof experience and training. They are also inextricably woven into the \nfabric of their local communities, a point which we have come to \nrealize is all important, that our military be connected to our \ncitizenry. Our Army, our military, is the finest in the world, bar \nnone. It is composed of the finest young men and women, provided the \nfinest training and the most well resourced in the world. Our history, \nour legacy demands the support of our citizens for the institution, and \nthe Guard provides a critical link between our civilian community and \nthe military which protects them. Don't eviscerate the Guard and sever \nthat link. This bill makes a cut of 5,000 Guardsmen and women, troops \nwho we have already voted to fund in the appropriations bill. These \ntroops funding remained within the budget constraints and were \napparently desired by the Pentagon and the President as he approved the \nappropriations bill. I believe that this is an ill-advised reduction in \nforce.\n  Mr. President, I make the following points to explain my objections \nto the National Guard policy decisions reflected in this bill.\n  The Guard is unique of all the Reserve components; having both Army \nand Air Force components under a unified command, and the Guard \nperforms State oriented missions under title 32 and Federal missions \nunder title 10. The Guard has been the neglected step-child of the \nNational Command Authority for as many and more years than I have been \nin the Senate. No one can say that the Guard has received a fair share \nof the budget pie without direct input from the Congress. Each year we \nare required to inject hundreds of millions of dollars to keep the \nequipment accounts adequately funded as well as the training and \noperations funding accounts. I believe that a four-star position along \nwith the elevation of the directors of the Army Guard and Air Guard \nwould provide the Guard Bureau with much needed and appropriate upper \nechelon infrastructure and departmental and congressional vetting. I \nbelieve the Department of Defense has been disingenuous in its \ncharacterization of the National Guard's participation during the \nQuadrennial Defense Review. I believe that the current command \nstructure of placing the Air Guard under authority of the Army is \nconvoluted to say the least.\n  Mr. President, as a four-star, the chief of the Guard bureau will \nhave the rank required and the subsequent authority to actually have a \nplace at the table. Now the Guard Caucus would like to see that table \nbe at the JCS level, because that is from where our uniformed personnel \ndelivers recommendations to the National Command Authority. However, it \nis our main concern that the operational and force employment decisions \nhave a Guard input. So, we are open to constructive and statutory \nalternatives. But whatever the result, the status quo is unacceptable. \nThe provisions in this bill do nothing to alter seriously, the status \nquo. I predict that next year, in spite of this well intentioned but \nwholly inadequate compromise with rogue and obstinate members of the \nHouse, we will once again see resourcing problems in the Guard and \nReserve accounts. We will continue to see them until we, here in the \nCongress, do something to recognize and reflect our increased reliance \non our reserve components because of the force structure changes we are \nforcing our military to make.\n  I disagree strongly with the measures in this bill dealing with \nNational\n\n[[Page S11810]]\n\nGuard policies but I will grudgingly accept them for I do believe that \nwe do need an authorization bill and these are issues which may be \naddressed at a later date. And I guarantee you, that come next year, I \nwill be here again arguing for policies which will recognize the \nrelevancy of the Guard and which will position it appropriately within \nthe Department of Defense hierarchy.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I would like to discuss with the \ndistinguished chairman and ranking member of the Armed Services \nCommittee a provision in the DOD authorization bill conference report. \nThese provisions concern depot-level activities and are contained in \nsubtitle D of title III. As the chairman and ranking member know, \nLouisville is the home to the former Naval Surface Warfare Center \nDetachment which was closed by the 1995 Defense Base Closure and \nRealignment Commission. However, in its recommendation, the Commission \ndirected that the workload, equipment and facilities be transferred to \nthe private sector if the private sector could accommodate the workload \nonsite. The Commission's recommendation has been followed and the \nformer Navy depot was privatized in 1996. The current contract runs \nthrough the year 2000 if all the options are exercised. My \nunderstanding is that the competition requirements in section 359 of \nthe conference bill would not apply to any workload already privatized \nat the former depot in Louisville under the current contract or under \nany recompetition once the current contract expires. Is my \nunderstanding correct?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the distinguished senior Senator from \nKentucky is correct in his interpretation of section 359. First, under \nthe exception contained in new section 2469a(c)(3), these competition \nrequirements do not apply to any contract originally entered into \nbefore the date of enactment of the conference bill. Second, under new \nsection 2469a(b), these requirements apply only to workloads that are \ncurrently proposed to be converted from performance by DOD personnel to \nperformance by a private sector source for the first time, not to work \nthat has already been converted to performance by a private sector \nsource. For these reasons, the competition requirements in section 359 \nwould not apply to workloads that have already been converted to \nprivate sector performance at Louisville or any other similarly \nsituated facility.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I agree with the statement of the \ndistinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee that section 359 \ndoes not apply to any current or future solicitations or contracts for \nworkloads that have already been privatized at a former military \ninstallation before the enactment of the Fiscal Year 1998 Defense \nAuthorization Act. The conferees were aware of my colleague from \nKentucky's concerns about the successful privatization that has already \noccurred at Louisville and section 359 represents a compromise that \ndoes not affect workload currently performed at Louisville under \nexisting contracts or under any recompetition of those contracts. I \nwould also note that the requirements of this provision would not apply \nto any other workloads that Louisville may choose to compete for, \nunless those workloads were performed at a military installation that \nwas approved for closure or realignment under the 1995 BRAC round, and \nare proposed to be converted to private sector performance for the \nfirst time.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the distinguished chairman and ranking member of \nthe Armed Services Committee for their explanation of section 359 of \nthe conference bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of passage of the \nconference report on H.R. 1119, the National Defense Authorization Act \nfor Fiscal Year 1998. Despite its many flaws, some of which I will \nexpand upon momentarily, the report does represent a solid effort at \nadvancing the defense budget process in accordance with the legislative \nbranch of government's constitutional role in raising and supporting \nthe Armed Forces of the United States. Important policy issues are \naddressed, needed reforms are implemented, and vital quality of life \ninitiatives are authorized.\n  Procedurally, there is ample room for improvement in how the \nbudgetary responsibilities of Congress are executed. The exclusion from \nnegotiations of Members with important interests in specific issues \nshould not be accepted. Conversely, when invitations to participate in \nnegotiations on such issues are proffered, the Members in question \nshould not then decline those offers. Through such cooperativeness we \ncan hopefully avoid the kind of problems that have delayed final \npassage of this bill.\n  Lest anyone underestimate the importance of this bill, let me remind \nthem that it is bad enough that $13 billion foreign aid appropriations \nbills are routinely passed without proper authorization. To permit $260 \nbillion in defense spending to be enacted without appropriate \nauthorization is simply dangerous. The authorizing and appropriations \nprocesses, as we all know, provide Congress with its own much needed \ninternal system of checks and balances. As with the checks and balances \nthat exist between branches of government, should our internal system \nbreak down, the results will be grave indeed, including drastically \nreduced accountability in how public funds are spent and an elimination \nof vital oversight of the structure, equipping and training of our \nArmed Forces. That is not a situation that should be permitted to \ndevelop, and I intend to do everything in my power to prevent it from \nhappening.\n  We maintain the system of authorizing and appropriating to help \nprevent an excessive consolidation of power in too few hands. I don't \nthink I exaggerate when I suggest that such a consolidation would be \nseriously deleterious to the country's best interests.\n  On the content of the bill itself, when the fiscal year 1998 defense \nbudget process commenced early this calender year, it was widely \nanticipated that certain issues would delay and possibly derail our \nability to pass an authorization act. Chief among these is the so-\ncalled depot maintenance issue, inarguably the single most contentious \nissue with which the Senate Armed Services and House National Security \nCommittees were involved. Those of us who have been around a while are \nmore conversant than we would like to be in the intricacies surrounding \nthis arcane issue involving a handful of congressional districts.\n  The conference report before us today includes a depot compromise \nthat is much improved from previous depot language considered this \nyear. For example, it changes the 60/40 workload definition to 50/50. \nIt also removes the capacity factor requirement--that is 75 percent--\nwhich was synonymous to killing competition at Kelly and McClellan Air \nLogistics Centers. However, this remains an exceedingly deficient \napproach to the issue of depot-level maintenance, still grounded in \nprotectionist sentiments devoid of serious regard for the principles of \nsound public policy.\n  A key criticism is that the process was not inclusive of all the \nparties that would be affected by changing DOD policy on depots. I feel \nstrongly that developing compromise legislation with the depot caucus \nand the Kelly and McClellan supporters could have been achievable in \nthe late stages of the process. Having said that, however, this may be \nthe best compromise that could be expected.\n  I tried to reform depot policy in the past as chairman of the Senate \nReadiness Subcommittee on the Armed Services Committee and failed. So I \ncommend Senator Inhofe and Chairman Thurmond for making at least some \nmeaningful progress toward reforming the depot maintenance system. I \ncontinue to support fair and open competition between private and \npublic depots, though. Current law, even with these modifications, \nprecludes the full competition that would most benefit the American \ntaxpayer and allow the Defense Department to allocate operations and \nmaintenance dollars more optimally.\n  I am also disappointed that this compromise does not include language \nthat was in the Senate bill that changed section 2466--definition of \n60/40--by relating workload to a facilities-based definition rather \nthan a personnel-based definition. This provision would have allowed \nindustry to go into public depots and compete for work alongside public \nemployees and any core capability work done privately in a depot \ncounted against the public workload. This language, more than any other\n\n[[Page S11811]]\n\nprovision in the compromise encouraged public-private partnerships.\n  Another issue that was amicably resolved, but that should not have \nbeen brought up at all in light of the apparent resolution of the \nmatter during preparation of the previous fiscal year's authorization \nact, involves personnel missing in action in Southeast Asia. Most of \nthe onerous provisions, strenuously opposed by administrations of both \nparties as well as by theater and war-fighting commanders since its \ninception a decade ago, that establish burdensome bureaucratic \nrequirements upon our troops in the field and that place unrealistic \nrequirements upon the Defense Department personnel responsible for \naccounting for missing personnel, are included in the conference \nreport.\n\n  Those provisions that are included are not particularly necessary and \nwon't contribute to resolution of the problem of accounting for all \nmissing personnel, but they are not as egregious as the provisions that \nwere not included in the final bill. Those of us active on this issue \nfor many years who believed the issue to have been resolved last year \nwill not endure another protracted debate over provisions of extremely \ndubious merit when the process begins again next year. It was clearly \nstated by the conferees that this matter is considered closed. I expect \nthat to be the case.\n  Not surprisingly, given the wealth of unnecessary and wasteful \nprograms funded in the defense appropriations bill, the authorization \nact similarly includes numerous examples of items funded in the bill \nprimarily, and, in some instances solely, for parochial reasons. I have \nalready presented a list of such items from both the House and Senate \nauthorization bills for publication in the Congressional Record. \nConsequently, I will not repeat them item by item today. Suffice to say \nthat the unrequested $150 million for the B-2 bomber, the addition of a \ndestroyer not requested by the Defense Department, the acquisition of \nadditional C-130 airframes despite the surplus of such aircraft already \nin the fleet, the usual list of unrequested military construction \nprojects, and a variety of location-specific earmarks for such highly \nquestionable projects as those all-important Centers for Excellence, \nall combine to represent a business-as-usual approach to passing \nlegislation that serves to further erode public confidence in elected \nofficials while draining scarce financial resources from higher \npriority programs. To paraphrase Samuel Beckett, we've laughed at the \nidiocy so many times that the humor is gone and we are left with the \nunfortunate consequences of our actions.\n  Thankfully, negotiations on the authorization act succeeded in \ndiluting the potentially damaging effects of language on Bosnia, but \nthe appropriations bill has already addressed that action in a manner \napparently acceptable to the White House. The administration's \nprotestations notwithstanding, a satisfactory compromise was worked out \non the export of computers with dual use applications to countries with \nsuspect records in how such technology is exploited. Whether the \nCommerce Department wants to admit it or not, a legitimate national \nsecurity concern involving the export of such computers does exist, and \nI believe the language included in the conference report adequately \naddresses the concerns of both the national security apparatus and the \nindustry affected by it. I am surprised, therefore, that the Office of \nManagement and Budget included this issue in its letter to Majority \nLeader Lott as being particularly objectionable.\n  Provisions involving the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization serve little or no constructive purpose, particularly \nthose pertaining to cost. The cost of expanding the alliance is \ncertainly worth debating, but at the end of the day we ought not \npredicate a decision on whether to bring in new members on cost data \nthat is so qualified as to be rendered meaningless. Expanding NATO will \ncost as much or as little as we want to spend. We're not bringing in \nimpoverished Third World countries with facilities barely able to \naccommodate a Cessna. We're talking to countries that belonged, \ninvoluntarily, to the Warsaw Pact and which possess military \ninfrastructures that only need to be improved upon and that have \ncommand, control and communications networks that must be made \ncompatible with the rest of the alliance. That will certainly cost \nmoney, but it is hardly a deal breaker.\n  Thanks to the administration's decision to adopt a more reasonable \napproach toward missile defense issues, the conference report includes \na more realistic funding profile for both theater and national missile \ndefenses. The administration's admission that it was seriously \nunderfunding even rudimentary national missile defenses has helped to \nmove this issue forward in a constructive manner. Hopefully, this \npresages a trend toward a more mature and serious approach to missile \ndefenses on the part of the White House.\n  I am pleased that the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program is funded \nat the Defense Department's request while restricting the use of funds \nto exclude spending on programs or areas not directly involved in \ndismantling Russian weapon systems that would otherwise threaten the \nUnited States.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, the conference report to accompany H.R. \n1119 is like its predecessors: flawed but acceptable. It deserves our \nsupport and I hope my colleagues will agree to vote for its passage.\n\n\n                      core logistics capabilities\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. Chairman, Senator Levin, I would like to take a few \nmoments to discuss one of the concerns that has been raised relating to \nthe compromise language on depot maintenance. In particular, I would \nlike to ask a few questions regarding the provisions relating to core \nlogistics capabilities and workloads. The concern has been raised that \nthis language could require the Department to change its current depot \nmaintenance practices and bring in-house work that is now performed by \ncontractors. What is the view of the chairman and ranking minority \nmember on this issue?\n  Mr. THURMOND. It was not the intent of the depot maintenance \nprovisions to require the Department to bring in-house any work that is \nnow being performed by contractors, and those provisions should not be \ninterpreted to have that effect.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I agree with the distinguished Chairman. The depot \nmaintenance provisions in the bill are consistent with DOD's current \npolicy and practice on core logistics capabilities and will not require \nthe Secretary to bring in-house any work currently performed by private \ncontractors. As under current law, the Secretary of Defense gets to \ndecide what capabilities are core logistics capabilities, what \nworkloads are necessary to maintain those capabilities, what is cost \nefficient, and how much workload is necessary to ensure cost \nefficiency.\n  Mr. COATS. I understand that the Senators from Texas and California \nbelieve that the requirement to ``ensure''--rather than ``promote''--\ncost efficiency in the depots might be interpreted in such a way as to \nrequire the Department to withdraw depot maintenance workloads from the \nprivate sector and perform the work in public depots in order to \nachieve efficiency because the only way they can operate efficiently is \nto fully utilize the physical capacity. Could you please explain your \ninterpretation of the language? What do you believe it requires?\n  Mr. THURMOND. I would be happy to clarify what the conference \nagreement requires. First of all let me just say that this language \ndoes not require the Department of Defense to withdraw depot \nmaintenance workloads from the private sector and perform the work in \npublic depots in order to achieve efficiency. As the statement of \nmanagers indicates, it simply requires the Secretary to assign \nsufficient workload to these facilities to ensure that they are \noperated as cost efficiently as possible. The report clearly states:\n\n       The provision does not require that maintenance for all \n     weapon systems necessary for the execution of DOD strategic \n     and contingency plans be performed at public facilities. \n     Rather, it requires that the capability to perform \n     maintenance and repair on these systems be retained in the \n     public depot activities and that these activities be assigned \n     sufficient workload to ensure that they are operated as cost \n     efficiently as possible while preserving sufficient surge \n     capacity to support the strategic and contingency plans of \n     the U.S. Armed Forces.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I agree. This language requires that during peacetime the \npublic depots perform certain types of\n\n[[Page S11812]]\n\ndepot maintenance workloads necessary to retain the capability to \nmaintain mission essential weapon systems, and that sufficient amounts \nof work should be assigned to these depots in order to ensure that the \npersonnel necessary to perform the maintenance are operating \nefficiently. This does not mean that the Department would be required \nto perform maintenance on all mission essential weapon systems within \npublic depots; it simply requires that the Department retain a \ncapability to maintain this equipment, should it become necessary.\n  Mr. COATS. Then nothing in this language would preclude the \nDepartment from retaining a surge capacity to be used in times of \nmilitary emergency?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Absolutely not. The language specifically requires that \nthe public depots retain a surge capacity and reconstitution capability \nnecessary to support any strategic or contingency operations identified \nby the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The requirement for a surge capacity for \nmilitary emergencies by definition requires less than full utilization \nof the physical capacity during peacetime.\n  Mr. COATS. Isn't that similar to the Department's current policy?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Yes. The provision in question is a clarification of \nexisting law, which already requires DOD to ``maintain a logistics \ncapability (including personnel, equipment and facilities) to ensure a \nready and controlled source of technical competence and resources'' for \ncontingency situations and prohibits the contracting out of any \nlogistics activity identified by the Secretary as ``necessary to \nmaintain [that] logistics capability.''\n  Mr. THURMOND. I agree. The Department of Defense maintains a \npeacetime work force at these depots that can be supplemented with \nadditional personnel if they are necessary. Ensuring efficiency while \nretaining surge capacity and reconstitution capability is accomplished \nunder current policy by having the right number of personnel to perform \npeacetime workloads and simply adding the necessary personnel, or \nworkshifts, to provide a sufficient surge capacity to support any \ncontingency or strategic operations. In fact, when we drafted this \nlanguage, we asked the Department of Defense to review it and let us \nknow if the Department had any concerns, or if this did not reflect the \nDepartment's current policy. We made a number of changes to address the \nDepartment's written comments.\n\n  Mr. COATS. And did these comments identify the use of the word \n``ensure'' rather than ``promote'' as a concern?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Not initially. The Department provided the conferees \nwith two rounds of written comments on the draft compromise language. \nIn neither version did the Department suggest that ``promote'' be \nchanged to ``ensure.'' It was only on the day that the conference \nreport was finalized that the Department indicated that the use of the \nword ``ensure'' might be interpreted in such a way as to require all \nlogistics workloads to be performed at public depots. We informed the \nDepartment that the requirement to ensure efficiency does not mean that \nall logistics workloads must be performed at public depots, and added \nlanguage to the statement of managers to reaffirm that point.\n  Mr. COATS. So the bottom line is that this compromise language does \nnot require the Department to withdraw workloads from the private \nsector and move them to the public depots in order to ensure \nefficiency?\n  Mr. THURMOND. That is correct. The language does not require this.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I agree with the chairman.\n  Mr. COATS. If I could just ask one additional question, is there \nanything in this language that would preclude the Department from \ngiving appropriate consideration to the differences in cost or \nperformance risk particular to the location of the performance of the \nwork?\n  Mr. THURMOND. There is nothing in this language that would preclude \nsuch consideration. In fact, the bill language specifically requires \nthe consideration of all direct and indirect costs, and the report \nlanguage specifically states ``The Department would be expected to \nconsider real differences among bidders in cost or capability to \nperform the work based on factors that would include the proposed \nlocation or locations of the workloads.''\n  Mr. LEVIN. I agree with the chairman. Under this language we expect \nthe Department to give appropriate consideration to costs and risks \nassociated with the proposed location of the performance of the work.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the chairman and ranking member for this \nclarification.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today so that this great body may \nmomentarily reflect upon the importance of the bill we are about to \nvote on this afternoon. It is a bill whose beginnings extend back to \nearly Spring, a bill that has been through many hurdles since then to \ninclude a major compromise impacting competition at depots around the \ncountry. I intend to vote yes for this bill and I encourage my fellow \nSenators to do the same.\n  There have literally been thousands of differences between the House \nand Senate versions of this bill. However, what is important for \nMembers of this body to understand is that on both sides of the aisle, \nin both Houses of Congress, we have fundamental support for maintaining \nthe strongest national defense possible for America. This is not an \neasy task. We share differences in solutions to defense that range from \nmanagement styles, to leadership, to modernization and procurement, to \nthe vexing uncertainty of the funding levels required to sustain our \nforces in the field.\n  The conference agreement was unanimously supported by the committee \nunder the able leadership of Chairman Thurmond. On the major issues of \nBosnia, the B-2, cooperative threat reduction and other issues, the \nbill is much closer to the Senate position than the House position. \nEqually important to me, the bill is consistent with the targets of the \nbipartisan budget agreement.\n  The depot issue was certainly the most controversial provision in \nthis year's bill. There are strong feelings on both sides of the aisle. \nAs the committee noted recently, ``many jobs are at stake, and neither \nside wants to lose them.'' Certainly, I didn't want to lose any at our \ngreat depot in Anniston, AL. Nonetheless, I feel strongly that Chairman \nThurmond's objective all along was to ensure fair competition and a \nlevel playing field. I feel he and the other members of the committee \nachieved just that. We have a fair compromise. We have an honest \ncompromise. We have a product that the Department of Defense can work \nwith. I think it's time to put our disagreements behind us and move \nforward in unity to support the men and women in uniform for whom this \nbill is designed.\n  I plan to vote for this bill and I trust my colleagues will join me \nin making this vote an overwhelming one.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate Senator \nThurmond and Senator Levin, the distinguished chairman and ranking \nminority member of the Armed Services Committee, for their work in \nconference to produce a defense authorization bill that will help keep \nAmerica's military strong and well-prepared for today's multiple \nthreats and challenges. The U.S. leadership role has never been more \nimportant than it is now as the world reshapes itself to face a new \ncentury.\n  In order to lead, America must have strong diplomatic and military \ntools. As ranking minority member of the Committee on Foreign Relations \nI have worked this year with the Chairman, Senator Helms, to enhance \nour country's diplomatic readiness overseas.\n  Our Nation's defense force is the weight behind our diplomatic \ninitiatives. It is the critical strength upon which we rely when other \noptions, unfortunately, may fail. Good diplomacy is always built upon \ngood defenses and this bill enhances our ability to deal with critical \nforeign policy and security issues.\n  I am pleased that the conferees agreed to fully fund the Nunn-Lugar \nCooperative Threat Reduction program. This program assists Russia and \nother former Soviet states both to secure and control their nuclear \nmaterials and to improve their nuclear safety programs. This bill \nensures that the Nunn-Lugar program will continue to protect our \nnational security in a very cost-effective manner.\n\n[[Page S11813]]\n\n  The bill also requires the President and the Secretary of Defense to \nincrease their focus on counterterrorism efforts.\n  The importance of Asia and the Pacific is highlighted by an \nexpression of congressional support for continuing a minimum troop \npresence to support our security agreements with countries in that \nregion.\n  The bill contains another important provision that expresses the \nsense of the Congress that any moratorium on the use of antipersonnel \nlandmines by U.S. Armed Forces should not be implemented in a manner \nthat would endanger U.S. personnel or undermine their effectiveness. \nThis is consistent with the provisions of S. 896, the Landmine \nElimination Act of 1997, of which I am proud to be a cosponsor, as that \nact includes a Presidential waiver to protect American forces in Korea.\n  Like the defense appropriations bill, there are sections in this \nauthorization bill dealing with our involvement in Bosnia. As I have \nsaid before, I think that it was a mistake to have set a deadline for a \ncomplete American troop withdrawal from Bosnia. Months ago, I called \nfor a combined joint task force with European troops making up the \noverwhelming majority of the ground forces and Americans providing \ncommand and control, intelligence, and logistics assistance, air and \nnaval support, and, if necessary, a ready reserve force in the region. \nSo, I agree with the thrust of this bill's recommendation, but I also \nthink a small, residual American ground force in Bosnia may be \nnecessary to maintain America's leadership role in the operation.\n  I am happy to see the commendation for the NATO enlargement process \nand the sensible reporting requirements contained in this conference \nreport.\n  In separate provisions, by authorizing pay raises and barracks \nconstruction, this bill takes important steps to enhance the quality of \nlife for our brave men and women in uniform.\n  This bill also adds two positions to the Joint Chiefs of Staff to \ninclude National Guard and Reserve commanders. This change recognizes \nthe unique and increasingly vital role played by our reservists and \nguard members in our nation's defense.\n  Last, the conferees maintained the U.S. ability to forcefully project \npower by continuing to fully fund the C-5 aircraft. The C-5 is the \nmilitary's workhorse plane--carrying heavy weapons like tanks and \nhelicopters all over the world. Its singular value has been shown in \nconflict after conflict, from Vietnam to Desert Storm. Delawareans are \nproud to host a significant portion of the Nation's C-5 fleet stationed \nat the Dover Air Force Base and glad to see that Dover's infrastructure \nwill benefit from the military construction appropriations bill signed \nby the President and authorized by this bill.\n  I am pleased, therefore, to support the work of my colleagues on the \nArmed Services Committee and vote to strengthen America's leadership \nrole around the world with a strong, well-equipped military.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a brief colloquy \nwith the senior Senator from South Carolina.\n  I understand that the conference report on the Department of Defense \nreauthorization bill includes a provision--section 1088--that \nreauthorizes the Aviation Insurance Program for 5 years. The Senate \nwill soon act on a freestanding bill to reauthorize this important \nprogram. The freestanding bill (S. 1193) was approved recently by the \nCommerce Committee, which is the committee with jurisdiction over this \nprogram.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Because the Aviation Insurance Program is so vital to \nU.S. military missions overseas, we thought it prudent to try to \nreauthorize it in the defense bill, which is a must pass piece of \nlegislation. The military depends on the airlift capacity that \ncommercial carriers provide. Without an insurance program in place, \ncarriers will be less likely to participate in the Civil Reserve Air \nFleet, for one.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I agree with my colleague from South Carolina that it is \nessential that we reauthorize this program as soon as possible. Our \ngoals are the same in that respect. Nevertheless, the Commerce \nCommittee specifically acted to reauthorize the Aviation Insurance \nProgram through 1998. The committee did so out of concern that the \nbalance in the revolving fund is insufficient to pay a major claim or \nsimultaneous claims. Timely payments for hull losses are a significant \nissue. Many of the carriers lease aircraft under agreements that \nstipulate that they have to repair or replace damaged aircraft within \n30 days of the damage.\n  The bill would not grant the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] \nborrowing authority to cover claims against the program, as we had \noriginally planned. Rather, a short term extension of the program gives \nthe committee and the administration additional time to craft an \nalternative to FAA borrowing authority. S. 1193 also makes other \nimportant modifications to the program.\n  I appreciate the efforts of the Armed Services Committee to ensure \nthat the Aviation Insurance Program is in place. If, however, both of \nthese bills are enacted into law, I want to clarify that the provisions \nof S. 1193 supersede the 5-year reauthorization bill. Is that agreeable \nto the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee?\n  Mr. THURMOND. That sounds like a good accommodation to me. When and \nif S. 1193 or a similar House version is signed into law, its language \nreauthorizing the Aviation Insurance Program should be controlling. If \nfor some reason that bill is not approved before Congress adjourns for \nthe year, and the defense authorization bill is signed into law, the \ndefense bill provisions will serve to reauthorize the program until \naction on S. 1193 or a similar House bill is taken.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my good friend and colleague for his \nunderstanding.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I intend to vote in favor of the \nDefense Department authorization conference report which contains \ncritical funding for our Armed Forces. This legislation authorizes \n$268.2 billion in budget authority, the spending level recommended in \nthe concurrent resolution on the budget.\n  I also am pleased that the Senate and House conferees agreed to \ninclude provisions from two bills I introduced earlier this year. \nSection 1082 of the DOD conference report authorizes the flying of the \nPOW/MIA flag over military installations, memorials and post offices \naround the nation and at other appropriate places of significance on \nArmed Forces Day, Memorial Day, Flag Day, Independence Day, Veterans \nDay, and National POW/MIA Recognition Day. This provision reflects in \nlarge part the language of S.528 which I introduced on April 9, 1997.\n  The United States has fought in many wars, and thousands of Americans \nwho served in those wars were captured by the enemy or listed missing \nin action. In 20th century wars alone, more than 147,000 Americans were \ncaptured and became prisoners of war; of that number more than 15,000 \ndied while in captivity. When we add to this number those who are still \nmissing in action, we realize that more can be done to honor their \ncommitment to duty, honor, and country.\n  The display of the POW/MIA flag would be a forceful reminder that we \ncare not only for them, but for their families who personally carry \nwith them the burden of sacrifice. We want them to know that they do \nnot stand alone, that we stand with them and beside them, as they \nremember the loyalty and devotion of those who served. This section \nprovides that support.\n  The DOD conference report also contains important provisions to \nstrengthen how the Defense Department tracks and accounts for our \nmissing in action.\n  To address this issue, the DOD Conference Report includes the \nfollowing provisions. These provisions are based on S. 755, which I \nintroduced on May 15, 1997.\n  Civilian contract employees who accompany armed forces in the field \nare now covered under all DOD POW/MIA search and recovery policies.\n  The theater component commander is now involved in the initial \nassessment of a missing person's status, where as before, the initial \nhandling of the situation originated with the Secretary of Defense in \nWashington, DC.\n  A new file must be opened and reviewed if any new information \nsurfaces concerning the status, living or dead, of an MIA.\n  A status review board, when making a determination of death must now\n\n[[Page S11814]]\n\nprovide a description of the location of the body, if recovered, and if \nthe body is not identifiable, a certification by a forensic \npathologist. DOD may also have input by other specialists of \nappropriate medical sciences.\n  Personnel files will now be established for Korean conflict cases \nupon receipt of new information.\n  Families of MIAs will now have more open communication with counsel \nappointed to investigate the missing person.\n  Last summer, a United States forensics team returned what are \nbelieved to be the remains of four American Korean war soldiers who \nhave been missing for nearly half a century. The following day, news \nreports then indicated that recently declassified Air Force documents \nshow that the Department of Defense had knowledge of POW's in Korea \nafter the Korean war. These events clearly reinforce the necessity for \nthese provisions as thousands of POW and MIA's still remain unaccounted \nfor. I believe that the provisions adopted by the Senate-House \nconference and included in the legislation we consider today will go a \nlong way to help the families of our servicemen and women missing in \naction and will strengthen Defense Department policies for the future.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, it has taken 9 long months to get to \nwhere we are today. Yet one issue remains controversial. In spite of \nnumerous profound concessions made by the Depot Caucus, this bill faces \nthe threat of a veto. I do not understand this. Much has been said on \nthis topic, so I will be very brief.\n  There were at least two significant concessions.\n  First, we agreed to the Department of Defense request to continue \nfree and open public-private competitions for the workloads at Kelly \nAir Force Base, TX, and McClellan Air Force Base, CA, rather than \ndirecting the Department to transfer this workload to the remaining \ndepots, which we believe was the intent of the BRAC. I would urge those \nwho do not believe this is a major concession to consider that this \nmeasure would essentially ratify a mechanism that overides a major BRAC \nrecommendation.\n  Second, we agreed to the Department of Defense request to lower the \n60-40 rule to 50-50. The administration requested 50-50. The Congress \nresponded with 50-50, over the objection of many in the Depot Caucus.\n  What I find ironic is that on the two most significant priorities the \nadministration had, we conceded to the administration position. Yet \nthere is still talk of a veto here. I do not understand that, \nespecially when I have to explain to people why we agreed to give up so \nmuch in return for so little.\n  I am not completely satisfied with the depot provision in the \nconference report, but it is a provision I can live with. The \nDepartment of Defense shares this view, and I would note that the \nprovision has the unanimous support of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  The provision does not include everything that either side really \nwanted, but it is undoubtedly a fair and unbiased bill that places \nbidders on an equal footing.\n  When Robins Air Force Base won the contract to perform maintenance on \nthe C-5, it had to go the extra mile to prove to the Air Force that it \ncould do the job. It had to endure additional audits, above what is \nnormally expected in such cases. Robins' bid was adjusted after it was \nsubmitted to account for factors which the private bidder was not \nsubjected to. In spite of this unlevel playing field, Robins was able \nto win the award because of its outstanding record and the quality of \nits people.\n  I support fair competition, and I agree it can result in lower costs \nto the Federal Government. This bill provides for fair competition. I \nurge my colleagues to adopt it, and I urge the President to sign it \ninto law.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, the conference report for the National \nDefense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1998 is being considered by \nthe Senate. This is an important component of the national security \nlegislation that the Congress must pass each year. The national defense \nauthorization conference report is a good, bipartisan bill. The \nconference between the Senate and the House conferees dealt with many \nsubstantial issues. There were tough negotiations on many issues, and \nthis bill provides a balanced approach and fair compromise. There are \nthree areas that I would like to talk about which are very significant. \nThese are in regard to United States policy in Bosnia; the depot \nmaintenance compromise; and some very substantial quality of life \nissues for our troops--the men and women in uniform who serve our \nNation.\n  Mr. President, it is important to note that none of these significant \nnational security issues will be addressed in any other forum unless \nthe Senate passes this conference report and it is enacted into law.\n  For example, significant progress was made in this legislation with \nregard to United States policy in Bosnia. The bill states that it is \nthe sense of Congress that United States ground combat forces should \nnot participate in a follow-on force in Bosnia after June 1998. In \naddition, the bill contains a provision cutting off funds to support \nUnited States troops in Bosnia after June 30, 1998, unless the \nPresident certifies that their continued presence in Bosnia is required \nto meet our national security interests, and provided United States \npolicy continues to preclude U.S. forces from being used to perform \ncivil law enforcement functions.\n  This is a significant message to the administration and our NATO \nallies. This provides a workable solution to this complex policy issue, \nand is certainly more acceptable to the Senate and the administration \nthan some of the alternatives proposed. I believe our language on \nBosnia clearly puts the United States appropriately on record and yet \npreserves the constitutional authority and the necessary flexibility \nthe administration needs to deal with the thorny issue of Bosnia.\n  Another significant issue is the area of depot maintenance, and the \nfair and open competition that was created by the compromise in this \nlegislation. There are strong feelings on both sides of the depot \nissue--with many jobs at stake. The conferees' objective was to ensure \nfair competition and a level playing field. This conference report \ncompromise achieves two things: Straightforward criteria for fair and \nopen competition and, provides greater opportunity for DOD outsourcing.\n  Mr. President, one of the most significant areas in this legislation \nthat will not be adequately addressed unless this bill is passed are \nvery important provisions that support our military personnel in \nuniform who serve our nation so proudly--our troops who the President \nhas so readily called upon in times of crisis throughout the world. Men \nand women who are now serving in dangerous and remote places like \nBosnia, along the DMZ in Korea, and sailing in ships like the aircraft \ncarrier U.S.S. Nimitz and its battle group who President Clinton has \njust recently ordered into the Persian Gulf to send a very clear \nmessage to Saddam Hussein. If we do not pass this bill we will be \nfailing those we call on in times of crisis--the men and women in \nuniform.\n  Examples of some of these important provisions are adjustments to \ntroop strength levels, military pay raises, specialty pay and bonuses, \nmajor reform to housing allowances that will eliminate Government \nwaste, authorization for new family housing units, and finally an \nimportant step forward in establishing accountability in the fair and \nequal treatment of our troops--both men and women.\n  Compared to current law, this bill provides lower end strength levels \nand increased flexibility for the Pentagon and the individual services \nto manage military personnel strength. If the bill is not enacted, the \nmilitary services will be held to the higher fiscal year 1997 end \nstrength levels that were based on the 1993 Bottom Up Review. Levels \nthat are higher than they need to be, levels that require the DOD to \nspend money that it does not have and does not need to spend. The lower \npersonnel levels authorized are also consistent with the Department of \nDefense's Quadrennial Defense Review [QDR]. If we do not enact this \nbill we might as well throw the recommendations of that review right \nout the window.\n  Without these modified troop strength levels, the services will have \nto recruit and retain personnel that they will have to separate from \nthe service 1 year later. Is this responsible\n\n[[Page S11815]]\n\ngovernment? This will be disruptive to our military, unfair to its \npeople, and significantly detract from funding needed for \nmodernization. This is just poor stewardship of our Nation's precious \nresources.\n  Without this Defense authorization bill, the military pay raise that \nwe authorize in this bill will be less than our service members \ndeserve. The bill includes a 2.8 percent pay raise for military \npersonnel. If the bill is not enacted, the pay raise for military \npersonnel will be limited to 2.3 percent.\n  Mr. President, the bill also includes authority for significant \nincreases in the special pay and bonus structure designed to respond to \ncritical recruiting and retention problems highlighted by the \nDepartment of Defense in our Personnel Subcommittee hearings. If the \nbill is not enacted, these authorities will not be available to the \nDepartment of Defense to address these problems. Specific groups that \nwould be affected include military aviators, nuclear-qualified \nofficers, dentists, military members on overseas tours, military \nmembers receiving family separation allowances and/or hazardous duty \nassignment pay, and military members serving in hardship duty \nlocations.\n  Reducing military pay raises while failing to increase these bonuses \nthrough defeat of the Defense authorization bill will punish those who \nexpect us here in the Congress to look out for them. We will be \nrepudiating the commitments we have made to improving the quality of \nlife for military personnel and their families.\n  The conference report also includes a major reform to housing and \nsubsistence allowances. These are significant reforms to the existing \nstructure for housing allowances and subsistence allowances for \nmilitary members. The reforms are intended to simplify the management \nof these allowances and to better target the allowances to those \nindividuals and geographic areas where the need is most acute. The \nreforms will save the Department of Defense money which can be used for \nother compensation and quality of life projects. If the bill is not \nenacted, the Department of Defense will be forced to continue to use \nthe existing, out-dated allowance structure with all its demonstrated \ninefficiencies, inequities, and higher costs.\n  I assure my colleagues if we do not support military personnel with \npay and compensation levels that are fair and meet the needs of their \nfamilies, we will see increases in career personnel leaving the \nmilitary services. They will see our action as a breach of faith and \nthey will be absolutely right in their assessment.\n  The bill also provides authority for the Department of Defense to \nbegin construction on the fiscal year 1998 military construction \nprojects which include quality of life and training-related facilities. \nIf the bill is not enacted, construction cannot begin. Some may believe \nthat since the military construction and family housing projects are \nfunded in the Military Construction Appropriations Act, they do not \nneed the authorization in the conference report. Let me assure my \ncolleagues that is not correct. Both an authorization and an \nappropriation are required for military construction projects. Without \nthis bill we will not build new family housing units. We will not build \nnew barracks and dormitories for our single service members. We will \ndelay construction on child care centers and dining facilities. If we \ndeny these military construction projects, we will be guilty of failing \nto meet our commitment in support of our troops.\n  And finally, another issue of great importance, is creating an \nopportunity for fair and equal treatment for all our troops. This body \nhas few greater responsibilities than maintaining the effectiveness and \naccountability of our Nation's Armed Forces. This is one of the reasons \nthat reports of widespread sexual harassment in our Nation's military \ndeeply concerns us all. With Department of Defense statistics showing \nthat sexual harassment is prevalent throughout the Armed Forces--we \nmust do more than pay lip service to the problem. We must act, and this \nbill does that.\n  Today, with a full understanding that the time has come for serious \naction that is responsible and constructive, a provision that I \nauthored is included in this 1998 Defense authorization bill that \nplaces us on the road to solving the crisis of sexual harassment that \nplagues our military force. This legislation attacks the root of the \nproblem--the lack of accountability when it comes to reporting and \ninvestigating incidents of sexual harassment.\n  The Department of Defense conducted a survey in 1988 and found that \n64 percent of women reported that they had experienced one or more \nincidents of sexual harassment in the 12 months preceding the survey. \nThe Defense Department conducted another study in 1995 and found that \nthe figure had only improved to 55 percent. This is not progress, these \nstatistics are shocking.\n  In its 1995 Defense Department survey, only 24 percent of the victims \nchose to report their sexual harassment experiences. Is this the kind \nof environment to which we should subject our volunteer force? These \nnumbers tell me that women essentially stand a 50-50 chance of being \nharassed. This cannot and should not be tolerated. Add to that the fact \nthat over three fourths of our military personnel do not feel they can \nreport the harassment that occurs and you clearly have a very negative \nset of circumstances. How can you maintain good order and discipline in \nsuch an environment? This situation demands accountability. And it \nrequires action to erase any perception that sexual harassment is \ntolerated in today's Armed Forces.\n  My provisions in this bill require the unit commander to report each \nand every sexual harassment incident to their next senior officer \nwithin 72 hours. Once reported, the unit commander appoints an \ninvestigating officer to investigate the complaint of sexual \nharassment. The unit commander has 14 days to report back to their \ncommander with the results of the investigation. If the unit commander \ncannot complete the investigation within 14 days, that commander must \nreport the interim results, every 14 days, until the investigation has \nbeen completed.\n  Today when an incident is reported to a unit commander, the commander \nis not required to report the incident until a preliminary \ninvestigation recommends disciplinary action. This gives the unit \ncommander tremendous latitude as to how the case is handled. In most \ninstances this is a not a problem. But look what we witnessed with the \ntragedy at Aberdeen. We saw a company commander who was a bad apple and \nthere was no established system to alert his superiors that there was a \nproblem.\n  Under the provisions of the national defense authorization bill each \nincident is immediately brought to the attention of a more senior \nofficer. The most distinct advantage of this provision is that the \ndecibel level of the problem rises by elevating the matter to the \nhighest echelons of the services. Mr. President, this accountability is \nincluded in this legislation.\n  This provision also requires that the senior officers who receive \nthese reports of sexual harassment forward all the complaints they \nreceive and the results of the investigations of those complaints to \ntheir respective service Secretary by January 31 of each year, \nelevating the problem another notch within the military to the authors \nof the services' zero-tolerance policies where they can be scrutinized. \nThe service Secretaries are then required to forward this information \nto the Secretary of Defense who in turn must report the information to \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, this is what is needed to put us on the road to help \nend sexual harassment in our military. We owe the men and women who \nserve our Nation an environment that includes accountability, good \norder, and discipline. But we also owe this to our Nation, which relies \non our military to defend our great country and its interests.\n  The committee has been working on this bill for the past 10 months, \nit is an essential piece of legislation that must be passed by the \nSenate to ensure our national defense. We owe it not only to our people \nin uniform but to our Nation. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of \nthis conference report. Thank you, Mr President, and I yield the floor.\n\n\n                        Military Utility Assets\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as chairman of the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources, I would like to\n\n[[Page S11816]]\n\nengage in a colloquy with Mr. Thurmond regarding section 2812 of the \nconference report, the section of the bill authorizing the sale of \nmilitary utility assets.\n  Mr. THURMOND. What is the distinguished Senator from Alaska's concern \nregarding section 2812?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wish to draw the Senator's attention to the plain \nmeaning of section 2812 so that there is no confusion in its \napplication or implementation.\n  First, the plain meaning of the provision does not limit the \nSecretary of a military department's authority to convey electric \nutility assets present at a military base. There is no requirement that \nboth electric generation and distribution facilities be present at a \nbase in order for the Secretary of a military department to convey \nassets. Indeed, the plain language of section 2812 states that such \nSecretaries may ``convey a utility system, or part of a utility \nsystem.''\n  Second, section 2812 has no effect whatsoever on existing preference \npower allocations. If an entity that is not currently eligible for--or \nis not currently receiving--preference power buys an electric utility \nsystem at a base which is entitled to receive preference power, the \nbase will continue to receive that preference power--subject of course \nto the terms of existing contracts, rights, or obligations. There is \nnothing whatsoever in the plain meaning of section 2812 to the \ncontrary, nor is there any language in the provision supporting the \nidea that a base's preference power allocation will transfer to any \nasset purchaser that buys a military base utility system. Federal \nmilitary bases, as customers of the Federal Government's utilities--the \nPower Marketing Administrations--will not be defeased of their rights \nto purchase preference power, regardless of the purchaser of military \nbase assets.\n  Finally, I wish to reiterate that there is nothing in the plain \nlanguage of section 2812 which in any way supports the notion that a \nparticular purchaser (either a municipal, private, regional, district, \nor cooperative utility or other entity) should be given any particular \npreference with respect to the purchase of military base utility \nassets. Indeed, the section is intended to create a level playing field \nfor all to compete for the purchase of the facilities. There is no \nlanguage whatsoever in the section supporting the idea that preference \npower recipients should receive an advantage in competitive bidding for \nmilitary base utility assets. Moreover, regardless of who purchases the \nutility system, the base will continue to receive Federal preference \npower pursuant to the terms and conditions of contracts.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I thank the Senator for those comments.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise to engage the distinguished \nChairman of the Armed Services Committee and President pro tempore, \nSenator Strom Thurmond, in a colloquy. Mr. President, I know the \nchairman is very familiar with the important work conducted by the \nDepartment of Energy's Technology Development Program.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Yes, I know the DOE's Technology Development Program \ndoes very useful work developing new technologies to tackle many of the \ntough waste management and environmental restoration challenges across \nthe DOE complex.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, the chairman also knows the pending \nconference report authorizes $220 million for technology development \nwork in fiscal year 1998. Within these authorized and appropriated \nfunds, Assistant Secretary Alm has agreed to provide $22.5 million to \nthe Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory [INEEL] to \nenhance application and deployment of innovative technologies across \nthe DOE complex through specific validation, verification, and system \nengineering activities. This work will focus on simulation modeling, \ntreatability studies and development of disposition processes for major \nDOE waste streams. The work will also help focus DOE's Environmental \nManagement Program on accelerating clean up, developing alternative, \nimproved technologies, and developing and tracking performance metrics \nfor these efforts. This work is certainly within the authorized scope \nof work of the DOE's Technology Development Program, is it not?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Yes; this work is what we expect from the Department of \nEnergy's Technology Development Program. I am also pleased to hear \nAssistant Secretary Alm is working with you and the INEEL to take full \nadvantage of the enormous capabilities of that national lab. I urge the \nSenator from Idaho to keep me apprised of the progress of this \nimportant work.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I want to assure the chairman I will keep him \ninformed about our progress in this area. I also want to thank my \nchairman for his hard work and leadership during the conference on the \n1998 Defense authorization bill.\n\n\n                      brilliant antitank munition\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to engage the Senator from \nIndiana in a brief colloquy to clarify a language provision of this \nlegislation regarding the Brilliant Antitank, or BAT Munition in \ndevelopment for the U.S. Army. There have been some in DOD that have \nquestioned whether the intent of Congress is to cancel the basic BAT \nprocurement program for future years. I maintain this is not our \nintent. The BAT program is a key component of the Army's long-range \nfire support against threatening armored forces, but has experienced \nsome developmental difficulties in recent months. It is clear to all of \nus that in fiscal year 1998, BAT is not ready for full-scale production \nand the committee's action eliminates the funds for production and \napplies them to much-needed further development. This is a move which \nis supported by the U.S. Army and in no way indicates a change in their \nrequirements. Would the Senator say that my understanding is correct?\n  Mr. COATS. I would say to the Senator from Alabama that his \nunderstanding is correct.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, as I understand the proposed BAT \nlanguage then, the committee is only eliminating basic BAT procurement \nfor fiscal year 1998 and the committee intends for the basic BAT \nprogram, as well as the advanced sensor, to continue development \nthrough fiscal year 1998 at which time the committee will have an \nopportunity to evaluate the program's progress this time next year. \nAgain, would the Senator conclude that my understanding is correct?\n  Mr. COATS. I would say to the Senator that yes, his understanding is \ncorrect. The conferees believe it is important that the Department of \nDefense understands that the intent of Congress was not to prohibit \nfuture procurement of basic BAT, but to eliminate 1998 production. \nFuture congressional evaluation will determine whether the Army should \nenter into either full-scale production of the basic BAT submunition or \nlimit production to the number required for testing and evaluation of \nthe improved (P31) BAT objective system.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to thank both the distinguished \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Readiness, Senator Inhofe, and the \ndistinguished chairman of the Committee on Armed Services and manager \nof the bill, Senator Thurmond, for their cooperation in including \nprovisions to reauthorize the Sikes Act in H.R. 1119.\n  The Sikes Act was first enacted by Congress in 1960 to provide \nenhanced stewardship of fish and wildlife and other natural resources \non military installations. The act seeks to capitalize on the enormous \npotential for natural resource conservation on military lands. The \nDepartment of Defense controls nearly 25 million acres of land and \nwater at approximately 900 military installations in the United States, \nand the National Guard oversees an additional 1 million acres on 80 \nsites. These lands serve as home to approximately 100 endangered or \nthreatened species and countless other fish and wildlife resources.\n  The amendment that I offered to the bill, along with Senators \nKempthorne, Warner, and Baucus when it was pending before the Senate, \nwould infuse new vigor into the implementation and effectiveness of the \nSikes Act. Specifically, it would require the Secretary of each \nmilitary department to develop a natural resource management plan for \neach of its military installations, unless there is an absence of \nsignificant natural resources on the base. The plan would be prepared \nby the Secretary in cooperation with the Fish and Wildlife\n\n[[Page S11817]]\n\nService and the appropriate State fish and wildlife agency. The plan \nmust be consistent with the use of military lands to ensure the \npreparedness of the military, and cannot result in any net loss in the \ncapability of the installation to support its mission. With those \ncaveats, the plan must also provide for the management and conservation \nof natural resources. This language accommodates the interests of the \nState and Federal wildlife agencies as well as the needs of the \nmilitary.\n  I would like to thank the conferees for accepting the Senate language \nextending the deadline for completing natural resource management plans \nfrom 2 to 3 years from the date of the initial report to Congress, \nwhich is required 1 year after the date of enactment. This change was \nnegotiated between the Committees on Environment and Public Works and \nArmed Services, and approved by all interested parties, including the \nDepartments of Defense and the Interior, and the International \nAssociation of State Fish and Wildlife Agencies. This change should \nenable the Department of Defense to complete the plans within its own \ninternal timeframes, without unnecessarily missing any statutory \ndeadlines.\n  As I mentioned when I offered this amendment back in July, \njurisdiction of the Sikes Act, since its passage in 1960, has always \nrested with the Committee on Environment and Public Works. Bills to \namend and reauthorize the act, including one that was introduced in the \n103d Congress containing substantive revisions similar to the revisions \nin this amendment, have all been referred to that committee. The fact \nthat reauthorization of the Sikes Act is being done through the DOD \nauthorization bill represents the fortunate circumstance that after \nmore than 1 year of debate, agreement happened to be reached by all \nparties at this particular time in this particular context. This \ncircumstance does not alter the jurisdiction over the Sikes Act in the \nfuture. Nevertheless, the Committee on Environment and Public Works has \nalways worked cooperatively on that portion of the Sikes Act pertaining \nto military installations in the past, and will continue to do so in \nthe future.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I believe that this provision will \nsignificantly improve the Sikes Act, and I thank the conferees for all \ntheir hard work.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, every high school civics student is taught \nthe importance of the system of checks and balances among the three \nbranches of government that underlays our representative government. \nThat system, as we all know, is an essential element of democracy. \nWithout it, the consolidation of excessive power in one branch of \ngovernment poses a very real risk to the survival of true democracy \nand, consequently, the welfare of the republic.\n  I do not intend to sound melodramatic, but I believe strongly that \nthe survival of the legislative branch's own system of internal checks \nand balances is similarly essential to the welfare of our country. The \nprocess of authorizing appropriations exists for a reason, and that \nreason has only increased over time. The balance of power within the \nbranch of our Government that enjoys a constitutional prerogative over \nthe raising and expenditure of revenues seriously needs to be respected \nand maintained.\n  Important policy directives that are an integral part of the \nauthorizing process are not particularly well suited to the \nappropriations process. Authorization acts are intended to set the tone \nfor the appropriations process that, ideally, would follow. When this \nsystem begins to degrade for whatever reason, the entire budget review \nprocess falters, and essential legislative provisions and oversight \nactivities go unaddressed.\n  The two-step process of reviewing the President's budget request for \ndefense--in both the authorization and appropriations committees--is \nespecially crticial to our national security. The Senate Armed Services \nand House National Security Committees provide Congress its most \nimportant body of knowledge and experience in the vital realm of \nnational security affairs. The defense authorization bill, which is the \nmajor legislative product of these committees, contains the \nrecommendations of the Congress' defense experts on important policy \nmatters as well as guidance on funding priorities. Many of the policy \nrecommendations in this bill must be enacted before the dollars \nprovided in the appropriations bill can be expended to implement them, \nsuch as the increases in pay and bonuses that are key to good morale in \nthe force.\n  With all due respect to the Appropriations Committees, no single \ncommittee should be granted sole authority over the expenditure of $260 \nbillion in defense funds. The manning, structure, equipping, and \ntraining of the most powerful and important armed forces in the world \nis too important to set aside the long-standing process of \nauthorization and appropriations review.\n  Despite its flaws, and there are some, I urge my colleagues to vote \nfor the Fiscal Year 1998 National Defense Authorization Act. To fail to \npass this important legislation would be an abrogation of one of our \nmost important responsibilities and would shift the balance of power \nwithin Congress from the many to the few, to the detriment of our \nfuture security.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise in strong support \nof the conference report on the fiscal year 1998 Defense authorization \nbill. I want to specifically commend the distinguished chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee, Senator Thurmond, for his outstanding \nleadership in formulating this legislation. I also want to thank the \nSenator from Michigan, Senator Levin, for his profound contributions to \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. President, although this has been a long and difficult \nconference, the product of these labors is an excellent defense bill. \nThis legislation will provide for necessary modernization of our Armed \nForces, and significantly improve the quality of life for our service \nmembers and their families.\n  Importantly, this bill addresses in a very fair and appropriate \nmanner, a variety of issues upon which the administration expressed \nstrong concerns. Many of these issues had been represented as possibly \ntriggering a veto. These include Bosnia, the B-2 bomber program, and \nthe depot maintenance provisions.\n  But the conferees dealt in good faith on these issues, and have \noffered honest compromises that address the administration's concerns. \nIn particular, the depot maintenance provisions have been modified to \naccommodate the strongly held concerns of the administration and the \nSenators from Texas and California.\n  The resulting language is, in my view, balanced, fair, and consistent \nwith our national security interests.\n  However, in listening to yesterday's floor statements by the Senators \nfrom Texas and California, I could not help but think that they were \nlooking at some other bill, because the characterizations made about \nthe depot provisions in the conference report were grossly inaccurate.\n  Mr. President, let me make clear that I am an advocate for \ncompetition. Whether it be private sector competition among defense \nfirms, or competition between public sector and private sector \nfacilities, I believe that fair and honest competition makes sense for \nthe American taxpayers and should be pursued wherever practical and \nconsistent with our national security requirements.\n  The conference report includes a compromise on depot maintenance that \nwould require the conduct of fair and open competitions at the Kelly \nand McClellan air logistics centers. The compromise would specifically \ndefine ``depot maintenance'' to include contractor logistics support \nand interim contractor support. It also requires that the Defense \nDepartment maintain the capability in public depots to perform \nmaintenance work on certain mission essential weapons systems that the \nSecretary of Defense and Joint Chiefs deem necessary as part of our \nnational military strategy.\n  Mr. President, the language is very clear and the intent is even more \nclear. The conferees support free and open competition for depot \nmaintenance work. With all due respect to the Senators from Texas and \nCalifornia, who suggest otherwise, their assessment of this language is \nsimply not accurate.\n  The truth is, many Senators, including my friend from Oklahoma, \nSenator Inhofe, have very strong concerns on this issue. I want to \ncommend Senator Inhofe for his willingness to compromise so much on \nthis issue. He has\n\n[[Page S11818]]\n\nbeen very statesmanlike throughout these negotiations, and anyone who \nlooks at this objectively will come to the conclusion that he has \nacted in good faith and has gone the extra mile to facilitate a \nresolution on this issue.\n\n  Mr. President, as a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, I \nwas deeply troubled by some of the assertions made by the Senators from \nTexas and California during yesterday's debate. In particular, I was \ntroubled by the statement by one member to the effect that ``we do not \neven need a Defense authorization bill since we have already passed the \nDefense appropriations bill.'' With all due respect, this statement is \nflat out wrong.\n  The truth is, we need this bill to authorize pay raises and bonuses, \nmilitary end strengths, and military construction and family housing. \nIf there is no fiscal year 1998 Defense authorization:\n  Higher end strengths will remain in effect without funding to sustain \nthem;\n  There will be no reform of basic allowances for subsistence and \nquarters;\n  All bonuses will continue at present levels, which prevents \nauthorized increases to aviation and nuclear officer bonuses;\n  The Navy will lose the ability to have the CNO's choice for Chief of \nChaplains;\n  Construction of 385 military construction and 45 family housing \nprojects will not be initiated;\n  There will be no authority to continue the Challenge Program;\n  There will be no authority to expand the counternarcotics Riverine \nProgram in Peru and Colombia;\n  There will be no authority to increase counternarcotics support to \nMexico;\n  There will be no authority for the Department of Navy to reprogram \nfunding for the advanced procurement and construction of components for \nthe next nuclear aircraft carrier; and\n  There will be no authority to accelerate the NATO JSTARS Program.\n  Mr. President, as you can see, the authorization bill is urgently \nneeded for a variety of compelling reasons. While I respect the views \nof my friends from Texas and California, I must honestly say that I do \nnot believe they are being reasonable. The conferees conceded to \napproximately 80 percent of the requests made by advocates of Kelly and \nMcClellan. The House Depot Caucus and the Senators from Oklahoma, \nGeorgia, and Utah have negotiated in good faith. The result is a very \nreasonable compromise.\n  Mr. President, in an honest negotiation, no one gets everything. Both \nsides must give and take. In this case, it is very clear that the \nOklahoma, Utah, and Georgia delegations have given a great deal. In \nfact, I would say they have gone above and beyond the call of duty to \nfacilitate a fair resolution on this issue.\n  Accordingly, I would call upon my colleagues to reject any further \nattempts to stall this legislation or to prevent its enactment. The \nArmed Services Committee has worked diligently, in a bipartisan \nfashion, to formulate a very responsible and constructive defense bill. \nWe owe it to our men and women in uniform, and particularly those \ndeployed in harms way throughout the world, to pass this legislation \npromptly.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the fiscal year 1998 Defense \nauthorization conference report.\n\n\n                            depot compromise\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I would just like to take a few moments \nto address some of the issues that were raised yesterday regarding the \ncompromise depot language included in the conference report on the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998. I believe it \nis important to clarify the issue and ensure that all Members are fully \naware of the contents of the compromise language, and the negotiation \nprocess that resulted in this language which provides for fair and open \ncompetitions.\n  First of all, I would like to put to rest one very important \nallegation--that the committee demonstrated bad faith on this issue--\nthat there was some agreement that was subsequently changed in the dark \nof night. This allegation is simply not true. Given the unprecedented \ninvolvement that was afforded to the Department of Defense and the \nstaff of the concerned delegations; given the efforts that were taken \nto ensure that all interested parties, including those who were not \nconferees, were kept fully informed on what was taking place; I reject \nany assertion that the committee treated any Member unfairly, or \ndisregarded any agreement.\n  There was never an agreement on any package prior to October 22, \n1997. Proposed agreements drafted by the committee and provided to \neveryone--depot caucus, Texas and California delegations, and the \nadministration, were either rejected or there was no response. This \nincludes the proposed agreement regarding depot-level activities that \nwas provided for everyone's review and comments on October 17, 1997.\n  After talking with the interested parties, both in the administration \nand Congress, the committee put together the October 17 proposed \nagreement and submitted it for everyone to review and either accept, or \nprovide input to us regarding those changes that would make this \nproposal acceptable. After reviewing the language, Senator Bennett and \nother Members expressed concern regarding the language in the bill that \nstated:\n\n     No offeror may be given any preferential consideration for, \n     or in any way be limited to, performing the workload in-place \n     or at any other single location. Appropriate consideration \n     may be given to differences in cost or performance risk \n     associated with the location of performance.\n\n  The concern of these Members was simply with the appearance of the \nlanguage. After agreeing to give up their position that privatization-\nin-place must be prohibited, a position very important to these Members \nand their constituents, they believed that the Congress should at least \ninsist on a clear statement that the administration could not give \npreferential treatment for privatization-in-place. Therefore, they \nasked that the second sentence be moved from the bill to report \nlanguage.\n  Mr. President, just to be sure that everyone understands, this \nlanguage does not state that the Department cannot consider cost or \nrisk. In fact, the bill language still requires the Department to take \ninto account:\n\n     the total estimated direct and indirect costs that will be \n     incurred by the Department of Defense and the total estimated \n     direct and indirect savings (including overhead) that will be \n     derived by the Department of Defense.\n\n  Furthermore: the report language, which Senator Gramm himself \ndeclared has the effect of law, states:\n\n     The Department would be expected to consider real differences \n     among bidders in cost or capability to perform the work based \n     on factors that would include the proposed location or \n     locations of the workload. The consideration of such \n     differences does not constitute preferential treatment.\n\n  Unfortunately, when the committee scheduled a meeting with the staff \nof the concerned delegations to discuss this and other proposed \nchanges, the Department of Defense as well as the staff of the Texas \ndelegation refused to participate.\n  Taking what input we received from those Members who were able to \nidentify concerns, the committee made a couple of changes to the \nlanguage that we believed were reasonable. This included moving the \nbill language discussed above to report language and some changes \nrequested by the Department.\n  Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Texas that if the \nsentence that was moved is technical, is inconsequential, there is no \nreason why it had to be dropped; other than for the sake of appearance. \nHowever, since Senator Bennett and other Members wanted a clear \nstatement that preferential treatment could not be given to a bid \nsolely because the workload would be done in place, and since we could \nnot even discuss this with the other Members because their staff \nrefused to participate in meetings, the language was moved.\n  Mr. President, given the administration's past attempt to politicize \nthis process by advocating privatization-in-place, Senator Bennett's \nconcerns appear to have merit. The Congress should be on record stating \nthat the most competitive bidder should do this work wherever they can \ndo it best. That is the only way the American taxpayer, and our \nmilitary personnel, will receive the best deal.\n  Mr. President, I would now like to address the issue of the so-called \nanticompetitive language that was the\n\n[[Page S11819]]\n\npoint of discussion on the Senate floor earlier this week. The \nassertion that this language is anticompetitive could not be further \nfrom the truth. As many of you know, the original language that was \nrejected by the Senate contained an effective prohibition on such \ncompetitions. This provision is not included in this bill. In fact, \nthis bill specifically authorizes such competitions and merely includes \nsome of the criteria that must be considered in order to ensure that \nthey are fair and open.\n  Furthermore, the Department would retain complete flexibility to \nconsider any other criteria that the Department believes necessary to \nensure that these competitions are fair. In fact, this provision is \nvery similar to what Senator Gramm advocated when he addressed the \ndepot issue on the floor of the Senate earlier this year and asked for \ncompetitions with criteria.\n  One of the criteria that the Senator from Texas would like to have \nchanged because he believes it to be anticompetitive, is the clause \nthat would require the Department of Defense to allow public depots and \nprivate corporations to form teams to compete for the workloads at \nKelly and McClellan. I am not sure why this clause, which opens the \ncompetition to more potential bidders, would be viewed as \nanticompetitive. I see no reason why we should preclude the best team, \nwhether public, private, or public/private, from competing to perform \nthis work and doing it if they have the best proposal. In fact, at a \nrecent hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Mr. F. \nWhitten Peters, the Principle Deputy General Counsel for the Department \nof Defense and nominee to be the next Undersecretary of the Air Force, \nstated that he also did not believe such language to be \nanticompetitive. If someone truly believes that allowing an \norganization to compete is anticompetitive, they should explain their \nposition to the Congress and the American people.\n  Mr. President, the compromise language also amends the current 60/40 \nlaw so that the Department might outsource up to 50 percent of its \ndepot maintenance workload. This will provide substantially more \nflexibility to the Army and the Navy, and some additional flexibility \nfor the Air Force despite the fact that the compromise would also \ncodify the definition of depot maintenance to include interim \ncontractor support and contractor logistics support.\n  Furthermore, the depot compromise codifies the Department's own \npolicy of maintaining, within organic Defense depots, the capability to \nmeet readiness and sustainability requirements of the weapon systems \nthat support the JCS contingency scenarios. This does not require that \nthe Department perform depot maintenance on all mission essential \nweapon systems in public depots. It simply requires that the Department \nretain a capability to maintain this equipment should it become \nnecessary.\n  The Senator from Texas has expressed some concern regarding the use \nof the word ``ensure'' rather than ``promote'' in this provision. He \nstated that this was a major concern for the Department of Defense \nbecause someone might interpret it in such a way that it would require \nthe Department of Defense to perform all depot maintenance in public \ndepots. All I can say is that it would take an extremely creative \nimagination to give that interpretation to this language. Both \n``promote'' and ``ensure'' are subjective terms that will be \ninterpreted by the Secretary of Defense. He is not going to interpret \n``ensure'' in the manner feared by Senator Gramm when it is clearly \ncontrary to the intent of the Congress. in fact, when the committee \nasked the Department to provide in writing any concerns they had \nregarding this language, the Department did not express any concern \nregarding the word ``ensure'' or suggest changing the word ``ensure'' \nto ``promote.''\n\n  Mr. President, the Senators from Texas and California have asserted \nthat the depot compromise contained in this bill ``undercuts the \nability of the Secretary of Defense to conduct price competition so \nthat we can have bidding on this work.'' However, the compromise \nlanguage specifically requires the consideration of all costs and \nsavings, and would ensure price competition. Most of the Members \ninvolved in this issue have always insisted on price competitions as \nopposed to schemes which would allow more subjective judgment.\n  It is also asserted that this language skews the competitions in \nfavor of public depots because it allows them to hide their overhead \ncosts. There is no clause in the depot compromise that allows the \npublic depots to hide overhead costs. The compromise specifically \nrequires that all costs and savings must be taken into account when \nconsidering any bid.\n  Concern has been raised that this language would require the \nDepartment to procure expensive and unnecessary equipment in order to \nbe able to maintain commercial systems that have been integrated into \nmilitary equipment. This is false. in fact, the provision requiring the \nretention of a core capability specifically provides an exemption for \ncommercial items.\n  Finally, concern has been raised because there was bill language \nwhich the Department did not like that was moved to report language. I \nbelieve that this must refer to the report language that simply notes \nthat the Department of Defense has denied the General Accounting Office \naccess to information that the General Accounting Office is entitled to \nobtain by law. I could understand why this would be objectionable if \nthis were not true. Unfortunately, the Department is refusing to \ndisclose information on the earlier C-5 workload competition so that we \ncan be sure that it was fairly conducted. Perhaps the conferees would \nnot have agreed to include such language if the Department would allow \nthe General Accounting Office access to the information necessary to \nperform the review requested by the committee.\n  Mr. President, this bill contains a fair compromise that was drafted \nby the members of the Senate Armed Services Committee after consulting \nwith all interested parties; including the administration and the \nconcerned delegations. It is fair to assert that none of the parties \ninvolved are completely happy with this compromise language, however, \nthat is what happens when you have to compromise. If we all insisted on \ngetting everything our way, nothing would ever be accomplished by the \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, Senator Levin, the ranking member of our committee, \nand I worked together in a totally bipartisan manner to achieve this \ncompromise and we both agree that this compromise enables the \nDepartment of Defense to conduct fair and open competitions for the \nworkloads currently performed at Kelly and McClellan. During the \ndrafting of this compromise language the Department of Defense, as well \nas the staff of the concerned delegations, were provided numerous \nopportunities to review this language and identify their concerns. We \nmade significant changes to this language in order to alleviate many of \nthe concerns they raised.\n  Mr. President, as I previously stated, this is a good compromise; a \nfair compromise. It allows all parties to compete for these workloads \nin a fair and open manner. I ask the other Members of the Senate to \nsupport this compromise, and this bill, by voting in favor of final \npassage.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I intend to oppose H.R. 1119, the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill for fiscal year 1998, and \nwould like to take a few moments to explain my disagreement with this \nauthorization bill.\n  Mr. President, there are a multitude of reasons for opposing this \nlegislation. First and foremost is the $268.2 billion in overall \nfunding this bill provides for our Armed Forces, an amount that is not \nonly substantially higher than the amount we authorized last year, but \n$2.6 billion more than the Pentagon itself has requested.\n  Additionally, this legislation continues the funding of a host of \nhighly questionable and outright unaffordable programs. For example, \nthe bill includes $331 million--$157 million more than the Pentagon \nrequested--for the B-2 bomber, a program that scores of budgetary and \nmilitary experts, not to mention numerous Members of Congress on both \nsides of the aisle, have concluded does not serve our national security \ninterests and does not merit any additional funds.\n  The legislation includes $2.4 billion for 20 new F/A-18 E/F \nSuperHornet tactical fighters for the Navy. My colleagues may recall \nthat the General Accounting Office and other experts\n\n[[Page S11820]]\n\nhave made repeated, convincing recommendations that we shelve this \nprogram in favor of the more affordable F/A-18 C/D, the Navy's current \ntop-of-the-line tactical fighter capable of providing nearly all of the \nbenefits of the E/F version but at a savings of billions of dollars to \nthe taxpayer.\n  These are just two examples, Mr. President, of billions of dollars \nthat are being needlessly spent in this bill for programs that have \nencountered enormous criticism and steadfast opposition from across the \npolitical spectrum. Despite these questions and opposition, the gravy \ntrain continues to chug along unabated from the Congress to the \nPentagon.\n  For many years Congress has failed to sufficiently control the flow \nof deficit dollars to the Defense Department, clinging to a conviction \nthat having a less expensive military structure will consequently leave \nus with a less effective military structure. That is an absurd \ncorrelation, Mr. President. There is no question that if we invest our \ndefense dollars wisely we can have a leaner military without \ncompromising either efficiency or effectiveness.\n  Since I arrived in the U.S. Senate almost five years ago, my driving \nobjective has been to reduce the Federal deficit and achieve a balanced \nbudget. We have had enormous success in that regard, passing hallmark \nlegislation in 1993 that drove down the deficit to a point where we \ncould pass further legislation in 1997 that will finally allow us to \nreach a balanced Federal budget in a few short years.\n  A large part of that success has been due to the willingness of both \nthe Congress and the President to do more with less, to trim excessive \nspending wherever possible and maintain important services but with \nfewer resources. We have succeeded almost everywhere in government--\neducation, health care, veterans' care, welfare benefits, environmental \nprograms--everywhere except defense spending where we continue to build \ndestroyers the Navy does not ask for and continue to build bombers the \nAir Force does not want.\n  Balancing the budget is about making difficult choices, Mr. \nPresident. Sure the Navy would like to have the F/A-18 E/F fighter, and \nif we were in a radically different budgetary position I might support \ngiving them 200 of those airplanes instead of the 20 they are receiving \nin this legislation. But can we afford 20 of these new tactical \nfighters, when a more affordable and equally effective alternative \naircraft is readily available? How that question is answered, Mr. \nPresident, is the difference between fiscal excess and fiscal \nresponsibility.\n  We have to make smart choices Mr. President. A balanced Federal \nbudget is in sight for the first time in three decades. But we are not \ngoing to be able to maintain a balanced budget, let alone start \nbringing down the Federal debt, so long as we continue to commit to \nprograms and force structures that are so blatantly unaffordable.\n  In this context, I would like to discuss the role of the National \nGuard in our force structure and how the Guard will be affected by this \nconference report.\n  Mr. President, the National Guard is a source of immense pride in my \nState of Wisconsin. As I travel across the State, I often have the \nprivilege of meeting the men and women who compose the Wisconsin Guard \nand have been impressed with the tremendous degree of professionalism \nand proficiency with which they complete a wide range of missions.\n  These are well-trained, dedicated, professional soldiers who earn \nrave reviews from the Governor's office down to the villages and \nmunicipalities who are often the principal beneficiaries of the Guard's \nassistance.\n  The mission list of the Wisconsin Guard is impressive: Just last \nspring, the 115th Fighter Wing based in Madison and comprised of \nFighting Falcon F-16's, participated in Operation Northern Watch, \nenforcing the no-fly zone the United Nations imposed over northern \nIraq. In addition, 181 Wisconsinites attached to the 128th Air \nRefueling Wing stationed at Mitchell Field in Milwaukee recently \nreturned from Turkey where they too participated in Operation Northern \nWatch, providing air refueling support to the fighters enforcing the \nno-fly zone.\n  As much as some perceive the Guard as mere weekend warriors, we must \nremember that these individuals are performing missions both \ndomestically and abroad that pose as great a risk to their lives as any \nactive duty personnel.\n  But what makes the National Guard so unique is the traditional role \nthey have played in our democratic system dating back to our Nation's \ninfancy. In Wisconsin, we can trace the history of the Guard to 1837, \nwhen Governor Henry Dodge appointed a new commander of the Green Bay \nRangers Volunteer Company, enlisting the men of that unit to serve the \nTerritory of Wisconsin.\n  Today, over 10,000 men and women serve in the Wisconsin Guard, \ngenerating more than $125 million in annual Federal income. The \nWisconsin Army National Guard has 96 units located in 67 communities \nthroughout the State, while the Air Guard has four units in Madison, \nMilwaukee, and Volk Field.\n  The National Guard has traditionally served both a Federal and a \nState mission, providing ready, trained units to the active Army and \nAir Force in time of war or national emergency, and assisting State \nauthorities in protecting life and property and preserving peace, \norder, and public safety.\n  Unfortunately, the legislation before us includes provisions that are \ntroubling to those who support a meaningful role for the National Guard \nin our Nation's defense. These provisions were recently brought to my \nattention by Maj. Gen. James G. Blaney, adjutant general of the \nWisconsin National Guard, who raised concerns not only about the impact \nthese changes would have on the readiness of the Guard, but also about \nhow such changes undermine the traditional and constitutional roles the \nGuard has always been intended to fill.\n  First, the legislation includes a reduction in the Army National \nGuard's end strength by 5,000 troop slots. This reduction reflects a \ncompromise agreement that was reached with the active Army, which also \nagreed to reduce its end strength by 5,000 soldiers in the upcoming \nfiscal year. However, though this legislation includes the reduction \nfor the National Guard, it does not include the reduction for the \nactive army--a reduction that was also recommended by the Quadrennial \nDefense Review.\n  Second, the legislation before us establishes a new mobilization \ncategory that would allow the President, under the Presidential \nSelective Reserve Call-Up Authority, to mobilize up to 30,000 \nIndividual Ready Reserve [IRR] troops before mobilizing the National \nGuard for contingency operations. Mr. President, the IRR is composed of \ninactive military members who are awaiting their final discharge. \nAlthough current law permits the President to call on these troops only \nafter he has called on the Guard, the DOD Authorization Conference \nReport would elevate this new category of IRR forces to a higher \nposition than that of the Guard.\n  That is a senseless exercise, Mr. President. The members of the \nNational Guard are continually training for such deployments, and yet \nthis legislation proposes to call up 30,000 inactive, nontraining \ntroops before the Guard is mobilized.\n  It is little wonder that the National Guard perceives these changes \nas a direct assault on the traditional role of the Guard in our Armed \nForces. But what is even more troubling is how contrary these proposed \nchanges are to the constitutional role that the Guard and the State \nmilitias are designed to fulfill.\n  Article I, section 8 of the U.S. Constitution provides Congress with \nthe power to ``raise and support armies, but no appropriation of money \nto that use shall be for a longer term than two years''.\n  I find that extraordinary, Mr. President. Why did the Founding \nFathers prohibit Congress from appropriating funds for a standing army \nbeyond 2 years? Not surprisingly, Americans of the late 18th century \nwere highly suspicious of standing armies. They had witnessed firsthand \nthe power and intrusiveness of such an army and how it could be used by \na monarch or a central government to suppress the rights and \nsovereignties of the people.\n  The Framers of the Constitution wisely decided that if there was \ngoing to be a standing army in a free democracy, it would only be \nthrough the ongoing approval and purse strings of the representative \nbranch of government.\n\n[[Page S11821]]\n\n  Article I, section 8 continues, granting Congress the power:\n\n       To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the \n     Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions \n     [and] provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the \n     Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be \n     employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to \n     the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and \n     the Authority of training the Militia according to the \n     discipline prescribed by Congress.\n\n  In short, Mr. President, the Framers not only held a standing army \nsuspect, they recognized the importance of defining a role for a \ncitizen militia to be maintained, led and trained not by the central \ngovernment, but by the States. Interestingly, although the Constitution \nmakes no mention of what capacity a standing army is designed to serve, \nit does specifically hold the militias responsible for executing our \nlaws, suppressing insurrections, and repelling foreign invasions.\n  This leaves little doubt that the Founding Fathers were substantially \nmore trusting of the State militias, and were far more willing to \nassign responsibilities for the defense of the Nation to these militias \nthan they were any standing army.\n  Of course, Article I of the Constitution is not the only component of \nthe Constitution that is relevant to today's National Guard. The second \namendment to the Constitution provides:\n\n       A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security \n     of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear \n     Arms, shall not be infringed.\n\n  Whatever advocates and opponents of gun control construe these words \nto mean in 1997, the aim of the first part of the second amendment is \nevident: Our Founders were making a penetrating statement that a strong \nmilitia was imperative to the security of a free State.\n  What the Framers of the Constitution recognized over 200 years ago \nwith respect to the vital importance of the militias remains true \ntoday. That is certainly not to suggest that there is no purpose or \nmerit in maintaining a standing army. On the contrary, we have learned \nin this century that a free and democratic society cannot sustain \nitself without self-protection, and Republicans and Democrats alike can \nagree that we should have--and do have--the strongest and best-trained \nactive duty force structure in the world.\n  But to simultaneously and needlessly diminish the strength and role \nof the National Guard is, I believe, to tarnish many of the \nunderpinnings of our great democracy.\n  Today's men and women of the National Guard represent what our \nFounders envisioned in terms of a citizen militia. Members of the Guard \nare sprinkled throughout our communities. They are teachers, \nfirefighters, doctors, nurses, business owners, police officers, \nfarmers, and yes, even Members of Congress.\n  And just like our active duty personnel, the men and women of the \nNational Guard can be called upon on a moment's notice to be placed in \nharm's way. From the Civil War to the Persian Gulf, the State militias \nand the National Guard have consistently played a central role in \nprotecting our Nation's security, both at home and abroad.\n  But the Guard does much more as well. They participate in youth \nprograms, such as the highly successful, low-cost Badger Challenge \nprogram in Wisconsin where the Guard takes at-risk kids and helps them \nobtain their GED's while teaching them discipline and respect for \nthemselves and others.\n  The Guard supports medical outreach programs. They are involved in \ncounterdrug efforts, working with the Department of Justice and local \nlaw enforcement agencies through aerial observations, ground \nsurveillance, and cargo inspections.\n  All of this is accomplished, Mr. President, in a highly cost-\neffective manner. A comparison of the costs of active duty personnel \nand Guard personnel demonstrates the sharp differences in costs. \nAccording to one study, on average, it costs $73,000 per year to train \nand equip an active duty soldier. The cost of training and equipping \none National Guard soldier--$17,000, almost one-fifth the cost.\n  Projected on a larger scale, an estimate recently prepared for the \nNational Defense Panel found that the Government could save roughly $1 \nbillion per year for every active division whose responsibilities it \nshifts to the eight divisions of the National Guard. Another analysis \nfinds that a Guard unit can cost anywhere from 25 to 80 percent less to \nmaintain than an active duty unit.\n  In other words, Mr. President, with little sizable military threat to \nthe United States today, we can shift many of the warfighting \nresponsibilities--not to mention responsibilities for peacekeeping and \nhumanitarian operations--from the active forces to the National Guard \nat a substantial savings to the taxpayer while losing little in skills, \nreadiness, and training.\n  There are a host of missions today that the National Guard can \nfulfill and should fulfill, providing a less expensive but highly \neffective complement to our active forces.\n  As we reassess what our strategic blueprint for our future Armed \nForces should look like, and as we begin the process of conducting a \ncomprehensive review of our inventories and projected needs, it is my \nhope that the there will be renewed focus on the advantages of a \nproperly funded, well-maintained National Guard.\n  Such a focus presents us an opportunity not only to ensure that we \nhave a highly efficient and cost-effective military, but that we are \nalso adhering to some of the most fundamental constitutional principles \nestablished by our Founding Fathers.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to commend Senator Thurmond, Senator \nLevin, and the others on the Armed Services Committee for their efforts \nin bringing this conference report to the floor. This important \nconference report has not easily reached this point, and the fact that \nwe are about to vote on it is a tribute to the bipartisanship and \nforbearance of the Committee members.\n  This conference report will be good for our fighting forces and good \nfor the Nation. Most important perhaps is the well-deserved 2.8 percent \npay raise for our military personnel. Moreover, this conference report \nwill provide the badly needed pay bonuses to help encourage highly \ntrained personnel to continue their military service beyond their \ninitial commitments.\n  With passage of this conference report into law, this Nation will \nalso fully fund the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program--the most \ncost-effective means of preventing nuclear proliferation. I can think \nof no better method to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction \nthan to assist Russia in dismantling its nuclear arsenal.\n  This conference report includes an amendment that I authored to \nassist those suffering from Persian Gulf war illnesses. Next year, I \nlook forward to a combined Defense Department-Veterans Administration \nplan to provide health care to our sick veterans. Also, I expect to see \na full report from the Defense Department on the effectiveness of \nresearch efforts to date. Finally, because there has not yet been a \nprogram to determine which treatments are most effective in caring for \nthose suffering from Persian Gulf war illnesses, this amendment \nauthorizes $4.5 million to begin a clinical trials program with that \ndetermination as its goal.\n  As for procurement, I give this conference report high marks. It \nsupports the agreement between our Nation's two submarine builders to \nwork together in building the New Attack Submarine; it provides \nappropriate relief from the Seawolf cost cap; it completes the funding \nauthorization for the third and final Seawolf-class submarine; and it \nfully funds the New Attack Submarine Program. For those who think that \nthis Nation is doing too much submarine building, let me urge them not \nto look at any 1 year in particular, but to look at the submarine \nprogram as a whole. The U.S. Navy, which had once built two, three, or \nfour attack submarines a year to maintain a fleet of well over 100, now \nplans to build just four over the next 6 years. The United States has \nnever built nuclear attack submarines at a lower rate.\n  This conference report also authorizes 30 H-60 helicopters. The Army, \nNavy, Air Force, Coast Guard, and National Guard all use these \nhelicopters, not to mention several countries throughout the world. In \nnatural disasters and military operations alike, H-60 helicopters are \non the front line. One\n\n[[Page S11822]]\n\nneed only ask the Adjutant General of virtually any State in the Union \nto gain an appreciation of how vitally important these helicopters are. \nI hope that future defense bills will continue to provide this Nation's \nservicemembers with the capable H-60 helicopters that they need and \nwant.\n  Let me conclude by mentioning that I do not know whether this \nconference report will be vetoed. I think, on balance, that the good in \nthis report clearly outweighs the bad, and I would urge the President \nto quickly make it law rather than prolonging the battles that have \nplagued conference report for months.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ndivision of time on the pending conference report be as follows: \nSenator Thurmond in control of 20 minutes, Senator Levin in control of \n20 minutes, Senator Gramm and Hutchison in control of 45 minutes, \nSenator Feinstein and Boxer in control of 45 minutes, and finally \nSenator Stevens be recognized to speak up to 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask I be notified after 22 minutes \nbecause that is the time I will control. My senior colleague, Senator \nGramm, will have the other 23 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I want to say that I am one of the most prodefense \npeople in this body and I think most of this bill is very good and very \nimportant. I am going to speak on the part of the bill that I think is \nvery shortsighted and will, in fact, hurt our readiness in the future \nif it is not fixed. I will continue to urge the committee to work to \nfix it because I do believe that all of us want a stronger national \ndefense and we want the taxpayer dollars to be spent wisely. In fact, \npassing this bill will waste billions of taxpayer dollars, and those \naren't my figures. Those are the figures of the experts.\n  So why would we do that? Let me first say that the points that were \nmade by Senator Kempthorne and Senator Cleland can be met. I agree with \nthem. It is most important that the pay and compensation issues, the \nhealth care issues, the military construction issues be addressed. In \nfact, a clean bill has been introduced that would cover those items, \nthat if this bill is vetoed by the President--which I hope it will be, \nso it can be corrected--we can take care of those very important \ncompensation, health and military construction issues, and that bill \nhas been introduced.\n  This can be worked out. It can be worked out for the good of \neveryone, for the good of the Department of Defense, for our men and \nwomen in the military and for the taxpayers of our country.\n  I want to read from the Base Closing Commission recommendation. The \nBase Closing Commission recommended the closing of both Kelly Air Force \nBase and McClellan Air Force Base, but it did reserve the right of the \nDepartment of Defense to make the decision about where the work would \nbe done and how it would be done. It says that ``the workload would be \nmoved to other depots, or to private sector commercial activities, as \ndetermined by the Department of Defense.''\n  Now, what we are doing in the bill, if it is passed today, is taking \nthat flexibility away from the Department of Defense. What we are \nsaying is, you cannot have a level playing field, you cannot have real \ncompetition for the most cost savings and for the readiness issues in \nthe maintenance of our equipment. This is a crucial issue, and it is \nnot an issue that is just for McClellan Air Force Base or Kelly Air \nForce Base or California or Texas. This is an issue about how we are \ngoing to conserve the dollars that we spend on defense so that they can \nbe spent for our troops, for the quality of life, and for the readiness \nthat we must have to face the security threats to this country.\n  The savings are absolutely--it has been proven--achievable, and it \nhas been shown already by the most recent competition, the one that \ntook place on the C-5, which saved $190 million on the cost of doing \nthe maintenance of the C-5. This was won by a public depot against the \nprivate sector bidders that I had hoped would win. Nevertheless, I \ndidn't win, but the taxpayers did, and the Department of Defense will \nsave $190 million because we had the competition.\n  In fact, private-sector companies that outsource frequently achieve \ncost savings of 20 to 30 percent. That is proven. If the Department of \nDefense could achieve similar savings by outsourcing $15 billion in \nannual depot maintenance, that would free up $2 billion a year for \nother purposes--$2 billion a year. Just think of it. Our operations in \nBosnia cost us $3 billion a year. Most of that could be achieved with \nsavings from efficiencies gotten with competition in the depots. That \nwas proven within the last 2 months in the C-5 competition that was won \nby Warner-Robins. It was only because there was competition that these \nefficiencies were made. Otherwise, it would have been business as \nusual. Everything would have been done the same way. In fact, we would \nhave paid $190 million more to do this work.\n  One corporation, with much experience in commercial aircraft \nmaintenance, has already looked at the engine maintenance work at \nKelly. They have concluded that, by employing commercial-sector \nbusiness practices, they can reduce the cost by over $1 billion over \nthe life of the contract. They can reduce the amount of time necessary \nto repair engines by as much as 40 percent. So that is a readiness \nissue. And they can improve safety of flights through their process \nmodifications. We all know that safety is of paramount importance when \nwe are talking about our young men and women flying in the aircraft \nprovided to them by the Department of Defense. So why wouldn't we bring \nthis kind of expertise and savings into our military maintenance? I \ndon't understand it.\n  Look at the people who have spoken on this issue. Adm. William Owens, \nthe Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, when he was going out of office, \nin testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee said:\n\n       The world's largest business is 65 to 70 percent fixed \n     cost, 35 percent variable cost. The variable cost translates \n     to the war-fighting capability. The money is in the fixed \n     costs, and that is what we've got to work on. We must work on \n     the fixed costs, like maintenance.\n\n  Dr. John White, Deputy Secretary of Defense, March 1996:\n\n       Privatization provides substantial savings. Now as we go \n     forward, we have a situation where we have to emphasize \n     modernization.\n\n  General Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, 1996:\n\n       I believe we must go on with privatization, with \n     outsourcing. We need your support to make the hard choices \n     and to change it to make these initiatives work. I \n     particularly ask for your support where changes in law are \n     required.\n\n  I don't think the general would want to have constraints on \ncompetition and privatization as we are seeing in the bill before us \ntoday.\n  William Cohen, the present Secretary of Defense, June 18, 1997:\n\n       The San Antonio and Sacramento workload involve thousands \n     of highly trained workers and large, expensive equipment and \n     facilities. This work is critical to the continued operation \n     of national assets. To transfer all of these workloads \n     without a competitive evaluation and risk assessment would be \n     unwise, from a business perspective, and would involve a \n     significant risk of disruption in mission performance and \n     degradation in military readiness.\n\n  Now, these are the people in charge of our military. They are talking \nabout the importance of privatization, the option of privatization. \nThey are saying, look, we are willing to live with fewer dollars and \nprovide the security that we are supposed to provide to the people of \nAmerica. But don't tie our hands. Let us have the option, let us have \nthe ability to do this job with the options and flexibility we must \nhave to put the dollars where we need them. And we are seeing the \ncapability of saving $2 billion a year if we will allow full \ncompetition.\n\n  What is Congress doing in the bill that is before us today? It is \ntying the hands of the people who are asking for our help in order to \ndo the job we are asking them to do in the most efficient way.\n  Mr. President, why would we do this? I can't understand it. We have \nheard quotes from the people on the military side. Now let me quote \nfrom a letter received today from the Industry Depot Coalition. These \nare the people who do the work. These are the people who have been in \nthis business, who know what the cost savings can be, who provide the \n20 to 30 percent cost savings\n\n[[Page S11823]]\n\nwhen they do the work. They have written a letter to Senator Thurmond \nand Senator Levin. It says:\n\n       The Industry Depot Coalition, comprised of eight national \n     associations representing the breadth of the defense industry \n     and thousands of American businesses, large and small, wishes \n     to register, for the record, our concerns relative to the \n     depot maintenance provisions that are contained in the FY98 \n     national defense authorization bill. In so doing, we wish to \n     raise with you a number of impacts we foresee resulting from \n     the provisions, as well as our sincere hope that you will \n     give serious consideration to making modifications in that \n     language.\n\n  They state as a primary concern:\n\n       The legislation requires that the Secretary of Defense \n     assign sufficient workload to public depots to ensure cost \n     efficiency. However, the arbitrary assignment of workloads \n     will not ensure efficiency. Efficiency can only be ensured \n     through competition, innovative management initiatives, and \n     the adaptation of commercial practices, none of which is \n     adequately addressed in this legislation.\n       In addition, we are concerned that the legislation's \n     requirement that DOD have in-house capability to repair all \n     new systems within four years of initial operating capability \n     could result in DOD having to create and maintain redundant \n     facilities and capabilities, even when doing so is neither \n     cost-effective nor, in the judgment of the Department, \n     necessary for the national defense.\n\n  A second area of primary concern:\n\n       The legislation places in statute competitive requirements \n     that are at this time only to be applied to the proposed \n     competition for the workloads at the Kelly and McClellan Air \n     Logistic Centers. As believers in fair competition and equal \n     treatment in all areas of competition, we simply cannot \n     support a statutory requirement such as this one that places \n     unique requirements on one category of bidders.\n\n  Mr. President, we have heard from the industry, we have heard from \nthe Department, we have heard from the military chiefs--they need the \nflexibility. They need the ability to be able to do the work in the \nmost efficient way, and that is what we are trying to provide them.\n  The bill before us today does not allow that competition. It does not \nallow a free and fair competition; it weights toward the public depots \nto such a great extent that even one of the greatest proponents of this \nlanguage admits exactly what they want to do, and that is keep private \nbidders from bidding.\n  I will just quote from the Daily Oklahoman, where the junior Senator \nfrom Oklahoma says:\n\n       With the language in the bill before us, I think it is \n     highly unlikely any contractor would want to bid on it.\n\n  So they are trying to stifle competition, and I don't understand why \nthe committee is letting them do this. I do not, in any way, challenge \nthe motives of the committee. I know they want to do what is right. But \nI think they have not looked at the quote of the Senator from Oklahoma, \nwho admits he is trying to put language in so that no one will bid. \nThey are overlooking the Defense Industry Depot Coalition, who have \ndone the work and know that they can do it more efficiently. They are \noverlooking the fact that, where private industry is doing maintenance, \nit has worked very well for the Department of Defense. One of the best \nexamples of this was in Desert Storm, where we had much private \nmaintenance that kept right up to the readiness requirements of the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  Mr. President, all the evidence is against what is in this bill \ntoday; yet, everyone who is arguing for this bill seems to say that \nthis is just one little issue; it is just one little issue that can \nsave $2 billion a year--$2 billion a year. We could start deploying \ntheater missile defense. We could pay for most of our operation in \nBosnia with these savings. Why won't the committee work with us to make \nsure that it is not just the one narrow interest of people who do not \nwant competition who are winning? That is why the President has said he \nis going to veto this bill. He has told the Members of Congress he is \ngoing to veto this bill, and he is right because he knows that, as he \nhimself is trying to lower the defense costs to our country, he has to \nhave the flexibility to do his job. He can't afford to let $2 billion \nlay on the table in inefficient operations because a few people don't \nwant competition. The President has said he is going to veto the bill \nbecause he knows that it is wrong to stifle competition and waste \ntaxpayer dollars when we need to provide for the readiness of our \ncountry.\n  We are not talking about one State or one depot. We are talking about \nthe readiness of our troops, and the quality of life for our troops. We \nare talking about doing a job with fewer dollars from our taxpayers but \nfulfilling our responsibility for the security of our country.\n  How could we pass a bill that we know is going to waste $2 billion a \nyear, according to the Department of Defense statistics? How could we \ndo it?\n  I urge the committee to work on this language and make it fair. I \nurge my colleagues to listen to the debate because, if you vote on the \nmerits, we can fix this bill, and we can provide for competition. We \nare not asking for favors. We are not asking for anything more than a \nfair and level playing field. In fact, in my conversations with the \nSecretary of Defense and the Deputy Secretary of Defense, I said, ``If \nyou can answer one question for me, I will be for this bill because I \nlike most of what is in it.'' Answer one question. ``Can you have a \nfair and open competition with the bill language as it is before the \nSenate today?'' And the answer was ``no.'' The answer was no from the \nDeputy Secretary of Defense. That is the only question that matters.\n  So when you hear people glossing over this issue as if it is some \nsmall thing, as if it is some parochial, minor issue, $2 billion of \ntaxpayer money, $2 billion of readiness, $2 billion of quality of life \nfor our troops, and $2 billion toward systems that will protect the \nsecurity of our country, it is not parochial.\n  I urge my colleagues to get engaged on this issue and do what is \nright. We still have time to pass a good armed services authorization \nbill that provides for health care, quality of life, pay raises, \nmilitary construction, and free and fair competition for savings, for \ngood jobs, for people who win on the merits--not through a fix. And the \nfix is in the bill.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I would like to ask that any balance of my time be given to Senator \nGramm.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record the letter from the Industry Depot Coalition.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         The Industry Depot Coalition: Aerospace Industries Assn., \n           American Electronics Assn., American Shipbuilding \n           Assn., Contract Services Assn., Electronic Industries \n           Assn., National Defense Industrial Assn., Professional \n           Services Council, Shipbuilders Council of America,\n                                                 November 5, 1997.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Committee on Armed Services,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Thurmond and Senator Levin: The Industry Depot \n     Coalition, comprised of eight national associations \n     representing the breadth of the defense industry and \n     literally thousands of American businesses large and small, \n     wishes to register for the record our concerns relative to \n     the depot maintenance provisions that are contained in the \n     FY'98 National Defense Authorization. In so doing, we wish to \n     raise with your a number of impacts we foresee resulting from \n     the provisions, as well as our sincere hope that you will \n     give serious consideration to making modifications to that \n     language.\n       We certainly respect and appreciate the considerable and \n     extensive efforts to which your and your staffs have gone in \n     attempting to fashion compromise legislation that would \n     ensure a ``level playing field'' for depot maintenance \n     competitions. Unfortunately, from the perspective of private \n     sector entities that might be inclined to participate in such \n     competitions, we do not believe the legislation, as it now \n     stands, achieves that goal. In addition, it would establish \n     in statute a number of problematic precedents that we believe \n     could lead to additional problems on future depot, and non-\n     depot, competitions. Finally, at a time when we have been \n     seeking real clarity and consistency in the conduct of \n     public-private competitions, which, to date, have been marked \n     by anything but, the ambiguities contained in the legislation \n     threaten to only increase the degree of confusion and \n     uncertainty in the process.\n       Our primary concerns are as follows:\n       (1) The legislation requires that the Secretary of Defense \n     assign ``sufficient workload'' to public depots to ``. . . \n     ensure cost efficiency''. However, the arbitrary assignment \n     of workloads will not ``ensure'' efficiency; efficiency can \n     only be ensured\n\n[[Page S11824]]\n\n     through competition, innovative management initiatives, and \n     the adaptation of commercial practices, none of which is \n     adequately addressed in the legislation. In addition, we are \n     concerned that the legislation's requirement that DoD have \n     in-house capability to repair all new systems within four \n     years of Initial Operating Capability (IOC) could result in \n     DoD having to create and maintain redundant facilities and \n     capabilities, even when doing so is neither cost-effective \n     nor, in the judgement of the department, necessary for the \n     national defense.\n       (2) The legislation places in statute competitive \n     requirements that are, at this time, only to be applied to \n     the proposed competitions for the workloads at the Kelly and \n     McClellan Air Logistics Centers. As believers in fair \n     competition and equal treatment in all areas of competition, \n     we simply cannot support a statutory requirement such as this \n     one that places unique requirements on only one category of \n     bidders. If the object is to ensure fair competition, the \n     statute should reflect that philosophy clearly, unambiguously \n     and uniformly.\n       (3) The provisions do not adequately address the vital \n     issue of ``best value'' procurements versus cost-based \n     awards. We have, with your strong support and leadership, \n     worked hard in recent years to move the procurement process \n     into an environment where the guiding principle for awards is \n     the best overall value to the taxpayer, including the full \n     range of non-cost factors, so as to ensure quality, \n     performance and true efficiency. We believe affirmative steps \n     should be taken to ensure that the ``best value'' to the \n     taxpayer and the department becomes the dominant focus of all \n     competitions.\n       (4) While the provisions do include a very important change \n     in which the current ``60/40'' rule is replaced by a new \n     ``50/50'' rule, continuing to base the rule on personnel, \n     rather than on facilities, renders much of the positive \n     language on partnerships and Centers for Technical \n     Excellence, moot. From an objective business case analysis \n     perspective, the continued focus on ``who'' does the work \n     rather than where the work is done, will mitigate against the \n     initiation of the kinds of partnerships that can genuinely \n     assist DoD in meeting its mission requirements, more \n     effectively and efficiently utilizing its current capacity \n     and adapting innovative commercial practices to its \n     operations.\n       As noted earlier, we recognize the appreciate the efforts \n     you have made to move the House conferees this far and are \n     mindful of the difficulties and challenges posed by this \n     issue. Nonetheless, we urge you to reconsider the substance \n     and ramifications of the provisions and hope that efforts \n     will be made to make appropriate changes. We have a long \n     history of working together effectively to not only ensure \n     the national defense but also to reform, streamline and make \n     fairer a procurement process that has not, historically, \n     functioned as any of us believe it should. As proposed, this \n     legislation could result in a step backward in that critical \n     area.\n       We look forward to continuing to work with you to fashion a \n     more level playing field for future competitions so as to \n     provide the true best value for the government and the \n     taxpayer. Should you have any questions or comments, please \n     contact any of the associations listed above or the coalition \n     chairman Stan Soloway at (202) 347-0600. In the meantime, our \n     thanks for your time and consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                     The Industry Depot Coalition.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the able Senator \nfrom Virginia, Senator Warner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee. I wish to join other members of committee in indicating to \nour distinguished chairman and to the ranking member, Mr. Levin of \nMichigan, our commendation for their work over these many months on \nthis bill.\n  Mr. President, in the limited time I have I wish to turn immediately \nto the subject of the welfare of the men and women of the Armed Forces.\n  This past few weeks we have seen a good deal of tension increase in \nvarious parts of the world. In fact, that tension prompted the \nPresident of the United States to convene a very important meeting. The \nPresiding Officer was in attendance, as was the chairman and ranking \nmember of the committee, myself and others, at which time the President \nin consultation with the Congress, the leadership, reviewed the various \nproblems facing the United States and our allies today--and the \npossibility that we may once again call on the men and women of the \nArmed Forces of the United States, together with our allies, to go into \nharm's way in an effort to stabilize these situations.\n  Mr. President, I say that we cannot as a Congress--as a Nation--say \nto these men and women, ``You once again will respond to the Commander \nin Chief'' and not pass this bill, which gives them a very modest and \nwell-earned increase in their pay and allowances to compensate them for \ninflation--particularly in specialized areas of service: Aviation, \nsubmariners, and others where we have to have additional compensation \nin order to enable them to perform their services, and we retain \nsufficient numbers of aviators and submariners.\n  So, Mr. President, I deem this bill absolutely critical. I also wish \nto commend the chairman and ranking member and other Members who have \nindividually, as have I, petitioned the President to give this bill the \nmost serious consideration and hopefully to affix his signature so that \nit can become law.\n  Mr. President, to go into those areas, which as chairman of the \nSeapower Subcommittee, I have special responsibility, together with the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts, [Mr. Kennedy], who is \nmy ranking member, and our subcommittee recommended to the full \ncommittee the following, and the full committee basically adopted it.\n  We authorized the Secretary of the Navy to enter into a contract for \nthe procurement of four new attack submarines under the terms of a \nteaming arrangement that was submitted to Congress by the Secretary of \nthe Navy between the two contractors involved in submarine \nconstruction. This arrangement will save taxpayers over $1 billion in \nthe next 6 years, and ensure the continued viability of two nuclear \ncapable submarine yards.\n  I thank my distinguished colleague from Virginia, Mr. Robb, who \nworked with me on that, a member of our committee, as well as the \ndistinguished colleague, Mr. Lieberman, from Connecticut.\n  Further, our subcommittee authorized an increase of $720 million for \nthe procurement of a fourth Arleigh Burke destroyer. By buying this \nship early, we will save approximately $230 million on the marginal \ncost of this ship.\n  Those are savings that are passed on, of course, to the Department of \nDefense, but to the American taxpayer.\n  As relates to the aircraft carrier, the CVN-77, the next in the \nseries of our carriers, we authorized $50 million to accelerate the \nadvanced procurement and construction of components for CVN-77.\n  I particularly want to thank the distinguished chairman and ranking \nmember of the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Stevens, and Mr. Inouye. \nThey accommodated this Senator, personally allowing me to come into \nliterally the closing few minutes of their conference with the House in \norder to ensure that this $50 million be included in the \nappropriations.\n  We authorized the Secretary of Defense to reprogram up to an \nadditional $295 million in fiscal year 1998 for the advanced \nprocurement of CVN-77. I am now working with the Chief of Naval \nOperations and the Secretary of the Navy to ensure that the Navy takes \nadvantage of this important opportunity to get the ``smart buy'' \nproposal fully utilized within the Department of Defense, as well as \nthe Department of the Navy. Acceleration of funding for this ship \noffers an opportunity for potential savings of $600 million for the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this conference report. The House has \nalready spoken resoundingly in favor--with 286 Members voting in favor \nof the conference report last week. We must follow their lead with a \nstrong vote in favor of this conference report. Let us not allow a full \nyear's worth of work to be squandered.\n  I also urge the President not to veto this important measure. This \nPresident has deployed our troops into ``hot spots'' in record numbers. \nOur troops have answered these many calls to duty and performed \nadmirably. They stand ready today as new missions in Bosnia and Iraq \nare being discussed by policy makers in Washington.\n  Do not send a signal to those troops that you do not support their \nefforts. They should not have to worry about whether or not their \nraises and bonuses will be there in January. They should not have to \nquestion the commitment of politicians in Washington to provide the \nbest equipment and quality of life possible for our troops and their \nfamilies. I call on you, Mr. President, to show your support for our \ntroops by signing this very important conference report.\n  Mr. President, I wish to commend the distinguished chairman and \nranking\n\n[[Page S11825]]\n\nmember for their personal intervention with the President along with my \nown and others to see that this bill merits his signature in a prompt \nway.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to yield to the senior Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed \nfor 10 minutes without that time being charged to either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I join with others in complimenting the \ndistinguished chairman, Mr. Thurmond, and ranking member, Mr. Levin, as \nwell as Mr. Kempthorne, and Mr. Cleland.\n  Of the many duties that a United States Senator or a Member of the \nHouse of Representatives is called upon to perform, one of the most \nimportant involves expressing our views on whether U.S. armed forces \nshould be put in harm's way in defense of our country's national \ninterests. We must weigh whether the issue at hand merits risking the \nlives of our soldiers, sailors, and aviators.\n  Members of our armed forces cannot individually decide whether they \nshould place their lives at risk, for they are duty bound to follow the \norders of their commanders, and ultimately, of the President. Every \nindividual in our armed forces knows that he or she may be called upon \nto make the ultimate sacrifice for the nation. Every individual who \ntakes the oath to join the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marines, whether \nin the active forces, Reserves, or National Guard, does so knowing that \nthey carry a special burden, and a unique responsibility, to defend our \nnation's interests, wherever and whenever they may be called upon to do \nso.\n  As Senators, we must help to ensure that our armed forces are ready \nto perform this role. This includes raising and considering difficult \nquestions, which are included in the conference report before us, \nrelated to force readiness and the procurement of weapons systems. \nThese decisions involve billions of dollars and involve the employment \nof thousands of military and contractor personnel. The decisions made \nhere affect all military personnel and a large segment of our economy, \nand I, for one, do not take them lightly.\n  But of equal importance are questions concerning the morale of our \ntroops. Weapons alone do not win wars. It is our troops on the ground, \nour sailors at sea, our aviators in the air, and all the personnel who \nsupport them behind the lines who must combine to triumph over our \nnation's enemies. And these forces can only fight together as a \ncohesive force if they are united by common goals, morale, and \nstrategy.\n  The morale of our forces is of particular importance, for troops who \nsuffer from weakened morale must defeat not only the external enemy, \nbut also deal with the internal divisions and problems of their own \nranks, even while they fight the enemy. Our armed forces require strong \nleadership to deal with such problems, while providing a victorious \nstrategy on the battlefield.\n  Sadly, such leadership has been lacking in recent years, as is \nevidenced by the low morale particularly among the women in our armed \nforces. The women in our armed forces must endure a demoralizing and \nhostile environment while they attempt to carry out their duties. From \nthe shocking behavior of Naval aviators at the ``Tail Hook'' \nconventions, to the alleged rape of recruits at Aberdeen, it has become \nclear that the women in our armed forces face sexual discrimination, \nharassment, assaults, and even rape, as they carry out their duties in \ndefense of our nation.\n  The recent report by the Secretary of the Army exposes the \nseriousness of the problem. The report states that ``sexual harassment \nexists throughout the Army, crossing gender, rank, and racial lines . . \n.'' Almost one quarter of the women reported that they had been \nsexually harassed in the last twelve months, based upon a random \nstatistical survey conducted by the Army. A shocking 74 percent \nreported that they have endured crude or offensive behavior, 47 percent \nreported that they received unwanted sexual attention, 18 percent \nsuffered from sexual coercion, and 8 percent said they had been \nsexually assaulted. While these statistics are appalling, the footnotes \nonly add to the outrage. ``Unwanted sexual attention''--which almost \nhalf of the women reported--is defined as ``unwanted touching or \nfondling and asking for dates even when rebuffed.'' And sexual \ncoercion--which almost one quarter of the women endured--``includes \nclassic quid pro quo instances of job benefits or losses conditioned on \nsexual cooperation.''\n  The Army's report found that ``this issue is one of which the Army \nhas been long aware, and that to date, Army policies and processes \nimplemented to combat and eradicate sexual harassment have had little, \nif any, impact. As one soldier noted, `Women have been reporting sexual \nharassment for five years, and the Army's just now looking into it.' \nMany soldiers believe that their complaints and concerns have been \nignored and that only recent media attention has forced Army leaders to \nfocus on this issue.''\n  I would note that this in fact understates the intentional neglect on \nthe part of the Army. It is not just that Army leaders ignored \ncomplaints of sexual harassment for a number of years. More shockingly, \nit is that it took the media and national public attention focused on \nthe rape of female recruits to finally force the Army to seriously \naddress the treatment of women in the ranks.\n  There is an old adage that ``the fish rots from the head down.'' The \nreport states that ``leaders set the values compass for the Army; it is \nfrom them that respect and dignity flow. Many leaders are currently \nseen as practicing a zero defects mentality, caring only about \nthemselves and their careers. Soldiers do not uniformly have trust and \nconfidence in their leaders. Unfair treatment, double standards, and a \nlack of discipline were raised to Panel representatives time and again \n. . .''\n  Within the Army, the policy has been to ``talk the talk,'' but not \n``walk the walk''. Even while the Army brass told the troops that the \npolicy was one of ``zero tolerance'' for sexual discrimination, the \nofficers and drill sergeants knew that this was rarely enforced in \npractice. The report notes that a policy of ``zero tolerance'' is \nenforced for racial discrimination, but not for sexual discrimination.\n  The question for the Army is what can be done to correct the problems \nidentified in the report. I must commend the Secretary of the Army for \nissuing a candid and brutally honest summary of the problem. The report \nalso identifies a number of policies that must be changed or enforced \nin order to ensure that women receive equal and fair treatment in the \nArmy.\n  I must note, however, that the report is silent on the question of \nthe desirability of gender integrated training. I offered an amendment \nduring the Committee markup of this bill, which is included in this \nconference report, calling for the establishment of an independent \noutside review commission to examine the question of the \nappropriateness of gender integrated recruit training in the armed \nforces. My amendment also calls upon the Commission to review the rules \nof fraternization with the goal of recommending a single consistent \nstandard for conduct among enlisted people, and between enlisted people \nand officers, which spans all the services. What is appropriate for a \nsoldier in the Army should also be appropriate for a sailor or airman \nor marine.\n  On the question of training, the Army report notes that ``a key to \naddressing human relations issues, including sexual harassment, is \nassigning enough female role models to set the example for all \ntrainees. Twenty percent of Army accessions are women, but the training \nbase is composed of only ten percent female drill sergeants.'' The \nreport also states that ``new recruits form and hold their most lasting \nimpressions of the Army from the cadre they encounter during initial \nentry training.''\n  These observations suggest that female recruits might benefit from \ngender segregated training, in which they would be guaranteed to \nreceive training from women drill instructors and role models.\n  The report of the Secretary of the Army is a good first step, in \nterms of identifying the scope of the problem, and offering possible \nsolutions. The commission that will be created as a\n\n[[Page S11826]]\n\nconsequence of the enactment into law of this conference report will \nadd yet another dimension to our understanding of the problem and \npossible solutions.\n  ``People are not in the Army, people are the Army,'' stated General \nCreighton W. Abrams, former Army Chief of Staff. ``By people, I do not \nmean personnel . . . I mean living, breathing, serving, human beings. \nThey have needs and interests and desires. They have spirit and will, \nand strength and abilities. They have weaknesses and faults; and they \nhave means. They are at the heart of our preparedness . . . and this \npreparedness . . .--as a nation and as an Army--depends upon the spirit \nof our soldiers. It is the spirit that gives the Army . . . life. \nWithout it we cannot succeed.''\n  The report of the Secretary of the Army concludes that ``if there is \none overarching theme to this report, it is this: we must rededicate \nourselves to the fundamental truths so eloquently stated by General \nAbrams . . . Personnel readiness relies on a positive human relations \nenvironment. It is the vital base upon which we build the Army, and the \ncombat effectiveness of the Army's most important weapon system--the \nsoldier.''\n  Let us hope that the Army follows the recommendations included in \nthis report, and for that matter, that its philosophy permeates the \nentire Pentagon and military establishment. We cannot relent in our \nexamination of this problem; we must ensure that the leadership of our \narmed forces creates an environment of fairness for the women in the \nservices. And we must not shirk from examining objectively every aspect \nof this issue, including some aspects that might be labeled \n``politically incorrect,'' such as gender segregated training and \ncoherent across-the-board fraternization policies. I am glad that the \nconferees had the courage to establish the commission, and I look \nforward to the report.\n  I again compliment my chairman, Mr. Thurmond, and the ranking member, \nMr. Levin.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I wish to commend the able Senator from West Virginia \nnot only for his work on this bill but for all he has done over the \nyears for good Government in this Senate.\n  We are proud of you.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished chairman, Mr. \nThurmond, for his kind words.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, before I yield 4 minutes to my friend from \nNew Mexico, let me also add my thanks to Senator Byrd for the \ntremendous contribution he makes to the committee. We all know the \ncontribution he makes to the Senate, but he makes also an important \ncontribution to the Armed Services Committee, which is not noted as \noften as it should be but I want to note right now.\n  I thank him for his support of the conference report.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank Mr. Levin for his dedication to \nduty, for his high sense of purpose, and for the example he gives to \nall of us. I hope we can emulate that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly in support of \nthis year's national defense authorization bill which was reported out \nof conference committee.\n  The bill is the product of many months of dedicated work by Senator \nThurmond, Senator Levin and many others here, and of course, the \ncommittee staff and personal staff of Senators as well. It reflects the \ncollective interests of the Congress. It includes many provisions that \nwere arrived at through many long weeks and even months of debating and \nnegotiating.\n  I want to call particular attention to the provisions to fully fund \nthe Cooperative Threat Reduction Program and the related Department of \nEnergy programs to secure the nuclear materials and destroy chemical \nstockpiles and strategic weapons in the former Soviet Union. In my \nview, the money spent on these programs is among the most cost-\neffective ways that we expend taxpayer money to pursue our own national \nsecurity and to promote international peace.\n  I am also pleased that there is significant funding in this bill \nauthorized for a range of dual-use research and development programs. I \nbelieve that is important and allows the Department of Defense to \nleverage commercial investment in advanced technologies to meet our \ndefense needs.\n  The bill also authorizes funding to meet the requirements of the \ndefense programs in the Department of Energy, particularly the \nStockpile Stewardship Program, which I believe is extremely important \nto the future of our country.\n  The bill also contains, and I am sure others have commented on this, \na 2.8 percent pay raise for active duty military members. Without this \nbill, that increase would be limited to 2.3 percent. This may seem like \na small amount, but I believe that for people in uniform it is an \nimportant difference and one that we should definitely adopt this bill \nto accomplish.\n  The bill also, of course, is essential if we are going to go forward \nwith the construction programs for the fiscal year 1998 military \nconstruction projects, and that is another reason why the bill should \nbe approved by this Senate and should be signed by the President.\n  Mr. President, this bill does not meet all the goals of individual \nSenators, but it does express the collective priorities of the Senate, \nand I urge that we move to adopt it and send it to the President for \nhis signature. I hope the President will recognize the value of this \nlegislation to the Nation and sign it into law.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I know the Senator from California \nis waiting to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Whole yields time?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I believe the Senators from California \nhave 45 minutes reserved. I would like to exercise that time now and \nutilize as much of that as I may consume. I would appreciate being \nnotified when 20 minutes have gone by so that my colleague and friend \nfrom California might utilize the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct and the Senator is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise on this final day of debate on the conference \nreport to the DOD bill, and I do so to express my strong opposition.\n  Now, I very much regret this. I have great fondness for the chairman \nof the Committee, the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, and \ngreat respect for the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin. The great bulk \nof the bill I wish to support. I understand that there are important \nthings in the bill. However, from the perspectives of Texas and \nCalifornia, there is a basic unfairness in this bill that we cannot \nleave unaddressed, and I rise to address those points.\n  I want to say how privileged both my colleague from California and I \nhave been to work with the senior and junior Senators from the great \nState of Texas in trying to remedy the unfairness in this bill. \nUnfortunately, I must indicate we have not been able to achieve an \naccommodation, and therefore we register our objections through our \n``no'' votes.\n  I oppose the conference report because it contains language that will \neffectively stop, ban, prohibit any further public/private competitions \nof depot workloads at both McClellan and Kelly Air Logistics Centers. \nThese competitions will lower the cost of weapons systems repair and \nwill save the taxpayer money. It is hard for me to understand why they \nare not being permitted to go ahead.\n  It is unfortunate that this debate has to take place. We felt we had \nan agreement. The distinguished Senator from Michigan knows that he \ncalled me one night to indicate that at least 2\\1/2\\ points of the four \npoints we had raised would be accommodated. We agreed to that. We \nbacked off. Overnight, committee language was written which essentially \nundid the compromise, and\n\n[[Page S11827]]\n\nwe have been able to achieve no remedy since that time.\n  In the debate last week, this body heard that if this restrictive \ndepot language remained in the bill, the President would probably veto \nthe bill. A strongly worded letter was sent to the majority leader and \nother senior Members of Congress detailing the administration's concern \ndovetailing our concern. I will not read the letter, but I would like \nto talk about some of the points in it.\n  The depot language in this bill constrains DOD's ability to conduct \ncompetitions for depot-level repair work. This will result in \ndecreasing the amount of potential savings the Department would reap \nfrom these competitions and could then redirect to fund other vital \nneeds like readiness and weapons modernization.\n  Second, the administration is correct. The conference report \nabsolutely ``seeks to impose unique and inappropriate requirements on \nDOD's process for allocating the work now performed at the closing San \nAntonio and Sacramento Air Logistics Centers.''\n  Contrary to what members of the Depot Caucus espouse, the option to \nprivatize this depot work was explicitly made available in the 1995 \nBRAC closure report. The BRAC 95 Commission specifically recommended \nthat the Department ``consolidate the remaining workloads to other DOD \ndepots or to private-sector commercial activities as determined by the \nDefense Depot Maintenance Council.''\n  And, yes, the President did strongly support the Commission's \ndecision which specifically reinforced the option of privatization. In \nhis letter to the chairman of the BRAC 95 Commission, the President \nwrote, ``I was pleased to learn that . . . you confirmed the \nCommission's recommendations permitting the Department of Defense to \nprivatize the workloads of McClellan and Kelly facilities in place or \nelsewhere in their respective communities. . . . In my communications \nwith Congress, I have made clear that the Commission's agreement that \nthe Secretary enjoys full authority and discretion to transfer workload \nfrom these two installations to the private sector, in place, locally \nor otherwise, is an integral part of the overall BRAC 95 package it \nwill be considering.''\n  The President goes on to say without ambiguity,\n\n       Moreover, should the Congress approve this package but then \n     subsequently take action in other legislation to restrict \n     privatization options at McClellan or Kelly, I will regard \n     this as a breach of Public Law 101-510 (the base closure law) \n     in the same manner as if the Congress were to attempt to \n     reverse by legislation any other material direction of this \n     or any other BRAC.\n\n  While I'm on the subject of the BRAC, let me clear the air on this \npoint. Some have alleged that this public/private competition process \nwhich could result in this work being privatized at McClellan and Kelly \nis just a crooked attempt to keep these bases open. Let me say, without \nambiguity, it is not. McClellan and Kelly will both be closed in 2001. \nBRAC 95 made that decision. And, the communities of Sacramento and San \nAntonio are struggling to deal with this decision and make the best of \nit today.\n  Nearly 3,000 jobs not associated with the ongoing competition at \nMcClellan's Air Logistics Center will be moved to other Air Force \ndepots because when McClellan's gates are locked in 2001, that is it. \nThose 2,300 jobs that are associated with the public/private \ncompetition may also be moved to other Air Force depots depending upon \nits outcome. That's it. If this depot language remains in the \nconference report, McClellan will undoubtedly lose these remaining \n2,300 jobs. And that is what this is all about.\n  As far as the property and buildings at McClellan are concerned, they \nwill be transferred under the base reuse process to recipients in the \nlocal community according to their base reuse plan.\n  Third, the Department is already conducting a fair and open public/\nprivate competition at McClellan and Kelly. The depot language in this \nconference report would change that. It would, without question, skew \nthese competition in favor of the public depots. But, don't take my \nword for that, or the administration's, just listen to the supporters \nof the depot language.\n  One of the authors of the language, the junior Senator from Oklahoma, \nbelieves that this language shuts the door on private industry's \nability to compete. Quoted in the Daily Oklahoman he said, ``I think \nit's highly unlikely any (contractor) would want to bid on it.''\n  How are my colleagues and I supposed to believe this is a fair \ncompetition? Not only is that the sentiment of the Depot Caucus, but in \nthe letter we have heard quoted on the floor very effectively by the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas, the Industry-Depot Coalition, the \nAerospace Industries Association, the American Electronics Association, \nthe American Shipbuilding Association, the Contract Services \nAssociation, Electronic Industries Association, National Defense \nIndustry Association, Professional Services Council, and Shipbuilders--\nall agree that the impact of this is to kill private competition.\n  In a letter today sent to the distinguished Senator from South \nCarolina, the chairman of the committee, they point out that the \nlegislation, `` * * * places in statute competitive requirements that \nare at this time only to be applied to the proposed competitions for \nthe workloads at Kelly and McClellan. As believers in fair competition \nand equal treatment in all areas of competition, we simply cannot \nsupport a statutory requirement such as this one, that places unique \nrequirements on only one category of bidders. If the object is to \nensure fair competition, the statute should reflect that philosophy \nclearly, unambiguously, and uniformly.''\n  Mr. President, I have had calls from private contractors saying they \ncan't compete and won't compete under this language. I have said to \nthem, ``Would you put this in writing? Will you go public?''\n  Do you know what they told me? ``We are afraid to. There will be \nreprisals against our companies if we state this publicly.''\n  Have we come to that?\n  Let me also say, the Sacramento Bee quoted an industry representative \nwho said, ``I can't conceive of a company that would bid for McClellan \nand Kelly under these circumstances.'' So, the Senators from Texas and \nthe Senators from California are fighting for survival. We are fighting \nfor the ability to do what is professed to be the will of this body, \nwhich is to see if private competition can be effective in handling \nsome of this workload and that a fair bidding and contracting process \nexists to carry out that competition.\n  Secretary Cohen has supported us in this effort and for that I am \nvery pleased.\n  It is amazing to me that the Depot Caucus has taken this position. \nLet me cite the Warner Robins Air Logistics Center in Georgia as an \nexample. Members of the Depot Caucus have complained from the first day \nthat the competition announced by the Air Force would be unfair and \nbiased. They said public depots couldn't possibly win. But, Warner \nRobins won. How did this happen?\n  One of the reasons it happened is that public depots can hide their \noverhead in other accounts when they bid against private industry for \nthis work. Members of private industry on numerous occasions have said \nthis is exactly why they can't compete under this bill that is being \npassed today. Warner Robins, as I understand it--and I have never been \ncontradicted in this--took advantage of this ability to hide overhead \ncosts to help make its bid below that of their private competitors. In \nfact, the Air Force had to add penalties to Warner Robins' bid for the \n500 employees and other overhead that had been shifted to other \naccounts.\n  When conference began, the President's advisers said that he would \nveto the DOD authorization bill if these depot provisions were included \nin the bill. This veto message has not changed. The Depot Causus' \nanticompetition provisions, included in this bill by the conferees, \nwill serve to delay and restrict the public-private competitions for \ndepot workload currently underway at both McClellan and Kelly Air Force \nBases undermining any effort to do this work in the private sector in a \nmore cost-effective way.\n  DOD's own policy calls for greater reliance on the private sector for \nappropriate depot maintenance workload. Outsourcing helps preserve \nprivate sector capabilities and enhances DOD's ability to capture new \ntechnologies\n\n[[Page S11828]]\n\nthat are constantly being developed in the private sector. By \nintroducing greater competition into the mix, outsourcing lowers the \ncost of depot-level maintenance activities increasing funding levels \nfor modernization and readiness needs.\n  Secretary Cohen stated earlier this year that these provisions:\n\n       . . . could cost the Department significant sums in lost \n     annual savings and start-up costs. The could severely impact \n     military readiness. The San Antonio and Sacramento workloads \n     involve thousands of highly trained workers and large, \n     expensive equipment and facilities. . . . To transfer all of \n     these workloads without a competitive evaluation and risk \n     assessment would be unwise from a business perspective and \n     would involve a significant risk of disruption in mission \n     performance and degradation in military readiness.\n\n  DOD has stayed true and faithful to the Secretary's statement in also \nurging and recommending to the President that this bill be vetoed.\n  So, I urge my colleagues, please support the Senators from Texas and \nCalifornia in opposing this conference report until these depot \nprovisions are removed from the bill. We need to let these competitions \ngo forward in a truly fair and level way so that we can fund the \nmodernization and the readiness accounts. DOD believes that the first \ncompetition will result in an expected savings of $190 million. That is \nwhat is at stake in this issue, as far as funding for readiness and \npreparedness of the military is concerned--$190 million.\n  Turning to another subject, I would also like to raise concerns with \na provision in the conference report on revised export rules for \ncomputers. The conference report enacts new, and I believe damaging, \nrestrictions on the sale of many types of computers. The proposal is \nunworkable and will result in undermining our security in the long run.\n  Computer technology advances rapidly. What was called a supercomputer \nonly a few years ago, represents only routine computing power today. An \noverbroad restriction will not make the world a safer place, but will \nundermine U.S. interests by locking up U.S. exports, shifting sales to \nforeign manufacturers and denying the administration the necessary \nflexibility to respond to evolving technology and worldwide \ncompetition.\n  Export restrictions must be based on an objective review of a \ncomputer's computing power and the computing needs of the potential \ncomputer application. In a letter to conferees, National Security \nAdviser Sandy Berger wrote.\n\n       The President's 1995 decision to streamline computer export \n     controls addressed the outdated controls then in effect. \n     Given the rapid pace of technological change, we must avoid \n     substituting similarly inflexible controls mandated by \n     Congress. It is vitally important to maintain our ability to \n     adjust controls to keep pace with technological change while \n     focusing our limited resources on exports of national \n     security concern.\n\n  So the administration needs the authority to distinguish between \nsales that jeopardize national security and those that do not. That is \nwhat the administration is asking for. In stating this as a rationale, \nas well, they would recommend that this bill be vetoed if it goes out \nin its present form.\n  I believe that is a correct assessment. I think we only kick \nourselves in the pants, to have this kind of a restriction in this \nbill. Other countries will simply buy elsewhere. Our companies will \nlose those sales and the President, as well as the Department of \nCommerce, will lose any flexibility they have in making some decisions \nthat are really based on meaningful criteria. This bill fixes that \ncriteria at a lower level on computers that are not, in fact, \nsupercomputers today. That is the mistake that is inherent in the \nwriting of this provision.\n  It is for these reasons that Senators Gramm, Hutchison, Boxer, and I \noppose this bill. There are those who have said, and I want to address \nit, these four Senators are resisting pay raises. They don't want \nincreases in housing allowances. They don't want authorization of \nmilitary construction projects.\n  That is baloney, and it is the reason that the four of us introduced \na bill last week that goes ahead and authorizes the pay raises, the \nhazardous duty pay, the military construction projects, and military \nhealth care.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 20 minutes of the Senator has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. These are the reasons we oppose this bill. We ask our \ncolleagues to oppose it as well. Regardless, the President is going to \nveto this bill and I am happy, at least, about that.\n  Mr. President, I know my colleague from California would like to \nutilize the remainder of this time and I reserve the remainder of my \ntime and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and \nask the time be equally charged to each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, is it correct that the Senators from \nCalifornia have 24 minutes remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Further might I ask, do the Senators from Texas have any \ntime reserved?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have 20 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, although I discussed this bill last week, \nI think it is important as the Senate gets ready to vote on the \nconference report that my colleagues understand why the Senators from \nCalifornia and Texas oppose this conference report and why we believe \nit is a matter of extreme importance, not only to more than 2,000 \nCalifornia families, but also to taxpayers throughout the Nation and, \nindeed, to our national defense.\n  Mr. President, although I discussed this bill last week, I want to \ntake a few minutes of the Senate's time to explain why the Senators \nfrom California and Texas oppose this conference report and why we \nbelieve it is a matter of extreme importance--not only to more than \n2,000 California families, but also to taxpayers throughout the Nation, \nand indeed, to our national defense.\n  We oppose this bill because it contains provisions changing depot \nmaintenance law that would harm our States and undermine the DOD's \nability to perform maintenance work in the most cost-effective manner. \nThese provisions were designed for one purpose: To destroy planned \ncompetitions at McClellan AFB in California and Kelly AFB in Texas and \nfunnel workload to public depots in Oklahoma, Utah, and Georgia.\n  To fully understand this complex issue, I want to provide the Senate \nwith some background and recent historical context.\n  McClellan Air Force Base in Sacramento and Kelly Air Force Base in \nSan Antonio were scheduled for closure by the 1995 Base Realignment and \nClosure Commission. Rather than automatically relocate the duties \nperformed at these bases to other Government depots, the Department of \nDefense chose to privatize some workload by conducting a public-private \ncompetition.\n  Such privatization efforts were clearly authorized by the base \nclosure commission's final report. Opponents of competition argue that \nthe DOD's privatization initiatives thwart the intent of the BRAC, but \nthis is simply not true. The report of the commission itself instructs \nthe DOD to, and I am quoting the report, ``consolidate the remaining \nworkloads to other DOD depots or to private sector commercial \nactivities.'' It's right there: The DOD has the choice--either send the \nworkload to other depots or to the private sector.\n  This interpretation of the BRAC Commission's action was supported by \nthe ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Levin, \nduring debate last week. Although Senator Levin and I disagree somewhat \non this issue, he said last week:\n\n       I will state candidly that I disagreed with the assertion \n     of the depot caucus that the Base Closure Commission \n     prohibited privatization in place at Kelly and McClellan. The \n     1995 Base Closure Commission left it up to the Department of \n     Defense to decide how to distribute the Kelly and McClellan \n     work.\n\n  I hope Senator Levin's statement will put to bed once and for all the \nfalse assertion that competition at McClellan contravenes the BRAC \nprocess.\n\n[[Page S11829]]\n\n  The DOD will not award workload to Kelly and McClellan automatically. \nInstead it has insisted that private bidders compete with public depots \non the basis of quality and cost. In fact, the Department's first \npublic-private competition for work at Kelly AFB was won by a public \ndepot. After this result, how can anyone seriously argue that the \nprocess is biased in favor the private sector.\n  The Depot Caucus--a coalition of legislators from States and \ncongressional districts with public depots--have made no secret of \ntheir opposition to public-private competition at Kelly and McClellan. \nThey believe that without competition, work currently performed at \nthose bases will be directed to facilities in their States--regardless \nof cost or quality. That's not what is right for our Nation.\n  In the House, Depot Caucus members were able to insert a provision \ninto the DOD authorization bill that would have blocked privatization \noutright. The Senate bill initially included a similar provision, but \nit was removed prior to floor consideration. Thus, depot maintenance \nbecame a highly contentious issue for the DOD conference committee.\n  The senators from Texas and California, as well as affected members \nof Congress, worked very hard to reach a compromise with the conferees \non the DOD authorization bill. At first, we were pleased to learn the \nDepot Caucus abandoned its strategy of blocking competition outright, \nand instead submitted a proposal described as a compromise.\n  This suggested compromise was supposed to allow competition to \nproceed, but would also guarantee a level playing field for both public \nand private bidders. When I first heard this description, I responded \nenthusiastically. Unfortunately, when I studied the alternative \nproposal, it became clear that it was simply a backdoor attempt to \nblock competition.\n  To explain the depot provision included in this bill, I have compared \nit to a footrace in which all the participants--both the private \ncontractors and the public depots--are placed equally at the start line \nand told the first competitor across the finish line wins. \nUnfortunately, in this footrace, the private sector competitors are \nforced to run wearing 100-pound ankle weights. That's not a fair \ncompetition, Mr. President.\n  But don't take my word for it. Listen to our leading opponent, the \nSenator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe]. Following the announcement of the \nconference agreement, the Senator told his home State paper, the Daily \nOklahoman, ``I think it's highly unlikely any contractor would want to \nbid'' on work at Kelly and McClellan, because of all the new \nrequirements imposed by the bill. That article, titled ``Senators Agree \nto Provision Giving Tinker Bidding Edge,'' described in detail how the \ndepot maintenance sections of this bill will give the Oklahoma Air \nForce depot an unfair bidding advantage.\n  Mr. President, the Senators from California and Texas don't want an \nunfair advantage. We only want a level playing field and a fair chance \nto compete. Unfortunately, this bill denies fairness to thousands of \nworking families.\n  We remain willing to talk to the other side in an effort to reach a \nfair solution. During the conference, we were moving in the right \ndirection and were close to an agreement. Frankly, we were very \nsurprised when the bill was filed, closing the door to additional \nnegotiations. We believed that a final was compromise in sight. \nHowever, once the conference report was filed, we had no choice but to \nuse all of our procedural rights to block passage.\n  From the beginning, the Clinton administration has made clear that \nany provision that effectively stops competition will jeopardize \npassage of the DOD authorization bill. OMB Director Frank Raines \nreiterated that view in a letter sent to the majority leader on last \nweek. In the letter, Director Raines advises congressional leaders that \nthe President's senior advisors would recommend that the President veto \nthis bill. I hope the President will take that advice and I hope \nSenators will vote to sustain that veto if it comes. This bill is bad \nfor California, bad for taxpayers throughout the Nation, and bad for \nour national defense.\n  I want to mention another provision of this bill that I find \nobjectionable--section 1211, which restricts the export of midrange \ncomputers.\n  On July 10, the Senate overwhelmingly approved the Grams-Boxer \namendment, which required a GAO study on the national security impact \nof the export of computers in the 2,000 to 7,000 MTOPS range to tier 3 \ncountries. Our amendment was offered as an alternative to a proposal to \nrequire U.S. companies seeking to export computers in this range to go \nthrough a cumbersome and lengthy review and licensing process. The \nSecretary of Defense, the National Security Advisers, and the Secretary \nof Commerce all opposed the original proposal.\n  Unfortunately, rather than accept the Grams-Boxer amendment, the \nconferees wrote a new provision imposing a number of procedural \nbarriers to the export of midrange computers.\n  Specifically, the bill requires that prospective exporters wait 10 \ndays before shipping, during which a variety of Government agencies \ncould object to the sale. This requirement is overly bureaucratic, and \nin the opinion of national security experts, is simply not necessary.\n  The conference report allows the President to establish a new MTOPS \nthreshold, but it requires a 6-month delay before the new threshold can \ntake effect. I believe that the President deserves the flexibility to \nmake the changes he deems appropriate. A 180-day notification to \nCongress makes it extremely unlikely that the high-performance computer \ncontrol threshold will be increased fast enough to keep pace with this \nrapid technological changes that take place in this industry.\n  This provision will hurt the American computer industry for no good \nreason. The conferees should have listened to the NSC, the Defense \nDepartment, and the Commerce Department and left this issue alone.\n  Mr. President, I will vote against this conference report. We may \nhave lost an important skirmish in the conference committee, but I \nbelieve the battle is not yet over. We will revisit these important \nissues in the near future. I remain willing to work with my colleagues \nto reach a compromise that will ensure fairness for the more than 2,000 \nCalifornia families who only want a fair chance to compete to keep \ntheir jobs.\n  Mr. President, what it comes down to is this. When the last Base \nClosure Commission issued its report and decided to close down Kelly \nAir Force Base and McClellan Air Force Base, it was determined by the \nadministration that it would be very foolish if we didn't utilize these \nbases to allow private firms to come in and do the depot work at these \nbases. We called it privatization in place.\n  Specifically, in that BRAC, it was determined that privatization in \nplace would be permitted at McClellan and Kelly, and that those private \nsector companies that came in would have an equal chance to bid on \ndepot work. Let's face it, we know that around here. Everyone talks \nabout, ``Oh, yes, we want to be competitive''; ``Oh, yes, let's bring \nin the private sector''; ``Oh, yes, let's run the Government more like \na business.'' All that is fine except when something really happens and \nyou get a chance to do it, you have the people from the States who will \nlose the work suddenly saying, ``This is a bad idea.''\n  There is language in this bill that is meant to destroy the \ncompetition that McClellan Air Force Base in California would offer and \nthat Kelly Air Force Base in Texas would offer. They would take that \nwork that could go to the private sector at an efficient rate, saving \nthe taxpayers money, and instead funnel it to the public depots, the \nGovernment-owned, fully subsidized depots in Oklahoma, Utah, and \nGeorgia.\n  It is extraordinary to me that the very same people who were on this \nfloor for those States arguing day in and day out for a little private \nsector competition around here are the ones who are undermining the \nchance to have privatization in place at Kelly and McClellan, thereby \nsaving taxpayers millions of dollars and saving thousands and thousands \nof jobs.\n  I think it is important to note that it is the position of the \nCalifornia Senators and the Texas Senators that we don't expect the \nwork to be automatically given to McClellan and Kelly just\n\n[[Page S11830]]\n\nbecause they are privatizing. The DOD will not award work load to Kelly \nand McClellan automatically. Instead, the DOD has insisted that private \nbidders compete with public depots on the basis of quality and cost, \nand that is as it should be.\n  In fact, the first public-private competition for work at Kelly was \nwon by a public depot. So I don't see how anyone could argue that the \nSenators from California and Texas are rigging the situation to assure \nwork to our private companies at those bases.\n  But what you have is the Depot Caucus, a coalition of legislators \nfrom States and districts with public depots, trying to completely \ndestroy the ability of McClellan and Kelly to compete. They know that \nwithout competition, the work currently performed at Kelly and \nMcClellan will be directed to their facilities regardless of cost and \nquality. Mr. President, that is not right for this Nation.\n  What we had hoped in the conference was that we could reach some kind \nof agreement. Senator Levin worked very hard to try and reach some kind \nof agreement.\n  We were very disappointed. We thought we had a compromise that was \ngoing to work, but, frankly, it became clear to us, as we read the so-\ncalled compromise, that it would not guarantee fairness. It would not \nguarantee a level playing field.\n  If anyone has any doubt about it, they ought to look at what the \nSenator from Oklahoma said to his hometown press. He said in the Daily \nOklahoman: ``It is highly unlikely any contractor would want to bid'' \non the work at McClellan or Kelly. Even the headline of the paper said, \n``Senators Agree to Provision Giving Tinker Bidding Edge.'' Of course, \nTinker is a publicly owned depot.\n  So what we have here is a Senator from one of the affected States \nsaying on the one hand there is a fair compromise on this bill and then \nrunning home to his hometown press announcing with glee that, in fact, \nKelly and McClellan would be out in the cold. That is really where it \nis at.\n  So we have our colleagues who are saying on the one hand, yes, they \nwant to be fair; on the other hand they are saying to Kelly and \nMcClellan, you are at that starting point and now you can run with all \nof the public depots, and whoever wins, wins. What they don't tell you \nis that they put the equivalent of a 100-pound ankle weight on the \npeople at Kelly and McClellan giving them a huge disadvantage. In fact, \nthey are not going to be able to compete for the work.\n\n  There are those who swear that under the current language in the \nbill, the Department of Defense will be able to award some work to \nMcClellan and Kelly. We don't hear that from our private sector people. \nThey are saying they probably would not be able to bid, which is \nexactly what the Senator from Oklahoma said when he ran home to his \nhometown press to tell the world that, in fact, the language in the \nbill was going to disadvantage the workers at Kelly and McClellan.\n  I think it is important not only to listen to what Senators say on \nthis floor but to read what they tell their hometown press, if you \nreally want to know the truth. I think the Senator from Oklahoma made a \nbig mistake by going home and telling everyone he had rigged the deal, \nbut he did it, and now the truth is out.\n  Mr. President, the Senators from California and Texas do not want an \nunfair advantage. We only want a level playing field and a fair chance \nto compete. Unfortunately, this bill denies fairness to the taxpayers, \nfirst and foremost, because that is what we are about--quality products \nat the best price. Competition will make that happen. No, we are \ndenying them that.\n  We remain willing to talk to the other side in an effort to reach a \nfair solution because, frankly, this bill could well be vetoed. This \nbill, the way it is currently written, goes back on a promise that was \nmade to thousands of working families in Texas and California.\n  I also want to discuss another part of this bill which is very \nobjectionable, section 1211, which restricts the export of midrange \ncomputers. On July 10, the Senate overwhelmingly approved the Grams-\nBoxer amendment which required a GAO study on the national security \nimpact of the export of computers in the 2,000 to 7,000 MTOPS range to \ntier 3 countries.\n  Our amendment was offered as an alternative to a proposal that would \nrequire U.S. companies seeking to export computers in this range to go \nthrough a cumbersome and lengthy review and licensing process. The \nSecretary of Defense, the National Security Adviser and the Secretary \nof Commerce all supported the efforts of Senator Grams and myself on \nthis matter. Unfortunately, when it got to the conference committee, \nrather than accept the Grams-Boxer amendment, the conferees wrote a \nwhole new provision, a nightmare of procedural barriers to the export \nof midrange computers.\n  Nobody wants to see computers be exported that are \nsupercomputers, computers that in fact could give one country the \nability to develop weapons of mass destruction.\n\n  But these computers are in the midrange. Why would we restrict the \nexport of computers that are made all over the world? We are putting \nour companies through a nightmare of bureaucratic procedures in order \nto export. I am really sad that the bill took this tack because it is \nbehind the times and it does not reflect technology.\n  We ought to wake up. This is almost the 21st century. The computers \nthat are being stopped from export shortly will be the computers in \nevery office in the country. So we are putting our computermakers \nthrough this for no reason at all.\n  So, Mr. President, I will vote against this conference report. We \nlost an important skirmish in the committee, but I believe the battle \nis far from over. We will revisit these important issues in the near \nfuture if this bill is vetoed, which it is my understanding it will be. \nI hope that we can get together, all of us, on both sides of this \nissue, and resolve it.\n  So I will vote against this bill because it is unfair. It is unfair \nto workers. It is unfair to taxpayers. And, finally, it has unnecessary \ncontrols on midrange computers that are so out of date, we are \ndisadvantaging our computer companies for no good reason at all.\n  Again, in closing, let me say, Mr. President, I look forward to \nsitting down with my colleagues in a new spirit of true compromise. \nThere are ways we can resolve these problems. The Senator from Texas, \nSenator Hutchison, has been most dogged in her oversight of this. \nSenator Gramm of Texas, Senator Feinstein, and I, we want to find a \nfair solution. We are ready, willing and able to do that. I hope before \nthe week is out, we will find a way to resolve this short of having a \nbattle over a veto.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield whatever time I may still \nhave to the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. How much time do we have left on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-five minutes from the original grant.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I yield myself 15 minutes and save the 10.\n  How much is left on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. About 9 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Nine minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Zero-nine?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Zero-nine, the total of which is, 09 plus the \n25, 34.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I want to thank you for the recognition.\n  Let me try to go back and explain to people who may have come into \nthis debate in the middle what this is all about, why it is so \nimportant, why four of us have in essence held the Senate up for 7 days \nin considering this bill and why the issue is important to you whether \nor not your State will ever have a private contractor who competes for \na contract or not.\n\n  Let me go back 3 or 4 years and try to set the whole thing in \nperspective.\n  First of all, as we are all painfully aware, we have cut defense \nspending since 1985 by about 35 percent. That has taken a very, very \nheavy toll on maintenance and procurement and modernization. We have \nnot correspondingly reduced the overhead of the military. We have more \nnurses in Europe than we have combat infantry officers. We still have a \nbureaucracy that is\n\n[[Page S11831]]\n\nleftover from the cold war. So this 35 percent cut that has been \nimplemented since 1985 has had a profound impact on the military.\n  That is something that all sides of this dispute agree on.\n  Obviously, you would think that with defense being cut by 35 percent, \nwith the modernization program being dramatically reduced, with \noperations and maintenance being bled by cuts, and with the President \nspending billions of dollars now on a deployment in Bosnia, that the \none thing we would all agree on is that we want to spend the money that \nwe do have efficiently. You would think that this real tight budget \nthat we have would at least produce unanimity that we ought to try to \nspend the money as effectively as we can spend it.\n  In one of the most incredible paradoxes that I have observed, exactly \nthe opposite is occurring. At the very time when we do not have enough \nmoney for defense, at the very time that we are not modernizing the \nweapons systems that need to be modernized, at the very time that we \nare not maintaining our equipment, at the very time that recruitment \nand retention in the military is being affected and we are not meeting \nour quality goals in recruitment in the services, at the very time that \nall of those things are happening, rather than pulling together to try \nto get the most we can out of the money that we are spending by having \nmore competition, we have exactly the opposite occurring.\n  The opposite is occurring because there is a group of Members in the \nHouse that have an organization called the Depot Caucus. Basically, \nthese are House Members who have a military depot in their district. A \nmilitary depot is a Government facility that does defense work, \nprincipally maintenance.\n  What these Congressmen have done is concluded that with declining \ndefense work, what they want to do is stop price competition and force \nthe taxpayer to do defense maintenance work in their depots. That is \nwhat this whole issue is about. Now, it has been building for 3 years. \nFor 3 years we have had this battle with the Depot Caucus in the House. \nFor 3 years they have tried to get language in the defense bill that \nmandates that money be spent inefficiently by limiting competition.\n  Finally, this year, after a 3-year knock-down, drag-out fight, they \nhave in the bill as it is now printed 12 pages of language that have \none objective. That one objective is to guarantee, to the extent that \nthey could guarantee it, that price competition will not be allowed in \nthose areas where we have these defense depots and that defense \nmaintenance work will go to these Government facilities. That is \nbasically what this issue is about.\n\n  Now, under our current system where we are beginning competitive \nbidding, let me give you one example of what it produced.\n  We had competitive bidding for the maintenance of the C-5. That is \nthe great big transport plane, for those who do not know what the C-5 \nis. It was put up for bids. Interestingly enough, a Government depot \nwon the bid. But they bid $190 million less than the costs that we are \ncurrently performing the work for. How were they able to do it for $190 \nmillion less? They were able to do it for $190 million less because \nthey had 500 workers hidden away in their overhead that they were able \nto put doing work on the C-5, and they were able to do the work with \n700 employees rather than the 1,200 that are doing it now.\n  Who benefited from that? Well, I guess you could say these 500 people \nwho were hidden away in the overhead, maybe they did not benefit. But \nevery taxpayer in America benefited because we are doing the same work \non the same critical weapons system, and we are doing it for $190 \nmillion less.\n  What the language of this bill would do, to the extent that they were \ncapable of doing it, would be to stop that type of competition from \noccurring and mandate that that work be done in a Government depot, \neven though it might mean $190 million of additional cost to the \ntaxpayer.\n  Now, what is it that we want? Then I will explain to you why we want \nit.\n  What we want is competition. What we want is to give the Defense \nDepartment the ability to compete this work, which they support. This \nis one of these rare instances where President Clinton and some \nRepublicans are on the same side. The President wants to put this work \nout for competitive bidding, and he wants the contracts to go to the \npeople who can do it for the smallest amount of money.\n  The language of this bill attempts to stop that from happening. Now, \nwhy are we specifically involved? Well, partly we are involved because \nI care about $190 million on one contract and potentially a couple of \nbillion dollars a year--a couple of billion dollars a year--that will \nbe squandered if we do not have effective competitive bidding.\n  Second, my State is a State that wants to have the opportunity to \nbid. So does California.\n  Now, let me digress for a minute and talk about base closings. We \nhave had three Base Closing Commissions. I was an original cosponsor of \nthe Base Closing Commission bill. I vigorously supported it. I have \nvoted for the conclusions of every Base Closing Commission. And every \none of them has closed a base in my State.\n\n  Did I like it? No. I hated it. Did I think you should close bases in \nother States where their Senators were not as supportive of defense as \nSenator Hutchison and I are? Yes. That would have been eminently fair \nand reasonable in my mind and would have probably been good for the \ncountry.\n  But the point is, I am committed to the process of closing bases. I \ncould not very well say, when the commission decided to close them in \nmy State, that I am for closing them in Massachusetts; I am just not \nfor closing them in Texas. Well, when we committed to a technical \nprocess, I supported it.\n  Now, when the decision was made to close Kelly Air Force Base in \nTexas and McClellan Air Force base in California, we were in the midst \nof a Presidential campaign. So is anybody surprised that the most \ntalented politician of our era, Bill Clinton, jumped right in the \nmiddle of it with both feet up to his eyeballs? I was not surprised. \nNor is there any Member of the Senate that in similar circumstances \nwould not have done exactly what Bill Clinton did and probably more.\n  What did Bill Clinton do? He came to Texas. He went to California. We \nare the two largest States in the Union. I do not need to explain to \npeople how the electoral college works in electing Presidents. And he \nstood there, tears welling in his eyes, and talked about feeling our \npain.\n  He did not go so far as to lay down in front of the bulldozers, and \njust as they were getting ready to grind him into dust, to have his \nfaithful staff run in and pull him out, him shouting that he wanted to \ndie rather than see it happen. He did not go quite that far, but he was \nvery effective.\n  For our colleagues who say, ``Well, the President played politics,'' \nhe played it very effectively. And any one of us would have. But the \npoint is, he did not do anything. The Base Closing Commission report \nsaid that one of the options that was available to the Air Force--they \nwrote it out in the Base Closing Commission report--was to put the work \nup for competitive bids. And if private contractors could come into the \nempty facility that would no longer be an Air Force base in Texas, \nwould no longer be an Air Force base in California, if they could \ncompete for the work and win it, they would get it.\n  The President, of course, wanting the electoral votes of Texas and \nCalifornia, thought this was just one great idea. And he talked about \nit. He was supportive of it. And he was effective at it. But the point \nis, the Base Closing Commission made the decision. And now the Pentagon \nis trying to carry it out. Now some of our colleagues say, well, \nbecause the President gave a political speech in Texas or California, \nsomehow he tainted the whole process.\n  That, Mr. President, is not borne out by the facts. The Base Closing \nCommission report specifically set out the option of competitive \nbidding.\n  We have had our first competitive bid, saving $190 million. \nInterestingly enough, a depot, a Government facility, won the bid by \ntaking 500 workers out of featherbedding and by putting them on the \nproject, and everybody benefited $190 million.\n  Now, what our colleagues are trying to do is to come in and say that \nhas to stop, that we cannot let contracts on any competitive basis \nuntil all these conditions are met with regard to\n\n[[Page S11832]]\n\nusing these Government facilities, and they have 12 pages of all of \nthese conditions, which boil down to no competition.\n  In trying to reach a compromise, in working with the Pentagon and the \nWhite House, we came up with four simple changes that we said, if you \nwill make these four simple changes, we will swallow hard and we will \ntake this bad language. What were the changes? No. 1, was for \ncommercial items. Those are items that are sold on the general economy; \nfor example, maintaining the engine that is used on airliners. \nObviously, airlines maintain their own engines. They are very efficient \nat it and can do it much cheaper than the Government can do it. So the \nPentagon said don't force us to do routine maintenance on things in \ndefense depots that are used by the private sector. Let us \ncompetitively bid it, and airlines will compete. We might save 40 or 50 \npercent on bids. That is the first thing they wanted. Those who are for \nthis language say, no, we don't want American Airlines to maintain the \nsame engines they maintain. We want the Government to do it.\n  The second thing we asked for was the change of one word. It is a \nvery important word. It is complicated, but the principle is very \nsimple. The principle is that our colleagues tried to write into the \nbill language to ``ensure the full utilization'' of all of these \nGovernment depots. The problem is, if you are forced to fully utilize \nthem, then you can't have competitive bidding because there is not that \nmuch work. What the Defense Department wanted to do, they were willing \nto commit to promote the utilization of them, to try to utilize them, \nbut they wanted to have the ability to engage in competitive bidding. \nSo they asked that we substitute ``promote'' for ``ensure.'' They asked \nwhen you are going to have public-private teaming on these bids, they \nat least have an opportunity to figure out how they could keep \nGovernment facilities from hiding costs to balance the bidding process.\n  Finally, they wanted the ability to take into account cost and \nperformance risk in these competitive bids. The answer on all of these \nthings was ``no.''\n  So what is the issue that is before the Senate? The issue that is \nbefore the Senate is, in a defense budget that is inadequate, in a \ndefense budget that is bleeding modernization and maintenance, should \nwe have 12 pages of language that attempts to preclude competitive \nbidding that could save billions of dollars for the taxpayer, could \nallow us to improve pay and benefits, that could help us recruit and \nretain the finest young men and women who have ever worn the uniform of \nthe country, savings that could help us procure miracle weapons that \ncould protect American lives in the future, and that could maintain the \nquality maintenance of our equipment and the training of our people? Or \nshould we forgo those savings and simply guarantee Government depots a \nmonopoly, for all practical purposes, on doing this work? That is the \nquestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 18 minutes. There are 16 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Those of us who oppose this bill say we want competition. \nThat competition is critically important.\n  We have asked and the President has committed to veto this bill. He \nis going to veto this bill because it is anticompetitive, because it \ncheats the taxpayer, because it cheats the men and women who wear the \nuniform of this country by squandering money that could go to improve \nthe operation and maintenance of their equipment, to modernize their \nequipment and to provide pay and benefits that would keep the best and \nthe brightest in the service. So that is what this issue is about. It \nis about competition. This is a debate that has been building for 3 \nyears. Every year we have had this cry that really boils down to this: \nDefense is being cut and so Government depots have a right to be \nmonopolists on this defense work. Even if it costs more, even if \nbillions of dollars could be saved, they have a right to it. What we \nhave done in this bill, I am sad to say, is we have turned defense into \nwelfare. At the very time when we need efficiency and economy, we are \ndenying it in the name of protecting special interests. I think it is \nfundamentally wrong.\n  Now, I don't deny that competition would benefit my State because we \nhave facilities that private contractors would like to use to bid. But \nthe point is they can't get the work if they don't do it cheaper and if \nthey don't do it better. What we want is competition. That is what we \nhave fought for.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes of my time to the \ncontrol of the two Senators from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to be notified when 5 minutes \nhave expired.\n  I understand well the consternation of my good friends from Texas and \nCalifornia. My State of Utah has been there, too. We have suffered no \nless a proportionate loss of jobs and installations from the past Base \nClosing Commissions. The great difference here is we are a small State \nwith just five electoral votes.\n  The conference measure gives California and Texas, vote-rich States, \nsomething that Utah and other States never had, a second chance at life \nthrough a Presidential circumvention of the very BRAC process that the \nPresident himself previously enthusiastically supported.\n  My friends from Texas and California had several months to work out a \ncompromise. Under the threat of Presidential veto and Senate \nfilibuster, the Armed Services Committee and the Senators and staff \nfrom such States as Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, \nOklahoma, and Utah, among others, the so-called depot States or depot \ncaucus States, which included Texas and California on other issues, \nhave accommodated our friends. We could not be more sympathetic to \ntheir losses, which, after all, involve real people and families. As I \nsaid earlier, we have all been there.\n  But we have given them just about everything they want, even though--\nI repeat, even though--what we give them we do in a zero-sum sense. \nThat is because we are giving up something that our people won and \nearned from the BRAC process and must now share. Our generosity in this \nsense goes beyond mere fairness and magnanimity. It is closer to \nsacrifice.\n  Let me tick off some of the sacrifices.\n  We allow competition for work that was originally designated for our \ndepots by BRAC.\n  We allow the Air Force's tier I depot, Hill Air Force Base, which has \nthe highest military value, to bid for something rightfully owed to \nHill, against McClellan Air Force Base, a tier III depot, or an \ninstallation with the lowest military value, according to Air Force \nassessments.\n  We allow these same tier III depots to bid to keep the work there \ndespite the $400 to $700 million higher cost to the taxpayers that the \nGAO and the Air Force have identified.\n  Mr. President, that is sacrifice. But I say enough is enough. It is \none thing for us to squawk and scream at each other on the floor of the \nSenate. We need to move ahead now and address this matter in the way it \nshould be addressed.\n  Hill Air Force Base also hosts two Air Combat Command air tactical \nfighter wings, one of which is an Air Force Reserve unit. These units \nare rotating to fulfill this Nation's peacekeeping missions in the \nMiddle East and in Bosnia.\n  What does that mean to us here today? Military persons are required \nto put the mission before all else: personal well-being and safety, \nfamily, and virtually everything else that matters. So important is \nthis commitment that we have constructed a separate body of law called \nthe Uniform Code of Military Justice, which allows military and \ncivilian authorities to enforce and defend, where necessary, the \nobligation of self-sacrifice. Cowardice or desertion in the face of the \nenemy, for example, carries severe penalties.\n  Having imposed such heavy obligations on the courageous men and women \nof our Armed Forces, we now find ourselves delaying the availability of \nthe equipment and means they need urgently to execute their missions.\n  So this bill needs to pass. We should not hold up the $93.8 billion \nfor operations and maintenance, which is to say troop training and \nequipment\n\n[[Page S11833]]\n\nmaintenance. We don't want to deny a pay raise of 2.8 percent for these \nfolks in the military who need it so badly at a time when highly \ntrained air crews are leaving at alarming rates. We don't want to deny \nbonuses based on years of service and skills or delay the \nimplementation of studies to correct deeply rooted gender \ndiscrimination and abuses.\n  Improvements of family housing, which is sometimes so awful I wince \nat some, we don't want to delay that.\n  The President's request for $2.1 billion to move ahead on the F-22 \nprogram, the airplane to replace the F-15C, the work horse of the Air \nForce fleet, we don't want to delay that.\n  I could go on and on. I believe my point is made. We in Utah made our \nsacrifices. We shouldn't have to make these sacrifices. The President \nshould have lived up to BRAC to begin with.\n  Delaying this bill means increased risk for military persons putting \ntheir lives on the line:\n  We are holding up $93.8 billion for operations and maintenance, which \nis to say troop training and equipment maintenance.\n  We are denying them a pay raise of 2.8 percent.\n  At a time when highly trained air crews are leaving the services at \nalarming rates, we are denying bonuses based on years of service and \nskill levels.\n  We are delaying the implementation of studies to correct deeply \nrooted gender discrimination and abuses.\n  Improvements in family housing, which is sometimes so awful I wince \nin shame, are delayed.\n  The President's request for $2.1 billion to move ahead on the F-22 \nprogram, the airplane that will replace the F-15C, the work horse of \nthe Air Force fleet, will also be delayed.\n  Mr. President, I can appreciate that my good friends from Texas and \nCalifornia want to protect the interests of their States. But, they \nwant to change the rules of the game after they've lost in fair play.\n  To help us make the really tough decisions about base closures, we \ncreated the BRAC process. We--Congress--created this mechanism to \ndecide what bases to close and which to keep open.\n  Congress itself selected several of the BRAC Commissioners; and, I \nheard no grievances about the criteria used by the Commission to make \nits recommendations. The process enjoyed the support of Congress and \nthe administration. And, I believe that it has been managed by fair-\nminded men and women and staffed by nonpartisan, skilled analysts. It \nis probably about as objective a decisionmaking process as you are \ngoing to get.\n  During the BRAC 95 round, it was determined that Kelly and McClellan \nshould be closed. I can understand why my colleagues from Texas and \nCalifornia are not happy about that--I was not happy when previous BRAC \nrounds put Tooele Army Depot and Defense Depot Ogden on the closure \nlist.\n  But, so far, those of us who represent States that have lost bases \nbecause of BRAC have not tried to jury-rig a method for keeping Federal \ndollars coming to a base on the closure list.\n  The Clinton administration has inexcusably tampered with this \nprocess. In proposing privatization in place, the Clinton \nadministration put electoral politics ahead of the integrity of the \nBRAC process, weakening the investment value of already shrinking \ndefense dollars.\n  No one has greater cause for protest on this floor than my colleague \nfrom Utah and myself. Utah, along with Oklahoma and Georgia, have been \nmade the real victims of the President's tampering with this process.\n  In the case of Utah, the administration's original proposal would \nhave starved Hill Air Force Base of the work needed to maintain its own \nefficiency.\n  The Ogden Air Logistics Center at Hill AFB is rated by the Air Force \nas its No. 1 depot. It received a tier I rating, meaning it has the \nhighest military value. By contrast, Kelly and McClellan were rated as \ntier III installations, those having the lowest military value.\n  The original changes to BRAC proposed by the President could have \nbeen made only by dismissing merit as a criteria. It is no different \nthan telling a grade school student that, although he or she is the top \nacademic performer in the class, the honors will go to a less \nproficient teacher's pet.\n  It is no wonder that the workers at these depots are offended by this \nmessage. The American Federation of Government Employees [AFGE] has \nvigorously opposed privatization in place --not just because private \ncontractors would be allowed to take over work, but also because the \nquality of their work and the dedication of their members to America's \ndefense has been given such short shrift.\n  Nevertheless, Mr. President, Utah has a proud legacy of strength in \nadversity. The great majority of Utahns are descended from pioneers who \npulled handcarts halfway across America. Utahns came together with \nideas and resources and determination to overcome defense losses. We \nhave long since absorbed the more than 5,000 jobs that previous BRAC's \nand DOD downsizing have cost us. Our losses are just about \nproportionate to those experienced by defense closures in Texas and \nCalifornia, considering the relatively smaller size of our workforce.\n  But, I would like to point out that Utahns were working without a \nnet. A net that the Clinton administration has graciously--but without \njustification, in my opinion--provided to Texas and California in this \nlatest BRAC round.\n  But, now let's talk about the compromise adopted by the Armed \nServices Committee in this legislation.\n  First of all, as my remarks would indicate, I am strongly opposed to \nthis sleight of hand known as privatization in place. I simply do not \nsee that Federal dollars to contractors to perform the same work done \nby Kelly and McClellan--and which should have been redistributed to \nHill, Warner-Robins, and Tinker--is a savings. Instead of \nconsolidating, all that is achieved with this policy is maintained \nexcess capacity. GAO reported that this concept would actually cost \n$468 million per year.\n  Instead of five depots with excess capacity, we now have three depots \nand private contractors at Kelly and McClellan. This effectively locks \nin excess capacity at the three remaining depots and would sign their \neventual death warrant.\n  Let's be clear about one thing: This conference report does not \nrepudiate privatization in place. It does not consolidate workload. \nScore a big one for President Clinton and for my Texas and California \ncolleagues.\n\n  But, though I would cheerfully chuck this whole concept, I can accept \nthe compromise plan developed by the conferees. The provisions in the \nconference report at least allow fair competition for the maintenance \nwork and will not stack the deck against Utah and the other similarly \naffected States.\n  In my view, Utahns can compete with anyone. Our work force, our \ntechnology, our efficient State and local governments, and our \ncooperative spirit have been staples of the Utah economy.\n  Some of the fruits of that spirit are the facts that:\n  Salt Lake City was selected--after one of the toughest competitions \nyou can imagine--to host the Winter Olympic Games in the year 2002;\n  Business Week has called Utah the software valley of the world;\n  Utah has the highest educational level in the country, according to \nthe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics;\n  We are ranked second in the Nation in job creation;\n  We are second in economic growth, which for 1997 is estimated at 6.9 \npercent. This is well above the 2.5 percent average economic growth \nrate for all States, according to the U.S. Labor Department;\n  Despite our small size and being an insular State, 17 percent of the \nadult population speak a foreign language, many fluently. Utah is the \nsite of the Army's only linguist brigade, a reserve unit that in \nwartime will bring forward nearly 3,000 accomplished speakers of more \nthan 20 languages. And, I might mention that the city of Provo, UT, \nbeat out New York City and Los Angeles as the site selected by the Army \nto locate this unit.\n  These achievements do not entitle my State to anything. There should \nnever be any guarantees--no free passes. But, this exemplary track \nrecord does mean Utah has earned the chance to compete fairly, without \nhaving to play by rules that do not apply to others.\n  The Air Force knows the value of Utah well. The BRAC Commissioners\n\n[[Page S11834]]\n\nlearned it quickly. And the workers from Kelly and McClellan \nunderstandably wanted to share it.\n  Utah's military value is unmatched. Our former colleague, Senator \nJake Garn, fostered its development as a defense technology mecca. \nFormer Governor Norm Bangerter added 20,000 aerospace jobs to the State \nduring his tenure, which ended in 1992. Today, Congressman Jim Hansen, \na longtime member of the House National Security Committee, has led the \neffort to sustain the high quality of Utah's defense installations.\n  Mr. President, Utah has made a commitment to national defense. I am \nin no way questioning the motivation of others who have enjoined this \ndebate; but, the level of investment and record of excellence exhibited \nby Hill, Warner-Robins, and Tinker, is a reason for making sure that \nthe Federal Government conducts a fair competition.\n  This conference report sets the stage for an acceptable process of \nfair competition. I expect that the Clinton administration will \njudiciously carry it out, and I will, of course, be following the \nimplementation of these competitions closely.\n  We have crafted a compromise that goes beyond mere equity and \nfairness. Utah, Oklahoma, and Georgia, after all, are directed to give \nup something they've earned--which is the right to perform the work \nBRAC stated they should have. That is an indisputable fact.\n  And, perhaps this is a good time to remind my colleagues who do not \nbelieve that they have a dog in this fight that, if the rules can be \nchanged to put Utah, Georgia, and Oklahoma at a competitive \ndisadvantage, they can be changed to put your State at a disadvantage \nas well. Tampering with the BRAC process is a slippery slope.\n  Back in July, I questioned Air Force Deputy Secretary Rudy DeLeon \nregarding several competition procedures. I ask unanimous consent to \nenter these questions and his responses for the Record, Mr. President.\n  I accept Mr. DeLeon's responses as commitments by the Air Force. I am \npleased that these commitments have been incorporated in principle or \nin explicit language in the depot provisions of the bill.\n  The only exception regards the protest rights of the bidders. Under \nthe President's original plan, public depot bidders, like Utah's Hill \nand Oklahoma's Tinker, would have been denied the normal rights of \nprotest available to private bidders. Under the conference agreement, \nany public depot-private contractor team could pursue a protest through \nthe inherent rights available to the private team member.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I want to say that I intend to audit, \noversee, and examine the details of each competition in the most minute \ndetail. I will insist not only on compliance with the letter of every \nappropriate competition statute and regulation, but also with the \nnonstatutory language and other administration commitments found \nelsewhere in the legislative history of this debate. The danger of \ncompromise is that those who implement it have the ability to spin \nthings their own way.\n  Members of both the House and Senate Armed Services Committee have \ninvested significant blood and sweat on this issue. I appreciate the \nextraordinary effort by Senators Thurmond, Warner, and Levin. I also \nwant to acknowledge the assistance of Senator Lott. Every now and then \nwe needed a referee, and he was a fair one. At the end of the day, I \nbelieve we have come up with a compromise that is workable, and I have \nevery expectation that the President will agree.\n  It has also been a pleasure working with my colleagues from Oklahoma \nand Georgia, and, of course, my partner from Utah, Bob Bennett.\n  Last, but not least, I want to thank my colleague, the senior Utahn \nin the House, Congressman Jim Hansen. Jim fought his guts out to make \nsure that Hill Air Force Base has a fair chance. And, I don't think \nthis issue could have been as successfully resolved without his work in \nthe other body.\n  Mr. President, I believe we have reached a satisfactory resolution of \nthis thorny issue. I urge all Senators to support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent questions and answers in the \nSenate Armed Services Committee confirmation hearing be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Question for the Record, Senate Armed Services Committee Confirmation \n                         Hearing--July 17, 1997\n\n       Question A1. Senator Hatch. Contract term. Why was a 5-year \n     contract with three option years selected? Is this a \n     customary period for such workload contracts? What are the \n     criteria for determining whether 3 plus year extensions to \n     contract performance will be granted?\n       Answer. Mr. De Leon. The contract period of performance is \n     a critical decision in the acquisition strategy process and \n     is based on factors peculiar to the particular acquisition. \n     The contract needs to run long enough to attract serious \n     bidders and bids favorable to the government. A contract \n     shorter than 5 years would likely fail to provide sufficient \n     time for bidders to recover their initial investment expenses \n     and realize cost savings. In other depot maintenance and \n     contractor logistics support contracts the Air Force has used \n     five year periods. Over the past 5 years the Air Force has \n     found it cost effective and beneficial to write contracts for \n     10 or even 15 years, basic contract and options combined. For \n     example, many contractor logistic support contracts, such as \n     JPATS, C-12 and C-21, run 10 or 15 years. Additionally, the \n     Arnold Engineering and Development Center contract is a 5 \n     year basic with a 3 year option. With options, the government \n     always has the flexibility to not exercise the option(s) in \n     order to recompete the work if the incumbent is not \n     performing satisfactorily.\n       The inclusion of options (three, one-year extensions to \n     contract performance) under an innovative ``award term'' \n     approach is being considered for the workloads at McClellan \n     to provide additional incentives to the winner to deliver \n     cost-effective, reliable products to the customers. In the \n     case of award term, continuation of the contract is awarded \n     for exceptional performance. This type of approach is \n     designed to incentivize the winning competitor to lower costs \n     and provide exceptional performance to the Air Force.\n       Question A2. Senator Hatch. Best Estimated Quantity (BEQ). \n     The BEQ for the KC-135 aircraft is offered at 35-40 annually. \n     What is the current rate of serviceable KC-135s entering \n     depot level maintenance annually? If the current number is \n     smaller, how does the Air Force plan to raise the number to \n     the RFP BEQ?\n       Answer. Mr. De Leon. The draft request for proposal (RFP) \n     contains two separate pricing schedules for KC-135 \n     maintenance. The first schedule is based on an annual BEQ of \n     15 aircraft, and an aggregate BEQ of 75 aircraft over the \n     period of performance. The second potential schedule is based \n     on an annual BEQ of 35 with an aggregate BEQ of 175 aircraft \n     over the period of performance. The final RFP will contain \n     only one of these pricing schedules. The determination of the \n     schedule for the final RFP will be based on the best estimate \n     quantity at that time.\n       Recent trends show 100 KC-135s inducted for programmed \n     depot maintenance in FY96, 77 expected in FY97, and 83 \n     projected for FY98. These include inductions to all sources \n     (OC-ALC, SM-ALC, and contract). The Air Force is considering \n     the higher quantity to allow for the cost savings derived \n     from economies of scale.\n       The current total inductions of KC-135 aircraft are well \n     above the contemplated BEQs.\n       Question A3. Senator Hatch. Twenty-five percent cost \n     savings. It is my understanding that the Air Force \n     anticipates a 25-percent cost savings during the first five \n     years of the contract. How was that number calculated?\n       Answer. Mr. De Leon. The Air Force believes the best \n     opportunity for savings can be achieved through a fair \n     public/private competition. Since the competitions are not \n     yet completed, the Air Force cannot, at this time, be sure \n     what the savings outcome will be; however, the Air Force \n     anticipates that it will be significant.\n       Question A4. Senator Hatch. Excess capacity costs. GAO \n     estimates that the Air Force cannot achieve cost savings from \n     excess capacity that will remain under the current \n     privatization-in-place concept. The audit agency reports that \n     higher prices can only result. How do you respond to GAO on \n     this matter?\n       Answer. Mr. De Leon. The Air Force is not privatizing in \n     place but rather, conducting public/private competitions. \n     Under these competitions, the public and private bids will be \n     evaluated to ensure that any potential consolidation savings \n     and resulting recurring and one-time costs are carefully \n     considered in the decision process. This includes considering \n     capabilities, risks, costs and savings in evaluation of both \n     the public and private bids. Along with public/private \n     competitions, the Air Force will look at eliminating excess \n     capacity using strategies such as transferring workload, \n     partnering with industry, and reducing infrastructure.\n       Question A5. Senator Hatch. Transition costs. My \n     interpretation of the section on transition costs in the \n     December 1996 Public Private Competition documents \n     [hereafter: ``PPC''], and page 32, secs. a-b specifically, \n     tells me that the public bidder must show adjustments for \n     such personnel costs as severance pay, relocation, VERA/VSIP, \n     etc. Yet, I believe these costs are covered by \n     congressionally appropriated funds under BRAC. How does the \n     private bidder account for these costs in its bid submission?\n\n[[Page S11835]]\n\n       Answer. Mr. De Leon. The intent of the language on \n     transition costs in the December 1996 PPC documents was to \n     have the public and private bidders provide a list of all of \n     the transition costs included in their proposals. This would \n     allow the cost proposal evaluation team to determine whether \n     all appropriate transition costs were captured and, if not, \n     make the necessary adjustment. For cost comparison purposes, \n     the Air Force did not need to distinguish between BRAC and \n     non-BRAC funded costs since they are both included.\n       Question A6. Senator Hatch. Depot facilitization and \n     upgrade costs. What is the comparable state of the depot \n     facilities at Ogden and Sacramento--more specifically: what \n     improvements have been made to each depot, at what aggregate \n     cost, over the past five years? In addition, please comment \n     on the following related topics:\n       a. Do both public and private bidders account for personal \n     and real property (equipment and facilities) over the \n     contract term?\n       b. If the question at sub-sec. 6a is answered in the \n     negative, how does the competition comply with policy (DOD \n     7000.14R) and cost accounting standards which seem to require \n     identical treatment of depreciation by both classes of \n     bidders?\n       Answer. Mr. De Leon. Capital investments in facilities, \n     equipment and other infrastructure have been made in planned \n     modernization strategies by McClellan and Ogden to perform \n     their designated mission workloads. New facilities are \n     acquired and maintained through the MILCON, minor \n     construction, and Real Property Maintenance (RPM) programs. \n     Capital equipment is replaced, added, and upgraded through \n     the Capital Purchase Program (CPP).\n       For FY90-96 (projected end of year), investments for these \n     two bases include the following:\n\n                        [In millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                    McClellan    Ogden\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMILCON............................................      38.75       25.9\nRPM...............................................       41.3       45.8\nCPP...............................................       49.3       57.8\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       (a) In the case where equipment and facilities are \n     purchased or acquired for the proposed workload and would not \n     otherwise have been purchased or acquired, both public and \n     private bidders will account for such assets over the \n     contract period of performance.\n       (b) N/A\n       Question B1. Senator Hatch. Rights of protest. Do public \n     and private bidders have identical rights of protest? If not \n     why not?\n       Answer. Mr. De Leon. No, public and private parties do not \n     have identical rights, primarily as a result of statutory \n     provisions of law relating to bid protests.\n       Question B2. Senator Hatch. Personal property rights. My \n     interpretation of 32 CFR Part 91.7, para. (h)(5)(l) and (v), \n     and 10 USC 2687 suggests that a successful public bidder may \n     acquire personal property such as equipment, from Kelly or \n     McClellan where such property is required for the operation \n     of a unit, component weapon, or weapon system transferring to \n     the successor public depot as a consequence or outcome of \n     competition or realignment. These rights, I believe, also \n     accrue to the successful public bidder where the property \n     meets the needs of an authorized program and which would \n     otherwise require the government to expend monies to acquire \n     similar equipment if the transfer was not made.\n       Do you dispute this interpretation?\n       Answer. Mr. De Leon. I agree that under 32 CFR Part 91.7 \n     (now 175.7) if personal property at Kelly or McClellan is \n     required for the operation of a depot function transferring \n     from one of those bases to another public depot as a result \n     of the public-private competition, then such property may be \n     transferred to the successor public depot. August 1996 Air \n     Force guidance explicitly provides that ``if another DoD \n     depot wins a depot maintenance competition, or limits of \n     federal statutes require certain depot maintenance workloads \n     remain under governmental control, then the associated \n     personal property will be transferred as required.'' In \n     addition, the regulation provides that personal property may \n     be removed from the installation when ``the property meets \n     known requirements of an authorized program of another \n     federal department or agency that would have to purchase \n     similar items. . . .'' These regulations are fully consistent \n     with the statutory provisions in the GRAC Act, \n     Sec. 2905(b)(3)(E), set out as a note to 10 U.S.C. Sec. 2687.\n       Question C. Senator Hatch. It is my understanding that the \n     Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) activity has been \n     restricted to the compilation and submission of bids to the \n     Source Selection Advisory Council (SSAC). The Source \n     Selection Authority (SSA), however, will be situated within \n     the Air Force secretariat. I appreciate the foresight \n     demonstrated by the Air Force in restricting the Air \n     Logistics Command acquisition authorities from award making. \n     However, what assurances does Congress have that the SSA will \n     not submit to political influences that could distort a truly \n     merit-based award?\n       Answer. Mr. De Leon. The policies and procedures that were \n     developed and published in ``AFMC Procedures for Depot Level \n     Public/Private Competition'' addressed the roles, \n     relationships and responsibilities to ensure a level playing \n     field and a merit-based award. This was further augmented by \n     the Cost Comparability Handbook which provides standardized \n     procedures and techniques to ensure cost comparability when \n     competing depot maintenance workloads. The Source Selection \n     Authority is a career civilian who over the past 28 years has \n     been the source selection authority on many critical \n     programs, including most recently the Space Based Infrared \n     Radar System, Airborne Laser, Joint Directed Attack \n     Munitions. The SSA chaired the source selection advisory \n     council for the Joint Strike Fighter, the Evolved Expendable \n     Launch Vehicle, and the Joint Air to Surface Stand-off \n     Missile. The SSA has an impeccable record of integrity and \n     objectivity.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank my colleague for his summary of the circumstance \nwith relation to Hill Air Force Base. I want to take my 5 minutes and \nrefer to the arguments made on the floor.\n  We have heard that the bill as currently constituted contains 32 \npages of anticompetitive language. I challenge that, Mr. President. I \nbelieve it contains 32 pages of rules by which the competition will \noccur.\n  Do we refer to rules as anticompetitive when they establish the \nframework in which a competition will happen? I will take a sports \nanalogy. Is it anticompetitive when there is a referee on the floor \nthat prevents one player from fouling another in a basketball game? If \nI have a team filled with very rough players, I consider that \nanticompetitive. But if the purpose of the game is something other than \nto beat each other up, but to score baskets in the form of the rules of \nthe game, the existence of the referee and, yes, the rule book which \nruns for more than 32 pages, in fact, enhances competition rather than \ncuts it down.\n  Mr. President, 32 pages of oversight language. I must report my own \nexperience with this issue. We have only one set of numbers before us \nas a Congress as to what happens with privatization in place, and those \nare the numbers that come from the GAO. The GAO says if you proceed \nwith privatization in place, it will cost the taxpayers over half a \nbillion. That is not right, says the Air Force, nowhere near, we will \nsave money with competition. I said, fine, give me the numbers. ``We \ndon't have any numbers. We just know we will save money.'' I had Sheila \nWidnall, the Secretary of the Air Force, in my office. I asked for \nnumbers. She refused to give me any and just said, ``We will save \nmoney. GAO is wrong.'' If GAO was wrong, give me specifics. No, the Air \nForce said, we won't give you specifics. Just trust us that they are \nwrong.\n  General Babbitt was put forward as the general who would command this \nactivity. I held up his nomination until he came to my office. I said, \n``General, you are undoubtedly qualified for this. I will let you go \nforward. But there is something I want from you before I will let you \ngo forward.'' He said, ``What is that?'' I said, ``I want you to agree \nto give us the numbers. If indeed you can improve that privatization-\nin-place will save taxpayers dollars, you ought to be able to prove \nthat with numbers rather than rhetoric. If you have those numbers I \nwant you to be willing to share them with the Congress.'' He looked at \nme and said, ``Why, of course, Senator, we will be happy to share those \nnumbers.'' I said, ``General, you are the first person in the Air Force \never to agree to do that.''\n  That is all we are asking for, a little sunshine here, not quite so \nmuch rhetoric and not so much ``trust me,'' a little sunshine, a little \noversight, a little understanding. So in these 32 pages that have been \nattacked, there are requirements that the Air Force tell the Congress \nhow much money they are spending, how much money, presumably, they are \nsaving and how they are following the rules, and then have those \nnumbers reviewed by the GAO.\n\n  Is this so anticompetitive, if you are saving the taxpayers millions \nor hundreds of millions of dollars, that you are willing to share the \ninformation? I don't think it is anticompetitive at all. I think, \nagain, it is like the rule book in a basketball game that says: These \nare the rules and there will be a referee to enforce them. The rules \nare fairly voluminous, but the end result of the rules is that you have \na game that works.\n  We have been told again and again, ``no, we believe in competition.'' \nI believe in competition. But I believe in competition in the open. I \nbelieve in competition where the information is available, particularly \nto the policymakers in the Congress.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that this bill passes. I hope the President \nsigns it because I think we can pass it by a\n\n[[Page S11836]]\n\nwide enough margin to send a veto-proof message to the White House, and \nI hope when it's over, we will then, by virtue of the language that has \nbeen added to the bill on the depot issue, as a Congress, be able to \nsee what is done, be able to understand what is done and, if at that \ntime they come back and say we would save the taxpayers this much \nmoney, and they get specific with numbers, I am perfectly willing to \nhave them spend that money on privatization in place. But I am not, Mr. \nPresident, willing to accept a ``trust me'' attitude, given the history \nof the Air Force's unwillingness to talk to us on this issue up to this \npoint.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, how much time remains of my 30 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want this record to reflect my \ndisappointment with the levels authorized in this bill for the National \nGuard.\n  Since the end of the cold war, we have undertaken the most massive \nrestructuring of our military forces since the end of World War II.\n  The cornerstone of these initiatives has been greater reliance on the \nNational Guard and Reserves to meet both day-to-day and major crisis \nmilitary requirements.\n  Sadly, the bill before the Senate retreats from, and does damage to, \nthe expanded role for the Guard.\n  This year, tens of thousands of Guard and Reserve personnel have been \ndeployed to Bosnia, Haiti, Southwest Asia, Central America, and Korea.\n  By the account of every regional commander in chief, they have \nperformed these duties with a level of professionalism and excellence \nindistinguishable from the Active Force. They are simply that good.\n  Their performance in the field merits the total support of the House \nand Senate.\n  The Guard and Reserve comprise 38 percent of the total force. \nHowever, funding for these components in this bill equates to only 8 \npercent of the total funding for the Department of Defense.\n  The cost of forces in the Guard and Reserve is less per capita--\nsignificantly less than the active components.\n  But 38 percent of the force deserves more than 8 percent of the \navailable funding. The Guard needs modern, new equipment. They need \ntraining--particularly flying hours and adequate maintenance money for \ntanks, trucks, and other vehicles.\n  They need ammunition and travel money. They need the funding to \ncontinue to be fully ready to deploy.\n  This bill does real damage to the force structure, readiness, and \nmorale of our National Guard.\n  Fortunately, the Defense appropriations bill passed by the Senate \nlast month does provide the increased funding for the Guard.\n  The Defense appropriations and military construction bills achieved a \nreal bipartisan consensus in support of the National Guard.\n  We carefully reviewed the needs identified by the National Guard and \nReserves.\n  We allocated funding to meet their most urgent personnel, readiness, \nand modernization priorities.\n  The National Guard and Reserves cannot be asked to take on more \nmissions, more deployments, and more responsibility without the support \nof Congress. This bill fails that test.\n  The levels authorized in this bill would require a 5,000 personnel \nreduction in the Army National Guard.\n  This bill authorizes $108 million less in the vital Army Guard \nOperation and maintenance account that was appropriated by the Congress \nand signed by the President for 1998.\n  This bill reduces funding for the Air National Guard by almost $14 \nmillion.\n  I regret that on the levels provided for the National Guard there are \nthese differences between the 1998 authorization and appropriations \nbills. I do not regret the actions we took in the appropriations bill, \nwhich provided greater support for the National Guard.\n  Even that was not enough. Our committee deserves to be criticized \nalso for not having provided even more. But this bill means we can't \nspend the money we have already appropriated.\n  There are other differences between our two bills--especially in the \nprocurement and research and development accounts.\n  Our committee worked hard to pass an appropriations bill early that \nincorporates the Department's and the Senate's priorities.\n  We attempted, as much as possible, to follow the authorization bill \nthat passed the Senate. When the Defense authorization bill undercuts \nthese accounts and programs, it causes great concern within the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  They will be asked by the Armed Services Committee not to spend the \nmoney as it was intended by the appropriations bill--and DoD cannot \nspend the money for items in this authorization bill for funds were not \nappropriated in the bills that were already passed.\n  The funding could has been allocated more effectively. This does not \nserve the institution well.\n  A further blow against the position taken by the Senate in support of \nthe National Guard was the rejection of the increased rank and role for \nthe next chief of the National Guard.\n  Forty-nine Senators cosponsored this effort on a total bipartisan \nbasis.\n  Instead, this conference report creates two new advisory positions \nfor the National Guard and Reserves.\n  The National Guard already has a chief and two very capable \ndirectors--it does not need additional advisers.\n  This legislation is, in fact, a step backward for the National Guard \nand Reserves, and they do not endorse or support this approach.\n  I want to assure the Senate, and our friends in the National Guard, \nthat we will be back next year--this matter is not closed, as far as \nthis Senator is concerned.\n  The men and women of the Armed Forces deserve, and should receive, \nthe pay raise funded in the Defense appropriations bill that is \nauthorized in this legislation. They must have that.\n  The military construction projects appropriated for 1998 will be \nstalled unless we pass the bill.\n  Incidentally, 38 of the projects in the military construction bill, \nline-itemed by the President, are in this bill. All 38 of them are \nauthorized by this bill, and the House will soon send us a bill to ask \nthe President to reconsider the line-item veto of each of those 38 \nprojects.\n  So, I am not asking the Senate to defeat the bill. I do urge others \nto speak up and to commit to readdress these significant Guard and \nReserve component issues next year.\n  It is with great regret, however, that I announce to the Senate I \nwill not vote for this conference report. It will be the first \nconference report on a Defense authorization bill that I have not voted \nfor in 29 years. I feel very strongly about this. That is why I want to \nmake it a matter of record. I don't intend to support an authorization \nbill again until we do address the problem of the readiness account and \nthe status of the National Guard in the defense structure.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, let me begin by congratulating the Senate \nArmed Services Committee for completing their work on the National \nDefense Authorization Act conference report for fiscal year 1998. \nNevertheless, I'm very disappointed that the conference committee was \nunable to agree on the amendment by Senator Stevens, and 49 of his \ncolleagues, to make the Director of the National Guard Bureau a four-\nstar general and a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  When I spoke before the Reserve Forces Policy Board back in \nSeptember, I began my speech talking about Union general, ``fighting \nPhil Sheridan.'' Sheridan didn't strike people as having the stature of \na war hero. He was a bit on the short side. Yet at the head of the \ncavalry, he was an invaluable leader, helping General Grant win many \nkey battles during the Civil War. His battlefield successes led Abraham \nLincoln to joke that at the beginning of the war he thought a cavalry \nman had to be 6'4\". ``But now,'' he said, ``I've seen 5'4\" will do \n``just fine'' in a pinch.\n  I tell that story because all too often the National Guard is being \ndismissed out of hand for being nothing more than ``weekend warriors.'' \nBut after seeing their work in international hot spots like Kuwait, \nSomalia, Bosnia, and Haiti, it's clear the Guard will do more than \n``just fine'' in a pinch.\n\n[[Page S11837]]\n\n  I think we all agree that as we enter the 21st century the common \ngoal of the U.S. military should be to create and maintain a seamless \ntotal force that provides our military leaders with the necessary \nflexibility and strength to address whatever conflicts that might \narise.\n  The QDR should have been the vehicle to achieve that goal. \nUnfortunately, it fell far short. And one analyst went so far as to \ndescribe it as ``another banal defense of the status quo.''\n  There are close to one-half million men and women in the National \nGuard, accounting for about 20 percent of this Nation's Armed Forces. \nBecause of their dual Federal-State mission, National Guardsmen and \nwomen are on hand to serve in both the international arena and in our \nown backyards. Perhaps more than any other soldier, Guardsmen embody \nour forefathers' vision of the citizen-soldier. That's because the \ncitizen-soldiers of the National Guard find their roots not only in the \nhistory of this country, but equally important, in the communities of \nthis country.\n  The Army National Guard alone provides more than 55 percent of the \nground combat forces, 45 percent of the combat support forces, and 25 \npercent of the Army's combat support units--all while using only 2 \npercent of the Department of Defense budget.\n  But if you look at the QDR process you would think the Guard has \noutlived its usefulness * * * that their cost-effectiveness, their \nflexibility, their readiness are all figments of this Senator's \nimagination.\n  Experts have called QDR a ``cold war relic,'' and I agree with them, \nespecially when it comes to the Army. Back in July, the Senate was \nforced to add $437 million to the Pentagon's budget request just to \nmeet the minimum spending needs of the Army National Guard.\n  While both the Marine Corps and the Air Force have successfully \nintegrated their reserve fighting units into their total combat force, \nthe Army continues to fail to include its National Guard combat troops \nin national military strategy. To this day, none of the Guard's eight \ncombat divisions is in the Nation's war plans, despite the fact that \nthey have undergone the same training as their active duty \ncounterparts.\n  This contentious relationship got even hotter, last spring when \nleaders of the National Guard expressed outrage at never being given \nthe opportunity to present their case before the QDR and over the \nArmy's failure to be up-front about how deeply they wanted to cut the \nArmy Guard.\n  The outrage was well placed. The Washington times was right on target \nwhen they wrote back in June that ``the Guard has a greater relevance \ntoday than during the cold war--exactly the kind of relevance the \nFounding Fathers envisioned when they elected to place the \npreponderance of the Nation's military strength in the State \nmilitias.''\n  As a classic dual use system the Guard is not a relic of the past, \nrather the wave of the future. That same article said, ``There is no \ninherent reason the Guard cannot perform adequately across the range of \nmissions. The Marine Corps and Air Force have demonstrated what can be \naccomplished when reserves are treated as assets, not rivals * * *. In \nshort, the Guard's proficiency is limited only by resources and \ncreativity--by a standing Army that, for reasons of its own, prefers \nnot to acknowledge it.''\n  This is not a new battle. And the QDR is just another symptom of a \ndysfunctional relationship that must change.\n  That's why I believe that after assuring the Reserve forces needs are \nmet in this year's budget. Our biggest priority was to make the Chief \nof the National Guard Bureau a four-star general and a member of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff. I was proud to cosponsor Senator Stevens \namendment to the Defense authorization bill doing just that.\n  As Senator Stevens said during debate on the amendment, this change \n``will help ensure that the National Guard's needs will be met during \nthe formulation of the Department's budget and not solely by the \ninterventions of Congress * * *. It has taken the intervention of \nCongress each year to get the Guard the money it needs to perform its \njob.'' The amendment would have gone a long way towards changing that \nstatus.\n  When you compare the National Guard with the U.S. Coast Guard, the \ninequity becomes even more clear. There are an average of 10,000 men \nand women deployed outside the continental United States by the \nNational Guard every day. And working with an annual budget of $10 \nbillion, the National Guard manages a tremendous amount of equipment \nand runs 3,360 facilities in 3,200 communities touching every State in \nthe Nation.\n  The Coast Guard, which also has a dual mission, runs an efficient, \ntight ship. At the head of that ship is a four-star admiral. But what \nis startling to me is that the Coast Guard is a fraction of the size, \nwith a fraction of the budget of the National Guard.\n  Look at the Marine Corps. Like the National Guard, they serve as a \nfree standing force, maintained under a parent service. Again, with a \nbudget and a troop strength smaller than the Guard, they are under the \nleadership of a four-star general, and have a seat on the Joint Chiefs. \nThose changes were made after the Marine Corps came before Congress \narguing that to be heard they needed a general's rank, not a colonel's, \nwhen dealing with the other services.\n  The Pentagon must recognize that the Reserve components are the only \ncontact the majority of Americans have with the military. When they see \na neighbor, a child's teacher, or their family doctor on hand when \nnatural disasters strike or representing the United States in the \ninternational arena, they have a direct link to the military.\n  That bond has remained strong for more than 200 years. And despite \nresistance from the Pentagon, I believe Congress has no intention of \nseeing that bond damaged through insufficient funds or a lack of \nresources.\n  But passage of Senator Stevens amendment in the Senate was a sign \nthat we're no longer willing to accept the status quo either. We \nbelieve it's a critical first step not only toward giving our citizen-\nsoldiers a seat at the decisionmaking table, but toward creating a \nTotal Force.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, the conference committee disagreed with \nthe Senate position of making the National Guard Director a four-star \ngeneral. Instead the conference ``split the baby'' by establishing what \nthey thought was a new position for the Army Guard and Army Reserve--\ntwo new two-star general positions serving as advisors to the Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  The problem with this decision is that the National Guard already has \nsuch a position within the Joint Chiefs of Staff. This new language \nwon't solve the problem faced by the National Guard. I hope my \ncolleagues on the Senate Armed Services Committee understand that the \nissue of a four-star position on the Joint Chiefs of Staff is not going \nto go away.\n  I'm also disturbed by the conference committee's decision to cut the \nNational Guard by 5,000 spaces without any corresponding cuts in the \nActive Duty Army or the Army Reserve. This cut for the National Guard \nisn't right and it isn't consistent with what we've done on the Defense \nappropriations bill. That bill, which was just signed by the President, \nfully funded the Army National Guard.\n  General Sheridan might have been on the short side, but when the \nsmoke cleared at the end of the battle, he sat very tall in his saddle. \nWhile detractors might refer disparagingly to our National Guard Forces \nas weekend warriors, I hope my colleagues will remember that at the end \nof the day, whether helping families return to their homes after a \ndevastating flood or flying in supplies to war torn countries, they \nstand just as tall.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, do I have any further time left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has about 14 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield 5 minutes to Senator Coverdell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Alaska for \nyielding time. It is with great pleasure and relief, I must say, that I \ncome to the floor to hail what I believe will be final passage of the \n1998 Defense authorization conference report. As many\n\n[[Page S11838]]\n\nof my colleagues know, this was not an easy process. This bill, of \nvital importance to our men and women in uniform, has sparked much \ncontroversy over the last several months.\n  My colleagues may remember my taking the floor, along with several of \nmy colleagues, this summer to denounce what we felt was a \npoliticization of the BRAC process by the President. At the time, I \nstated that we will not begin a new round of BRAC, as the \nadministration has called for, until the previous round's \nrecommendations have been carried out effectively. To my satisfaction, \na new round of BRAC has been averted and we have taken a step in the \nright direction toward restoring BRAC integrity.\n  The approach we have taken on military depot work in this bill is a \nwin for our Armed Forces and taxpayers. In this bill, we promote \nprivate-public competition, as my colleagues called for, while \nestablishing more objective criteria in making contract awards.\n  I would like to commend my colleagues on both sides of this issue for \nworking to develop a solution to the impasse we reached. Obviously, as \na Senator with a remaining air logistic center, I have a vested stake \nin the issue. While not a member of the Armed Services Committee, I \nvoiced my opinion strongly with my colleagues from California and Texas \nand have respected their position. It is unfortunate that we have not \nbeen able to reach an ultimate agreement on the issue, but we have come \nto our disagreement after much debate and consideration on both sides.\n  I point out to my colleagues, however, that it says a great deal \nabout a piece of legislation when the chairman, ranking member, and \nmajority and minority leaders all agree on the approach we have taken \nin this bill.\n  I would be remiss not to mention the tremendous contribution that our \nchairman, Senator Thurmond, has once again added to this process. He \nand his staff have worked tirelessly to develop this legislation and to \nwork for a compromise on the depot issue. I also want to thank my \ncolleagues from Utah and Oklahoma--particularly Senator Inhofe, who has \nworked equally as hard in trying to reach a compromise on the issue. \nThey are all to be commended.\n  Finally, I understand that there is an important pay raise provision \nin this bill for our armed services members. This is of great \nimportance because I think we have arrived at a good place, a solid \nplan. I encourage my colleagues to support it. Further, I call on the \nPresident to sign it as quickly as possible. We need to move on with \nthis bill and what I feel is correcting a fundamental flaw in the \nsystem.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I \nask unanimous consent that the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask our colleagues who want to speak to \ncome over and speak. It becomes a sort of curious game when people want \nto be heard, but they don't come over, and one side is forced to use up \nall of its time, or else see the time run off, when we would like to \nhave a debate. I wish those who wanted to debate would come over.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nMichigan.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that privilege of \nthe floor be granted to the following staff member of the Committee on \nForeign Relations: Mrs. Gina Abercrombie-Winstanley, a Pearson Fellow \ndetailee from the Department of State, during the pendency of this \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, one of the arguments that has been made is \nthat if this conference report is enacted that the private industry \nwill be reluctant to bid on the work of the closed depots. In fact, \nsome elements of industry had announced that they intended to bid on \nthe Kelly and McClellan work well before the compromise was even \nwritten. Most of the concerns raised by those groups relate either to \nfeatures of the current law that they don't like, or to features of the \ncompromise that the Department of Defense has accepted as fair and not \nsought to change.\n  We cannot just simply give the work to industry without any \ncompetition. We must have fair competition. That was the purpose of \nthese provisions in the bill. Those of us who wrote these provisions \nhave no depots at stake, and no issues at stake in our States. In fact, \nwe voted against the provision of the Depot Caucus in the conference \nbecause we thought it was one-sided. I voted against a similar \nprovision which was offered by Senators here during our deliberations \nin the Armed Services Committee. But those of us who have drafted the \nprovision in this final bill have intended and attempted--and we think \nsucceeded--in drafting a provision which will ensure fair and open \ncompetition. That is our goal. We don't want to tilt this one way or \nthe other.\n  We couldn't get the parties to reach an agreement. We waited months \nfor the parties to try to reach an agreement. We tried to negotiate an \nagreement that everybody would agree to. We couldn't get everybody to \nagree to any particular language. We never could reach an agreement.\n  Finally, those of us who had the responsibility of bringing a bill to \nthe floor, and getting a defense bill passed because of all the \ncritical provisions in here for our military people, decided we would \ndraft the best possible provision that we could that would guarantee \nopen and fair competition and would not tilt this one way or the other. \nWe have that responsibility, and we think we carried it out fairly.\n  One significant part of this compromise is a simple sentence which is \naimed at guaranteeing a level playing field for both sides. The \nsentence states:\n\n       No offeror may be given any preferential consideration for, \n     or in any way be limited to, performing the workload in-place \n     or at any other single location.\n\n  That sentence means exactly what it says. No preferential \nconsideration may be given to Kelly and McClellan, and no preferential \nconsideration may be given to the depots that remain open. They have to \ncompete on a level playing field.\n  That is what this compromise is all about. At one point the argument \nwas made that by prohibiting the Air Force from giving preferential \nconsideration to either side that we might somehow preclude them from \nconsidering real differences in cost or risk. I don't accept that \nargument. We consider legitimate differences in cost and risk in \nvirtually every competition. That is fair consideration--not \npreferential consideration. It is not preferential treatment to \nconsider differences in cost and risk any more than it is preferential \ntreatment to award a contract to the low bidder.\n  My staff has confirmed this with top procurement officials at the \nDepartment of Defense. Although we did not believe the concern to be \nwell-founded, the conferees decided to remove any question over the \ninterpretation of this language by clarifying in the statement of \nmanagers that the consideration of differences in cost or risk \nassociated with the location of performance is not preferential \nconsideration, and the managers' language states that consideration of \nsuch differences in cost and risk is not only permitted but it is \nexpected.\n\n  In short, we bent over backwards to address concerns about this \nproposed compromise. This is a fair compromise. It provides a level \nplaying field without preference to either side. And I hope that the \nSenate will act to put this issue behind us.\n  We also heard the statement that the requirement for the Department \nof Defense to ensure that the depots are operated as cost effectively \nas possible will have the effect of precluding any work from going to \nthe private sector. That statement is not accurate.\n  Nothing in the depot maintenance provisions requires that all the \nwork go to the depots, as has also been stated. Under these provisions, \nthe Secretary would retain broad discretion to\n\n[[Page S11839]]\n\ndetermine which workloads should be retained in public depots and which \nshould be subject to private-public competition.\n  First, the sentence in question is nothing more than a clarification \nof existing law which already requires the Department of Defense to:\n\n       . . . maintain a logistics capability, including personnel, \n     equipment, and facilities to ensure . . .\n\n  That word is in existing law.\n\n       . . . a ready and controlled source of technical competence \n     and resources for contingency situations.\n\n  And prohibits the contracting out of any logistics activity \nidentified by the Secretary as necessary to maintain that logistics \ncapability.\n  Second, this sentence applies only to workloads that the Secretary of \nDefense determines to be necessary to maintain core logistics \ncapability. Under current law, the Secretary gets to decide what \ncapabilities are core logistics capability. And the Secretary gets to \ndecide what workloads are necessary to maintain those capabilities.\n  Third, the Secretary of Defense--not the Congress--gets to decide \nwhat is cost efficient and how much workload is necessary to ensure \ncost efficiency. The statement of managers expressly states that this \nprovision does not require the performance of all core logistics \nworkload in public depots.\n  This is what the statement of managers says:\n\n       The provision does not require that maintenance for all \n     weapons systems necessary for the execution of DOD's \n     strategic and contingency plans be performed at public \n     facilities.\n\n  In short, it is the Secretary--not the Congress nor the depot caucus. \nIt is the Secretary who gets to decide what functions will be performed \nin-house under this provision.\n  On the basis of extensive consultation with the Department of Defense \nofficials, starting last spring, we are convinced that the depot \nmaintenance provisions in the bill are consistent with the Department's \ncurrent policy and practice on core logistics capability, and will not \nrequire the Secretary to bring in-house any work currently performed by \nprivate contractors.\n  In fact, the Department of Defense has informed us that on the basis \nof the bill's change from 60-40 to 50-50 they expect to be able to \ncontract out slightly more work than they can under current law.\n  The main argument that is being made here is that somehow or other \nthis bill prevents real competition. I assure our colleagues that this \nbill not only intends to guarantee fair competition, but is the best \neffort that we know how to make--those of us that have no stake in the \noutcome of this debate--this is the best effort that we can make to \nobjectively and fairly come up with provisions which will guarantee and \nensure as fair and open a competition as possible.\n  Far from prohibiting public-private competition, these provisions \nmandate competition for depot maintenance work, and require that all \nqualified public and private sector offerors be permitted to compete.\n  The provisions establish seven simple conditions to ensure that this \ncompetition is carried out on a level playing field. Again, I emphasize \nthese provisions were written by Members and staff who are neutral in \nthe fight between the closed bases and the remaining Air Force depots. \nThe sole objective here is to ensure fair competition. And each of the \nprovisions was included for that purpose alone--a level playing field \nfor competition by ensuring that appropriate factors are considered in \na balanced manner. The bill expressly prohibits the Department from \ngiving any preferential treatment to either the closed depots or the \nremaining ALCs.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I reserve the remainder of that time.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I inquire of the chairman of the committee \nhow much time he can yield.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to Senator Coats.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for yielding this \ntime. I rise to urge my colleagues to support the vote coming up here \non the Defense Authorization Act. I congratulate Senator Thurmond and \nSenator Levin for their leadership on this issue. We have continued a \nbipartisan effort in the Senate Armed Services Committee for addressing \nthe key issues facing our national security policy.\n  It has been a contentious and difficult process this year, but one, \nnevertheless, that has gone ahead, and we are here today just a few \nmoments away from voting on this and sending it to the President.\n  It is important to note that we have reached support in the Senate \nArmed Services Committee; all 18 members of the committee have signed \nthe conference report and, most importantly, we have been able to \naddress some of the most difficult issues in a way that I think, while \nnot perfect and while not the solution to everybody's concerns, clearly \nmoves us in the right direction.\n  Senator Levin and others have talked about the depot provisions. I \nappreciate how difficult it has been and the very strong views of \nSenators on both sides of the aisle on these provisions.\n  Earlier, I opposed the depot provisions which were originally \nrecommended by the readiness panel because they explicitly precluded \ncompetition for the resolution of the Kelly and McClellan Air Logistics \nCenters issue. We went back to work --a number of people spent a great \ndeal of time and effort trying to find a way in which we could develop \na substantive set of provisions that would promote competition, and I \nsaid that if we could do that, I would support it.\n  Now, if I were drafting this legislation, I would have gone much \nfurther than we have been able to go. I think, clearly, if we can't \nmove further faster on privatization efforts, we are going to continue \nto face shortfalls in modernization, shortfalls in research and \ndevelopment, and in other vital areas for the military.\n  This, I believe, is the best we are able to do at this particular \ntime given the polarization on this issue between members on the Depot \nCaucus and those who were promoting greater competition. We have been \nable to move the percentages from 60-40 to 50-50. I know that 50-50 is \nnot defined in the way all of us would like, but it is a step in the \nright direction. Hopefully, it will open the way for further discussion \nand determination of what core capacity we need to retain within the \nservices and how we can also move toward privatizing maintenance in a \nway that saves the Department money.\n  It will also, hopefully, open the door to another round of BRAC \nclosings. There should not be any disagreement that we still have too \nmuch infrastructure given the size of our force. It is aging \ninfrastructure. It is costly infrastructure. Unless we can find ways to \nclose that infrastructure, and modernize and streamline the way in \nwhich we provide for our national defense, we are going to continually \nface a shortfall of funds, particularly given the fact that we have a \nfixed top line, as stated in the budget agreement.\n  One of the provisions of the depot compromise involves an initiative \nthat was suggested to us by the Business Executives for National \nSecurity Tail-to-Tooth Commission, the so-called BENS Commission. It's \nprivate partnerships within the public sector. This commission is made \nup of people from both parties, former Members of the Senate and \nCabinet, leaders of industry and retired members of the Joint Chiefs. \nAnd their insights, I believe, ought to be given significant attention.\n  Let me just quote from one of the sections of the bill which \nincorporated one of their suggestions. Section 359 of the depot \nprovisions is titled, ``Requirement for Use of Competitive Procedures \nin Contracting for Performance of Depot-Level Maintenance and Repair \nWorkloads Formerly Performed at Closed or Realigned Military \nInstallations.''\n  And this provision states, and I quote:\n\n       Any offeror, whether public or private, may offer to \n     perform the workload at any location or locations selected by \n     the offeror and to team with any other public or private \n     entity to perform that workload at one or more locations.\n\n  This provision enables the Department of Defense to leverage the core \ncompetencies of our public-sector depots with those of private industry \nin\n\n[[Page S11840]]\n\nbuilding the most effective and the most efficient team for maintaining \nour military's equipment, and it does so in a way that keeps \ncompetitive pressures on both the private and the public sector that \nwill ensure that the Pentagon and the U.S. taxpayer continue to get the \nbest value for their defense dollar.\n  The Pentagon has indicated that this is a workable approach to \nresolving the highly charged issues surrounding Kelly and McClellan Air \nLogistics Centers. I know there is not agreement on that point, but my \nanalysis of this is that it moves us significantly in the right \ndirection. And given the dynamics of the political considerations that \nwe are facing, it is the best we can do this year. We are not going to \nget a bill without this. I trust the administration will think long and \nhard before they consider a veto over this provision. I do not believe \nwe are going to be able to go back and adjust it one way or the other \nin any significant measure without creating a loss of support on one \nside or the other, depending on which way we go.\n  So I urge the administration to understand the process that we have \nbeen through, where we started and where we now are and take this as a \nsignificant incremental step in the necessary effort to move toward \nprivatization.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to briefly talk about some things \nthat we have done in my role as chairman of the Airland Subcommittee. \nFirst, the national Defense authorization supports the Army's Force XXI \ninitiatives which significantly enhances the situational awareness and \ncombat effectiveness of our land forces through information technology. \nYet, we need to do much more to get the spectrum of digitization \nefforts, which were so strongly endorsed by the Pentagon's Quadrennial \nDefense Review, adequately funded. But at least this is a fair start.\n  And for the record, I wish to correct a statement reported in press \nthis morning that the first flight of the second Comanche armed \nreconnaissance helicopter would be delayed because of a 2.75 percent \ntax levied on acquisition programs in the fiscal year 1998 Defense \nauthorization bill, which we are voting on today. I want to emphasize \nthat this Defense Authorization fully funds the Comanche program at the \nlevel requested in the President's Budget, and that it does not include \na tax. The tax reported in this article was levied in appropriation, \nnot authorization, legislation.\n  We have been able to incorporate in this bill a significant \nenhancement in the military's tactical and operational mobility through \nincreases in tactical trucks, the establishment of multiyear \nprocurement for the family of medium tactical vehicles, and increases \nin V-22 procurement. We have also added increases for tactical air and \nmissile defense capabilities.\n  Specifically, however, I want to talk about the F-22. I spoke at \nlength about my concerns with F-22 cost overruns and technology risks \nduring our deliberations over Defense appropriations. This national \nDefense authorization provides the same F-22 funding levels, but goes \nthe very important further step to put key oversight provisions in \nplace that will help Congress and the Administration keep this program \non track.\n\n  First, this Defense Authorization includes the Senate's total cost \ncap provisions which limit the level of engineering and manufacturing \ndevelopment to approximately $18.7 billion and production to $43.3 \nbillion.\n  Second, the Defense authorization requires an annual review of the F-\n22 program by the General Accounting Office. This report will address \nwhether the F-22 EMD program is meeting established goals in \nperformance, cost, and schedule; and whether the F-22 program is \nconsistent with the cost caps we have established. The Comptroller \nGeneral also must certify to Congress that he has had access to \nsufficient information to make informed judgments on the matters \ncovered by the reports. This seriesof annual reviews will provide us a \nvisibility into the F-22 program which we have not had to date. And it \nwill also provide a means of independent assessment on the spending and \ntechnical performance of the program so that this body can effectively \ncontinue its long history of oversight on the key F-22 program.\n  In conclusion, this national Defense authorization makes great \nstrides in supporting the defense strategy of shape, respond, and \nprepare now. It provides significant increases in our readiness \naccounts by adding over $750 million to address shortfalls in flying \nhours, real property maintenance, and ammunition procurement.\n  It also takes better care of our military servicemembers and their \nquality of life through a 2.8 percent pay raise and a reformed approach \nto quarters allowances.\n  And it accelerates investment to address shortfalls in key mission \ncapabilities such as adding over $700 million for theater and missile \ndefense programs.\n  Finally, this national Defense authorization provides a reasonable \ncompromise to the depot issue through a fair and open competition which \nserves the best interests of the military and the American taxpayer.\n  In short, this bill provides the policy and fiscal provisions \nrepresentative of the prudent oversight from our Senate authorization \nprocess. It provides a framework for setting a course which ensures \nU.S. military dominance into the 21st Century.\n  This National Defense Authorization has my full support, and I urge \nmy colleagues to support us when the vote comes forward in just a few \nmoments.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I commend the able Senator from Indiana for his \nremarks, which are very helpful, and also commend the Senator for the \ngreat work he has done on the Armed Services Committee for many years. \nWe are very proud of the Senator, and we are going to miss him when he \nleaves the Senate next year. We hope the Senator will reconsider and \ncome back with us.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the chairman for his kind remarks.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield the remaining time we have to \nSenator Roberts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, might I inquire as to the amount of time \nthat is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes 50 seconds.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Defense authorization \nbill. I wish to thank and pay tribute to the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan, Mr. Levin, and obviously to our chairman, the distinguished \nSenator from South Carolina, for his long record of support and \nleadership for our men and women in uniform is almost unequaled in the \nhistory of the Senate.\n\n  Some of my colleagues are opposing passage of this important bill for \nreasons I know they are committed to, and they certainly feel they are \ntaking action in the best interests of their constituents. But I feel \nstrongly we must as a body demonstrate unity and support for our \nmilitary by passing this bill.\n  Yesterday, we were briefed on the serious events in the Mideast, in \nparticular in Iraq. The day before, several Members of Congress met \nwith the President to discuss the U.S. military commitment of lasting \npeace in Bosnia. Early next year this body will debate the enlargement \nof NATO and the implication of extending the military security of NATO. \nWe all watched with great interest the developments on the Korean \npeninsula. That is a very dangerous place.\n  We are at peace, but we all understand this is a fragile peace. \nCongress is charged with the responsibility to raise and support \narmies, and in this troubled time we cannot forget that is our \nresponsibility.\n  We have all heard of the morale problems and the difficulty in \nretaining key leaders in the military. We all understand the long and \nfrequent deployments we ask our men and women to make are taking a \nterrible toll on their families. We all understand we rely on these \ndedicated and patriotic Americans to be the instruments of our national \npolicy. We should not hold this bill hostage because of internal \ndifferences between Members of this Congress. I feel it would be a \nterrible signal to send to the men and women of the military that we \nare so egocentric and so parochial that we are unable to provide a bill \nto provide a pay raise or quality housing.\n\n[[Page S11841]]\n\n  Let me highlight some of the important aspects of the bill I feel \nstrongly about.\n  Active duty pay raise. The bill includes a 2.8 percent pay raise for \nactive duty military members. If the bill is not enacted, the pay raise \nfor active military will be limited to 2.3 percent because of the \nstatutory link between pay raises for the military and pay raises for \nFederal civilians.\n  Active duty end strength. The bill, compared to current law, provides \nlower end-strength levels and increased flexibility for the managing of \nmilitary personnel strengths. If this bill is not enacted, the military \nservices will be held to the higher fiscal year 1997 end-strength \nlevels that were based on the Bottom Up Review.\n  Special pay and bonuses. The bill includes authority for significant \nincreases in the special pay and bonus structure designed to respond to \ncritical recruiting and retention problems highlighted by DOD.\n  If the bill is not enacted, these authorities will not be available \nto DOD to address these problems. Specific groups that would be \naffected include--listen to this--aviators, nuclear-qualified officers, \ndentists, military members on overseas tours, military members \nreceiving family separation allowances and/or hazardous duty assignment \npay, and also the military members serving on hardship-duty locations.\n  Reform of housing and substance allowances. This bill includes \nsignificant reforms of the existing structure for housing allowances \nand subsistence allowances for military members. These reforms are \nintended to simplify the management of these allowances and to better \ntarget the allowances to those individuals and geographic areas where \nthe need is most acute. If the bill is not enacted, the Department of \nDefense will continue to use the existing allowance structure with all \nof its demonstrated inefficiencies and also inequities.\n  Military construction projects? The bill provides authority for the \nDepartment of Defense to begin construction on the fiscal year 1998 \nmilitary construction projects. If the bill is not enacted, that \nconstruction cannot begin.\n  Mr. President, my fellow colleagues, there are many other examples of \nwhy this bill must be supported now. Despite the differences we have in \nour ranks, I think this is a fair and credible bill, the best bill \npossible. The Members of both Houses worked hard to reach compromise. \nIt was a very difficult task, but when the work was done the Members of \nboth committees--the House side and Senate side--were satisfied with \nthe results. The system worked the way it was designed. Now the Senate \nshould act on the bill. I urge the Senate to pass on the bill.\n  One thing about a Presidential veto. Tuesday night we were with the \nPresident, 40, 50 Members. Senator Thurmond rose to his feet and said \nthat our policy in Bosnia cannot be separated from this bill. It is \ninseparable. And that if we pass this bill, it will be commensurate \nwith our goals in Bosnia and with our vital national security \ninterests. And he pleaded with the President, eloquently, with fervent \npassion. He said: Mr. President, do not veto this bill. And I will tell \neverybody here, the President has not made his mind up. He looked at \nthe Senator and said he would consider his remarks.\n  The Department of Defense will agree with this bill. I do not think \nthe President will veto it. We need to pass the bill. We need to do \nwhat is right, and our first obligation as Members of this Congress is \nto do everything we can for our national defense.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I commend Senator Roberts for his \nexcellent remarks on this subject. He is a new member of the Armed \nServices Committee, and he has done a magnificent job. As chairman, I \nwant to let him know that we appreciate all he has done for defense \nsince he has been on that committee.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Chairman.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, how much time do we have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 6 minutes, the \nSenator from Alaska has 8 minutes, the Senator from Texas has 8 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nat this point to assign 3 of my 6 minutes to Senator Thurmond so we can \nfinish up with 3 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and \nthat it be charged equally to each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I ask unanimous consent the remaining time not be \ncharged to Senator Levin or to me.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I don't want \nto object but I am here ready to debate. I am waiting for people who \nwant to defend this bill to come to the floor to speak. What we are \ndoing is we are running off time that I have to debate because people \ndon't want to come over here and debate. If I knew they weren't coming, \nI could close out, make about 2 or 3 minutes of statements, and we \ncould vote. Our colleagues are ready to vote.\n  Let me ask unanimous consent that we might conclude this debate, that \nwe might have 3 minutes for each person holding time to conclude, and \nthat we might then have a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state it.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I was not here when the senior Senator from Texas made \nhis unanimous-consent request. I ask if that would in any way vitiate \nthe time that was given, remaining for the Senator from Alaska, Senator \nStevens?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It reduces it from 8 minutes to 3 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, now that the \nSenator is here, if he wants to be heard--what I was trying to do was \ngo on and vote if nobody wanted to debate. But if the Senator wants to \nspeak, let me ask unanimous consent that we return to the status quo \nante, before my unanimous-consent request, so that the Senator can \nspeak if he chooses to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the time \nremaining for Senator Stevens has been given to me, which is \napproximately 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is unfortunate, since we have a bill \nthat is the most significant bill that we will be dealing with during \nthe course of this year, that it has gotten bogged down into a debate \nand discussion about depot maintenance. This is very unfortunate. \nHowever that has been the case.\n  Let me just devote a little bit of time to that, because, having \nlistened to the arguments as put forth by the two eloquent Senators \nfrom California and the Senators from Texas, I didn't hear any new \narguments. But I do think that we need to, once and for all, respond to \nthese arguments. I was hoping to be speaking last because I know what \nwill happen, since I am obviously not speaking last. But let me just go \nahead and bring up four arguments that I heard. I think these four are \npretty much the total argument of those who want to stop competition in \nALC's.\n  First of all, I heard the quote saying, ``We are telling the DOD that \nyou can't have real competition.'' This bill does allow competition. \nThis allows competition and takes into consideration all direct and \nindirect costs.\n  They said that ``The bill was crafted by Members seeking special \nprotection, whose sole purpose is to block private competition.'' I \nsuggest that everyone in this Chamber knows, and certainly everyone on \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee knows, that when we had our \nlanguage in there that did clearly carry out the intent and the letter \nof the BRAC recommendations, we felt we were going to lose the bill \nbecause the\n\n[[Page S11842]]\n\ntwo Senators from both Texas and California wanted an opportunity to \nprivatize in place. Then we agreed to have open competition.\n  I was not even in on that. The ones who agreed to that language--that \nwas drafted by members of the committee who were totally neutral on \nthis subject. They didn't have a dog in this fight. But they got \ntogether and came up with the agreement that this is the way to do it. \nLet's take all costs into consideration. We did that. I think the \neloquent remarks of Senator Levin pointed this out.\n  They were the ones who put this together so that, yes, even though \nthis is not what the BRAC committee wanted, still it did open up an \navenue for privatization-in-place if they took into consideration all \nthe costs. And then they voted and it was 18-to-nothing, all Democrats \nand all Republicans voted for it.\n  Closely related to that, I have been quoted as to a statement that I \nmade in Oklahoma. Let me say that is an accurate statement. That is \ntrue. I wasn't misquoted. And I was stating it as a businessman. I \nspent 33 years in the real world and I know, as Senator Bennett has \npointed out several times, that you can't operate and leave three out \nof five ALC's at 50 percent capacity and have any kind of competitive \noperation.\n  So I said very definitely that, in my opinion, those individuals who \nwere interested in competing in McClellan in California and in Kelly in \nTexas, wanted to compete on a basis where they had a tremendous \nadvantage which is paid for by the taxpayers.\n  So they did two things. They put two considerations in. First of all, \nif they want to bid and privatize in place and bid at Kelly or \nMcClellan, they had to pay for a fair value for that facility they are \nusing. In other words, you can't take a $200 million facility and give \nit to a private contractor for a dollar a year and say now that's fair \ncompetition. That is not fair competition.\n  The second thing we did was say, according to the GAO--and this has \nbeen pointed out already by several Members here--that if you leave \nthree air logistics centers operating at 50 percent capacity, the cost \nannually to the taxpayers is $468 million. So that has to be \nconsidered.\n  Those are the two major changes that were made. I agree I think they \ndid a good job coming up with these. Even though that would still \nviolate the intent of the BRAC system, that at least made that fair.\n  There is one last thing I will say and then I will put this to rest. \nI am not going to say anything more about this. I am going to read this \none more time, because I think it is really significant.\n  I came to the U.S. House of Representatives, before I was elected to \nthis body, in 1986. That was a year that a Congressman--I might add, \nand say to the senior Senator from Texas, he also is a Ph.D. He got his \nfrom Oklahoma, you got yours from Texas--he came out with an idea how \nwe can close the excess capacity, the infrastructure, and do it without \npolitical interference. So he came up with the idea of the BRAC \ncommittee. The BRAC committee was supposed to be free from political \ninterference.\n  I hope every Member who is watching on their tube right now, anyone \nwho is going to come down here and vote on this, will listen to this. \nThis is what Representative Dick Armey, the author of the BRAC process, \nsaid on June 23, 1997:\n\n       We had three rounds of base closing, and we are all very \n     proud of the process because politics never intruded into the \n     process. That ended in round four. And all of my colleagues \n     knew at the time, and we know now, that the special \n     conditions for McClellan and Kelly, California and my own \n     State of Texas, where you might think I have a parochial \n     interest, were in a political invention.\n       We talk about this being privatization. No, it is not. It \n     is a new concept. It is privatization in place, created \n     specifically for these two bases in an election year for no \n     purpose other than politics.\n\n  With that, Mr. President, I think we beat up that issue. We have \nargued and debated this hours and hours on the floor. I know Senators \nfrom Texas and California would like to have an opportunity to have \nmore jobs in their States, but that is exactly what the BRAC process \nwas put in place to prevent.\n  In the remaining time, let me just make a couple of comments. I am \nthe chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee, and I can tell you right \nnow, during this process it was very civil, in our Senate Armed \nServices Committee, but we didn't agree on everything.\n  Quite frankly, I agreed with the Senator from Alaska as far as the \nNational Guard was concerned. I did not agree with Senator Levin, the \nranking minority member, as far as the B-2 was concerned, but we voted \non it. I lost and they won. So we went through this very arduous \nprocess and successfully came up with a bill.\n  In the meantime, I have been spending my time as chairman of the \nReadiness Subcommittee all over America and all over the world going to \nour various installations. I can tell you right now, we have a very \nserious problem in defending America. We can't do it.\n  As pointed out by the Senator from Connecticut, for 13 consecutive \nyears, we have reduced every year our defense budget at a time when \nmost people realize, finally, that we have a greater threat facing \nAmerica than we have had since World War II. Yet, we are at one-half \nthe force strength that we were in 1991. I am talking about the number \nof Army divisions, the number of Air Force wings, the number of ships \nfloating out there.\n  So it is a very critical thing, and it is exacerbated by the fact \nthat we have troops in places like Bosnia. It is very, very expensive. \nThe President said it wouldn't be over $2 billion. It is now looking at \ncloser to $6.5 billion to $8 billion. Where does that come from? It \ncomes from the defense budget.\n  While this is not a perfect product--can I have 1 more minute from \nthe Senator from South Carolina?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from South Carolina yield?\n  Mr. THURMOND. We don't have any more time.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator have 1 additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the senior Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. President, I will only conclude we do have a very serious problem \nin talking to the troops out there about tempo. We have these guys \noperating at about 60 percent higher capacity than they are supposed to \nbe operating. Sure, they can handle it for a while, but the divorce \nrate is up, the retention rate is down, and we have a serious problem \nin our underfunding of our military.\n  I would like to have done a better job than we did in this bill, but \nthis was the best we could do in the spirit of compromise on a \nbipartisan basis. I strongly support the passage of our Defense \nauthorization bill. Thank you.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I commend the able Senator from Oklahoma \nfor his excellent remarks. He is a member of the Armed Services \nCommittee and does a fine job. I want to take this opportunity to thank \nhim for the great service he is rendering on the Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we are coming to the end of the debate. I \nwill conclude by making just a couple of points.\n  I first thank the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, Senator Thurmond. I am always unhappy when I am not on his \nside. I don't think I need to tell the Senator from South Carolina \nabout the high esteem in which I hold him.\n  Let me also say to my dear colleague from Oklahoma that there is \nnothing personal about this battle. It really comes down to principles \nand where you stand on those key issues. I don't question that everyone \ninvolved in this debate is trying to do the best and that their \nintentions are good.\n  Let me conclude with the following points. First of all, a great deal \nhas been made about what the President and what the White House and \nwhat the Defense Department have said. So let me let the President and \nthe White House speak for themselves. I sent a letter to the desk and \nasked that it be printed in the Record 9 days ago after this conference \nreport had been written. I just want to read three paragraphs from the \nletter. I think anybody\n\n[[Page S11843]]\n\nwho listens to these three paragraphs can be in no doubt as to what the \nposition of the White House and the President is on this bill. I am \nreading from a letter from the Executive Office of the President dated \nOctober 28:\n\n       This bill includes provisions whose intent is to protect \n     public depots by limiting private industries' ability to \n     compete for the depot maintenance of military systems and \n     components. If enacted, these provisions, which run counter \n     to the ongoing efforts by Congress and the administration to \n     use competition to improve DOD business practices, would \n     severely limit the Department's flexibility to increase \n     efficiency and save taxpayer dollars. We need to encourage \n     more competition from private industry, not less. Billions of \n     dollars in potential savings are at issue. These resources \n     should be used to maintain the U.S. fighting edge not to \n     preserve excess infrastructure. If the numerous problems \n     cited above cannot be overcome, the impact on the \n     Department's costs and on our Nation's military capacity \n     would be profound. The President's senior advisers would \n     recommend that he veto the bill.\n\n  That is not me talking, that is the Executive Office of the \nPresident. I think that defines the issue and where they stand.\n  Our colleague from Utah talked about a GAO study. We have heard this \nGAO study discussed over and over and over again in this debate. It is \na typical problem of where a study is directed to look at one thing, \nand then we all talk about it as if it concluded another. Let me read \nyou one sentence from the GAO study and then put this issue, hopefully, \nto rest forever. The GAO study says:\n\n       The Air Force's planning has not progressed far enough to \n     support a precise comparison of the cost of privatizing depot \n     workloads in place with a cost of transferring the work to \n     other underutilized depots.\n\n  So what the GAO study concludes is something with which I completely \nagree. That is if the choice is between maintaining five depots or \nthree, it is better to maintain three. That is what the GAO study is \nabout. Nobody disputes what it is about. But what it is not about is \nany conclusion that funds can be saved by consolidating into a depot as \ncompared to having price competition.\n  So the GAO study is relevant for a point that we all agree on, which \nis why we are closing two depots. But it is completely irrelevant to \nthe issue of whether we should have price competition.\n  I hope and believe the President will veto this bill. Then the \nquestion is, what do we do about it? Let me conclude on a positive note \nby making a suggestion as to how we can simply solve the problem.\n  We all say we are for competition. It reminds me of one of Abraham \nLincoln's speeches where he talked about how the Confederates and the \nUnion supporters all prayed to the same God; they both felt they were \nin the right; they both felt God was on their side, but one of them had \nto be wrong.\n  We all say we are for competition, but, obviously, we have great \ndifferences as to what that is. Let me remind my colleagues that I \noffered to try to break this logjam with a definition of competition \nthat would have given a 10-percent premium for depot work. In other \nwords, I offered that if depots could do it for only 10 percent more \nthan the private sector, that we would let them do it. But if the \nprivate sector could go do it and save more than 10 percent, that they \nwould do it. So let me remind my colleagues that I have not been \nunwilling to try to find a solution. But let me propose one that is \nvery simple.\n  We now have five major accounting firms in America. We used to have \nsix, but two of them consolidated. If the President vetoes this bill \nand if that veto stands, either we don't vote on it in February when we \ncome back or we sustain it, I propose that we ask each of the five \nmajor accounting firms who, in language the people understand, don't \nhave a dog in this fight, to each appoint one of their major partners \nand let them form a commission. Let them define what a level playing \nsurface is in competition between Government depots and the private \nsector. Let them look at all costs from retirement to capital. Let the \nfive accounting firms come up with what they believe is a free and fair \ncompetition, and then let's agree that whatever they decide is a free \nand fair competition, whatever they say is a level playing surface, \nthen let's agree to accept it. I, for one, agree to accept it. Whatever \nthe five major accounting firms in the Nation conclude is a fair way to \nhave price competition, I am for it.\n\n  My proposal is, if the bill is vetoed, we change it very simply by \ntaking out this anticompetitive language, set up a simple commission \nmade up of the representatives of the five major private accounting \nfirms in America, and let them tell us how to have a fair competition. \nWe will give them 6 months to do it. Whatever they conclude becomes the \npractice of the Defense Department, and we have this competition.\n  That is a simple way to solve this problem, and we have been fighting \nover this issue for 3 long years. I submit that I hope this will \nhappen. The President has said that he will veto the bill; that the \nbill, as it is now written, despite the best intentions of many, will \ncost the taxpayers billions of dollars that will not go to weapons, \nthat will not go to maintenance, that will not go to pay and benefits, \nbut instead will go to preserve the status quo and to prevent \ncompetition.\n  We need competition. We all agree we don't have enough money. We can \nget more use of our money through competition. I urge my colleagues, if \nyou are concerned about these things, to join us in voting ``no.'' I \nurge the President to deliver on the veto so that we can end this \ndebate and have price competition. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, let us be clear about the letter \nthat was printed in the Record. That letter is not a statement of the \nPresident. That was what the senior advisers said they would do if \ncertain problems cannot be solved. We think those problems have been \nsolved in this bill. They can be solved in the implementation of this \nbill.\n  One of the arguments, just to give you an example, that the opponents \nof this bill made, is that the provision authorizing teaming agreements \nbetween public depots and private contractors is anticompetitive. We \nasked the Defense Department when they were up in front of us as to \nwhether or not they were anticompetitive. And here I am going to read \nthe specific question of Senator Kempthorne:\n\n       Do you believe that allowing public depots and private \n     enterprise to team together to bid on these workloads is \n     anticompetitive? And, if so, would you explain why.\n\n  We have heard this morning, and we heard before that the teaming \nprovision is one of the so-called anticompetitive provisions in this \nbill. What does the Defense Department have to say about that? Their \ncurrent Deputy General Counsel, Mr. Peters, who was before the Armed \nServices Committee the other day, when asked that question by Senator \nKempthorne said the following:\n\n       Senator Kempthorne, I do not believe and I do not believe \n     the Department feels that that provision is anticompetitive. \n     We certainly do not feel it is anticompetitive.\n\n  This bill has been stymied for months over one provision. We need a \ndefense authorization bill for many, many reasons. There are provisions \nin here that are critically important to the well-being of the men and \nwomen in the military. When the parties who have a direct interest in \nthis dispute could not resolve this dispute in a way satisfactory to \nall of them, Senator Thurmond and I decided that we would get our \nstaffs working and do the very best we could to have a fair and open \ncompetition provision.\n  That is what we have accomplished. There is not one senior defense \nofficial who is on record as saying that this provision does not \nprovide for a fair and open competition. It is not the Defense \nDepartment that has gone on record as saying that this is not a \nworkable provision to create a fair and open competition. Not one \nsenior official in the Defense Department has so stated on the record.\n\n  May I say, I have had a number of off-the-record conversations with \nmembers of the Defense Department which lead me to conclude that this \nis a very workable provision, indeed.\n  Mr. President, the President has not said he will veto this bill. I \ndon't believe he has decided what to do. I hope that when he weighs the \npros and cons in this bill that he will sign this bill. It is important \nto the uniformed military. It is important to the security of this \nNation.\n\n[[Page S11844]]\n\n  I want to close by thanking my good friend, Chairman Thurmond, and \nhis staff. He and our staffs have worked together, very, very well \ntogether, throughout the consideration of this bill.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, as we close this debate, I take this \nopportunity to commend Senator Levin for the magnificent work he has \ndone on this bill. He is a man of integrity, ability and dedication. It \nis a great asset to have him on the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\n  Mr. President, there are a few obvious reasons for Americans to focus \non the defense of the United States. While there is no longer a \nsuperpower threatening to dominate us, threats still abound. Events in \nIraq this week demonstrate that America must be prepared to protect her \ninterests at a moment's notice. Other nations that might pose threats \nincludes Iran, North Korea, and Libya.\n  Mr. President, this bill is important to the young men and women who \nserve in our military forces. This bill includes pay raises and \nincreases to special incentive pay, including vital aviator bonuses. \nProvisions in this bill affect every aspect of our national defense, \nincluding quality-of-life initiatives, modernization, and readiness. I \nremind all Senators that all military construction projects require an \nauthorization as well as an appropriation and cannot be executed \nwithout this bill.\n  Mr. President, I want to remind the Senate that all 18 members of the \nArmed Services Committee support this bill--10 Republicans and 8 \nDemocrats--every one of them support this bill. The House has already \npassed this by a veto-proof majority of 286 to 123. The leaders of the \nDefense Department have indicated that they can make this compromise \nwork and that they need this bill passed. It is hard for me to believe \nthat any Senator would oppose and delay the entire Defense \nauthorization bill at a time when American troops are deployed in \nBosnia and serious trouble appears to be brewing again in Iraq.\n  I strongly encourage all Senators to vote for this bill. We must send \na strong signal to the White House to demonstrate to the President that \nthis bill, which is so important to our national security, should be \nsigned. We must show the young men and women in uniform serving our \nNation around the world that their services are appreciated and that we \nare backing them up.\n  Mr. President, I am a strong supporter of the Guard and Reserves. The \nNational Guard of South Carolina is a magnificent guard, and we \nappreciate what they have done. And in the whole Nation, the National \nGuard is so valuable. I happen to have served in the Reserves myself \nfor over 36 years. I appreciate the reservists and commend all of them \nfor voluntarily serving their country. They have to carry on their \ncivilian duties, but they do this extra work.\n  I want to say, too, to the Members of this Senate, that this bill \ntook not days, not weeks, but months. We have spent months on this \nbill. We have done the best we could. We have a lot of able members on \nthe Armed Services Committee. All of them have worked hard on this \nbill. It is a compromise bill. I did not have my way on everything. \nSenator Levin did not have his way on everything. No one did. This is a \ncompromise bill.\n  National security was the driving force of this bill. We could not \nsatisfy every Senator. We did the best we could to accommodate all we \ncould. But national security was our driving force when we considered \nthis bill. Again, I ask all Senators to support this bill for the good \nof the country and to support this bill for the good of our troops and \nto support this bill, too, for the public good.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the conference \nreport.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I shall \nnot object, I would like to inquire of the majority leader his \nintention with respect to the pending business, which prior to this \nunanimous-consent request was the fast-track legislation. I understand \nthat the conference report is privileged and you are seeking a \nunanimous-consent request with respect to a time agreement. I shall not \nobject to that. But I want to inquire about the intentions of the \nmajority leader with respect to the fast-track legislation--when we \nmight expect to get to amendments on that.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond, we have some business we \nneed to go through here with regard to some nominations, also another \npiece of legislation, the PUHCA legislation, some statements that will \nbe made.\n  As I mentioned, we are trying to work out something to where we can \nmove to the D.C. bill and Amtrak. It is our intent to return to fast \ntrack, so that there will be time for further debate and, I presume, \namendments, as we go on into the afternoon and into the night and \ntomorrow. We are trying to get some of these other bills agreed to and \nmoved today. We will try to do it before we get back into the debate.\n  We, of course, ask for your cooperation as we try to get consent to \nmove some of these bills.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

If the Senator will withhold. The Senate is \nnot in order.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The majority leader certainly will have my cooperation. I \nshare his interest in making progress on a number of the items he has \njust mentioned.\n  I am concerned, however, that we not get into a corner of the \nlegislative time period and discover that some say there is not time to \noffer amendments on the fast-track legislation. A number of us have \namendments that would require some debate, and we want very much to be \nassured by the majority leader that we will not be precluded from \noffering those amendments. So as we proceed, I want to have some \nassurance that that will be the case.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, before I respond, can I inquire, are these \ngermane amendments the Senator is entertaining to the fast track?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Some are germane, some are nongermane. They all relate to \nfast track and to trade. We are not under a cloture motion, so all the \namendments would be in order.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me just say that there are Members on both sides of the \naisle that have amendments. I know they want an opportunity to offer \nthem. We will return to that bill. There will be an opportunity to \noffer amendments. But I can't say exactly what time it will be at this \npoint. It very well could be tonight. We will need to work with the \nDemocratic leader and talk about the time and how we are going to \nhandle that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I shall not object to the request made by \nthe majority leader. I will seek further inquiry upon request later in \nthe day because we do want to find time for those amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank the Members on the other side. We \nall know that, because of matters which we won't continue to debate \nhere, our ISTEA or highway reauthorization measure has not gone \nforward. We will not be able to resolve the many difficult questions \nover funding allocations and funding formulas this year.\n  Several days ago, I said that I was working with the EPW, the \nchairman, Chairman Chafee, Chairman Warner, Ranking Member Baucus, and \nthe members of the committee to permit our highway departments in our \nStates to continue obligating funds, continue transit and safety \noperations and DOT operations for the next 6 months.\n  Mr. President, just a brief report. We are now working on a formula \nwhich would say to each State that, for the next 6 months, you may \nobligate up to half of what you had in the past fiscal year for \ncontracts for the coming summer construction season. There will be no \nchanges and no impact on the formula, but there will be complete \nflexibility. So if you have unpaid, unspent\n\n[[Page S11846]]\n\nobligations in one category, you can spend them wherever you need to. \nWe are working with the House. I appreciate the cooperation of all \nMembers, because I believe we all understand that we cannot leave \nhighways and transportation without the ability to go forward in the \nsummer construction season.\n  I thank the leadership of the Senate. We are working with the House \nto have a proposal that I believe should be acceptable. It does not \ninvolve any funding allocation changes or reestablish any formulas, but \nit does permit the work to go forward. It is vitally important. I \nappreciate the time of this body.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed immediately to H.R. 2676, the IRS Restructuring Act of 1997, \njust received from the House, that the bill be read a third time, and \npassed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator from \nDelaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I say to my distinguished friend from \nNebraska that, as he knows, we are beginning to hold hearings on the \nimportant problems of reconstructing the IRS. I think that the House \nlegislation is good legislation. It's a good beginning, but, frankly, \nit does not address all the problems that were uncovered in the \nhearings held by the Finance Committee a few weeks ago.\n  We will proceed very expeditiously with the hearings on this matter. \nWe will seek to respond to all of the problems that were raised in our \nhearings. We think it is important to strengthen the authority, that \nthere is nothing more important to reorganizing and reforming the IRS \nthan providing for independent oversight.\n  So, while I think it is a good beginning in that action that was \ntaken by the House, much remains to be done to reform the IRS in a \nmanner that it will provide true service to the American taxpayers.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, as long as we are in session, I will come \nto the floor, and I hope those on the other side of the aisle will look \nat this bill. The Senate did confirm Charles Rossotti to be the new \nCommissioner of the IRS. There is a lot in this bill. If you look at \nit, you would say, my gosh, I'm surprised that we don't already do \nthis. It gives the Commissioner the authority to hire, fire, move \npeople around, and to provide marketplace incentives. It has a public \noversight board, as well as increased oversight on our side. It has \nsignificant changes in here that give the public more information on \nthe basis of audits.\n  I appreciate very much the fine work that Chairman Roth has done in \nthe 3 days of hearings. We took a look at some additional things. But \nthis Commissioner is going to be expected to manage a 110,000-person \nagency through a very difficult filing season this year, next year, and \nthe year after.\n  This bill addresses many, if not most, of the problems that have been \nidentified by your citizens at home. I hope that during the next couple \nof days--this bill began as bipartisan. Congressman Portman, \nRepresentative from Ohio, and I; chief sponsors on this side in the \nSenate, Senator Grassley, and I--I hope my Republican colleagues will \ntake a look at this bill. There is a lot more that can be done. There \nis no question about that. But there is also no question that when we \ngive Mr. Rossotti this authority you are going to get a dramatic \nimprovement in the efficiency of the operation of the IRS. Hundreds of \ncollection notices are going to go out every day; over 1 million \nadditional notices for audits; and other contacts the IRS is going to \nmake per month with taxpayers. For every day we wait you are going to \nhave to answer citizens at home. ``Why didn't you give the Commissioner \nthe authority? Why didn't you provide the kind of authority needed to \nbe able to manage the agency on behalf of taxpayers?''\n  I believe delay will cost taxpayers. They are not going to be happy \nabout this delay.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to make a couple of comments. One \npertains to the IRS proposal. I think Senator Kerrey's assessment of \nthe House-passed language is correct. It is good language. But I \ncertainly agree with the chairman of the Finance Committee. We had \noutstanding hearings conducted in a very fair, bipartisan way that said \nwe should do more. I think Chairman Roth said we want to do more, \ndemand to do more, and I think we can do better. The House passed a \nvery good bill. We passed a better bill.\n  I tell my colleagues. We want to continue to work together in a \nbipartisan fashion to pass really good IRS restructuring reform in this \nCongress. I hope and expect we will.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/06/senate-section/article/S11846-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            INTERMODAL SURFACE TRANSPORTATION EFFICIENCY ACT\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I also want to make a comment concerning \nSenator Bond, and the outstanding work he has done in the Environment \nand Public Works Committee to pass the highway bill. We need to pass \none this year. The Senator from Missouri has been working with Senator \nBaucus and others in a bipartisan fashion, and I believe it has \nunanimous support in the Environment and Public Works Committee to pass \na reauthorization bill, or at least passing an extension for 6 months \nto allow the States to continue contracting.\n  They came up with a way that said, ``Well, we are not going to have \none side win on the formula issue, or another side.'' I think it is a \ngood compromise until we pass a 6-year bill, which we tried to do.\n  I might mention that we had four cloture votes on whether or not we \nwould take up the highway bill, and it was basically filibustered \nbecause people wanted to add campaign reform and unrelated issues. That \nis unfortunate. That is history. Now we have to move on. We only have a \nfew days to do it.\n  I compliment my colleague from Missouri, and others who have worked \nwith him, and I urge our House colleagues to work together with us to \nmake sure we get this passed. Let's pass this before we leave. I think \nit is vitally important to the highway programs in every single State \nin the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/06/senate-section/article/S11846-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11846-S11847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           DOD AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Finally, Mr. President, let me conclude on the DOD \nauthorization bill. We just had a resounding vote of 90 to 10 on the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill on which Senator Thurmond has \nworked, and many other colleagues have been working on for a long \ntime--a year. They put in a lot of work. They have a good bill. It is a \nbill the President should sign. I urge the President to sign it.\n  On the depot issue, which has been very contentious amongst a few \nStates, I think we came up with a fair compromise. I think we came up \nwith a compromise that allows States to compete, and to compete fairly.\n  So I compliment all Senators involved. I urge the President to sign \nthe Department of Defense authorization bill to allow our military \npeople to receive the cost-of-living adjustment, and to allow \nauthorization to go forward on many very important military projects \nall across our country.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to yield.\n\n[[Page S11847]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/06/senate-section/article/S11846-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n            INTERMODAL SURFACE TRANSPORTATION EFFICIENCY ACT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

This is very important to this country.\n  So I commend the Senator from Missouri, the Senator from Montana, and \nso many others who are working on these issues, and hope all Members of \nthe Senate feel, as we do, that this is something that must get done in \nthe final days of this session.\n  Mr. BOND.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nturn to the conference report on intelligence, with 20 minutes equally \ndivided under the control of the Senator from Alabama and the Senator \nfrom Nebraska, with the Senator from New Jersey to be recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise in my capacity as chairman of the \nSelect Committee on Intelligence to support passage of the conference \nreport on S. 858, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n1998. This important legislation authorizes funds for intelligence \nprograms and related activities of the Central Intelligence Agency, the \nNational Security Agency, and other Government entities.\n  This conference report also represents the culmination of a lengthy \nand detailed review by the Intelligence Committee of the plans, \npolicies, and programs contained in the President's budget submission \nfor fiscal year 1998. In this regard, I wish to commend the vice \nchairman of the committee, Senator Kerrey from Nebraska, for his \nassistance in crafting this important legislation. Senator Kerrey \nplayed a pivotal role in shaping this legislation, and I am pleased we \nwere able to work together, in a bipartisan manner, to bring this \nlegislation to the floor. It's a good bill; my colleagues should \nsupport it; and the President should sign it into law.\n  Let me also take this opportunity to commend Chairman Goss, my \ncounterpart on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, \nalong with Mr. Dicks, the ranking minority member. We have developed \nwhat I consider to be a very positive and productive working \nrelationship, which manifested itself in the smooth functioning and \ncordial atmosphere in which our conference deliberations took place.\n  Although Senate and House conferees completed action on this \nlegislation 7 weeks ago, a joint decision was made not to file the \nconference report at that time. This was due to the fact that the \nconference committee on the Fiscal 1998 National Defense Authorization \nAct had yet to resolve all open issues. Given that funding for all \nintelligence programs and activities is, consistent with past practice, \nincluded in the intelligence authorization bill, we agreed to withhold \nbringing our bill to a vote until conference action on the Defense \nauthorization bill was completed and the Defense authorization bill was \nvoted on by the Senate.\n  The conferees on S. 858 took several important steps to improve this \ncountry's ability to collect, analyze, and produce intelligence about \nAmerica's adversaries. We authorized funds above the President's \nrequest because we believe there are areas where additional resources \nare needed in this post-cold-war period of uncertainty. While the \nmission of our intelligence gathering organizations has not changed, \nthe areas on which they must focus have become diverse and more \nchallenging.\n  I am, therefore, particularly pleased that the conferees agreed with \nthe Senate that additional resources should be added for advanced \nresearch and technology development and in five areas that I call the \n``five C's'': counternarcotics, counterterrorism, counterproliferation, \ncounterintelligence, and covert action.\n  The conferees did not agree, however, to include Senate section 306, \n``Encouragement of Disclosure of Certain Information to Congress,'' in \nthe final conference report. The 20 conferees from the Senate--the 19 \nmembers of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and Senator \nStrom Thurmond, the distinguished chairman of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee--voted unanimously in favor of the provision that would \nrequire the President to notify Federal employees and contractors with \nclassified contracts that they are not violating any law, Executive \norder, regulation, or policy if they disclose information, including \nclassified information, evidencing wrongdoing to the committees of \nCongress with primary oversight of the Federal department or agency \ninvolved. A majority of the House conferees voted against the measure, \nbut they agreed that the issue should be explored in more detail and \nthey committed to producing legislation soon. Both committees will \nschedule hearings on the subject early next year. The conferees did \ninclude a declaration, in lieu of section 306, expressing the sense of \nCongress that Members of Congress have equal standing with the \nexecutive branch to receive classified information to carry out their \nconstitutionally mandated oversight functions.\n  I am disappointed that we were unable to convince a majority of our \nHouse colleagues to support Senate section 306. Given the importance of \ncongressional oversight of intelligence activities, the committee will \ndevote significant attention to this important issue in the near future \nand I look forward to producing legislation that both Houses can agree \non. I also hope that the President will work with the committees in \ndrafting such legislation.\n  I urge the President to reconsider his threat to veto a provision \nthat would allow individuals within his own administration to come \nforward to the appropriate committees of Congress with evidence of \nwrongdoing, rather than leaking it to the press, as seems to be the \ncase today.\n  Again, Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise in my capacity as vice chairman of \nthe Intelligence Committee to urge passage of the intelligence \nauthorization conference report. The House and Senate both produced \ngood bills this year, they fit together quite well, and the conference \ncommittee under Chairman Shelby's leadership worked out a compromise \nwhich I recommend to my colleagues. The outcome of the conference \nfavors new technology, focuses on today's and tomorrow's hardest \ntargets, and increases the usefulness of U.S. intelligence to its \nGovernment customers and to the public.\n  The legislation coming out of conference is not perfect, because it \ndrops a provision which the Senate had strongly favored, the provision \nguaranteeing the right of public employees to share classified \ninformation about wrongdoing directly with the appropriate \ncongressional committee. I will return in a moment to the failure to \ninclude this provision, and I will have more to say in the future about \nthe necessity of such a provision.\n  Last month, while the conferees were meeting, the CIA was publicly \ncelebrating the 50th anniversary of its creation. I salute its \nemployees and I join President Clinton in praising their generous \npatriotism, their willingness to take risks for America, and their \ngreat professional skill. Their successes during the cold war, be they \nin space and\n\n[[Page S11848]]\n\nairborne reconnaissance, human intelligence, covert operations, or \nintelligence analysis, were key to our eventual victory. In the years \nsince the cold war the people of the CIA have continued to make a huge \ndifference in warning our military, helping our leaders make the right \npolicy choices, and keeping the American people safe.\n  It shouldn't be surprising that the CIA is a misunderstood \norganization, because it is mostly a secret organization. Its employees \nare secretive about their duties, their budget is secret, their \noperations are secret. Further, while the CIA's failures, both real and \napparent, will probably find their way into the press, the successes \nwill not--and should not. Add the general disinclination these days to \nthink deeply about foreign threats and you see the problem. But it is \nin the national interest to confront this problem, and to demonstrate \nto the public the necessity and the necessary uniqueness of the CIA.\n  The necessity should be clear. Most countries need an organization, a \ndedicated service, to collect and analyze information so policymakers \ncan make good decisions and military forces can be warned and prepared. \nSuch a service might also be called upon occasionally to act in a \nclandestine or covert manner, in a way that the Nation's leaders could \nplausibly deny. A great nation with global responsibilities requires a \nhighly capable global service. Because the information collection is \nsecret--no reason to use an intelligence service to collect what is \npublicly available--and because the resulting analysis may also have to \nbe kept secret to protect the secret sources, much of this intelligence \nservice's activity should be secret. The necessity for secrecy seems \nself-evident, but in a period like present, when the threats to our \nnational life seem remote, it bears repeating. It also bears watching.\n  Secrecy, while necessary in intelligence, conflicts with the openness \nrequired of government operations in a democracy. The oversight roles \nperformed by an attentive public and alert media, oversight roles which \nwould quickly find wrongdoing in a Government agriculture program, are \nusually unavailable to probe secret intelligence operations. Congress \nhas to take up the slack.\n  For the first 28 years of CIA's existence, Congress's oversight of \nsecret intelligence was benign, distant, and superficial. For the most \npart, Congress trusted the CIA and the other agencies to do the right \nthing. But when we ask Government agencies to operate in secret, to \ntake the most serious risks, to conduct operations which the Government \nwill publicly deny, vigorous congressional oversight is required. In \ncreating the Intelligence Committees of the two Houses in the mid-\n1970's, Congress devised a method for legislative oversight of secret \noperations which works well and which has excited the curiosity and \nimitation of many other countries. It is a system which works hard to \ninsure U.S. intelligence activities are conducted in accordance with \nU.S. law and American values. It protects the right of Americans not to \nbe spied on by their own Government, it protects the taxpayer's dollars \nspent on intelligence, and it protects the employees of intelligence \nagencies from having to carry out an operation which has not been \napproved by the people's representatives. Despite the nostalgic \ncomplaints from those who never served under the current oversight \nsystem, congressional oversight has made U.S. intelligence much \nstronger.\n  Congressional oversight depends on information. That elementary fact \nis enshrined in the Lloyd-LaFollette Act of 1912, which makes explicit \nthe right of employees of the executive branch to directly provide \ninformation to Congress, and in the more recent Whistleblower \nProtection Act. Particularly in the murky and potentially lethal world \nof intelligence, it seems self-evident that an employee who knew of \nserious wrongdoing might not want to clear with her boss or with her \nagency's inspector general or even with the Justice Department the fact \nthat she was going to the Intelligence Committee or the Armed Services \nCommittee or another appropriate committee with information about the \nwrongdoing.\n  The administration sees it differently. They state the President's \ncontrol of national security information is vested in him by the \nConstitution, specifically by his powers in foreign affairs and as \ncommander in chief, and that the provision in the Senate intelligence \nbill authorizing employees to bring classified reports directly to \nCongress violates the Constitution. The administration is also \nconcerned that to weaken the President's control of secret information \nis to increase the chance of security leaks--even though Congress has a \nmuch better record than the executive branch in keeping classified \ninformation secure. Since a President has the sole authority to \nclassify any information he wants, it is possible that some future \nadministration could classify a report on sexual harassment or bribery \nor any topic. Congress will be a supplicant for information identifying \nwrongdoing, not an authorizer and overseer of Government activity.\n  I must stress that the Clinton administration has given no hint it \nwould ever behave in such a fashion; in fact, the intelligence \ncommittees get more information from this administration than from any \nother in our history. In addition to its many classified notifications \nto the oversight committees, this administration is declassifying data \nfrom earlier eras and also recently announced the dollar amount of the \ntotal intelligence budget for the last fiscal year. But ours is a \ngovernment of laws, not individuals, and we must be prepared for more \ncontentious relations between the branches, and less principled \nadministrations, than we have now.\n  The Senate provision was, very simply, about Congress' right to \nGovernment information and the right of citizens to inform Congress. I \nam disappointed this provision was removed in conference, but I will \njoin Chairman Shelby in introducing this provision as separate \nlegislation and I am confident we will prevail. The American system of \nGovernment depends on it.\n  I said congressional oversight has made U.S. intelligence better. It \nhas also made Congress more informed about the intelligence agencies, \njust as any oversight committee comes to know its agencies well. From \nmy vantage point, these agencies are national treasures, but they have \na potentially fatal defect: they are not effectively portraying to the \nAmerican people the crucial necessity of their work. I know, and my \ncolleagues know, how relevant the intelligence community's work is to \nAmerica. But the American people, by and large, do not know. The task \nfor the intelligence community is to inform them, to make sure the \nAmerican people know the role of intelligence in protecting their \nfreedom and their safety.\n  A second task is for the intelligence agencies to treat the American \npeople as their customers. In other words, the agencies must put \npriority and resources on their declassification efforts, they must \nrespond faster to freedom of information requests, and they must use \nand disseminate open source information the public can use to \nunderstand their world better and make better decisions. The days when \nintelligence was exclusively a secret activity for an elite inside the \nbeltway are over, and if intelligence is to retain its claim on the \npublic's resources and rebuild the public's full respect, they ought to \nbe over.\n  Over the past half-century, our leaders and our military used the \nbest intelligence to keep us free and to help us prevail in the global \nstruggle with communism. The CIA and its sister agencies went to the \nends of the earth, the depths of space, and the inner reaches of the \nhuman personality, to find that intelligence. We all owe them a great \ndebt. But this is a new, and far more open, world. The intelligence \nauthorization bill provides the resources and the direction for success \nin that new world. But the enthusiastic support of the American people \nis not something Congress can authorize--if we could, we would \nauthorize some for ourselves. Only the agencies themselves can accept \nthis challenge, and earn the respectful, even admiring and grateful \nsupport of the great majority of its 260 million customers. In my view, \nDirector Tenet and his colleagues are up to the challenge. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when Senator \nTorricelli of New Jersey is finished all time be yielded.\n\n[[Page S11849]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, under the original provisions of the \nSenate authorization bill for intelligence, Senator Shelby and Senator \nKerrey contained in the authorization a provision reasserting the right \nof the Congress to know the truth about activities of the intelligence \nagencies.\n  The provision directed the President to tell all Federal employees \nthat they can inform the Congress without fear of reprisal and \nprosecution of activities in which the intelligence agencies were \ninvolved. It was put into a provision. Indeed, the purpose of the \nprovision was whether or not intelligence agencies were involved in \nimproper or illegal activities.\n  The provision pointed out that Members of Congress have a clear right \nto know such information, and, indeed, constitutionally, since they are \ncharged with oversight responsibility, cannot meet their constitutional \nduties without Federal employees knowing that they not only have the \nright and the responsibility but, indeed, are free to provide this \ninformation without retribution.\n  Tragically, under the direction of some of the President's senior \nadvisers, it was suggested that the President might veto the entire \nbill unless this provision were removed.\n  I rise today to compliment Senator Shelby, Senator Kerrey, and the \nIntelligence Committee, and, indeed, this entire Senate for insisting \nupon this provision; and, at the same time to say with regret that it \nhas been removed from the legislation.\n  It is hard to exaggerate the potential impact of the removal of this \nprovision. The secret agency of the Government is overseen by only two \ncongressional committees--both select committees, which meet \nunderstandably in secrecy. Those committees are charged with overseeing \nall of the intelligence agencies of this Government. But they rely upon \nthe fact that the leadership of the intelligence community will come to \nthe committee with truthful testimony and report on its activities. \nThere is no one to rely upon but the leadership of the intelligence \ncommunity itself. All other committees of the Congress know about the \nwhistle-blower statutes. Federal employees will come forward if there \nare illegal activities in this Government, or improper activities.\n  The intelligence committee has no such assurance with regard to \nintelligence agencies of this Government. The Congress recognized this \nfact. Senator Shelby and Senator Kerrey recognized this fact. They \nacted appropriately.\n  It is with great regret that in voting for this conference report \ntoday I must report and note that the provision--that simple protection \nto allow this Congress to meet its responsibility--is no longer \ncontained in the bill.\n  I do, however, note and compliment the Intelligence Committee for \nthey have rejected unanimously the executive branch position as \nunconstitutional and have inserted language in the conference report \nmaking clear that the executive branch cannot unilaterally withdraw \ncongressional prerogatives. So, while the original language is no \nlonger contained in the bill, it is also made clear that the Congress \nis insisting upon its prerogatives.\n  I hope, Mr. President, that President Clinton will rethink his \nposition, and next year and in future years will return to the question \nof authorization of the intelligence community. We once again will be \nin a position to place into legislation clear and effective protections \nthat this Congress will be assured that every employee of the Federal \nGovernment will know that they have a right and a responsibility to \ncome to this Congress whenever they believe improper or illegal \nactivities are taking place and that they can do so without fear of \nretribution.\n  Mr. President, I support the conference report. But I do regret that \nthe administration has insisted upon the removal of this very \nworthwhile provision.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the conference \nreport.\n  The conference report was agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton).

Reg. 38856), would damage the international \n     competitiveness of the United States manufacturing industry \n     and effectively subsidize imports, penalize exports, and add \n     to an already large United States trade deficit;\n       (2) Public Law 101-549 (commonly known as the ``Clean Air \n     Act Amendments of 1990'') (104 Stat. 2399) established a \n     number of measures and programs that address ozone and \n     particulate matter pollution and the precursors to ozone and \n     particulate matter pollution;\n       (3) as of the date of enactment of this Act, most of the \n     measures and programs are continuing or have yet to be \n     implemented;\n       (4) the United States has made significant progress in \n     reducing atmospheric levels of ozone and particulate matter \n     since the enactment of Public Law 101-549 and will continue \n     to make significant progress in reducing atmospheric levels \n     of ozone and particulate matter through continued \n     implementation of that Act during the 5-year period beginning \n     on the date of enactment of this Act;\n       (5)(A) the national ambient air quality standards for ozone \n     that were in effect on July 15, 1997, are explicitly \n     incorporated into part D of title I of the Clean Air Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 7501 et seq.); and\n       (B) the changes to those standards published in the Federal \n     Register on July 18, 1997 (62 Fed. Reg. 38856), could nullify \n     many of the ozone provisions in Public Law 101-549 and lead \n     to disruptions and delays in the reduction of ozone and the \n     precursors to ozone;\n       (6) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency and the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee have \n     recommended that additional research be conducted to \n     determine any adverse health effects of fine particles \n     (including research on the biological mechanism for adverse \n     health effects, toxicity and dose response levels, and the \n     specification of the size and type of particle that might \n     have adverse health effects); and\n       (7) available atmospheric data regarding fine particle \n     levels in the United States are inadequate to provide an \n     understanding of any adverse health effects of fine particles \n     or a basis for designating areas under title I of the Clean \n     Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.).\n\n     SEC. __03. PARTICULATE MATTER RESEARCH PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Independent Panel.--\n       (1) In general.--The Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency (referred to in this title as the \n     ``Administrator'') shall request the National Academy of \n     Sciences to convene an independent panel of scientists with \n     expertise in the health effects of air pollution to establish \n     priorities for research on the health effects of particulate \n     matter.\n       (2) Report.--Not later than February 1, 1998, the \n     Administrator shall report to Congress on the recommendations \n     of the independent panel.\n       (b) Research Priorities.--At a minimum, the independent \n     panel shall consider--\n       (1) the sizes and physical-chemical characteristics of the \n     constituents of particulate matter;\n       (2) the health effects of individual exposure to \n     concentrations of fine particulate matter at ambient levels \n     versus indoor levels;\n       (3) the identification and evaluation of biological \n     mechanisms for fine particulate matter as related to \n     shortening of lives, acute mortality, and morbidity;\n       (4) controlled inhalation exposure as a determinant of \n     dose-response relationships; and\n       (5) long-term health effect evaluations that examine \n     individual exposure to fine particulate matter, other \n     particulate indicators, and other copollutants and airborne \n     allergens.\n       (c) Interagency Committee.--\n       (1) Establishment.--Not later than 60 days after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the President shall establish a \n     committee to be known as the ``Particulate Matter Interagency \n     Committee'' (referred to in this title as the ``Interagency \n     Committee'').\n       (2) Purposes.--The Interagency Committee shall--\n       (A) not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, develop recommendations for a program to coordinate \n     the activities of Federal agencies engaged in research on \n     human health effects of particulate matter that ensures that \n     the research advances the prioritized agenda of the \n     independent panel; and\n       (B) monitor, review, and periodically evaluate the program.\n       (3) Composition of interagency committee.--\n       (A) Membership.--The Interagency Committee shall be \n     composed of 8 members, of whom--\n       (i) 1 shall be appointed by the Administrator;\n       (ii) 1 shall be appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture;\n       (iii) 1 shall be appointed by the Secretary of Defense;\n       (iv) 1 shall be appointed by the Secretary of Energy;\n       (v) 1 shall be appointed by the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services;\n       (vi) 1 shall be appointed by the Director of the National \n     Institute of Environmental Health Sciences;\n       (vii) 1 shall be appointed by the Director of the National \n     Institute of Standards and Technology; and\n       (viii) 1 shall be appointed by the Director of the Office \n     of Science and Technology Policy.\n       (B) Chairperson.--From among the members appointed under \n     clauses (ii) through (viii) of subparagraph (A), the \n     Interagency Committee shall elect a chairperson who shall be \n     responsible for ensuring that the duties of the Interagency \n     Committee are carried out.\n       (C) Staff.--Members of the Interagency Committee shall \n     provide appropriate staff to carry out the duties of the \n     Interagency Committee.\n       (d) Report to Interagency Committee.--\n       (1) In general.--The Administrator shall request the \n     National Academy of Sciences to periodically submit to the \n     Interagency Committee, the Clean Air Science Advisory \n     Committee, and Congress a report that evaluates the \n     prioritized research activities under the program described \n     in subsection (c)(2)(A).\n       (2) Expenses.--The Administrator shall be responsible for \n     expenses incurred by the National Academy of Sciences in \n     carrying out paragraph (1).\n\n     SEC. __04. SCIENCE REVIEW.\n\n       Not earlier than 4 years after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the Administrator shall--\n       (1) complete a thorough review of the air quality criteria \n     published under section 108 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. \n     7408) for ozone and fine particulate matter and a thorough \n     review of the standards in effect under that Act for ozone \n     and particulate matter; and\n       (2) determine, in accordance with sections 108 and 109 of \n     that Act (42 U.S.C. 7408, 7409), whether to--\n       (A) retain the criteria and standards in effect under that \n     Act for ozone and particulate matter;\n       (B) make revisions in the criteria and standards; or\n       (C) promulgate new criteria and standards.\n\n     SEC. __05. PARTICULATE MONITORING PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Administrator may require State \n     implementation plans to require ambient air quality \n     monitoring for fine particulate matter pursuant to section \n     110(a)(2)(B) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)(B)).\n       (b) Grants.--The Administrator shall make grants to States \n     to carry out monitoring required under subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. __06.

Mr. President, South Dakota is a quiet state. Its cities \nare neither heralded in poetry like Carl Sandberg's ``big shouldered'' \nChicago nor celebrated in song like New York and San Francisco. It is, \nnonetheless, a state of stunningly varied beauty, showcased in the \nwildflower-sprinkled\n\n[[Page S11851]]\n\nlong grass prairie. It still boasts free-ranging herds of bison; and in \nthe wind- and water-carved Badlands that glow with sunset colors under \nthe azure skies. It can be a lonely state, with long ribbons of tarmac \nlinking small towns for years haunted by the brooding presence of \nnuclear-tipped intercontinental range missiles and blanketed by driving \nsnowstorms in winter. Strong-willed and resilient personalities are \nrequired to flourish in South Dakota, and she is blessed with such \ncitizens. One of those strong-willed, resilient South Dakotans ably \nserves both the State of South Dakota and the United States Senate, \nwhere he will soon celebrate both the fourth anniversary of his \nelection as Democratic Leader and the 50th anniversary of his birth in \nAberdeen, South Dakota.\n  Ah, Mr. President--oh, just to be 50 again. I would be calling back \nalmost 30 years in that event.\n  I am sure that everyone here would agree that Senator Tom Daschle is \nstrong-willed and resilient. Indeed, Senator Daschle's virtues are \ncommon to those who claim the Mount Rushmore State as their home. Like \nthe many ranchers and farmers who live in South Dakota, Senator Daschle \nis a patient, hard-working man who knows that one must toil today so \nthat one may reap the fruits of one's labors tomorrow. And, as befits a \nman who hails from one of the country's most sparsely populated states, \nin which a majority of the inhabitants are rurally located, Senator \nDaschle is quiet, self-contained, independent and plain-spoken. Despite \nhis quiet reserve, however, Senator Daschle is a warm and friendly man; \nthese qualities well suit the resident of a state whose name derives \nfrom the Sioux word for ``friends'' or ``allies.''\n  I hope that Senator Daschle will permit me to indulge in a flight of \nfantasy by pointing out that he shares many of the geographic and \nmeteorological characteristics of his state. Like a South Dakota \nblizzard, he is capable of driving the Senate with authority, but like \nthe tall grass prairie, he is also capable of bending with the winds of \nchange, adapting and modifying issues in order to reach a common \nconsensus. Like the famed Black Hills of South Dakota, Senator Daschle \npossesses an implacable reserve; and, as befits the representative of a \nstate which stands geographically at the center of our Union, he has \nclaimed for himself the ideological middle-ground of this body and this \ncountry. As I list these many and varied characteristics, it occurs to \nme that here is truly a fitting embodiment of the state whose \nchangeable climate and diverse geography have resulted in the \nappellation ``the Land of Infinite Variety.''\n  From the many and varied characteristics that I have enumerated, I \nwish to pluck one that best captures the essence of Senator Daschle. I \nrefer to his quietness. Quietness is an underrated and sadly uncommon \ntrait, in this chamber and in this nation. Underrated, perhaps, because \nit is often mistaken for timidity or lack of conviction; we Americans \nat times place too much faith in the hearty optimism and aggressive \nself-confidence of the extrovert. But the true optimist, the truly \nconfident person, has no need for bluster or vituperation. Thus the \nBible instructs us in Thessalonians 4:11, ``Study to be quiet, and to \ndo your own business.'' And Shakespeare, whose poetry and prose remain \na bounteous font of wisdom, also said ``truth hath a quiet breast.'' \nIndeed, truth does have a quiet breast, and the heart that beats within \nthat breast is no more steady, dependable, diligent, or uncomplaining \nthan is the senior Senator from South Dakota.\n\n  For many persons, turning 50--as my friend from South Dakota will do \non December 9th--marks an important milestone along the road of life, \nprompting thoughts about where one is heading and what one has \naccomplished. I know that Senator Daschle will not have to concern \nhimself on the latter score, for his accomplishments are both numerous \nand widely acknowledged. A champion of veterans, a dedicated friend to \nfarmers, an ally of Indians, and a powerful advocate of providing \naffordable health care to all Americans, Senator Daschle has proved \ntime and time again his willingness to fight for those who are unable \nto fight for themselves. His courage and persistence in these endeavors \nmay, perhaps, be traced to his service in the U.S. Air Force, which \nprovides further evidence--as if more were needed!--of Senator \nDaschle's dedication to his country.\n  Clearly, Senator Daschle has no reason to concern himself on his \nupcoming birthday with fears that he has achieved too little. But what \nof that other concern I alluded to a few minutes ago, the sudden \nrealization common to many fledgling quinquagenarians that they are \nleaving the comfortable environs of middle age and entering a new, \nunfamiliar, untested territory? I do not know whether Senator Daschle \nis experiencing such intimations of mortality--if he were, he would \ndoubtless be loath to admit it--but I feel that on this account I may \nset his mind to rest. Allow me to offer a little of the perspective on \naging that is the prerogative of those, like myself, who are more \nadvanced in years.\n  For when I entered my 50th year, the Senate was a far different place \nthan it is today. Senators were then paid $30,000 a year. Senators Mike \nMansfield of Montana and Everett Dirksen of Illinois presided \nmasterfully over their respective parties in the Senate. It was a \nturbulent time nationally, and that turbulence was mirrored in the \nSenate. Senator Eugene McCarthy stormed out of one particularly \ncontentious meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, angered \nover the President's Vietnam policy. That same year, spectators dropped \na flood of anti-Vietnam War literature from the galleries to protest a \nconflict that had already killed over 10,000 American soldiers; the \nSenate responded by, for the first time, banning demonstrations within \nthe Capitol, and I joined in that protest against demonstrations in the \ngalleries, as I think Senators who know me would understand that I \nwould.\n  On a more positive note, that year also saw several important \nmilestones in the history of the Senate. Maine's Margaret Chase Smith \nbecame the first woman elected to a leadership position in the Senate \nwhen she won a unanimous vote to be Chairman of the Republican \nConference. That same year, the first black Senator in years, Edward W. \nBrooke of Massachusetts, was sworn in. Senator Brooke was not only the \nfirst black Senator since Reconstruction; he was also the first from a \nnorthern state and the first to be popularly elected to the Senate.\n  I hope, in suggesting how the Senate has changed since my 50th year, \nthat I have both reminded Senator Daschle of his youth and suggested \nthe breadth of change that he will inevitably see in this chamber over \nthe next few decades. For if South Dakotans in their wisdom deem it, \nSenator Daschle may continue to toil in this chamber for many years to \ncome, and I look forward to working with him as he builds upon his \nachievements. So today, before the Senate adjourns this session, allow \nme to look ahead to the ninth of December and wish my friend Tom \nDaschle a very happy 50th birthday.\n  To Tom personally, may I say:\n\n       The hours are like a string of pearls,\n       The days like diamonds rare,\n       The moments are the threads of gold,\n       That bind them for our wear,\n       So may the years that come to you\n       Such wealth and good contain\n       That every moment, hour and day\n       Be like a golden chain.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am very honored, very grateful and, I \nmust say, humbled by the generous remarks of the very distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia, my friend, Senator Byrd. I can't think of a \nmore pleasant way to ease my way into the half-century realization than \nto listen to the eloquence of this masterful speaker and legislator. I \ncannot think of a better gift to be given than the respect shown to me \nby Senator Byrd in the way that he has just expressed.\n  It has now been my good fortune to serve in the Senate for 10 years. \nAs I continue to serve, my respect for him, the education I receive \nfrom him, the opportunities that I have in serving with him continue to \nexcite me and provide what I consider to be some of the greatest \nexperiences that I share in the Senate.\n  Someone once said that life has no blessing like that of a good \nfriend. If\n\n[[Page S11852]]\n\nthat is indeed true, then I have been richly blessed by my friends on \nboth sides of the aisle in the U.S. Senate, but among them, there is no \nfriendship for which I have greater pride and for which I treasure more \nthan the friendship that I have been blessed to receive from the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia.\n  So, I thank him for his kind words, for his eloquence, for the \nrespect that he has shown me and also for being such an extraordinary \ninstructor, not only to me, but to all the Members of the Senate as he \ncontinues to serve in such a magnificent way as the senior Senator from \nthe State of West Virginia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/06/senate-section/article/S11850-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11852-S11854]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            NATIONAL TESTING\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to speak of the need to preserve \nand protect the intense vital involvement of parents in decisionmaking \nin local schools all across America. If America is to succeed in the \nnext generation, we have to have the capacity to have the kind of \nschools that meet the needs of our students. We will have to have the \nability to experiment from one school district to another. We will have \nto have State and local governments that can tailor the programs which \nthey have to meet the demands of their unique settings.\n  Sometimes when we think about achievement, sometimes when we think \nabout success, we think it might be necessary to try and impose the so-\ncalled ``wisdom of Washington'' upon the Nation generally. But, I think \nthat temptation ought to quickly fly from us if we would think of what \nwould have happened, for instance, if we decided there needed to be a \nsingle uniform type of computer and we had imposed it from Washington \nsaying there would just be one way of doing things. Maybe we would have \nchosen Apple computers and their way of doing things instead of IBM and \ntheir way of doing things. Or maybe we would have chosen a single \nsoftware company and said that is the only way it could be handled, and \nwe wouldn't have the flourishing and the flowering and the kind of \nintense opportunity and plurality for the generation of marvelous \nalternatives that have made America the far and away overwhelming \nleader in terms of the technology.\n  I think whenever we feel that temptation to draw to Washington, DC, \nthe decisionmaking and the prerogative of developing for the Nation a \nsingle uniform policy which would take the diversity and the creativity \nout of the system and would cheat America of the vital creativity and \nopportunity that is expressed when people at the local level are \ninvolved, whenever we have that temptation, we should think about how \nbad it would be in so many areas had we had that kind of policy.\n\n  America's ability to flourish as a success reflects the diversity of \nthis country and the ability of different groups of individuals to \napproach things differently and to do so successfully. Not only does it \nprovide for us an energy which carries us to excellence, it also means \nthat we don't ever have all of our eggs in a single basket. We have the \ncapacity to meet a variety of challenges. We have innovative and \ncreative thinking. We have the capacity to look at things from \ndifferent points of view.\n  One of the things that the President sought to bring to the United \nStates--and I think his intention was good--was he wanted to improve \neducation, by bringing to us national testing, testing of students on \nan individual basis all across America with a uniform test promulgated \nby bureaucrats in Washington, a single test which would, unfortunately, \nchart the direction of education all across the country.\n  When you make a test, you decide that you are testing for something. \nSo if you are going to make up a test that is going to be imposed on \nthe country, you are going to be testing for something and you have to \ndefine what you are testing for.\n  So the development of a test, although it might not seem to be at \nfirst blush, is really the development of a curriculum. If you decide \nwhat you are going to test for, you have to decide what you are going \nto teach. Once you decide what you are going to teach, you have \nestablished a national curriculum.\n  Oddly enough, even deciding what you are going to teach probably \nisn't all that is controlled with the development of a test.\n  The development of a test probably decides how you are going to teach \nit, because if you teach English, for instance, with phonics, teach \npeople how letters sound together, and combinations and the like, that \nis one way of teaching the English language and would be tested \ndifferently than teaching the English language with the so-called whole \nlanguage approach where you just have the recognition of words by rote \nor memorization.\n  So when you have something like a national test proposed, you have to \nunderstand that you are talking about uniformity, that you are going to \nimpose a single system all across the country, going to make everybody \npretty much the same, you are going to deprive the system of the \ncreativity and the vitality and diversity of what a lot of different \nfolks can do when they are working simultaneously on a problem.\n  Second, you are not only going to have uniformity, but you are going \nto determine from Washington, DC--if you have a uniform test, you are \ngoing to have a uniform curriculum. What to teach and how to teach it \nthen becomes a uniform decision by bureaucrats. Because in order to \ntest accurately, you have to know exactly what you are teaching and, of \ncourse, what you are teaching for will depend on how you are teaching.\n  It troubles me to think that we might take these most fundamental \ndecisions in education and pry them from the prerogative of parents and \nmove them to the educators or bureaucrats of Washington, DC.\n  As a matter of fact, the bureaucrats, educational bureaucrats, in \nWashington, DC, do not have a very good record. The bureaucrats in \nWashington, DC, run a couple school systems. We know that.\n  As a matter of fact, they run the Department of Defense Dependent \nSchool System. A year or two ago they tried to put the so-called whole \nmath into that system. The results were devastating. The median \npercentile computation scores on the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills \ntaken by more than 37,000 Department of Defense dependent school \nstudents, 1 year after the Defense Department introduced whole math, \ndropped 14 percent for third graders--this is the median percentile \nscore--dropped 20 percent for fourth graders, 20 percent for fifth \ngraders, 17 percent for sixth graders, and 17 percent for seventh \ngraders. One year's implementation of a fad, of the new whole math, \ndevastated the performance of those students.\n  I am not sure we want to yield the control of our public schools to \nthe Federal Government so we can have that kind of devastating impact. \nI sure do not.\n  Maybe, if you think the Federal Government does things particularly \nwell, you should look at another school system which the Federal \nGovernment runs. It is called the District of Columbia School System, \nwhere, I think, we have the highest per capita expenditure on students \nanywhere in the world, and we have some of the lowest achievement \nlevels.\n  What I am trying to say is, we do not need to forfeit to the Federal \nbureaucracy in Washington, DC, the decisionmaking in education of what \nto teach and how to teach it, and we need far less to take parents out \nof the equation.\n  Some people might not understand the value of parents in education, \nbut there has been a lot of work in the educational research area about \nthe value of parents in education. A 1980 report in ``Psychology in the \nSchools'' shows that family involvement improved Chicago elementary \nschoolchildren's performance in reading comprehension dramatically.\n  One year after initiating a Chicago citywide program aimed at helping \nparents create academic support conditions in the home, students in \ngrades one through six ``intensively exposed to the program'' improved \n.5 to .6 grade equivalents in reading comprehension\n\n[[Page S11853]]\n\non the Iowa Test of Basic Skills over students less intensively \ninvolved in the program--a 50- to 60-percent better level of \nimprovement when the parents are deeply involved.\n  If we are going to take parents out of the equation of what to teach \nand how to teach and we are going to tell them, do not bother to try to \nget active in your schools, because if things are not working there, \nyou would have to change the whole country in order to change what \nhappens at your schools, and besides, all the decisions are going to be \nmade at sort of a quasi-national school board in Washington, DC, I do \nnot think we are going to get effective parental involvement. That is \nwhy I believe that locally controlled schools are the fundamental thing \nthat we ought to pursue. It is not only true for Chicago \nschoolchildren, it has been proven over and over again in other cities \nacross the Nation in a variety of studies.\n\n  It is important that we have parental involvement. It is important \nthat we have local determination. It is important that we not yield to \nWashington, DC, the capacity to impose uniform curricula and a uniform \nteaching methodology all across the country. It would stifle \ncreativity. It would impair achievement in a very, very significant \nway.\n  The Republican agenda for education has not been to centralize \neducation in Washington, DC. Our agenda, as expressed in this \nlegislative session, has been to give local schools block grants. It \nhas been to send them the power to do what they know they need to do.\n  I heard Congressman Goodling from the House talk about the \nPresident's plan to improve education with just one more test. We \nalready have between three and nine standardized tests every year for \nevery student in the country, according to USA Today.\n  Congressman Goodling put it this way: ``If you are trying to fatten \ncattle, they don't get fat by weighing them one more time.'' If you are \ntrying to educate students, they don't get smart just by being tested \none more time. Students not only have the regular tests of their \ninstructional regime, they also have these three to nine other tests \nwhich are taking instructional time. And they are telling us pretty \nclearly where we are educationally. We know where there is much to \nachieve, but weighing the cattle one more time, testing the students \none more time, will not make them fatter or smarter.\n  The truth of the matter is, the solution is to do things like the \nRepublicans have sought to do here, which is to get more capacity into \nthe hands of schools so that it can be devoted to students and \nteachers, not to the bureaucracy in Washington--a clear contrast.\n  The bureaucracy in Washington grows under President Clinton's ability \nto dictate, through the backdoor of testing, a curriculum and a \nteaching style in uniformity across America. Under the Republican \nproposals, instead of having a growing bureaucracy, you take the \nresource which would otherwise be sapped by the bureaucracy in \nWashington, and you target it on the schools, you give block grants to \nlocal schools.\n  Another Republican initiative, the A-plus accounts, gives parents \nchoices. Instead of taking parents out of the equation by saying we are \ngoing to have a national school board that no parent could afford to \ncome and talk to and that would impose a uniform regime all across \nAmerica, the Republican plan is to empower parents, to give parents \nchoice. Let parents invest resources so that they can send their \nchildren to the schools that the parents choose and invest those \nresources absent the kind of onerous tax burdens that parents normally \nwould have on their investments.\n  The President's agenda is more programs, more bureaucracies, more of \nWashington-knows-best. The Republican agenda is a commitment to local \nschools, local control, local education, the creativity, the pluralism, \nyes, the diversity and the energy that comes when we have local schools \nall across America.\n  There is an effort being made in this year's appropriations measure \nto harmonize the kind of demands that are being made by the \nadministration and the items that were passed in the Senate with items \nthat were passed in the House. I think it is fundamentally important \nthat we protect local schools. If we are not willing to stand up to \nprotect the local schools, the prerogative of parents to operate in \nthose schools, to be effective there, to get involved meaningfully in \nthe development of curriculum and the development of teaching \nmethodology, I think we will have failed in our duty.\n\n  I intend to do whatever I can, as we close this session--and I mean \n``whatever I can''--to make sure we arrive at a conclusion which makes \nit possible for parents to continue to have that kind of beneficial \nimpact.\n  At the end of this year the President and his bureaucrats seem to be \nwinning. America's children are losing. The block grants, which would \nhave cut the Washington bureaucracy by sending more funds directly to \nlocal school districts, were all but abandoned, and I commend the \noccupant of the Chair for having that idea, which is one of the best \nideas that has been offered to help education in this Congress in \ndecades.\n  Scholarships for needy children in the District of Columbia were \nfilibustered to death. Instead of giving parents the power to help \ntheir children in education, we lost on that ground. And the President \nhas indicated that, if we succeed on that ground, he will veto it.\n  On Tuesday, the Senate voted to kill A-plus accounts to help parents \npay for the costs of their children's education. At least the vote was \nto not allow that to go forward. We could not get cloture. So those who \nsought to reinforce the position of the President there deprived \nAmerica of another opportunity for parents to be beneficially involved.\n  We have lost on the block grants. We lost on the A-plus accounts. We \nlost on the scholarships for DC students that would empower parents.\n  A final ballot remains over national testing. It is a cause from \nwhich I do not intend to waiver.\n  I do not think Senators should pack their bags for the recess just \nyet. There are rights to defend. There are students whose interests are \nin the balance. I do not think we should sacrifice the next \ngeneration's education for a few extra days of rest at the end of this \nyear. I certainly do not intend to do so myself.\n  National tests would lead to a national curriculum. I think we can \nall understand that. The President keeps saying that the national \ntesting system he is proposing would be voluntary. He said these will \nall be voluntary. Do not worry. No school district would be required to \nbe involved in these tests.\n  That is what he said in Washington, DC. That is what he said in his \nState of the Union Message. That is what he said recently. Perhaps he \nthought we were not listening carefully when he was speaking in \nLansing, MI, on March 10 of this year, 1997. He put it this way:\n\n       I want to create a climate in which no one can say no, in \n     which it's voluntary but you are ashamed if you don't give \n     your kids the chance to do [these tests].\n\n  Here is a President who says this is to be voluntary, but he says he \nwants to make it so no one can say no. When the President has the \nability to control funding, and when he has the opportunity to give \ngrants and otherwise to make favorable or unfavorable decisions about \nwhat happens in schools, I doubt seriously whether there will be a real \nopportunity for these to be voluntary.\n  William Safire recently warned of the dangers of allowing the \nadministration's testing proposal. And I quote William Safire in his \neditorial from the New York Times op-ed page entitled ``Flunk that \nTest.'' He put it this way:\n\n       We're only talking about math and English, say the national \n     standard-bearers, and shucks, it's only voluntary.\n\n  I continue to quote Safire.\n\n       Don't believe that; if the nose of the camel gets under the \n     tent, the hump of a national curriculum, slavish teaching to \n     homogenizing tests, and a black market in answers would \n     surely follow.\n\n  You know, the evils of a national test have long been understood, not \njust by Republicans, but by Democrats as well, because they have \nunderstood that national testing ultimately dictates national \ncurricula.\n  Perhaps one of the most eloquent in that respect was Joseph Califano. \nJoseph Califano was the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare in \nthe Carter administration. When Joseph Califano was asked about \nnational\n\n[[Page S11854]]\n\ntests, he warned the American people. He put it this way:\n\n       Any set of test questions that the federal government \n     prescribed should surely be suspect as a first step toward a \n     national curriculum. . . . In its most extreme form, [Joseph \n     Califano went on to warn] national control of curriculum is a \n     form of national control of ideas.\n\n  We could have a long debate about the potential evils of national \ncontrol of ideas, but it is pretty clear to me that none of us believes \nthat Washington, DC, should control ideas. I think all of us understand \nthat if Washington, DC, controls things, it generally does not do them \nwell. As a matter of fact, what this country has controlled from \nWashington, DC, has not been exemplary. It has been an example of what \nto avoid rather than what to embrace.\n  When you are talking with individuals about the so-called tests which \nthey would impose, you have to wonder whether Washington's imposition \nof tests would be something like Washington's attempted imposition of \nthe standards for history, which they tried to develop at the end of \nthe last decade and early in the 1990's.\n  The National Endowment for the Humanities sought to develop a set of \nhistory standards telling us what we should know and what we should \nteach. What was interesting to me is that the standards tended to be \nfar more politically correct than they were historically correct.\n  When you are thinking about mathematics, I do not think we should \nthink about that which is politically correct or historically correct. \nWe should think about things that are arithmetically correct.\n  But here is what happened to the national history standards. The \nnational history standards were more interested in those who were \npolitically correct.\n  The standards slighted or ignored many central figures in U.S. \nhistory, particularly white males. To name a few, Robert E. Lee was \nleft out, Thomas Edison and the Wright brothers were left out, Paul \nRevere was left out, so we could have many, many references to the Ku \nKlux Klan, so we could have references to heroes from other continents.\n\n  The truth of the matter is the U.S. Senate understood what was \nhappening there and voted against those standards. I believe that these \nstandards were rejected unanimously in the Senate. George Will attacked \nthe failed history standards as ``cranky anti-Americanism.'' It didn't \nsurprise the American public. The American public has witnessed the \nFederal Government go awry, time after time after time on issue after \nissue after issue.\n  The proponents of the proposed national tests have indicated that \ntheir interest is in the whole math curriculum. As a matter of fact, \nwhen we found out what they were talking about with the whole math \ncurriculum we discovered they were talking about a rejection of \ncomputation. Computation is 3 times 6 is 18; 3 times 18 is 54; 4 times \n18 is 72. They reject that. One whole math proponent was quoted in the \nWall Street Journal as having said we can't ask students to say 6 times \n7 is 42, put down the 2, carry the 4. They said that is discriminatory. \nMost students can't do that, they are too dumb. That is ridiculous. Our \nstudents are smarter than that. They are not that dumb.\n  As a matter of fact, the only thing that will dumb down American \neducation is if we have low expectations. I have studies that show when \nyou have low expectations you get low performance. Here you have people \ndesigning the tests who want to run away from the ability of American \nstudents to compute. They want to supply everyone with a calculator so \nno one has to know the multiplication table and no one has to do things \nin his or her head. I think such dumbing down of America's educational \nperformance would be inappropriate.\n  Most importantly, it is fundamental that we maintain in this great \nland the ability of moms and dads to be at the focal point of \neducational policy and development and not bureaucrats in Washington, \nDC. It is fundamentally important that we maintain local control of \neducation rather than Washington control.\n  As we are working our way to see whether or not we can have an \nappropriations bill that maintains this balance, I want to say to the \nU.S. Senate that we have an obligation to stay here and work until we \ndo protect the rights and opportunities of the next generation for a \ndecent education by making sure that their parents are in charge, that \nlocal school boards and States are in charge, and that we don't forfeit \nthe prerogatives of education policy to bureaucrats in Washington, DC, \nwho would impose a kind of mindless ``dumbed down'' national curriculum \nwhich would fail to have the diversity and creativity and energy --\nespecially the energy--that comes from local involvement that we need.\n  I intend to do whatever I can and everything that is possible to make \nsure that we protect that prerogative. I hope Members of this body and \nMembers of the House will join me in doing so. As we are seeking in \nthese moments to reach an agreement with the White House in this \nrespect, I hope it will be their understanding that a plan to have a \nuniform stifling environment promulgated from Washington is not a plan \nfor a prosperous America but is a plan which would pull the educational \nrug out from under the feet of our children and would destroy our \ncapacity to compete in the next generation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, I rise again today to speak about the \nstate of the District of Columbia public schools, an issue that is \nextremely important to me. And I am happy to say, that for the first \ntime in the months that I've been bringing this issue to the attention \nof my colleagues, that there is some good news to report.\n  Behind me there are two articles from yesterdays papers declaring the \nnews that the advocacy group Parents United has settled its 5-year old \nlawsuit against the District over school repairs. I want to commend \nParents United, Judge Kaye Christian, Gen. Julius Becton, and the many \nstaff who were finally able to come to an agreement. The settlement \noutlines how repairs for these schools can take place as quickly as \npossible, with the least interruption of the school year as possible.\n  On paper, that is a good first step. But in concrete terms, the only \nthing this deal has done is to stop unnecessary school closings, which \nare clearly having a detrimental effect on morale and achievement. What \nabout the money and the orderly process for seeing that these repairs \nget accomplished? Look at Dr. Brimmer here and see what it boils down \nto: Congress. It boils down to us.\n  Yes there is included in this settlement a commitment on the part of \nthe control board to allocate money that the city borrows for school \nrepairs, but let me remind my colleagues that unless the city has a \nsustainable dedicated revenue stream to be used for bonding credit, who \nknows how much the city will be able to borrow? In years past the city \nwas considered essentially bankrupt, allowing for zero borrowing. How \nwill the school system be able to execute repairs on schedule with an \norderly process when they can't project a consistent budget?\n  Let's look at the money that is needed to get the schools fixed. \nBased on a GSA report, and the D.C.P.S. 2010 long range facilities \nmaster plan--we need a total of $2 billion to get the D.C. schools \nrepaired to code and modernized. The D.C.P.S. plan is a solid one, and \nit is broken into three phases: stabilization, functionality, and \nmodernization. The total cost is estimated at $200 million a year over \n10 years. Will Congress appropriate that kind of money? I think not--\nand history shows us so.\n  Look at the money that D.C.P.S. had available--through congressional \nappropriation and city borrowing--for school infrastructure improvement \nover the last few years: In 1996--$14.9 million; in 1995--$21.1 \nmillion; in 1994--$9.5 million; and in 1993--$8.8 million.\n  As you can see, Mr. President, this yearly allocation falls far short \nof $200 million. In fact, the average amount of money the District was \nable to spend on school repairs, over the last 10 years was $13.4 \nmillion. If we keep driveling money to the schools at that rate it\n\n[[Page S11855]]\n\nwill take the school system 150 years to meet their 10 year plan. How \nmany children will have to suffer if we wait 150 years?\n  There is a way for Congress to act responsibly. We must give the \nschools a dedicated revenue stream to bond with so that the $2 billion \ngoal can be met. But at present Congress has its hands tied by its own \nactions. In 1974 when Congress created home rule we denied Washington \nthe authority to be able to do what every other major city in an \ninterestate area can do--and that is tax it non-resident workers. This \nis not some new fangled idea.It is what every other city in America can \ndo to make sure its infrastructure and services are viable. I will \nspeak about how Washington can accomplish this and a larger goal in a \nminute.\n  But let's return to what happens when the schools don't have the \nmoney for repairs. The school year can't start on time. The upside of \nthe severe disruption to the school year that has taken place is this \nSeptember and October is that the focus of attention to the plight of \nour Nation's capital school system has never been greater. We have a \nlot of issues to deal with as national leaders, and bringing the focus \nto one school system is no easy task. But this is the school system of \nour Capital City--the school system that should be the flagship for \neducation in our country, not the sinking vessel it has become. And as \nthe leadership that created the control board, and created the \nemergency school board of trustees, and appropriates the city's funds \neach year we are responsible for turning this ship around.\n  Now, let's look for a second at the academic ramifications of a \nschool system in decay. Again, a piece of good news: the District of \nColumbia Public School system has a new chief academic officer, Arlene \nAckerman, and I had the chance to meet with her last week and enjoyed \nthat opportunity very much. Ms. Ackerman has done what any good manager \nwould and prescribed an evaluation to see where the students in her \ncharge are in terms of national standards. I have taken this \ninformation, which was released in the Washington Post last Thursday \nand let's see how that headline reads: ``Tests Indicate Many Students \nin D.C. Won't be Promoted. . . .''.\n\n  Now, I know this is appalling, but let me take you quickly through \nsome of the actual test results in reading and math. These statistics \nare based on the Stanford 9 Achievement Test that was administered last \nSpring.\n  As Arlene Ackerman said in her remarks when releasing these sorry \nstatistics, ``The lives of our children are at stake.'' And let me \nstate, for everyone listening, these children, the children of the \nNation's Capital, are our children. Every Member of this body has a \nresponsibility for their well being. And as you can see from these \nstatistics, we are not living up to that responsibility.\n  Is there a connection between Congress' annual appropriation process, \nthe D.C.P.S. infrastructure emergency and these unfortunate academic \ntest scores? You bet there is. As we saw earlier, every year that \nCongress appropriates far far less than the schools need for \ninfrastructure is like giving a dying man a drop or two of water. \nEventually the systems just wear out. In the process, you get low \nmorale, low academic achievement and outraged parents and students.\n  Look again at this article. That $487 million is only part of the \n$200 million a year I mentioned earlier. How are we going to get there? \nThe city needs to have a dedicated revenue stream so that they can bond \nfor infrastructure improvement. Where will that dedicated revenue \nstream come from?\n  A nonresident income tax that benefits the tax-payer, the Washington \nMetropolitan Region and the District schools is the answer. With my \nproposal, the economy in our ``Golden Crescent''--the area stretching \nfrom the District to Annapolis and as far west as Winchester, VA--gets \nan enormous boost. This bill creates an education and training \npartnership that would make it possible to fill the estimated 50,000 \navailable jobs in the D.C. metropolitan area that rely on information \ntechnology skills. Filling these jobs would boost our regional economy \nby $3.5 billion annually. More jobs = a stronger tax base = more \nconsumer spending = more home buying, and so forth.\n  Leaders in the private sector know the direct correlation between \nthose appalling test scores I just showed you and their bottom line. \nThey know the cost in decreased productivity when jobs go begging for \nlack of skilled employees. They know how much it costs to start \nrecruiting from all over the country and, some cases all over the \nworld.\n  The private sector I am speaking of resides in northern Virginia and \nsouthern Maryland. The payback to the counties in these States, if we \nfill these jobs and inject our local economy with that $3.5 billion a \nyear will be manifold. Far greater than the outlay the nonresident \nincome tax demands. And in the process we will be able, as a country, \nto feel pride in every aspect of our Nation's Capital.\n  I know the pride I feel each time I fly back to Washington, \nespecially at night, and see the beautiful monuments, all lit up. They \nsymbolize this great country and the founding fathers who upheld the \nintegrity and mission this country is built on. But I say to my \ncolleagues, these monuments are made of stone. The living testament to \nthe American system of government is it's children. Flesh and blood and \nthe inheritors of all that our Founding Fathers dreamed of. If we as \nU.S. Senators cannot make the future a great one for the children of \nAmerica's capital, then our pride in this city and its monuments is \nfraudulent. We must find a solution, and I challenge my colleagues to \nreview my proposal or show me a better one.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this afternoon, at this hour, we are \ndedicating the George Bush Library and the George Bush School of \nGovernment at Texas A University, which is in my hometown, and a \nschool that I taught at for 12 years. It is a place that is very close \nto my heart.\n\n[[Page S11856]]\n\n  We, today, live in a world that is very different than the world we \nlived in 10 years ago. The Berlin wall has come down, Eastern Europe \nhas been liberated, the Soviet Union has been transformed, and we have \nseen more people achieve their freedom than in any victory in any war \nin the history of mankind.\n  There are two people on this planet who have had more to do with that \nthan any other people who have lived, and those two people are Ronald \nReagan and George Bush.\n  Today, we honor George Bush with his library. We are proud of his \nachievements. But it is more than just his achievements, we are proud \nof George Bush. George Bush is a great man. George Bush is the kind of \nman you would want your son to grow up to be.\n  He is in many ways an old-fashioned man--as some would say, maybe \nfashion that is out of style today. But I don't think so. George Bush \nis the kind of man who tries and tries--tried as President and in \neverything in his life to try to figure out what was right--and he \ntried to figure out then how to do it.\n  George Bush is a man that has a keen sense of duty. And whether he \nwas a young naval officer risking his life for his country, or serving \nas President, when George Bush was on watch for America, he was \ndedicated to the task.\n  We are honoring him today in College Station. We are dedicating his \nschool and his library. Senator Hutchison and I are unable to be there \nbecause we are here doing the work of the people and doing our duty.\n  We wanted to take this opportunity to congratulate President Bush and \nhis family--to congratulate him on his great library; on what it will \nmean to Texas A and our State, and what it means to us.\n  I just simply wanted to say, Mr. President, to George Bush and to his \nfamily that we are all proud of you. We are proud of your Texas, and we \nlove you.\n  I yield whatever time she might use to Senator Hutchison.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to add my remarks to those of \nmy senior colleague.\n  We are so proud in Texas that President Bush is opening his library \ntoday. We are proud that he chose to do it in Texas because he had \nother home States that he could have chosen, but that he came to Texas \nwhere he had his roots, his business, and raised his family. It means a \nlot to us.\n  Also, I think what it is going to add to the intellectual commitment \nto Texas A, the foreign policy commitment to Texas A, and to all \nAmericans is going to be great. It is going to be a great contribution \nfor foreign policy debates; for leaders to come together. I think it is \ngoing to provide a diversity of views and opinions that will certainly \nenlighten all of us.\n  So, we are proud that the opening of the library is today. I know \nthat through the years we will all be very thankful that President Bush \nhas chosen to have a school and a place for people to discuss very \nimportant domestic and foreign policy issues. I know that he will \nprovide a fine quality of opportunity for all of us to learn from.\n  So I appreciate it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/06/senate-section/article/S11855-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11856-S11857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TEAMING WITH WILDLIFE\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to chat very briefly in \nmorning business concerning a matter that has come before the Senate \nfrom time to time that is of great interest to those of us in the \nWestern States. That is the national issue of what is termed ``Teaming \nWith Wildlife.''\n  The Teaming With Wildlife initiative has grown, and those of us in \nthe West recognize that we are very fortunate in having probably the \nbest area on Earth to fish, hunt, and explore the great outdoors. I \nknow the occupant of the Chair from the State of Oregon, and myself \nfrom the State of Alaska, are great boosters of that great outdoors \nwith unsurpassed natural beauty and wildlife, particularly the Western \nStates. I am not suggesting other States don't have the same. But \nperhaps ours is a little larger and the magnitude is a little greater. \nBut we have extraordinary natural beauty, wildlife, and I particularly \nlook forward every time I am back home in Alaska to enjoy the outdoors.\n  As chairman of the committee with jurisdiction overseeing our public \nlands in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I am well aware \nthat this bounty we enjoy doesn't come free. It takes huge sums of \nmoney to acquire and maintain our legacy of public lands which we \nenjoy. That is why I support providing additional funds to the States \nfor all outdoor recreation programs, including fish and wildlife \nconservation.\n  This brings me to the goals associated with the Teaming With Wildlife \nproposal, which I support along with many Alaskans, and I know many of \nmy colleagues in this body. But I would like to point out some of the \nconcerns because in the enthusiasm for Teaming With Wildlife some of \nthese things are overlooked. So let me share a few of them with you.\n  Mr. President, the proposal advanced by the International Association \nof Fish and Wildlife Agencies would impose a new tax on the American \npeople where that connection between the products being taxed and the \nuse of the tax revenue in some cases is tenuous, to say the least.\n  Mr. President, for decades hunters and anglers have worked very well \nin contributing to the management, conservation, and restoration of \nwildlife habitat and fisheries resources through an excise tax imposed \nat the manufacturing level. These targeted taxes have been a resounding \nsuccess for one reason. That reason, Mr. President, is there is a \ndirect link between the items taxed and the use of the tax revenue.\n  The Pittman-Robertson Act, for example, imposes an excise tax on \nsporting arms, on handguns, on ammunition and archery equipment. The \nWallop-Breaux fund does basically the same thing with fishing equipment \nand motorboat fuel. Money raised from this generates revenue that goes \ndirectly back in enhancing fishing and motoring in our various lakes \nand waterways. So States use the resulting tax revenue for the purchase \nand restoration of public wildlife habitat, and wildlife management \nresearch. Hunters like myself don't mind at all paying the extra tax on \nrifles and shells because we know that the revenue will be spent on \nincreasing and improving habitat where we can hunt and recreate.\n  Yet, the direct link--this is the key, Mr. President--between the \nitems taxed and the use of the resulting tax revenue is broader in the \nTeaming With Wildlife proposal. That legislative proposal would result \nin a tax being imposed on virtually everything from backpacks to tents, \nfrom hiking boots to sports utility vehicles, from film to binoculars. \nThe revenue would be used by States for a worthwhile purpose, which I \nsupport, of wildlife research planning, fishing and wildlife-associated \nrecreation, and research projects.\n  But the facts are that while many of the items being taxed would be \nused in the great outdoors to benefit the expanded use of the outdoors, \nmany of these products would not. We looked at a 1995 survey by the \nSports Market Research Group that indicates that 69 percent of all \nbackpacks sold--you might think they are going for camping--are used by \nschoolchildren while 27 percent of all sleeping bags sold are for \nindoor use. Is that a fair tax to those consumers?\n  Some suggest a new tax is not needed when an existing program could \nmeet many of the needs for outdoor recreation resources throughout the \nNation. Over 30 years ago, we created in Congress the Land and Water \nConservation Fund, the LWCF, for the sole purpose of meeting America's \nneeds for outdoor recreation, including the acquisition of property for \nfish and wildlife conservation purposes. Money in the fund would come \nfrom offshore oil and gas royalties--OCS activities off the shores of \nour various coastal States.\n  Up to 60 percent of the $900 million annually available is to be \npassed on to\n\n[[Page S11857]]\n\nthe States. Unfortunately, the States have not received any money from \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund for the past 4 years. And many in \nthis body have even forgotten the benefits of the program. What we have \ndone with that money is use it to reach our budget objectives, solely \nignoring the purpose of the program. I think we should do more to \nencourage the States to support offshore oil and gas development in a \nresponsible manner using our science and technology. As evidence is the \ntremendous development occurring in the Gulf of Mexico off Louisiana, \nTexas, and other areas. Perhaps we could by guaranteeing States some \nportion of the revenue from OCS activities. That would instill a sense \nof belonging and a sense of interest that those States currently don't \nhave.\n\n  Further, a portion of the Federal mineral receipts perhaps could be \nset aside in a dedicated permanent fund and the income generated from \nthe fund could be passed on to the States in the form of matching \ngrants for outdoor recreation. In many State parks in the West, \nincluding my State of Alaska, land was purchased with money from the \nland and water conservation Fund. And much of what Teaming with \nWildlife seeks to accomplish should be done with funds generated from \nsuch areas. I think offshore oil and gas development would gain us a \nbroader support necessary to pass legislation such as Teaming with \nWildlife, and I think we must explore fully using existing funding \nresources to help meet these laudable goals because I fear that we are \ngoing to have a hard time differentiating just what portion is a \nlegitimate tax on this broad area, as I have indicated before that we \nhave identified, including sleeping bags, film, binoculars, hiking \nboots, and so forth.\n  I encourage those who are interested to help us as we address \nresponsibly how to fund equitably for this purpose of Teaming with \nWildlife that, indeed, addresses those who are active in utilizing the \ngreat outdoors and purchase legitimate items that can be legitimately \nattached without getting into the situation where we are in dispute \nover the portion and the formula and the use.\n  So as chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \nI am committed to help bringing the States together to meet the growing \ndemand for fish and wildlife habitat, for outdoor recreation resources, \nand I certainly encourage all Alaskans to join me in providing input on \nwhat we think is a fair and workable method to raise funds for the \ngreat outdoors and not overlooking the intention of the land and water \nconservation fund which has been, I think it is fair to say, observed \nby the budgeteers as a place to pick up significant funding to meet \nsome of our budget obligations.\n  So I thank my colleagues for their indulgence and encourage everyone \nto work in a positive manner to meet the challenges associated with \nTeaming with Wildlife for a fair and equitable funding mechanism.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/06/senate-section/article/S11856-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11857-S11858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NUCLEAR WASTE STORAGE\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, seeing no other Senators on the floor, \nI wish to address my views on the passage of the nuclear waste \nlegislation by the U.S. House of Representatives, which occurred last \nweek.\n  Mr. President, last week Congress took a very important step toward \nending our Nation's 15-year struggle with how to solve our high-level \nnuclear waste problem. Last week, the House passed H.R. 1270 by an \noverwhelming, bipartisan 307-to-120 vote. The House bill is a companion \nto S. 104, the nuclear waste bill passed by the Senate by a 65-to-34 \nvote last spring.\n  Like the Senate bill, the House bill would take nuclear waste from 80 \nsites in 40 States, from the backyards of our constituents all across \nthis land, and move it to one safe, central storage site. The Federal \nGovernment has a contractual commitment to take this nuclear waste for \nsafe and central storage by next January.\n  Will that happen? The answer is clearly ``no,'' even though over $13 \nbillion has been collected from America's ratepayers to pay for the \npermanent storage of that waste, and even though a Federal court order \nhas reaffirmed the Government's legal obligation to take nuclear waste \nin January 1998. The same court is now considering what remedy the \nGovernment must provide for its failure to meet this obligation. This \nis the Government's failure, but it is the American taxpayer that is \ngoing to bear the burden. The American public paid that $13 billion \ninto the nuclear waste fund and now will have to pay a second time. \nEstimates of potential damages for the failure of the Department of \nEnergy to meet its obligations range from $40 billion to as high as $80 \nbillion. That is $1,300 per American family.\n\n  How important is the nuclear power industry in this country? It \ncontributes around 22 percent of the total power generation in this \ncountry. It provides electricity with no emissions, so air quality is \nnot a problem. The problem is what do you do with the waste? You cannot \nthrow it up in the air. It has to come down somewhere. The reality is \nthat no one wants it. The French reprocess their spent fuel and recover \nthe plutonium, put it back in the reactors and burn it. The Japanese \nare moving in that direction, as well.\n  We are hopelessly tied to a dilemma: no one wants nuclear waste and \nwe don't have any place to put it. Some of the plants are reaching \ntheir maximum capacity. Without the licensing of proper storage and \nwithout the Federal Government meeting its obligations to take this \nwaste, we stand to lose a significant portion of our Nation's nuclear \ngenerating capacity.\n  How are we going to make up for this lost generation? Are we going to \nput more coal fired plants on-line? How does the Clinton administration \nreconcile this position with their professed concern about emissions? \nIf we lose a portion of our nuclear power generating capability, it is \ngoing to have to be replaced with something, and the Clinton \nadministration has not provided us with any answers. Nor has it \nadequately addressed its contractual responsibility to take this waste.\n  Mr. President, without the legislation passed by the both the House \nand the Senate, there is no plan for action except more lawsuits, more \nemployment for the lawyers. As we move to conference, opponents of the \nbill will continue to sing the same old, tired refrain. They call it \n``Mobile Chernobyl,'' emasculating NEPA, running roughshod over our \nenvironmental laws. These scare tactics are a coverup, an excuse for no \naction. That is what we have had so far, no action in 15 years.\n  They will say the fuel is safely stored where it is. It is stored in \ntemporary facilities next to the reactors that were designed for just \nthat, temporary storage. But if it is safely stored where it is, then \nwhy isn't it safe to store it in Nevada at the Nevada test site, near \nwhere we have spent over $6 billion to develop a site that is facing, \nin the near future, licensing and suitability decisions? In fact, there \nis no question in my mind it must be safer to have one central, \nmonitored site than to have nuclear waste at 80 sites scattered around \nthe country at facilities that have been designed for temporary \nstorage.\n  Then, of course, they argue that somehow it is unsafe to move nuclear \nfuel to one central site. But we have shown how we have been safely \nmoving fuel around this country and abroad for many, many years. The \nFrench, the Japanese, and the Swedes move it by vessel, they move it by \nrail, they move it by truck.\n  They say the transportation casks cannot stand a 30-mile-per-hour \ncrash or survive a diesel fuel fire. These are more emotional arguments \nthat have no foundation. We have shown that the casks have been tested \nby locomotives going 90 miles an hour crashed into brick walls. They \nhave been submerged in water, bathed in fire. The casks are designed to \nwithstand any type of imaginable impact associated with transportation. \nWe have shown that, while we have had a few minor accidents, there has \nnever been a release of radiation. We have shown how our national \nlaboratories have certified that\n\n[[Page S11858]]\n\nthe transportation casks can survive any real-world crash. They say the \nradiation protection standard is unsafe. We have shown how our standard \nis more protective than the current EPA guidance that allows five times \nas much, and we will allow EPA to tighten the standards further if need \nbe.\n  The doomsayers say the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board says \nthere is no compelling or technical or safety reason to move fuel to a \ncentral location. We have shown that a more complete reading of the \ntechnical review report and testimony indicates that there is a need \nfor an interim storage and that there is a need for it at Yucca \nMountain, if, indeed, Yucca is determined to be suitable for a \npermanent repository.\n  They say, ``We can delay the decision.'' We have shown that delay is \nwhat got us into this mess in the first place; inactivity. Any time \nnow, the courts will tell us what damages we will face when the \nGovernment is in breach of its contract. With each delay, the damages \nare going to mount. With each delay, the liability of the taxpayer will \nmount. With each delay, there will be pressure to yield a further \ndelay. That is the way this place works. When we have a problem, we \nsimply delay. The call for delay is a siren song and, ultimately, a \ntrap.\n  We stand at a crossroads. The job of solving this problem is ours. \nThe time for solving the problem is now. We have made much progress at \nYucca Mountain. The 5-mile exploratory tunnel is complete. We can build \non this progress. Both the Senate and House bill contain site \ncharacterization activities for the permanent repository. But we cannot \nput all our eggs in the Yucca basket. We need a temporary storage \nfacility now or we are going to be storing spent fuel all across the \nNation for decades to come. We can choose whether this Nation needs 80 \ninterim storage sites or just one. Where is that? The arid, remote, \nNevada test site where we exploded scores of nuclear bombs during the \ncold war. It is a safe, remote location. It is monitored, and it is \nappropriate for an interim site.\n  If Yucca Mountain is licensed, it will be an easy task to move the \nspent fuel a short distance to the repository. If Yucca is not licensed \nand is found to be unsuitable, we will need a centralized interim site \nanyway, so we will be way ahead of the game. Regardless of what happens \nat Yucca, this is a responsible step that we should take.\n\n  Mr. President, the time is now. This legislation passed the House and \nthe Senate. It is the answer. I urge my colleagues over the recess to \nreflect on the merits of our obligation to take this waste, to \nrecognize the dependence we have on the nuclear industry, and move to \ntake a responsible position to uphold the contract that has been made \nby the Government to take this waste in conformance with the terms of \nthe agreement and the $13 billion paid by the ratepayers.\n  For those who are still in doubt as to the merits of this \nlegislation, I encourage them to recognize that it is irresponsible to \nobject to what has happened in both the House and the Senate without \nproviding an alternative. The development of this legislation has \nrequired a great deal of time and effort and a great deal of \nexamination of alternatives. So I hope the critics come up with a \nworkable alternative, as opposed to just criticism of the plan that is \ncurrently pending in the Congress of the United States, to meet our \nobligations to address the high-level nuclear waste issue.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 35 years ago today, the people of \nMassachusetts made the very wise decision to send Edward M. Kennedy to \nCongress. For 35 years, Ted Kennedy has fought for their interests--and \nfor the interests of all working people.\n  It is said that some people seek public office to be someone; others \nseek it in order to do something. Ted Kennedy is a pre-eminent example \nof the latter. For 35 years, he has fought unwaveringly to improve the \nliving standards of working families and to make sure that, in America, \nif you're sick, you can see a doctor--no matter how much money you \nhave, or how little.\n  He has used his great, booming voice to speak for those who have no \nvoice, and he has never wavered in his principles. Ted Kennedy does not \nchange his politics with the season. He is a man of principle.\n  At the same time, he is a pragmatist who wants, more than anything, \nto get things done.\n  I will never forget how he looked after the balanced budget agreement \nwas signed and the new children's health care program was created. He \ncame into my office. His Irish eyes were smiling. To everyone he passed \nhe said, ``Isn't it wonderful?'' He looked so much like a proud new \nfather--I half-expected him to start handing out cigars.\n  When he spoke about that victory, he didn't talk about how many votes \nhis plan had gotten. He talked about how many children it would help.\n  In 35 years, he has never forgotten the reason he is here. It's not \nabout strategy, or abstract policy. It's about people.\n  The struggle to create the children's health plan also illustrates \nanother of the basic truths about Ted Kennedy. There are those who view \nmy friend as an inflexible liberal. While he would claim the liberal \nlabel with pride, Ted Kennedy is one of the most flexible people in \nthis Chamber.\n  Ask his friend, Orrin Hatch. People call them the Odd Couple. I'll \nlet my colleagues decide for themselves who is Felix Unger, and who is \nOscar Madison.\n  Ted Kennedy takes his work seriously, but he doesn't take himself too \nseriously. His staff Christmas parties and his costumes are legendary \non the Hill. But not many people off the Hill know that one year he \ncame as Milli--or was it Vanilli?--and last year he and Vicki appeared \nas 2 of the 101 dalmations.\n  Sometimes when I am on this floor, I look up to the gallery to see \nthe people who have come here to see this great institution at work. I \ncan always tell when Ted Kennedy has walked on to the floor by the \nreactions of the people in the gallery. Invariably, people will sit up. \nSomeone will lean over and whisper to the person next to them, ``Look, \nTed Kennedy.''\n  He is, undoubtedly, the best known and most recognized Member of this \nbody. Yet, he remains a modest man. He is a worker among workers.\n  No one in our caucus works harder. He's often the first one to work \nin the morning, and the last person to leave at night.\n  No job is too small for Ted Kennedy.\n  At the same time, no challenge is too big.\n  He comes from a family that understands the American dream. And he is \ndetermined to keep that dream alive for a new generation of Americans.\n  Senator Kennedy's family also understands heartbreak. Carved into the \ndesk in which he sits are the names of his two brothers who sat there \nbefore him, John and Robert. Two brothers who were taken from him, and \nus, because of their commitment to public service.\n  Many people--perhaps most people--who had suffered such loss might \nwithdraw from public service, in fear or anger. They might conclude, \nrightly, that their family had given enough.\n  But not Ted Kennedy.\n  He has stayed here and he worked.\n  To some of us, he is an inspiration. To others, he is, frankly, an \nirritation. But he is the same sort of irritation that the speck of \nsand is to the oyster. Because of him, we have produced pearls.\n  We passed the Kennedy-Kassebaum Health Care Portability Act and the \nChildren's Health Care Act.\n  We raised the minimum wage.\n  As long as here is here, I know that Ted Kennedy will continue to \nfight for better health care for all Americans, for educational \nopportunity, and economic justice.\n  If history is any guide, he will move this body, and this Nation, \nforward on all those fronts.\n  I am proud to call him my colleague and my friend.\n\n[[Page S11859]]\n\n  I congratulate him today on 35 years of service in the Senate to his \nState and to his country.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/06/senate-section/article/S11858-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11859]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FAST-TRACK LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I agree with President Clinton's goal of \ncreating economic growth through more export opportunities, but I must \nvote against this legislation to renew fast-track authority because it \nfails to protect our workers and our environment.\n  I understand that exports are a key ingredient of Vermont's economic \ngrowth. As a small State, we must rely on selling our products beyond \nthe Green Mountains. Exports give Vermonters the opportunity to create \ngood jobs right here in Vermont through rising trade. For instance, \nCabot Creamery recently made headlines by selling its Vermont-made \ncheddar cheese in London, England.\n  Vermonters are reaping the benefits of more open markets around the \nworld, where we can sell our high quality goods. Since 1992, Vermont \nexports are up 29 percent, with 70,000 Vermonters now working in \nexport-related jobs. On a per capita basis, Vermont is the largest \nexporter of goods among the 50 States. We just need to look at the \nVermont expansion of Husky, a Canadian company with European plants, to \nunderstand the importance of trade in the world economy.\n  I will continue to work with Vermonters to encourage exporting of our \ngoods and services as a path for prosperity for ourselves, our \nchildren, and our grandchildren.\n  But trade is about more than economic statistics, it is a moral issue \nas well. Just as the fight to ban landmines worldwide is the right \nthing to do, free trade must also be fair. Fair trade expands exporting \nopportunities. But just as importantly, fair trade safeguards our \nstandard of living by supporting our absolute right to a clean \nenvironment and sound labor practices.\n  In earlier times workers' rights and environmental concerns were \nmostly separated from trade considerations, but that has begun to \nchange. In today's global economy, the interaction between trade and \nthe rights of workers and environmental protections cannot be ignored. \nOne of the reasons I voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement \n[NAFTA] was because it contained side agreements on labor and \nenvironmental issues--the first trade agreement to ever link these \nissues together.\n  But, unfortunately, this fast-track authority bill moves away from \nthe critical link between trade and labor and the environment that we \nfought so hard to forge in NAFTA. Under the terms of this bill, even \nthe modest labor and environmental side agreements under NAFTA would be \nexcluded from fast-track consideration. That is unacceptable.\n  Like the NAFTA debate, the rhetoric on both sides of this debate is \noverblown. I do not believe the lack of fast-track authority will \ncripple future trade negotiations. Since fast-track authority lapsed in \n1994, the administration has successfully negotiated hundreds of trade \npacts with countries around the world. As the world's only superpower \nwith a market of more than 250 million consumers, the United States \nwill continue to command the economic power to open markets and expand \nexport opportunities with or without the President having fast-track \nauthority.\n  I do not believe the Congress should lightly hand over its right to \namend, even in the consideration of trade agreements. In no other area \nof legislation does Congress give up its constitutional right to offer \namendments. If the Congress has no more recourse on these issues than \nto vote trade agreements up or down, the key question to ask is: Does \nthis bill give the President the authority to negotiate trade \nagreements that protect the rights of all our citizens? It does not.\n  I had hoped that when fast-track legislation reached the Senate floor \nit would have allowed for expanding export opportunities while \nprotecting our workers and our environment. This bill fails to deliver \nthose necessary protections. As a result, I will vote against it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/06/senate-section/article/S11859-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11859]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONGRATULATIONS TO JERRY B. HEDRICK\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Jerry \nHedrick as he retires from 22 years of service to Hoechst Marion \nRoussel, the largest pharmaceutical company in the State of Missouri. \nJerry is known for his expertise in the fields of health care and \npublic policy, and has been a mentor to many persons involved in those \nfields.\n  Jerry began his career in 1975 with the pharmaceutical industry as a \nconsultant when he joined Marion Laboratories, a predecessor company to \nMarion Merrell Dow Inc. and Hoechst Marion Roussel. Through Jerry's \noutstanding talents and dedication he has distinguished himself in the \npharmaceutical industry as the vice president of government affairs for \nHoechst Marion Roussel since August 1995.\n  Upon graduation from college, Jerry worked as a teacher, and he \ncontinues to work with young people through his volunteering with the \nHeart of America Council of the Boy Scouts of America and the Dream \nFactory, an organization dedicated to granting the wishes of very ill \nchildren. I commend Jerry for the outstanding service he provides to \nhis community. As our Nation looks increasingly to individuals to \nbecome more active in the work of the community, Jerry's commitment \nprovides an example for others to follow.\n  Jerry also generously gives his time to the Greater Kansas City \nChamber of Commerce, the Midwest Bioethics Center where he is one of \nthe founding trustees, the Advisory Council at Emporia State \nUniversity, and the American Quarter Horse Association as the Kansas \nState director.\n  I have had the opportunity to work with Jerry on several occasions \nand have always considered him to be a person of knowledge and insight. \nHis dedication to the advancement of health care in America is truly \nadmirable.\n  I urge the Senate to join me in bidding Jerry Hedrick a fond \nfarewell, and wishing him, his wife, Bev, and his daughter, Ginger, the \nvery best as they move on to face new challenges, opportunities, and \nrewards.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/06/senate-section/article/S11859-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11859-S11860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE ``SAVER'' BILL\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, as an original cosponsor along with \nSenator Grassley, I am pleased to strongly support the SAVER bill, \nSavings Are Vital to Everyone's Retirement Act of 1997. This measure is \na bi-partisan effort on the part of my colleague, Senator Grassley, and \nI to help ensure that all Americans are adequately prepared for \nretirement. As the ranking member of the Special Committee on Aging, I \nhave learned that there is a critical need to educate Americans on the \nneed to save for their retirement. Mr. President, only one-half of all \nAmerican workers have pensions. A mere one-third of Americans have ever \ntried to calculate how much money they need for retirement. And less \nthan one-fifth of the workforce is confident that they have saved \nenough to live comfortably after they retire. Having become aware of \nthis, Senator Grassley and I have introduced a piece of legislation \nthat takes the first step in educating the public about the need to \nplan ahead.\n  Mr. President, as my colleague has just told you, our legislation \nwill create an education project to raise public awareness about \npersonal savings. It directs the U.S. Department of Labor to maintain \nan ongoing program of education and outreach to the public. The program \nincludes public service announcements, public meetings and the \ndistribution of educational materials. It sets up an Internet site \ndedicated to promoting individual retirement savings. Americans will be \nable to log on to the site and complete a worksheet to calculate how \nmuch they need to save to adequately supplement their projected Social \nSecurity benefits when they retire.\n  The SAVER bill also directs the Department of Labor to provide \ninformation to small businesses on how they\n\n[[Page S11860]]\n\ncan set up pension programs for their employees. The proposed \ninformation includes a plain English description of the common types of \nretirement savings arrangements available to individuals and employers; \na way to calculate estimated retirement savings; and an explanation of \nhow to establish different savings arrangements for workers.\n  Finally, SAVER calls for a national summit on retirement savings to \nbring the urgency of our Nation's extremely low saving rate to the top \nof the public agenda. The event would serve as a catalyst for future \npolicy discussion on how to best increase personal retirement savings \nas well as accessibility and participation in pension plans. The summit \nwill represent the kind of public-private cooperation that is so \ncrucial to preserving successful retirement programs for future \ngenerations of Americans. The Department of Labor will work closely \nwith the American Savings Education Council [ASEC] to bring together \ndelegates from all over the country to develop a broad-based public \neducation program on retirement savings. As Senator Grassley correctly \npointed out, ASEC is an organization uniquely equipped to assist us in \nour efforts. Their input in both the logistical and conceptual \norganization of this event will help us create a top-notch program. At \nthe summit, participants will identify barriers that prevent many \nAmericans from setting aside enough money for their retirement and \nbarriers that discourage employers--especially small business--from \nhelping their employees accumulate more savings for their retirement.\n  Mr. President, as we move forward with reforming Social Security and \nMedicare, we must also provide more Americans with the incentives they \nneed to better prepare for their retirement. Our SAVER bill not only \ngives Americans the tools they need to determine how much personal \nsavings they need to supplement their Social Security benefits, it also \nraises awareness of the responsibility individuals have for planning \nfor their future.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the SAVER bill is the first step that \nthis Congress must take in assisting all Americans in their quest for a \ncomfortable, happy retirement. I urge my colleagues to join us in \nsupporting this measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/06/senate-section/article/S11859-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ONGOING TRADE CASES AND FAST TRACK\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with the \nsenior Senator from Texas. I would like to clarify a statement \nregarding salmon imports that the Senator made during yesterday's \ndebate on the motion to proceed to the fast track negotiating \nauthority. Would the Senator agree that his comments yesterday were not \nintended to suggest any connection between the fast track legislation \nthat is before the Senate and any pending trade cases regarding salmon \nimports from Chile?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am pleased to respond to the inquiry from \nmy colleague from Maine. I would fully agree that there is nothing in \nthe fast track legislation that would affect any ongoing trade cases \ninvolving salmon, or indeed any other product. My comments were \nintended to underscore the impact of trade on consumers and in no way \nshould be interpreted as affecting any of the formal processes involved \nwith reviewing the pending salmon cases or suggesting that the fast \ntrack legislation would affect any pending salmon trade cases.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Would the Senator also agree that the passage of fast \ntrack authority would in no way countenance the continuation of any \npractices by the Chilean salmon industry that are in violation of \nUnited States trade laws?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, that is also correct. This is a procedural \nbill regarding negotiations. It does not change any of our existing \nlaws regarding unfair trade practices.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Senator for this clarification.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am happy to do so and appreciate the inquiry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/06/senate-section/article/S11860-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to briefly \ndiscuss a program presently being developed by the Library of Congress.\n  The law librarian of Congress, Dr. Rubens Medina, briefed me this \nmorning on the efforts the law library has undertaken in recent years \nto put together an international legal database containing the texts of \nlaws of some 35 foreign countries. The data base comprises abstracts of \nlegal material, the full authentic texts of laws and regulations, and a \nlegal thesaurus. It is structured so that the full range of legal \nmaterial including constitutions, laws and regulations, judicial \ndecisions, parliamentary debates, and legal miscellanea can be added \nover time as participating countries are able to contribute the \nmaterial. The material is available over the Internet in its entirety \nto officials of those countries who agree to participate in making \ntheir laws available on the system; in addition, a summary in both \nEnglish and the language of the country of origin will be available to \nthe general public.\n  This network, called the Global Legal Information Network or GLIN, \nwill enable Members of Congress and their staffs and the Library \nstaff--as well as our counterparts in participating countries--to \naccess the most current and authentic versions of other countries' \nlaws, something that is increasingly important in this day and age when \nwe deal so frequently with international trade and security issues. \nCongress should acknowledge and salute this effort by its Library, and \nbe proud that it was created in and enhanced by the legislative branch \nand that the library is taking the international leadership role on the \nproject.\n  As additional recognition of the viability and importance of this \nproject, and one that interests me as the chairman of the Subcommittee \non East Asian and Pacific Affairs, Dr. Medina informed me that the \nSecretary of State will be proposing at the forthcoming ministerial \nmeeting of the 18 APEC nations in Vancouver, BC, next month that each \nAPEC country seriously consider joining GLIN and suggesting that an \ninformational meeting on GLIN be held early in 1998.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to be involved in some way in this \nmonumental project, one in which the joint efforts of the executive and \nlegislative branches can capitalize on technological achievements to \nadvance international cooperation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, a Vermonter who is on active duty in the \nU.S. Army contacted me recently to let me know of his support for a ban \non antipersonnel landmines. He wrote from personal experience, and his \ncomments mirrored those I have received from so many other servicemen \nand women who have seen first-hand the danger these weapons pose to our \nown troops.\n  Here is what he wrote:\n\n       In the many training exercises in which I have \n     participated, landmines were relatively ineffective in \n     disrupting enemy attacks. Landmines often caused fratricide \n     casualties\n\n[[Page S11861]]\n\n     among one's own troops. The locations of the training \n     landmines were almost never properly recorded. The modern \n     battlefield is simply too fluid and complex to accurately \n     keep track of all the landmines that are emplaced. Under \n     actual combat conditions, these landmines will represent a \n     certain threat to the lives of U.S. personnel.\n\n  Mr. President, compare that to a recent U.S. Army report which \nconcluded that landmines contributed to the high rate of fratricide \nduring recent exercises at Fort Irwin, CA. Air-dropped landmines, the \nso-called smart mines that the Pentagon claims pose no danger to U.S. \ntroops or civilians, were the biggest single cause of friendly-fire \ndeaths during mock battles. Of the 82 soldiers that were ``killed'' by \nfriendly fire, 45 of them were victims of their own landmines. In one \nincident, an Army unit drove into its own mines dropped by aircraft, \nresulting in what would have been 23 deaths in a real war.\n  Now compare that to our experience in Vietnam, where over 64,000 \nAmericans were killed or injured by landmines. The vast majority of \nthose casualties resulted from U.S. mines, or mines containing U.S. \ncomponents. In other words, we made the mines and took them over there, \nand they ended up killing our own people. I wonder how many times \nhistory has to repeat itself before we get the message.\n  A veteran of the Persian Gulf war described the same danger of \nfratricide. He said:\n\n       I spoke to numerous military officers who agreed * * * that \n     they would never employ scatterables (the air-dropped mines) \n     in their area of operations, even if those scatterables were \n     designed to self-destruct after a short period of time. Why? \n     They were simply not prepared to risk the lives of their \n     soldiers on the promise that the technology would work as \n     designed. The fact is that U.S. ground warfare doctrine is \n     `maneuver' warfare doctrine--highly mobile, able to take \n     advantage of the terrain, exploit the weakness of the enemy \n     on the battlefield. A commander who uses anti-personnel \n     mines--except in the most exigent, Alamo-like situation--\n     is deliberately reducing his or her battlefield advantage \n     of speed and flexibility.\n\n  Mr. President, despite this, the Pentagon insists that landmines \nprotect our troops. It is the same old story. Years ago, they said we \ncould not do without biological weapons. They said the same about \nchemical weapons, which they called the most effective weapon history \nhas ever known. They said if we gave up Okinawa that we would \nirreparably undermine our security in the Pacific. They fought the \nnuclear test ban. And now they say that landmines, which have \nconsistently plagued our own forces in battle, protect American lives.\n  I respect our military leaders and I support a defense second to \nnone. But I am losing patience with the Pentagon's arguments. They \nsimply fly in the face of the evidence. Their latest arguments about \nthe need for antipersonnel mines to defend antitank mines wither under \nclose scrutiny. Unfortunately, too many people, including some in the \nWhite House, accept the Pentagon's arguments as gospel, and don't ask \nthe hard questions.\n  From my off-the-record conversations with Pentagon officials it is \nobvious to me that the real problem is that they do not want to give up \na weapon, regardless of how marginal its utility or how dangerous it is \nto our own troops, because they are loath to encourage so-called arms \ncontrol activists from trying to ban other weapons that endanger \ncivilians. I understand their fear, because unlike a century ago when \nthe overwhelming majority of war casualties were soldiers, being a \nsoldier in a war today is far safer than being a civilian. The \noverwhelming majority of war casualties today are civilians.\n  That is hardly a reason to stay outside of a treaty that offers the \nbest hope for riding the world of a weapon that is both inhumane and \nmilitarily unnecessary. When the Pentagon argues that our ``smart'' \nmines do not cause the humanitarian problem, I ask them to consider \nthat as long as we stay outside the treaty we are part of the \nhumanitarian problem because there will never be an international ban \nwithout the United States. And I ask them to consider the evidence. \nGiven the danger our own mines pose to our troops, we should shop using \nthem for that reason alone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/06/senate-section/article/S11860-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11861-S11862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          SOUTH DAKOTA COMMUNITY FOUNDATION'S 10TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to pay tribute to a key \ninstitution in my State, the South Dakota Community Foundation [SDCF], \nwhich celebrates its 10th anniversary on November 11, 1997. This \nstatewide community foundation is a model of how private funds are \nraised within communities to support projects that enable those \ncommunities to enter the 21st century in a competitive position--people \nhelping themselves.\n  As with many success stories, the SDCF was launched by a group of \npeople with the vision of raising and investing funds with the goal of \ncreating an environment in which South Dakota communities can \nrevitalize themselves. This vision was embraced by the critical early \nstage investors providing seed funding, yielding, as we do in our \nfarmland, a rich harvest 10 years later.\n  I must take my hat off to the vision and drive of then-South Dakota \nState senator and now SDCF executive director, Bernie Christenson, and \nthe active support by our late Governor, George Mickelson. I regret \nGeorge is not alive to see the legacy of his actions in 1987, but his \nspirit lives with us through this foundation and in every one of the \ncommunities it helps.\n  That seed funding for the SDCF came from the 3M Foundation, McKnight \nFoundation and the South Dakota Legislature. I congratulate the leaders \nof those 3 institutions. The success of the SDCF is also a testament to \nformer South Dakota native, former 3M CEO, and McKnight Foundation \nfounder, William McKnight. We can all learn from William McKnight about \nthe value of giving back to the community and institutions that helped \nshape our lives. The State of South Dakota and the 3M Foundation each \ncontributed $2 million, and the McKnight Foundation committed up to $3 \nmillion in a challenge grant. Less than 13 months later, Bernie and \nGeorge had raised $3 million to meet that first challenge; the \nfoundation was off and running with a $10 million fund.\n  Ten years after its creation, the South Dakota Community Foundation \nhas reached the $20 million mark and administers these funds through a \nwide range of unrestricted, designated and donor-advised funds. This \nhas been accomplished over the years through the leadership, \ncommitment, and hard work of Bernie Christenson, an administrative \nassistant, and countless board members, including the current board \npresident, Paul Christen.\n  I am pleased that the Northwest Area Foundation has joined its \nneighboring twin cities-based foundations, 3M and McKnight, in \nproviding funds to the South Dakota Community Foundation. In a letter \nsent last year to northwest area president, Karl Stauber, I strongly \nurged support for the SDCF plan to challenge communities to join SDCF \nin raising capital to endow small community loan funds that would be \nused to help existing businesses expand and to assist entrepreneurs in \nstarting new businesses, with the goal of long-term community \nrevitalization. Bernie and my staff coordinated a short tour of South \nDakota communities and projects for Karl late last year. It is \nimportant for foundations as well as federal agencies to get out from \nbehind the desk and see close up the commitment and innovation \nflourishing in our communities. Just before closing down the foundation \ngrantmaking for a year of strategic planning, Northwest Area Foundation \ncommitted its support to this project and 10 communities have now \nstepped up to the challenge and matched the foundation funds with their \nown.\n  I am reminded of a letter President Franklin D. Roosevelt sent to \nSouth Dakota Governor Harlan Bushfield in 1939 on the occasion of South \nDakota's 50th anniversary of its entry into the Union.\n  President Roosevelt said, ``The 50 years that have elapsed since \nSouth Dakota became a State have witnessed the end of one period of \npioneering and the ushering in of another.''\n  Mr. President, nearly 60 years after Franklin Roosevelt wrote that \nletter, we in the Northern Great Plains are in a transition toward yet \nanother era, confronted now by tremendous global economic forces and \ndeclining Federal support for key economic development activities and \ninstitutions.\n\n[[Page S11862]]\n\n  These public/private partnerships exemplified by the South Dakota \nCommunity Foundation--lean but effective in its management, guided by \nlocal development officials, and supported by individual, corporate, \nand foundation investors--are critical institutions in helping the \nNorthern Great Plains make this transition.\n  I pledge to lend my active support and encouragement to the South \nDakota Community Foundation so we can return to Brookings, SD in \nanother 10 years and celebrate continued community vitality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/06/senate-section/article/S11861-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       LADIES AUXILIARY TO THE VETERANS OF FOREIGN WARS POST 2966\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it is a distinct honor for me to \ncongratulate the ladies auxiliary to the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post \n2966 in Scotland, SD. On Saturday, members of the ladies auxiliary will \nbe celebrating their 50th anniversary. This year marks five decades of \noutstanding service and support by the auxiliary to the Veterans of \nForeign Wars and to the Scotland community.\n  The ladies auxiliary to the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 2966 \nreceived its charter on January 3, 1947. A group of 16 women were among \nthe organization's charter members. I ask that their names be included \nin the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  As my colleagues know, the stated mission of the ladies auxiliary to \nany Veterans of Foreign Wars post is to promote patriotism and to \nmaintain and extend freedom and equal rights to all Americans. For the \npast 50 years, the members of the ladies auxiliary in Scotland have \nbeen fulfilling that mission, and they have distinguished themselves \nwith outstanding service to veterans and the community.\n  Some of the most important work these women have done over the years \nincludes service and support to our veterans. Members of the ladies \nauxiliary pride themselves on doing a great deal of volunteer work in \nveterans hospitals and in nursing homes, as well as fundraising for \ncancer research.\n  I would also like to point out that members of the ladies auxiliary \nof the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 2966 reach out to young people and \nother nonveterans in the Scotland community. For instance, they conduct \neducational youth programs to promote patriotism. They also serve as \nmuch-needed role models to young people and provide examples to us all \nabout what it means to serve one's country.\n  Mr. President, the members of the ladies auxiliary to the Veterans of \nForeign Wars Post 2966 deserve to be commended for their 50 years of \npatriotism and service. As we prepare to celebrate Veterans Day next \nweek, I know I speak on behalf of all South Dakotans when I extend my \nsincere thanks and appreciation to them for their continued commitment \nand dedication to veterans and to the Scotland community.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       Joyce Hosterman, Blanche Nelson, Gladys Keating, Lytha \n     Barth, Angie Pillar, Iona Retzer, Emma Brown, Vi Kostlan, \n     Bernice (Farmer) Cvrk, Emma Collinge, Elna (Nelles) Gemar, \n     Leondina Orth, Ruth Hirsch, Della Wold, Martha Baker, Mae \n     Brown.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/06/senate-section/article/S11862-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/06/senate-section/article/S11862-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:13 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2195.

A bill to reform the naturalization process, to clarify the \nprocedures for investigating the criminal background of individuals \nsubmitting applications in connection with certain benefits under the \nImmigration and Nationality Act, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                 THE NATURALIZATION REFORM ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nNaturalization Reform Act of 1997. This bill addresses some of the \nserious failings in the Immigration and Naturalization Service's \nconduct of the naturalization process that have come to light during \nthe past 2 years. This legislation does not attempt a comprehensive \nreform of the naturalization process, a topic that likely should be a \nsubject of serious consideration but regarding which much additional \nwork is needed. Rather, it includes a few targeted measures designed to \naddress critical issues that have emerged, particularly concerning the \ngranting of citizenship to criminal aliens and the INS' conduct of \ncriminal background checks. Given that these issues have been the \nsubject of extensive oversight in both Houses of Congress, it is \nimportant that we work together on this. In that vein, I have developed \nthis legislation with my counterpart on the House side, Representative \nLamar Smith, the chairman of the House Immigration Subcommittee. Today, \nhe is introducing identical legislation in the House.\n  Let me state at the outset that citizenship is the most precious gift \nand honor that our Nation can bestow. I have spoken many times before--\nboth in the Immigration Subcommittee and elsewhere--about my own \ngrandparents' experience of immigrating to America. Their citizenship \npapers give me a particular pride, and I know what citizenship papers \nmean to my own family and for millions of others across America. The \nvast majority of citizenship applicants are law-abiding legal \nimmigrants who have every right and desire to become full-fledged \nAmerican citizens.\n  Nonetheless, serious concerns about the naturalization process have \nbeen raised this session, particularly concerning the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service's provision of citizenship papers to some \nundeserving criminal aliens. Some initial reports did overestimate the \nnumber of aliens who were improperly naturalized in 1995 and 1996 \ndespite being statutorily ineligible for naturalization based on \ncriminal convictions. Regardless of the number, however, it is still a \nconcern to me that any obviously ineligible criminal aliens were \nnaturalized. Moreover, it remains of grave concern that the INS was \nnaturalizing large numbers of applicants without having completed their \ncriminal background checks, which have been central to the way the INS \nconducts its inquiry into an applicant's good moral character. Even if \nan applicant did not have a conviction making that applicant \nstatutorily ineligible, one would think that the good moral character \ndetermination might very well have turned out differently if the INS \nhad had information concerning an applicant's arrests or other criminal \nbackground information. The mere fact that the INS was moving forward \nin this manner in itself raises concerns about how the INS is carrying \nout its statutory responsibilities.\n  Many of these problems are not new, and it is disappointing that they \nhave gone unresolved for so long. Reports from the Justice Department \nand from the General Accounting Office over the past 10 years have \nrepeatedly found significant faults with the fingerprint check process, \nwhich the INS uses to conduct its criminal background checks. For \ninstance, a 1988 Department of Justice audit found that, in 47 percent \nof naturalization files reviewed at random, there was no record that a \nfingerprint check had been requested or no record of when fingerprints \nwere mailed to the FBI. In a 1989 report, the Department of Justice \naudit staff discovered an almost complete absence of evidence that \nbackground checks and fingerprint checks were conducted in \nnaturalization cases. A 1994 report of the inspector general's office \nfound that the INS did not verify that fingerprints submitted with an \napplication actually belonged to the applicant; that report also \ndocumented that the Service failed to ensure that fingerprint checks \nwere completed by the FBI. A 1994 GAO report disclosed similar \nfindings.\n  Despite such observations and disclosures, the INS continued to \npermit applicants to submit their own fingerprints without verifying \nwhether the prints belonged to the applicant, and fingerprint cards \nsubmitted to the FBI often contained incomplete or inaccurate \ninformation. The INS also continued to permit naturalizations to go \nforward after 60 days following the submission of fingerprints to the \nFBI, regardless of whether a definitive response had been received from \nthe FBI on the fingerprint check.\n  In 1996, weaknesses in the criminal history validation process \nreceived renewed attention in the midst of the President's Citizenship \nUSA program, a roughly 1-year effort to speed the pace of \nnaturalizations significantly. Those weaknesses were exacerbated as \npressure grew to increase naturalizations. As a result of various \nsevere problems that came to light, a number of investigations, audits, \nand reviews into the naturalization process are now taking place.\n  The Department of Justice's Justice Management Division, in \nconjunction with KPMG Peat Marwick and with some participation from the \nGeneral Accounting Office, has been conducting an ongoing review of the \nroughly 1.4 million cases of aliens naturalized under Citizenship USA. \nPreliminary results indicate that INS failed to complete criminal \nbackground checks on some 180,000 immigrants who were naturalized \nbetween August 1995 and September 1996, and that more than 71,500 \napplicants who did undergo background checks had criminal records and \nwere naturalized anyway. It is true that a much smaller number had \nconvictions for offenses for which there is a statutory bar to \nnaturalization. As I have noted, however, it remains of great concern \nthat such a large number were processed improperly, regardless of what \nthe particular results were.\n  In response to weaknesses identified by those reviews, on November 29 \nof last year, the INS finally announced major changes to its criminal \nbackground verification procedures in an effort to respond to some of \nthe serious and ongoing problems in that area. The Service did so \nthrough a policy memo announcing new ``Naturalization Quality \nProcedures.'' That memo went out--or was supposed to go out--from the \nCommissioner to all INS regional, district, and local offices. That \nspecific and detailed memo, which was to be effective immediately, \nprovided that no naturalizations were to go forward without a response \non the fingerprint check from the FBI and unless the new policies and \nprocedures were in place.\n  Unfortunately, we learned this year that the administration's policy \nfailed to go into effect as mandated by the Commissioner. On April 17, \nKPMG Peat Marwick issued a report based on its review of the INS' \nmanagement and implementation of the new criminal record verification \nguidelines. Building\n\n[[Page S11865]]\n\non the work of others in Congress, including my predecessor as \nsubcommittee chairman, I chaired a hearing earlier this year that \nexamined the criminal record verification process for citizenship \napplicants and that particularly focussed on the findings of Peat \nMarwick's review of the implementation of that policy. Peat Marwick \nrated only 1 INS office of the 23 it reviewed as ``compliant'' with the \nnew procedures. Of the 22 others, 15 were found ``noncompliant,'' and 7 \n``marginally compliant.'' One District Office and two Citizenship USA \nsites could not produce the particular policy memo they were supposed \nto be implementing. Numerous offices were sending fingerprint cards to \nthe wrong FBI address, fingerprint cards were completed incorrectly, \nand worksheets that were required to be dated and initialed showed no \nevidence of key tasks being completed. These results are simply \nastonishing in the wake of the attention that the flaws in the previous \nsystem received both in the Congress and in the press. Such troubling \ndeficiencies in even the most basic implementation of the new policy \nhave emerged that immediate action must be taken to ensure that no \ncitizenship application is processed without the required fingerprint \nchecks and that the INS properly considers and evaluates any criminal \nrecord that is revealed. Those deficiencies also suggest we need to \ntake a long-term look at the entire naturalization process and indeed \nat the structure of the INS.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is limited to targeted \nmeasures aimed at addressing in the short term some critical problems \nin the naturalization process, particularly with regard to criminal \nbackground checks. The bill would revise the INS' processing of \ncriminal background checks in a number of ways. It provides that, in \nconducting criminal background checks on any applicant for \nnaturalization or for a number of other significant immigration \nbenefits, the INS may not accept for processing or transmit to the FBI \nany fingerprint card or any other means used to transmit fingerprints \nunless the applicant's fingerprints have been taken by an office of the \nINS or by a law enforcement agency. Such offices or agencies would be \npermitted to collect a fee from the applicant for the service of taking \nand transmitting the fingerprints.\n  The bill further provides that if an applicant is physically unable \nto provide legible fingerprints, for example, because the applicant may \nbe elderly or disabled, the requirement that the INS submit \nfingerprints to the FBI shall not apply and the FBI shall instead \nconduct a record check based on the applicant's name and other \nidentifying information.\n  Under the legislation, no naturalization application, or application \nfor the other important immigration benefits specified in the \nlegislation, like the adjustment of status to lawful permanent \nresidence, could be approved until the INS receives from the FBI a \ndefinitive response concerning whether the applicant has a criminal \nrecord and receives the content of any criminal history that the \napplicant may have.\n  Interviews would also now be statutorily required before applicants \nmay be naturalized or may adjust their status to lawful permanent \nresidence. In the case of any applicant for naturalization, the \ninterview must cover any criminal background of the applicant, other \nthan minor traffic violations, and must review any misrepresentations \nmade on the naturalization application.\n  In order to provide for an orderly transition, and to insure that the \nnaturalization backlog does not increase, the bill provides for an \neffective date of October 1, 1998.\n  The bill also addresses the good moral character requirement for \nnaturalization. Under current law, an applicant for naturalization must \ndemonstrate good moral character for the 5 years preceding the \napplication for naturalization. The INS has given good moral character \nthe most narrow definition possible under the statute, and has \nrestricted its good moral character inquiry to whether an applicant has \nbeen convicted of a criminal offense that statutorily bars a finding of \ngood moral character. In my view, the 5 year period is too short. Our \nlegislation extends that period to 10 years. I also hope that the INS \nwill, through regulation, examine many more factors than it currently \ndoes in assessing good moral character.\n  This legislation also begins to approach the question of citizenship \ntesting. Hearings beginning to look into this issue have been held in \nthe House and were held last Congress by my predecessor. While we need \nto know more before we can definitively decide how to approach \ncitizenship testing, we can take some measures to address fraud \nproblems. With respect to non-governmental outside testing entities \nthat are authorized by INS to do citizenship testing, the bill \nsafeguards the integrity of the testing process in a number of ways. It \nrequires the INS to conduct regular inspections of testing sites, \nprevents outside testing entities from delegating their testing \nauthority to any other companies, and allows the Attorney General to \nrequire retests when the testing process is impaired by cheating, \nfraud, or negligence. The bill requires GAO to do a comprehensive study \nand report to Congress on the overall integrity of the outside testing \nprocess so that we can decide if other reforms are necessary.\n  The bill also includes a provision specifying that any alien approved \nfor naturalization would not be able to receive his or her \nnaturalization certificate until the alien turns in the alien's green \ncard or submits an affidavit describing how the green card was lost, \nstolen, or destroyed. To further discourage the misuse, sale, or \nfraudulent transfer of green cards, the legislation requires any alien \nwhose green card is lost, stolen or destroyed to report it to the INS \npromptly or pay a $50 fine for failing to do so.\n  To address the INS' continued management difficulties in the \nnaturalization area, the legislation puts into place quality assurance \nprocedures and will improve oversight for the naturalization process. \nIn particular, the legislation requires the Attorney General to \nestablish a process, which is to include internal or other audit \nprocedures, to review the ongoing compliance by each office of the \nService that is involved in the naturalization process with all \nnaturalization processes and procedures. Then, within 30 days after the \nend of each of the next 4 fiscal years, the Attorney General is to \nsubmit a report to the Senate and House Judiciary Committees concerning \nthe INS' compliance with naturalization processes and procedures during \nthe preceding years.\n  Again, this legislation is designed to address some immediate \nproblems requiring our attention. I look forward to continuing to work \nwith my colleagues on the Senate Immigration Subcommittee, and with our \ncolleagues in the House and others, on this legislation and on \naddressing the longer-term problems the INS is facing in the \nnaturalization area.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire text of the bill be placed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1382\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide a 6-month extension of safety programs \nunder ISTEA; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                           istea legislation\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it is clear that a multiyear \nreauthorization of ISTEA will not be possible during this session. Due \nto the expiration of ISTEA authorizations, I am very concerned that \nvital safety programs under the jurisdiction of the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation are at risk. Senator Hollings and \nI are introducing legislation that would provide funds to continue the \noperation of those important safety programs.\n  According to the Department of Transportation [DOT], the highway \nsafety grant programs do not have any unobligated balances available, \nfrom prior authorizations, to draw on if ISTEA is not extended to \nbridge the gap between now and when a long-term reauthorization bill is \npassed. The programs at risk include the State and\n\n[[Page S11868]]\n\nCommunity Safety Grant Program under section 402, the section 410 grant \nprogram to encourage counter measures to impaired driving, and the \nNational Driver Register [NDR].\n  The contract to run the National Driver Register is presently running \non funds obligated in fiscal year 1997 but that contract and the \nfunding expires in March. When that contract expires the program will \nhave to be shut down and the staff dismissed.\n  DOT indicates most States only have funding to operate safety \nprograms for the next 2 or 3 months. I understand that some States have \nalready started shutting down some of their highway safety programs.\n  Funds are also needed to pay the salaries of the more than 3,000 \nState motor carrier enforcement personnel. With the expiration of \nISTEA, there is no Federal funding currently available to pay the \nsalaries of these individuals whose expenses are exclusively financed \nthrough the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program [MCSAP]. The \nDepartment of Transportation testified this week that the elimination \nof vital MCSAP funding could impede the ability of States to perform \ncommercial vehicle and driver inspections. A short-term extension of \nMCSAP funding will help ensure that unsafe vehicles and drivers are \nprevented from traveling on our Nation's highways.\n  I know that no one in this body wants to see a situation where \nhighway safety is degraded in any way. I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues to address these important issues of highway safety to \nensure that we meet our obligations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE:\n  S. 1384. A bill to amend title 5, United States Code, to make the \nFederal Employees Health Benefits Program available to the general \npublic, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n\n\n                   THE ACCESSIBLE HEALTH COVERAGE ACT\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, when comprehensive health reform failed \nin 1994, we were left with the legacy of a major unmet challenge--\nproviding secure health care coverage to millions of uninsured \nAmericans. Despite the inability of Congress to enact comprehensive \nhealth reform, many of my colleagues and I continue to work to achieve \nthat goal, albeit incrementally. The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill was part of \nthat effort, as were the provisions of the recent budget agreement that \nmade $24 billion available to states to cover uninsured children.\n  As part of this ongoing effort, last week I introduced legislation \nthat would restore rights and protections to early retirees who are \nabruptly dropped from their employer's health plan. Today I am \nintroducing legislation to help individuals who do not have employer-\nsponsored coverage and who, because of a previous or current health \ncondition, are unable to obtain private non-group health insurance.\n  While today many people without employer-sponsored insurance can \npurchase health coverage in the individual insurance market, those with \nhealth problems --conditions as common as asthma or migraine headaches \nand as controllable as hypertension or allergies--may not be able to \nfind an insurer willing to cover them at any price. As many as 4 \nmillion Americans fall into this abyss, known by the insurance industry \nas the ``medically uninsurable.''\n  Many Americans felt that we had solved that problem when we enacted \nthe Kennedy-Kassebaum bill. I have received phone calls and letters \nfrom men and women in South Dakota and around the country who thought \nthat enactment of the Kennedy/Kassebaum legislation meant they could \nnot be denied private health insurance. Unfortunately, that is not the \ncase. While the Kennedy/Kassebaum bill makes it easier for some groups \nto maintain their coverage if they switch jobs or become unemployed, it \ndoes not improve health insurance affordability or access to coverage \nfor individuals who have not been part of the employer-sponsored \ninsurance system. Kennedy-Kassebaum does not require insurers to cover \nself-employed individuals unless they were previously enrolled under a \ngroup health plan. Moreover, insurance companies still can deny \ncoverage to workers whose employers do not provide employee health \nbenefits. The reality is that if you do not have employer-sponsored \ninsurance and have, or have had, any of a number of health problems, \nyou're probably out of luck.\n  Too many insurance companies continue to cherry-pick the healthiest \nof us and leave unprotected those most in need of insurance. This is \nnot only regrettable for those left without coverage, it is \nshortsighted. Uninsured individuals often end up needing expensive \nemergency room care and extended inpatient convalescence because they \nwere unable to afford the early, relatively inexpensive care necessary \nto prevent these serious problems. The unnecessary costs associated \nwith the treatment of preventable diseases are passed on to the insured \npopulation through higher hospital charges and insurance premiums. The \nuninsured suffer needless health problems, while the insured pay more \nfor everyone's health care. Ironically, insurers then point to these \nhigher premiums when they try to justify their exclusionary \nunderwriting practices, compounding the problem.\n  This is the unfortunate legacy of our inability to enact \ncomprehensive reform and it is why we need to continue to pursue every \nmeans available to provide reasonably priced health insurance to all \nAmericans, even if we have to do it one step at a time.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would allow individuals who \nhave been denied coverage for medical reasons to purchase private \ncoverage through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. While \nFEHBP insurers could charge high-risk individuals up to 150 percent of \nthe premium paid by federal employees--to account for differences in \nthe risk of insuring the two populations--these previously uninsured \nindividuals would have access to insurance and in every other respect \nwould be treated the same as federal employees.\n  The bill is structured to prevent any cost shifting to Federal \nemployees. The two populations would be accounted for separately, while \neligible non-Federal individuals would be able to enroll in the program \nwithout jumping through elaborate administrative hoops.\n  To allay the concerns of those who may fear the creation of a new \nentitlement, despite the fact that we're talking about private coverage \npaid for by private citizens, the FEHBP buy-in will sunset after 10 \nyears. I'm confident that what we'll learn from this demonstration is \nthat private insurers can cover high-risk individuals without \ndisrupting the private insurance market.\n  One thing is certain. The status quo isn't working. When health \ninsurance is reserved for only the healthy, the system is not working \nefficiently for any of us.\n  We must stop perpetuating a system that relegates certain individuals \nto permanently uninsured status if they are unlucky enough to become \nsick at a time when coverage was not in their name or was beyond their \nfinancial reach.\n  This bill empowers a disenfranchised group of individuals to purchase \nprivate health insurance. They are willing to pay a fair price for it--\nall they need is an insurer who will offer it. Through FEHBP this \nlegislation provides that opportunity.\n  This legislation is not a comprehensive solution to our health \ninsurance challenges. Filling this gap won't bring health care costs \nunder long-term control; it won't eliminate the billions of dollars \nlost to waste, fraud and abuse; and it won't create a system that \nuniformly reflects consumers' values regarding disease prevention, high \nquality care, privacy and access to treatment. Ultimately, we still \nneed a critical and comprehensive reevaluation and reform of the two-\ntiered, patchwork health care financing and delivery system we've \nerected over the years. However, this bill represents one long overdue \nstep, and I hope Congress will enact it in the near future.\n  There is no excuse for sitting on our heels while the health \ninsurance system excludes the very people who need coverage most. If \nfilling gaps is the only way we can move forward at this time to help \nearly retirees and individuals with health problems gain access to \ncoverage, then let's get on with it and begin to fill in those gaps.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S11869]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1384\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to expand the \nlist of diseases presumed to be service connected with respect to \nradiation-exposed veterans; to the Committee on Veterans Affairs.\n\n\n              the justice for atomic veterans act of 1997\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today, I am introducing a bill that \nwill help atomic veterans--veterans who were exposed to ionizing \nradiation while serving on active duty. Atomic veterans are not only \nAmerica's most neglected veterans, but they have been deceived and \ntreated shabbily for more than 50 years by the Government they served \nso selflessly and unquestioningly.\n  Mr. President, it is hardly accidental that I chose to entitle this \nbill the ``Justice for Atomic Veterans Act of 1997.'' Atomic veterans \nhave been seeking justice almost since the first atomic bomb was \ndropped on Hiroshima. The U.S. Government has a long overdue debt to \nthem and I urge my colleagues to join me in ensuring that this debt is \npaid at long last.\n  With the full cooperation of my distinguished colleagues Senators \nBond and Mikulski, the Senate in July passed an amendment to the VA-HUD \nappropriations bill which serves as the basis for this bill. That \namendment, which was in the legislation that the President signed \nrecently, provided for CBO to estimate the cost of legislation that \nwould add 10 radiogenic diseases to the list of presumptively service-\nconnected diseases for which atomic veterans may be compensated by the \nVA. The amendment also requires the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee \nto hold hearings on expanding the list of radiogenic diseases that are \npresumptively service-connected within 60 days of enactment. To \nfacilitate consideration by the Veterans' Affairs Committee and to \nsecure the support of my colleagues, I'm introducing this bill.\n  Mr. President, before I get into the substance of my bill, I want to \ndiscuss why I decided to introduce it. First and foremost, I must \nstress that much of what I know about atomic veterans I've learned from \nmembers and families of the Forgotten 216th. The Forgotten 216th refers \nto the 216th Chemical Service Company of the U.S. Army, which \nparticipated in Operation Tumbler Snapper--a series of eight \natmospheric nuclear weapons tests in the Nevada desert in 1952. About \nhalf of the members of the 216th were Minnesotans. Almost 4 years ago, \nthey contacted me after then-Secretary of Energy O'Leary announced that \nthe U.S. Government had conducted radiation experiments on its own \ncitizens. I will never forget my first meeting with members of the \nForgotten 216th. It was quite an emotional experience for them as well \nas for me. For the first time in public, they revealed what went on \nduring the Nevada tests they participated in over 40 years ago, as well \nas the tragedies and trauma they, their families, and former buddies \nhad experienced since then.\n  Since that first dramatic meeting, I've met often with the brave and \npatriotic members of the Forgotten 216th and their families. They have \nbeen and are my mentors. I'm very proud of\n\n[[Page S11870]]\n\nthese extraordinary Minnesotans who have fought hard against great odds \nfor just treatment for atomic veterans and their families.\n  Because I believe that their experiences and problems typify that of \natomic veterans nationwide, I want to tell my colleagues more about the \nForgotten 216th. After you hear their story, I'm confident you'll agree \nwith me that it is imperative that all of us work to ensure the \nForgotten 216th and other veterans like them are never forgotten again.\n  Mr. President, when they took part in Operation Tumbler Snapper 45 \nyears ago, they believed their Government's assurances that it would \nkeep them out of harm's way, but they have come to believe they were \nused a guina pigs without concern for their safety.\n  Many members of the 216th were sent to measure fallout at or near \nground zero immediately after a nuclear blast, exposing them to so much \nradiation that their Geiger counters went off the scale while they \ninhaled and ingested radioactive particles. They were given minimal or \nno protection, sometimes even lacking film badges to measure radiation \nexposure and provided with no information on the perils they faced. \nFurthermore, they were sworn to secrecy about their participation in \nnuclear tests, sometimes denied access to their own service medical \nrecords, and provided no medical followup to ensure they'd suffered no \nill effects as a result of their exposure to radiation.\n  Tragically, many members of the 216th have already died, often of \ncancer. Moreover, many of their children and even grandchildren have \nbeen born with serious and rare disorders, even after they'd had \nhealthy children prior to exposure to radiation. Their claims for VA \ncompensation were denied, often because they were alleged to have been \nexposed to radiation doses too low to cause disabling illnesses. Since \nthey'd inhaled radioactive dust near Ground Zero shortly after nuclear \nblasts, they were and are justifiably skeptical about claims that their \nexposures were insufficient to cause radiogenic diseases. Can anyone \nreally be surprised that these men now refer to themselves as the \nforgotten 216th?\n  Mr. President, I would not like to turn to the substance of my bill. \nI want to stress at the outset that this legislation is directly \nresponsive to one of the recommendations of the Final Report of the \nPresident's Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments issued in \nOctober 1995. The Report urged the Congress to address five concerns of \natomic veterans and their families ``promptly.'' My bill directly \naddresses two of these concerns, which the report described as follows:\n\n       The listing of diseases for which relief is automatically \n     provided--the presumptive diseases provided for in the 1988 \n     law--is incomplete and inadequate.\n       The standard of proof for those without presumptive disease \n     is impossible to meet and, given the questionable condition \n     of the exposure records retained by the government, \n     inappropriate.\n\n  The VA maintains two lists of radiogenic diseases, a presumptive list \nestablished under Public Law 101-321 as amended by Public Law 102-578 \nand now consisting of 15 radiogenic diseases, and a nonpresumptive list \nestablished under Public Law 98-542 which includes 10 diseases not on \nthe presumptive list. My bill would add these 10 diseases to the \npresumptive list, making all diseases currently recognized by the VA as \nradiogenic presumptively service-connected. The radiogenic diseases \nthat would be added to the presumptive list are: lung cancer; bone \ncancer; skin cancer; colon cancer; posterior subcapsular cataracts; \nnonmalignant thyroid nodular disease; ovarian cancer; parathyroid \nadenoma; tumors of the brain and central nervous system; and rectal \ncancer.\n  Why the need for these changes? To being with veterans must \njump through hoops to demonstrate they are eligible for compensation \nfor nonpresumptive diseases and, after they have done so the chances \nthat the VA will approve their claims are minimal.\n\n  Mr. President, to illustrate what I mean, permit me to cite some VA \nstatistics. As of April 1, 1996, out of the hundreds of thousands of \natomic veterans there are, there have been a total of 18,515 radiation \nclaim cases, with service-connection granted in 1,886 cases. According \nto VA statistics current as of December 1, 1995, only 463 involve the \ngranting of presumptive service-connection. If we were to exclude the \n463 veterans who were granted presumptive service-connection, atomic \nveterans had an incredibly low claims approval rate of less than 8 \npercent. It needs to be stressed, moreover, that of this low \npercentage, an indeterminate number may have had their claims granted \nfor diseases unrelated to radiation exposure.\n  Why so few claims approvals? One key reason is that VA regulations \nare overly stringent for service-connection for nonpresumptive \nradiogenic diseases. Dose requirements pose a particularly difficult, \nif not insuperable, hurdle. While it is almost impossible to come up \nwith accurate dose reconstructions because decades have elapsed since \nthe nuclear detonations and adequate records don't exist, veterans are \nfrequently denied compensation because their radiation exposure levels \nare deemed to be too low.\n  In this connection, let me cite the findings of the President's \nAdvisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments: ``the Government did \nnot create or maintain adequate records regarding the exposure of all \nparticipants in [nuclear weapons tests and] the identity and test \nlocales of all participants.'' This finding obviously calls into \nquestion the capability of the Government to come up with accurate dose \nreconstructions on which approval of claims for VA compensation for \natomic veterans frequently depend.\n  Mr. President, is there any reason that atomic veterans should be \npenalized for the U.S. Government's failure to maintain records that \nare fundamental in determining the merit of their VA claims? Of course, \ntheir isn't. If the Government can not even be counted on to come up \nwith the ``identity and test locales of all participants,'' what can it \nbe counted on to do? Certainly not on giving atomic veterans a fair \nshake. Certainly not anything resembling the ``benefit of the doubt'' \nthat the VA is required to accord them.\n  For these and other reasons it is vital that the Senate pass \nlegislation to ensure that these patriotic and long-suffering veterans \nreceive the justice that has been denied them for so many years. \nJustice is what my bill is all about. It will ensure that atomic \nveterans no longer have to depend on a benefit of the doubt they rarely \nreceive. How can they receive the benefit of the doubt when the \nGovernment records on which the whole edifice of VA claims adjudication \nrests are flawed or nonexistent? When dose reconstruction on which \ntheir claims depend is unreliable? When the health effects of exposure \nto purportedly low-level radiation are unknown or still the subject of \nscientific controversy 52 years after the first nuclear blast at \nAlamogordo, NM?\n  By now it should be obvious to all of my colleagues that the current \nsystem of adjudicating atomic veterans' claims makes little sense and \nis discriminatory. Like many of you I believe that `if it ain't broke \ndon't fix it.'' Well this system is obviously broke and we need to fix \nit now. Both the fairest and quickest way of doing so is by adding the \n10 radiogenic diseases now only on the nonpresumptive list to the \npresumptive list as my bill proposes.\n  Mr. President, since January 1994, I have had many meetings with the \nmen of the Forgotten 216th and atomic veterans from around the country. \nI want to assure you that they remain patriotic Americans who are proud \nto have served this country. I have no doubt whatever they would gladly \nanswer the call of duty again if their country was to call on them. A \nhalf century of neglect by the Government that put them in harm's way \nwithout even telling them so, has in no way dimmed their love of \ncountry. These are remarkable Americans and at long last they need to \nbe treated like the remarkable Americans they are. Even though they \nhave waited for over 50 years, they still retain the hope that they \nwill receive the compensation and recognition they deserve.\n  The fight of atomic veterans for justice has been long, hard, and \nfrustrating, but these patriotic, dedicated, and deserving veterans \nhave persevered. I urge my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to \njoin that struggle by supporting the Justice for Atomic Veterans Act. \nLet me assure each of you it's a struggle worth waging and a struggle \nwe can win.\n\n[[Page S11871]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1385\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to facilitate the remediation of contaminated \nsediments in the waters of the United States; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n               HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE SUPERFUND LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, 5 years ago Congress directed EPA, in \nconsultation with NOAA and the Army Corps, to conduct a comprehensive \nsurvey of data regarding aquatic sediment quality in the United States. \nSometime within the next few weeks, this long overdue report will be \nsubmitted to Congress. Because of the widespread contamination that \nEPA, working with the Army Corps and NOAA, has found, this report \nshould sound an alarm for all of us. While we have made great progress \non preventing pollution from many sources, we have severely neglected \nthe problem of contaminated sediments. This contamination is a legacy \nof decades of hoping that pollution would flow down the drain or off \nthe land and out of sight never to bother us again. But, now we know \nwhere a significant portion of it is and it's not going anywhere soon \nuntil we do something about it.\n  The report, ``The Incidence and Severity of Sediment Contamination in \nSurface Waters of the United States,'' identifies approximately 96 \nareas of probable concern [APC's]. In these watershed areas, sampling \nindicates there is a significant possibility of adverse aquatic \nwildlife or human health effects due to contaminated sediments. These \nAPC's can be found throughout the country including Boston Harbor, the \nDetroit River, Green Bay, along the Mississippi, Puget Sound, San \nFrancisco Bay, Seal Beach, Mobile Bay to the Middle Savannah, to name a \nfew. This concentration of sites is surprising when one considers that \nof the 2,111 watersheds recognized by the U.S. Geological Survey, there \nis no sediment quality information on about 90 percent of them or about \n1,900 watersheds.\n  Mr. President, this report has to be used with caution because it is \nonly a first step. There is obviously insufficient information to make \nsweeping claims about the extent of contamination in sediments across \nthe country, though EPA plans to develop the report into a national \nsediment inventory, a continually updated centralized assemblage of \nsediment quality measurements and state-of-the-art assessment \ntechniques. However, ``based on the evaluation [in the report], \nsediment contamination exists at levels indicating a probability of \nadverse effects in all regions and states of the country.'' We must be \ncautious too about leaping directly from evidence of contamination to \nevidence of adverse effects due to that contamination. Unfortunately, \nFederal Government agencies have been slow to agree upon and provide \nsediment quality guidelines to inform States and the public about \ncontamination that could cause adverse human health effects. This \nsluggishness has prevented development of the true picture of the \npotential risks contaminated sediments pose.\n  In the Great Lakes, we have been concentrating our efforts on \ncontaminated sediments for some time. We realized some time ago that \nour industrial legacy would need attention. That is why I authored the \nGreat Lakes Critical Programs Act of 1990, which formalized the process \nof developing remedial action plans [RAP's] in areas of concern [AOC] \nin the Great Lakes, where beneficial uses are impaired. These AOC's are \nnot too dissimilar to the APC's described in the sediment report, \nbecause contaminated sediments are a significant component of the \nenvironmental and public health risk associated with AOC's. \nUnfortunately, despite all of the efforts by local and State \ngovernments to prepare RAP's, very little Federal money has gone into \ntheir development and even less into implementing them to clean up the \nwaste and prevent further contamination. That needs to change.\n  The Federal Government has to commit more of its resources to helping \nStates and local governments clean up the industrial legacy that lurks \nbeneath the water's surface in harbors and rivers across the Nation. To \ndate, Federal agencies have been too reluctant to carefully examine the \nrisks that these contaminated sediments pose for fear of the costs of \ncleanup and because the technologies necessary have not been adequately \ndeveloped. But, as we have learned in the Great Lakes, these \ncontaminated sediments are the source of much of the continuing \npollution of our surface waters, as they recirculate pollutants into \nthe water bodies that are then taken up by fish, birds, humans, and \nother living organisms. So, if our goal is to have fishable and \nswimmable waters again, we need to use every took that we can to begin \naddressing the cleanup.\n  I am introducing legislation today to authorize the use of Superfund \nmoney to expedite remediation of contaminated sediment sites across the \nNation. Many of the most persistent, bioaccumulative toxics found in \ncontaminated sediments are derived from the same chemical feedstocks \ntaxed to fill the Hazardous Substance Superfund, so it is most \nappropriate that those moneys be used to clean up sediments.\n  The bill allows the EPA Administrator to use the Superfund to \nremediate contaminated sediments, but limits the amount to no more than \n$300 million annually. In expending funds, EPA is to give priority \nconsideration to sediment sites which do or could adversely affect \nhuman health or the environment. Further, there is a preference given \nfor sites in watersheds where the local governments are actively \nengaged in trying to prevent further contamination of the sediment and \nare willing to contribute 25 percent or more of the costs of \nremediation.\n  Under the bill, EPA would have to do a better job of integrating its \nWater and Superfund programs' approach to contaminated sediments. \nSpecifically, the hazardous ranking system used in Superfund to \nestimate the potential risks associated with a conventional terrestrial \nsite will be revisited to determine if it adequately assesses risks \nassociated with aquatic contaminated sediments. And, EPA would be \nrequired to promulgate final numerical sediment quality criteria for \nthe 10 toxic, persistent, or bioaccumulative substances most likely to \nadversely affect human health and the environment by 2001.\n  In addition, EPA would have to identify the 20 contaminated sediment \nsites that are most likely to adversely affect human health and the \nenvironment and have not been the subject of Federal or State response \nactions. And, to address the lack of data on contaminated sediments at \nSuperfund sites, EPA would have to report on their occurrence and \nassociated risk.\n  Mr. President, I consider this to be a fairly modest bill. It does \nnot set aside a specific percentage of the Superfund that must be spent \non contaminated sediment cleanup, through I think that might also be \nhelpful. And, it does not place great demands on Federal agencies, \nStates or local governments. What it does do, however, is seek to bring \nresources and attention to bear on a very pressing problem. This \nproblem has been clearly illustrated in EPA's report and it is a \ntenacious one that will not get any smaller. Unfortunately, our current \nsystem lets contaminated sediments fall between the regulatory and \nenvironmental policy cracks in the pier. And, there it will stay on our \nharbor and river bottoms, polluting fish, water, and vegetation until \nwe act.\n\n[[Page S11872]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues from all parts of the country to consider \ncosponsoring this legislation, but particularly want to encourage the \nattention of Senators from coastal areas or from States with \nenvironmentally sensitive and industrialized watersheds. I believe that \nthe approach taken in this bill is a necessary first step toward \ncleaning up contaminated sediments and I will be working to incorporate \nthis into whatever Superfund reauthorization bill comes before the \nSenate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1386\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize additional appropriations for the \nDepartment of Defense for ballistic missile defenses and other measures \nto counter the emerging threat posed to the United States and its \nallies in the Middle East and Persian Gulf region by the development \nand deployment of ballistic missiles by Iran; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n\n\n                THE IRAN MISSILE PROTECTION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today, I rise to introduce the Iran Missile \nProtection Act of 1997, the so-called, IMPACT 97 legislation, a similar \nversion of which Curt Weldon introduced in the House of Representatives \nlast week.\n\n  The IMPACT 97 legislation is aptly named because it is intended to \nhave a real impact on the growing threat from Iranian ballistic \nmissiles. Recent revelations that Iran has nearly completed development \nof two new ballistic missiles--made possible with Russian assistance--\nthat will allow it to strike targets as far away as Central Europe has \nconvinced me that United States theater missile defenses must be \naccelerated in order to counter the emerging Iranian threat.\n  According to published reports, a long-range Iranian missile, Shahab \n4, could be fielded in as little as 3 years. A shorter range missile, \nShahab 3, which will be capable of reaching Israel, could be \noperational in 12 to 18 months. Both missiles could be armed with \nchemical or biological warheads. These reports are the latest in a \nstring of increasingly troubling disclosures that have surfaced since \nthe Los Angeles Times first reported in February that Russia was \nproviding missile technology and assistance to Iran.\n  A bipartisan group of Senators and Representatives have been working \non various legislative approaches to address the Iranian threat. For \nexample,\n\n[[Page S11873]]\n\nRepresentative Jane Harman and I introduced a concurrent resolution \nexpressing the sense of Congress that the administration should impose \nsanctions against Russian entities transferring ballistic missile \ntechnology to Iran. The annual foreign aid bill, currently in \nconference, contains a provision strictly conditioning the release of \naid to Russia on certification by the President that Moscow has stopped \nthe transfer of nuclear and missile technology to Iran. And, Senator \nLott and Representative Gilman have also introduced legislation that \nwould require that sanctions be imposed against any entity caught \ntransferring goods to support Iran's ballistic missile program.\n  In addition to the legislative approach, the administration has been \nengaged in a series of diplomatic exchanges with the Russians. \nAccording to press accounts, Vice President Gore has raised the issue \nwith Prime Minister Chernomyrdin during their meetings in February and \nJuly. President Clinton has raised the matter with President Yeltsin at \nthe Helsinki summit in March and the P-8 summit in June. The \nadministration has also appointed Ambassador Frank Wisner as its \nspecial envoy to discuss with Russian officials the allegations made \nregarding transfers of technology to Iran. This is a very serious issue \nwhich the Clinton administration has clearly acknowledged.\n  While we hope that the diplomatic efforts will bear fruit, it is \nentirely possible that it will not. In that event, the United States \nand our allies must be prepared to defend and protect ourselves from \nthe possibility that Iran will use ballistic missiles armed with \nchemical, biological, or nuclear warheads. It is that possibility--some \nmight say eventuality--that IMPACT 97 is intended to address.\n  Neither the United States nor Israel will have missile defenses \ncapable of countering the threat from the Shahab 3 or Shahab 4 missile \nbefore those systems are deployed. IMPACT 97 authorizes the accelerated \ndevelopment of some key theater defense systems, as well as the \nprocurement of additional batteries of interceptors capable of \nproviding protection against the Iranian missiles.\n  Specifically, IMPACT 97 would authorize an additional: $65 million to \naccelerate development of Navy Upper Tier; $100 million to purchase a \nsecond THAAD UOES system; $15 million to improve interoperability of \nthe THAAD radar with other missile defense systems; 110 million to \npurchase additional Arrow Missiles and for production enhancement to \naccelerate deployment; $15 million to accelerate development of a \nremote launch capability for PAC-3 using a THAAD radar to enlarge the \narea the system can defend; $25 million for PAC-3 production \nenhancements to accelerate deployment of the system; $35 million to \npurchase two Cobra Gemini radars to improve missile tracking; and $20 \nmillion for development of the Joint Composite Tracking Network to \nimprove command and control and interoperability of missile defense \nsystems.\n  I believe that the potential threat from these Iranian ballistic \nmissiles is so grave that we cannot afford to wait until they are \ndeployed to respond with defenses. I have personally discussed this \nlegislation with members of the Department of Defense, and my staff has \nbeen in regular contact with other officials there to help ensure that \nthe best bill possible is presented for consideration. In the end, the \nDepartment has decided not to support this legislation, however, I have \nreasonable confidence that the programs identified, and the funding \nprovided, is an accurate reflection of where BMDO would spend the \nadditional funds, if provided. Secretary Cohen has indicated in a \nletter to me that he does not recommend that additional resources be \napplied to the theater missile defense programs. Unfortunately, the \ncurrent deployment schedule for the TMD programs is inadequate, and I \nhave to respectfully disagree with Secretary Cohen about his assessment \nthat the programs are progressing as fast as they can. This legislation \nwill ensure that the United States and its allies can counter the \ngrowing threat from Iran's ballistic missile program.\n  I hope that the Armed Services Committee will be able to act on this \nlegislation promptly and that the full Senate can debate IMPACT 97 \nearly next year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROBERTS (for himself and Mr. Brownback):\n  S. 1388. A bill to provide relief from unfair interest and penalties \non refunds retroactively ordered by the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                  THE KANSAS NATURAL GAS INDUSTRY ACT\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nspeaks directly to the issue of fairness in public policy.\n  The Kansas natural gas industry operates on the slimmest of margins. \nIt is still subject to the heavy regulatory ambitions of the Federal \nGovernment. It employs 24,000 individuals, operates in 89 of 105 Kansas \ncounties, and in 1996 paid $132 million in mineral and property taxes \nin the State. Mr. President, the natural gas industry is a major \nindustry, an important industry, and a beneficial industry to the \ncitizens and local governments of Kansas. Unfortunately, as happens too \noften, a regulatory body of the Federal Government is about to cripple \nanother valuable industry.\n  At issue is the failure of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \nto use discretionary authority and mitigate damages to the Kansas \nnatural gas industry resulting from a retroactive and punitive order. \nSince 1974, first sellers of natural gas in Kansas have been allowed to \nrecover the cost of a State ad valorem tax. First the Federal Power \nCommission and, later the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, held \nthe Kansas ad valorem tax was eligible for recovery as a reimbursable \ntax under the Federal price ceilings established by the Federal Power \nCommission and later under section 110 of the Natural Gas Policy Act. \nIn 1983, an interstate pipeline company petitioned the Commission to \noverturn treatment of the Kansas ad valorem tax as recoverable. In 1986 \nand 1987, the Commission responded to this petition by stating the \nKansas tax clearly qualified as recoverable. In 1988 the D.C. Circuit \ncourt reviewed these prior rulings and, believing the Commission had \nfailed to adequately explain its orders, remanded the issue to the \nCommission. In 1993, five years after the court remand, the Commission \nreversed 19 years of regulatory treatment of the Kansas ad valorem tax \nand ordered refunds retroactive to the year 1988 based on the date of \nthe District of Columbia Circuit's remand order. Kansas gas producers \npaid the ordered refunds for the period after 1988, both principal and \ninterest. Unfortunately, in 1996 the D.C. Circuit reversed the \nCommission's decision and required refunds back to 1983, based on the \nFederal Register notice of the 1983 interstate pipeline company's \npetition to the Commission. In essence, what had been legal for 19 \nyears was retroactively declared illegal, to the serious financial \ndetriment of not only the Kansas natural gas industry, but local and \nstate government budgets that rely on this industry's economic base. \nThe burden on the industry was made even heavier by the assessment of \ninterest on the period 1983 to 1988.\n  Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to alleviate the unjust \nand punitive financial burden placed upon this Kansas industry by the \nCommission. This legislation does not address the legality of the \nCommission or the court rulings. The subject of this legislation, the \ninterest penalty on the principal between the years 1983 to 1988 with \nsuch interest accumulated to the present, was never considered by the \nD.C. Circuit. This is an issue of equity and of the proper exercise of \ndiscretion and authority by the Commission in association with an order \nretroactively declaring a practice ruled legal for 19 years illegal.\n  While the industry and the State of Kansas still are in the process \nof assessing the cost of this Federal action, there is no question the \ncost will be huge and threatens to bankrupt many small producers. \nRelieving the industry of severe interest penalties is appropriate.\n  Congress entrusts oversight and administration of law to regulatory \nbodies. When that regulatory body fails to properly administer a law, \nor when it exercises authority in an egregious, inequitable manner \ninconsistent with congressional intent, Congress has the\n\n[[Page S11874]]\n\nresponsibility to intervene. Notwithstanding the D.C. Circuit's \ndecision in this case, the actions of the Commission are unacceptable. \nIf ever a case demonstrated the need for oversight of administrative \nbodies and corrective action, this is the case.\n  The natural gas industry and the administrative bodies in Kansas \ngovernment had every right to follow established regulatory guidance in \ntreatment of the Kansas ad valorem tax. Indeed, since 1974, Kansas \nproducers had been permitted to recover this tax. In 1978, with passage \nof the Natural Gas Policy Act, Congress explicitly used the term ad \nvalorem tax in report language to clarify the intent of section 110. \nFurther, upon another challenge in 1983, the Commission reaffirmed and \nruled favorably on the Kansas ad valorem tax as recoverable several \ntimes. Clearly a precedent was established and, over a fourteen year \nperiod, not once did Kansas gas producers have any reason to suspect or \nquestion the Commission's rulings.\n  Mr. President, this is an issue of fairness, of equity, of this \nCongress' oversight responsibilities. Regulated industries have every \nright--indeed a responsibility--to follow and rely upon established \nCommission regulatory guidelines based on statutorily granted \nauthority. I rise today to reaffirm the proper Federal-State \nrelationship and a state's right to rely on regulatory decisions in \nestablishing and administering the natural resource policies of the \nState.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1388\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States in Congress assembled, That the Natural Gas \n     Policy Act of 1978, as amended, is amended by adding the \n     following new section:\n       ``Sec. 603. In the event any refunds of any rates and \n     charges made, demanded, or received for reimbursement of \n     State ad valorem taxes in connection with the sale of natural \n     gas prior to 1989 are ordered to be made by the Commission, \n     the refunds shall be ordered to be made without interest or \n     penalty of any kind.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Burns):\n  S. 1389. A bill to amend title 39, United States Code, to allow \npostal patrons to contribute to funding for prostate cancer research \nthrough the voluntary purchase of certain specially issued U.S. postage \nstamps; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                 the prostate cancer research stamp act\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwould authorize the U.S. Postal Service to issue a special stamp to \nraise funds for prostate cancer research. It is time to fortify the \nbattle against prostate cancer by educating the public about this \ndisease, emphasizing the importance of annual screening, and bolstering \nour research efforts in order to find a cure.\n  In the wake of National Prostate Cancer Awareness week, September, \n22-29, men and women from my home State of Maine are sharing their \nstories about this devastating disease and are calling for more \nprostate cancer research. Prostate cancer is the most common form of \ncancer in American men. The American Cancer Society estimates that \n334,500 cases of prostate cancer will be diagnosed in 1997. Tragically, \n41,000 of these men will die from the disease--a number fast \napproaching the annual breast cancer death toll of 44,300. Between 1989 \nand 1993, the prostate cancer incidence rate increased by 50 percent. \nDespite this dramatic surge in incidence, prostate cancer receives only \na modest fraction, 3.7 percent, of the funding resources allocated to \ncancer. In fiscal year 1997, prostate cancer research funding was $96.2 \nmillion, which is very low considering the number of lives this dreaded \ndisease will rob each year.\n  Advances made over the past 10 years to detect and treat prostate \ncancer have been significant, considering the fact that the digital \nrectal examination [DRE]--the primary tool for detecting prostate \ncancer which has been used for over 100 years--cannot detect small \ntumors or those on the side of the gland where approximately 40 percent \nof prostate cancers are located. Physicians have increased their use of \nthe prostate-specific antigen, P.A. blood test which detects both \naggressive and latent prostate cancers. The National Cancer Institute \nis conducting a multicenter trial to test whether or not early \ndetection of prostate cancer by the DRE and P.A. will reduce prostate \ncancer mortality. Moreover, NCI's Prostate, Lung, Colon and Ovary \nCancer Screening Trial [PLCO], which began in 1993, will eventually \nenroll 74,000 men over its 16 year duration. The trial will determine \nthe relationships between P.A. levels, risk for prostate cancer, and \nthe actual presence and size of prostate cancer in individual men. \nThese advances will help lay a solid foundation for prostate cancer \nresearch into the 21st century.\n  These developments are pivotal steps in the right direction. However, \nif we are going to eradicate this disease, much work needs to be done. \nWe must continue the search for new techniques and methods of \ntreatment. We must be relentless in emphasizing the importance of \neducation and awareness. But most of all, we must find a cure. The \nlives of our fathers, sons, brothers, and friends depend on this \neffort.\n  The Prostate Cancer Research Stamp Act would authorize a special \nfirst class stamp to be priced at up to 8 cents above the cost of \nnormal first class postage. The stamp would be voluntarily purchased by \npostal patrons and the additional money raised by the sale of the stamp \nwould be earmarked for prostate cancer research at the National Cancer \nInstitutes. Perhaps most importantly, this special stamp would help \nbring the disease out into the open. By raising awareness, men of all \nages will be reminded to educate themselves about early detection, \nscreening, prevention and treatment of prostate cancer simply by \nvisiting the post office.\n  The ravages of prostate cancer--like all other cancers--are \ndevastating to the lives of all family members. A stamp designed to \ngarner additional research funds would not only help the hundreds of \nthousands of men who suffer from prostate cancer, but would also remind \nmen to seek regular screening. It is going to take a collective effort \nto find a cure. But if we all play a small role, the investment in this \nvaluable research will pay off and we will be one step closer to \nwinning the battle against prostate cancer.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. D'AMATO:\n  S. 1390. A bill to provide redress for inadequate restitution of \nassets seized by the U.S. Government during World War II which belonged \nto victims of the Holocaust, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Foreign Relations.\n\n\n                   the holocaust victims redress act\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Holocaust \nVictims Redress Act.\n  We all know that the Second World War was one of the darkest periods \nin the history of mankind. Nazi Germany used its vast resources, \ntechnology, and extensive transportation system for the sole purpose of \nthe persecution and annihilation of a single people, simply because of \ntheir religion. This inhumanity was unheard of in history.\n  Starvation, disease, slavery, random executions, children separated \nfrom their parents, husbands separated from their wives, the murder of \ninfants, the rate of women; these were the everyday tortures inflicted \non the Jews of Europe by their Nazi aggressors. By the end of the war, \nthe bulk of the Jewish population, 6 million men, women and children \nhad been killed. And those displaced and demoralized few who survived \nthis ordeal were left to pick up the pieces of their lives and start \nanew.\n  Today, we all know what the Swiss bankers did with the Jewish assets \nentrusted to them. Yet, during that period, the United States \nGovernment seized $198 million in German assets and froze an estimated \n$1.2 billion more in Swiss assets located in the United States, later \nreturned to Switzerland in 1946, after the signing of the Washington \naccords. The unfortunate fact is that among the capital confiscated by \nour Government were funds belonging to Holocaust victims, frozen to \nprevent them from falling into the hands of the Third Reich.\n  Realizing that there were victims of the Holocaust who may not have \nhad any legal heirs, Congress, after the war, authorized the transfer \nof $3 million from those assets to organizations providing relief and \nrehabilitation to\n\n[[Page S11875]]\n\nHolocaust survivors. However, only one-sixth of that amount was ever \npaid to the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization, dedicated to the \ntask of caring for the survivors. In June of this year, Under Secretary \nof State Stuart Eizenstat, in testimony before the House Banking \nCommittee, urged Congress to reconsider the $500,000 settlement made \nwith survivors of the Holocaust, who had assets in U.S. banks, saying \nthey have a compelling moral claim to the unpaid portion of the \nestimated $3 million that was originally authorized for compensation.\n  The Holocaust Victims Redress Act seeks to right these wrongs, \nproviding some amount of justice to survivors of the Holocaust while \nthey are still alive, doing so in the following ways:\n  As I stated earlier, only one-sixth of the amount authorized by \nCongress was actually paid to the Jewish Restitution Successor \nOrganization of New York. This bill would authorize the appropriation \nof funds equal to the present value of the unpaid difference.\n  It would seek to strike an agreement among the signatories of the \nParis Agreement on Reparations whereby all, or a substantial portion, \nof the gold held by the Tripartite Commission for the Restitution of \nMonetary Gold would be contributed to charitable organizations to \nassist elderly survivors of the Holocaust.\n  Furthermore, it expresses the sense of Congress that all governments \nshould act in good faith and facilitate efforts to return private and \npublic properties, looted by the Nazis, to their rightful owners in \naccordance with the Hague Convention of 1907.\n  I would like to congratulate my colleagues, Representatives Jim Leach \nof Iowa and Benjamin Gilman of New York, chairmen of the House Banking \nand House International Affairs Committees respectively, for their work \nto introduce this bill in the House. It is a good bill. It is the right \nand just thing to do. It offers at least a modicum of justice to a \nrapidly diminishing population which has long suffered the wounds of \nhatred and bigotry inflicted by the Nazis. This legislation has the \nsupport of the administration, as demonstrated by Under Secretary of \nState Stuart Eizenstat. I strongly urge the bill's speedy adoption.\n  Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that the text of the bill, \nalong with letters from Under Secretary of State Stuart Eizenstat and \nthe Anti-Defamation League in support of the legislation, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1390\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Holocaust Victims Redress \n     Act''.\n                        TITLE I--HEIRLESS ASSETS\n\n     SEC. 101. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Among the $198,000,000 in German assets located in the \n     United States and seized by the United States Government in \n     World War II were believed to be bank accounts, trusts, \n     securities, or other assets belonging to Jewish victims of \n     the Holocaust.\n       (2) Among an estimated $1,200,000,000 in assets of Swiss \n     nationals and institutions which were frozen by the United \n     States Government during World War II (including over \n     $400,000,000 in bank deposits) were assets whose beneficial \n     owners were believed to include victims of the Holocaust.\n       (3) In the aftermath of the war, the Congress recognized \n     that some of the victims of the Holocaust whose assets were \n     among those seized or frozen during the war might not have \n     any legal heirs, and legislation was enacted to authorize the \n     transfer of up to $3,000,000 of such assets to organizations \n     dedicated to providing relief and rehabilitation for \n     survivors of the Holocaust.\n       (4) Although the Congress and the Administration authorized \n     the transfer of such amount to the relief organizations \n     referred to in paragraph (3), the enormous administrative \n     difficulties and cost involved in proving legal ownership of \n     such assets, directly or beneficially, by victims of the \n     Holocaust, and proving the existence or absence of heirs of \n     such victims, led the Congress in 1962 to agree to a lump-sum \n     settlement and to provide $500,000 for the Jewish Restitution \n     Successor Organization of New York, such sum amounting to \\1/\n     6\\th of the authorized maximum level of ``heirless'' assets \n     to be transferred.\n       (5) In June of 1997, a representative of the Secretary of \n     State, in testimony before the Congress, urged the \n     reconsideration of the limited $500,000 settlement.\n       (6) While a precisely accurate accounting of ``heirless'' \n     assets may be impossible, good conscience warrants the \n     recognition that the victims of the Holocaust have a \n     compelling moral claim to the unrestituted portion of assets \n     referred to in paragraph (3).\n       (7) Furthermore, leadership by the United States in meeting \n     obligations to Holocaust victims would strengthen--\n       (A) the efforts of the United States to press for the \n     speedy distribution of the remaining nearly 6 metric tons of \n     gold still held by the Tripartite Commission for the \n     Restitution of Monetary Gold (the body established by France, \n     Great Britain, and the United States at the end of World War \n     II to return gold looted by Nazi Germany to the central banks \n     of countries occupied by Germany during the war); and\n       (B) the appeals by the United States to the 15 nations \n     claiming a portion of such gold to contribute a substantial \n     portion of any such distribution to Holocaust survivors in \n     recognition of the recently documented fact that the gold \n     held by the Commission includes gold stolen from individual \n     victims of the Holocaust.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To provide a measure of justice to survivors of the \n     Holocaust all around the world while they are still alive.\n       (2) To authorize the appropriation of an amount which is at \n     least equal to the present value of the difference between \n     the amount which was authorized to be transferred to \n     successor organizations to compensate for assets in the \n     United States of heirless victims of the Holocaust and the \n     amount actually paid in 1962 to the Jewish Restitution \n     Successor Organization of New York for that purpose.\n       (3) To facilitate efforts by the United States to seek an \n     agreement whereby nations with claims against gold held by \n     the Tripartite Commission for the Restitution of Monetary \n     Gold would contribute all, or a substantial portion, of that \n     gold to charitable organizations to assist survivors of the \n     Holocaust.\n\n     SEC. 102. DISTRIBUTIONS BY THE TRIPARTITE GOLD COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Directions to the President.--The President shall \n     direct the commissioner representing the United States on the \n     Tripartite Commission for the Restitution of Monetary Gold, \n     established pursuant to Part III of the Paris Agreement on \n     Reparation, to seek and vote for a timely agreement under \n     which all signatories to the Paris Agreement on Reparation, \n     with claims against the monetary gold pool in the \n     jurisdiction of such Commission, contribute all, or a \n     substantial portion, of such gold to charitable organizations \n     to assist survivors of the Holocaust.\n       (b) Authority To Obligate the United States.--\n       (1) In general.--From funds otherwise unobligated in the \n     Treasury of the United States, the President is authorized to \n     obligate an amount not to exceed $30,000,000 for distribution \n     in accordance with subsections (a) and (b).\n       (2) Conformance with budget act requirement.--Any budget \n     authority contained in paragraph (1) shall be effective only \n     to such extent and in such amounts as are provided in advance \n     in appropriation Acts.\n\n     SEC. 103. FULFILLMENT OF OBLIGATION OF THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       (a) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to the President such sums as may be \n     necessary for fiscal years 1998, 1999, and 2000, not to \n     exceed a total of $25,000,000 for all such fiscal years, for \n     distribution to organizations as may be specified in any \n     agreement concluded pursuant to section 102, only if the \n     organizations meet the needs of Holocaust survivors in the \n     United States.\n       (b) Archival Research.--There are authorized to be \n     appropriated to the President $5,000,000 for archival \n     research and translation services to assist in the \n     restitution of assets looted or extorted from victims of the \n     Holocaust and such other activities that would further \n     Holocaust remembrance and education.\n                         TITLE II--WORKS OF ART\n\n     SEC. 201. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Established pre-World War II principles of \n     international law, as enunciated in Articles 47 and 56 of the \n     Regulations annexed to the 1907 Hague Convention (IV) \n     Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land, prohibited \n     pillage and the seizure of works of art.\n       (2) In the years since World War II, international \n     sanctions against confiscation of works of art have been \n     amplified through such conventions as the 1970 Convention on \n     the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, \n     Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property, which \n     forbids the illegal export of art work and calls for its \n     earliest possible restitution to its rightful owner.\n       (3) In defiance of the 1907 Hague Convention, the Nazis \n     extorted and looted art from individuals and institutions in \n     countries it occupied during World War II and used such booty \n     to help finance their war of aggression.\n       (4) The Nazis' policy of looting art was a critical element \n     and incentive in their campaign of genocide against \n     individuals of Jewish and other religious and cultural \n     heritage and, in this context, the Holocaust, while standing \n     as a civil war against defined individuals and civilized \n     values, must be considered a fundamental aspect of the world \n     war unleashed on the continent.\n\n[[Page S11876]]\n\n       (5) Hence, the same international legal principles applied \n     among states should be applied to art and other assets stolen \n     from victims of the Holocaust.\n       (6) In the aftermath of the war, art and other assets were \n     transferred from territory previously controlled by the Nazis \n     to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, much of which has \n     not been returned to rightful owners.\n\n     SEC. 202. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING RESTITUTION OF \n                   PRIVATE PROPERTY, SUCH AS WORKS OF ART.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that consistent with the \n     1907 Hague Convention, all governments should undertake good \n     faith efforts to facilitate the return of private and public \n     property, such as works of art, to the rightful owners in \n     cases where assets were confiscated from the claimant during \n     the period of Nazi rule and there is reasonable proof that \n     the claimant is the rightful owner.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     U.S. Department of State,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 4, 1997.\n     Hon. Alphonse M. D'Amato,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator D'Amato: I want to bring you up to date on our \n     efforts to establish a ``Nazi Persecutee Relief Fund'' from \n     the remaining Tripartite Commission Gold (TGC) gold pool. As \n     you know, the TGC was charged after the war with gathering \n     the gold looted by the Nazis and with returning it to the \n     central banks from which it had been taken. Most of the gold \n     in the fund had been returned to the 15 claimant countries \n     long ago, but about 1.6% of the pool remains undistributed. \n     This now amounts to about $60 to $70 million at current \n     values.\n       Our TGC partners, the British and French, like us, very \n     much want to close out the fund. Mindful of the origin of \n     some of the gold, they have joined with us in proposing to \n     the claimant states that the remaining gold be transferred to \n     this new special Holocaust victims fund. Reactions from the \n     claimant countries have been generally positive, and we are \n     hopeful that such a fund might be announced by the end of the \n     year. The idea if that each of the claimant countries would \n     voluntarily turn over all or part of its share to the new \n     fund. Other countries, including neutral countries that had \n     received Nazi gold during the war, would also be invited to \n     contribute, as would other states that have an interest in, \n     or played a role in the collection and disposition of the \n     tainted gold. A TGC working group met in Brussels in late \n     September to discuss how such a fund might be established. A \n     follow-up meeting will be held shortly.\n       We would very much like the United States to participate in \n     this fund with it own contribution of up to $25 million. The \n     legislation that you and Congressman Leach have introduced is \n     very supportive of this objective. It is very important that \n     we be able to assist both American and other needy victims of \n     the Nazi Holocaust. Such a contribution would be fully \n     consistent with our leadership role and provide a powerful \n     incentive for the TGC claimant countries, wartime neutrals, \n     and others, also to contribute.\n       The legislation is being reviewed by our experts and their \n     comments will be provided to you shortly. I hope that we can \n     work together to achieve the establishment of this fund, and \n     our contribution to it.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                              Stuart A. Bizenstat,\n     Ambassador.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       Anti-Defamation League,\n\n                                   New York, NY, November 5, 1997.\n     Hon. Alfonse D'Amato,\n     Chairman, Senate Banking Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Alfonse: We commend your leadership in seeking to \n     investigate and expose the large-scale plundering of Jewish \n     assets during the Holocaust and the depth of the involvement \n     of banks and governments in helping finance the Nazi war \n     machine.\n       As aging survivors wait out arduous investigations and \n     negotiations, we must act quickly to enable them to live out \n     their remaining years with as much dignity and sense of \n     healing as possible.\n       The Holocaust Victims Redress Act would offer much needed \n     support to some victims and strengthen our nation's hand in \n     appealing to other nations to commit resources to help \n     survivors.\n       We are grateful for your efforts to awaken the conscience \n     of the American people and your resolve to do justice for \n     remaining Holocaust victims. If the U.S. hopes to credibly \n     compel all nations to act, we must act expeditiously and take \n     responsibility for any inadequacies in our own post-war \n     behavior.\n           Sincerely,\n     Howard P. Berkowitz,\n       National Chairman.\n     Abraham H. Foxman,\n       National Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Warner, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Grams, Mr. \n        Jeffords, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 1391. A bill to authorize the President to permit the sale and \nexport of food, medicines, and medical equipment to Cuba; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n          the cuban women and children humanitarian relief act\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I join with my colleagues, Senators \nWarner, Bennett, Jeffords, Grams, Bingaman, and Leahy in introducing \nthe Cuban Women and Children Humanitarian Relief Act--a bill to \nauthorize the President to permit the sale of food, medicine, and \nmedical equipment to the Cuban people.\n\n  Provisions of this bill include a summary of the impact that the \nUnited States embargo on food and medicine has had on the public health \nin Cuba; a statement of United States policy with respect to the sale \nof food and medicine; authority for the President to permit the sale of \nfood, medicine, and medical supplies to Cuba; congressional \nnotification requirements; and a report to Congress assessing the \nimpact of the bill 2 years after enactment.\n  Mr. President, the intent of the legislation is very straight \nforward, namely to clear away all of the legal implements that impede \nthe President's ability to permit American exports of food, medicines, \nand medical supplies to Cuba. As a matter of policy, I do not believe \nthat United States sanctions should include prohibitions on the sale of \nwhat are essentially humanitarian items--products that are critical to \nthe health and well being of the more than 10 million people who \ninhabit the Island of Cuba.\n  Most Americans are probably unaware that United States policy \ngenerally prohibits American food and drug companies from selling food, \nmedicines, and medical supplies to Cuba. Even those who are aware of \nthis aspect of United States policy, probably assume that this isn't a \nserious problem, since Cuban authorities can simply buy these products \nelsewhere. That is not the case.\n  Earlier this year, the American Association for World Health [AAWH] \nissued a report--Denial of Food and Medicine: The Impact of the U.S. \nEmbargo on Health & Nutrition in Cuba--setting forth its observations \nfrom a year long study of the implications of the United States embargo \non health care delivery and food security in Cuba. The AAWH \n``determined that the United States embargo of Cuba has dramatically \nharmed the health and nutrition of large numbers of ordinary Cuban \ncitizens.'' The team of nine medical experts who undertook this effort \non behalf of AAWH identified four major health problems affected by the \nembargo: malnutrition, water quality, medicines and equipment, and \nmedical information.\n  First, with respect to malnutrition--the prohibition on the sale of \nUnited States food to Cuba has had serious consequences on the \nnutritional standards in Cuba, particularly for pregnant women. These \nnutritional deficiencies have, among other things, led to an increased \nincidence of low birth-weight babies.\n  With respect to water quality, the lack of parts and appropriate \nchemicals has compromised the Cuban water supply system and resulted in \nincreased illness and deaths from water-borne diseases.\n  We all know that United States medical and pharmaceutical companies \nare at the forefront of the development and production of a vast \nmajority of all new drugs and medical equipment that enter world \nmarkets. The by-product of that situation is that current United States \nrestrictions virtually preclude the Cuban medical system from utilizing \nthe most effective and advanced medicines and medical treatments in \ncaring for the Cuban people. Finally, the embargo indirectly inhibits \nthe exchange of critical medical information between the United States \nand Cuba.\n  In no way should this legislation be seen as an endorsement of the \ncurrent regime in Cuba. The existing policies of that government are \nclearly responsible for the serious economic crisis confronting that \ncountry. United States policy should be focused on promoting a peaceful \ntransition to democracy in Cuba--the tide of history flows in that \ndirection.\n  Many human rights activists within Cuba have been strongly critical \nof United States food and medicine restrictions. Elizardo Sanchez \nSantacruz, director of the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and \nNational Reconciliation, and a prominent critic of the Cuban \nGovernment, has made clear his views on the current policy. ``America\n\n[[Page S11877]]\n\nshould lift its embargo on the sales of food and medicine to Cuba, a \nprohibition that violates international law and hurts the people, not \nthe regime. Denying medicine to innocent citizens is an odd way of \ndemonstrating support for human rights.''\n  I share that view. I believe the Clinton administration should take \nsteps to mitigate the harmful impact of United States policy on the \nhealth of the Cuban people--particularly so with respect to the health \nof children, the elderly, and the infirm--by permitting United States \nexporters to sell food and medicine to that country. That is what this \nbill once enacted will enable the President to do.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1391\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act shall be known as the ``Cuban Women and Children \n     Humanitarian Relief Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the outright ban on the sale of American foodstuffs to \n     Cuba has contributed to serious nutritional deficits, \n     particularly among pregnant women, leading to low birth-\n     weight babies;\n       (2) the embargo on trade with Cuba is severely restricting \n     Cuba's access to water treatment chemicals and spare parts \n     for its water supply, causing reductions in the supply of \n     safe drinking water and the increased incidence of water-\n     borne diseases;\n       (3) the most specialized medical supplies are in short \n     supply or entirely absent from some Cuban clinics as a result \n     of the United States embargo;\n       (4) although informational materials have been exempt from \n     the United States trade embargo since 1988, in practice very \n     little medical information is exchanged between the United \n     States and Cuba due to travel restrictions, currency \n     regulations, and shipping difficulties; and\n       (5) current embargoes against Iran, Libya, and Iraq do not \n     ban the sale of food to those countries or restrict medical \n     commerce.\n\n     SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       It should be the policy of the United States to permit the \n     sale and export of food, medicines, and medical equipment to \n     the Cuban people.\n\n     SEC. 4. AUTHORITY.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the President \n     is authorized to permit the sale and export of food, \n     medicines, and medical equipment to Cuba by any person \n     subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 5. NOTIFICATION OF CONGRESS AND THE PUBLIC.\n\n       The President shall notify Congress of any decision to \n     exercise the authority of section 4 and shall, at the time \n     the decision is made, cause such decision to be published in \n     the Federal Register, together with such regulations as the \n     President determines may be necessary to ensure that food, \n     medicines, and medical equipment sold to Cuba under this Act \n     will primarily be consumed or otherwise utilized by the \n     people of Cuba.\n\n     SEC. 6. REPORT TO CONGRESS.\n\n       Two years after the date that the President first exercises \n     the authority of section 4, the President shall submit a \n     report to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the \n     President of the Senate containing an assessment of the \n     level, composition, and end users of any food, medicine, or \n     medical equipment sold to Cuba during the previous two years \n     by any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United \n     States.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Cuban \nWomen and Children Humanitarian Relief Act. The objective of this \nlegislation, quite simply, is to remove some of the more objectionable \naspects of the standing United States trade embargo on Cuba, especially \nthose that imperil the health of women, children, and other vulnerable \ngroups. The bill would remove existing restrictions on the sale to Cuba \nof American food, medicines, and health supplies. Under current law, it \nis all but impossible for American companies to sell these items to \nCuba.\n  Mr. President, I have long held reservations about the effectiveness \nof our trade embargo on Cuba. After all, we have maintained a trade \nblockade on Cuba for 37 years and have little to show for it in terms \nof moving the Cuban Government in the direction of freedom or peaceful \ncoexistence.\n  However, this bill is not about how best to pressure the Castro \ngovernment. Nor is it intended in any way to signal a change in overall \nUnited States policy toward Cuba. What this bill is about is making \nsure that children and other vulnerable groups do not bear the brunt of \nthe trade embargo. The impact of the embargo on these groups has become \nmore severe since passage of the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992, which \ntightened the restrictions on food and medical shipments to Cuba.\n  The respected American Association for World Health concluded that \nthese new, tougher trade sanctions have caused ``a significant rise in \nsuffering--and even deaths--in Cuba.'' In particular, the AAWH found \nthat the embargo on food and medicines has led to malnutrition, reduced \nwater quality, and the unavailability or short supply of routine \nmedical supplies.\n  I do not believe that the American people intended that the trade \nembargo against Cuba lead to such demonstrable human suffering. Whether \none supports the overall embargo or not, surely we can agree that the \npain that this policy inflicts should not be borne by children.\n  All of which is not to absolve Fidel Castro of much of the blame for \nthe deteriorating state of health in Cuba. The OAS's Inter-American \nCommission on Human Rights has noted that many of the medical products \nmanufactured in Cuba are reserved for hospitals that cater to \nforeigners. This has apparently caused much resentment among ordinary \nCubans who feel discriminated against in their country.\n  But we, too, are the target of much resentment owing to our trade \nrestrictions on medicines and medical supplies. If a Cuban cannot gain \naccess to an important drug--50 percent of the most important drugs in \nthe world are available only from the United States or United States-\nlicensed firms--or no longer has safe drinking water because water \ntreatment chemicals or water supply spare parts cannot be obtained, he \ncan quite credibly blame the United States for his plight. In fact, \nCastro has made the most of this situation by pointing to the United \nStates embargo as the source of almost all of Cuba's health problems.\n  The State Department maintains that the United States trade \nrestrictions have not blocked medical shipments to Cuba and that many \nfirms have successfully met the conditions required to obtain a permit \nfor such trade. However, the reality is that the requirements to obtain \nsuch a license are so stringent that few drug companies are willing \neven to consider sales to Cuba. Those that do often find themselves \ninvestigated for technical and inadvertent violations of the embargo \nand ultimately abandon efforts to sell to Cuba. Moreover, relief groups \nsuch as Catholic Relief Services and Church World Services have found \nthe licensing requirements cumbersome, complex, and costly.\n  Sales of foodstuffs are barred altogether. And there is no way around \nit--no licenses, special permits, or other recourse. I think it's worth \nnoting that our current embargos against Iran, Iraq, and Libya do not \nbar the sale of food or medicines to those countries.\n  Mr. President, the American people are not mean-spirited. We want our \nGovernment to be tough-minded in protecting our interests but do not \nwant innocent people to suffer. Even in the case of those countries \nadamantly opposed to United States interests and values, such as Iran \nand North Korea, we have reached out with humanitarian assistance in \nresponse to natural disasters and famines. We should treat Cuba no \ndifferently. We should not allow our political objectives undermine the \nhealth and well-being of those most in need, especially children.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Johnson, and Mr. \n        Conrad):\n  S. 1393. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the permanent extension of the incentives for alcohol used as a \nfuel; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                          gasohol legislation\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation to \npermanently extend the Federal gasohol tax incentives that are \ncurrently available to encourage the development and use of ethanol. I \nam pleased that Senators Daschle, Johnson, and Conrad are joining me as \ncosponsors of this important bill.\n  I've been a long-time supporter of the domestic ethanol program \nbecause of its importance to this country's energy\n\n[[Page S11878]]\n\nand economic interests. And I was deeply troubled when Congress failed \nto take action earlier this year to keep these ethanol tax incentives \nfrom expiring in the year 2000. Ethanol is an important part of our \ndomestic fuels industry, and it merits continued support via the Tax \nCode.\n  The ethanol industry helps us to reduce our reliance on foreign oil. \nIt also provides environmental benefits and stimulates our agricultural \nindustry. In fact, one recent study found that the additional demand \nfor grain created by ethanol boosts total employment by nearly 200,000 \nwhile saving the Federal budget more than $3 billion.\n  Today's ethanol tax incentive program has strong support in the \nSenate. Currently there is a 54-cent per gallon of ethanol credit \navailable for ethanol blenders. Typically ethanol blenders get the full \nbenefit of the 54-cent income tax credit by claiming a 5.4-cent \nexemption from the gasoline excise tax. The 5.4-cent exemption is \nequivalent to 54 cents per gallon of ethanol. Small producers are \nprovided a 10-cent per gallon credit of ethanol produced, used or sold \nas a transportation fuel.\n  Some of my colleagues in the Senate are now proposing to extend the \nethanol tax incentives through the year 2007 and thereafter connect its \nfuture to any extensions of the Federal gasoline excise tax. Of course \nI will continue to support any reasonable efforts to extend the tax \nincentives currently available for ethanol. But I think it's time to \nmake the major ethanol tax incentives a permanent part of our Tax Code, \nas are many tax incentives for other energy sectors. The legislation \nthat I am introducing today will accomplish this goal.\n  The overwhelming vote of 69 to 30 on the Senate floor during the \nconsideration of the tax bill this summer shows that a vast majority of \nSenators strongly favor continuing the ethanol tax incentives. \nUnfortunately, the Senate's provision extending the ethanol incentives \nwas dropped in conference. But the ethanol program retains the strong \nsupport of many Members in the House of Representatives as well, and by \na broad coalition of Governors, farmers, environmentalists and \nconsumers across this country.\n  The future of the ethanol program is too important to our Nation's \nenergy, environmental and economic interests to be derailed by a few \npowerful members in the House of Representatives. Allowing the ethanol \ntax incentives to expire in 2000 is short-sighted and unfair. The \nethanol industry is no less important than the other energy sectors \nwhich enjoy permanent tax incentives, and the Internal Revenue Code \nshould reflect this simple fact.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join me in making the U.S. \nethanol tax incentive program permanent.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES:\n  S. 1395. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to provide \nfor the establishment of the Thurgood Marshall Legal Educational \nOpportunity Program; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\nthe thurgood marshall legal educational opportunity program act of 1997\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. I rise today to offer legislation which would establish \nthe Thurgood Marshall Legal Educational Opportunity Program. This \nprogram would allow the Department of Education to award grants to \nuniversities to provide assistance to low-income, minority or \neconomically disadvantaged students who are seeking a legal education.\n  For more than 28 years, such assistance was provided through \nappropriations authorized by the Higher Education Act [HEA] of 1965. \nThese critical funds were channeled through the Council on Legal \nEducation Opportunity [CLEO] and were used to help qualified \ndisadvantaged students gain admission to law school and prepare \nthemselves for their legal education.\n  Since 1968, the heart of the CLEO program has been the 6-week pre-law \nsummer institute. These institutes, held on law school campuses across \nthe country, simulate the classroom setting of first year law school, \nexposing students to the rigors of legal study. Utilizing full-time law \nschool professors and a proven curriculum that emphasizes critical \nthinking, legal analysis and writing skills, CLEO has built a \nreputation of credibility and has produced more than 6,000 successful \nalumni from more than 170 law schools.\n  Unfortunately, Federal funding for CLEO was eliminated during the \nfiscal year 1996 appropriations process. This highly beneficial and \ncost-effective program has persevered primarily through the assistance \nof private donations and the sponsorship of the American Bar \nAssociation [ABA].\n  The bill I am introducing today, a companion to Congressman Cummings' \nlegislation in the House, would restore much of the CLEO framework. The \nThurgood Marshall Legal Opportunity Program would identify socially and \neconomically disadvantaged law school students and provide them with \nthe opportunity to hone their skills through summer institutes, midyear \nseminars and support services.\n  Mr. President, every society places a premium on education in terms \nof developing a skilled and trained work force in the next generation, \nand the more economically complex the world becomes, the more urgent it \nis to develop these human resources. This program will provide the \nnecessary resources to ensure that those who have proven themselves at \nthe undergraduate level of study are able to maximize their potential \nas they move on to law school.\n  Investing in the promise of these talented individuals is a \nworthwhile endeavor and I encourage my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1395\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to expand \nthe School Breakfast Program in elementary schools; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                     the meals for achievement act\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Meals \nfor Achievement Act. This bill, if enacted, is intended to expand the \nschool breakfast program in elementary schools.\n  In his State of the Union address earlier this year, President \nClinton called education ``my number one priority for the next four \nyears.'' Congress has echoed this sentiment with a variety of bills \nintended to improve the readiness of children to take their place in \nAmerica's work force in order to secure our place in a strong economy. \nFor the United States to compete effectively in the world we must have \nan educated and productive work force. In order to have an educated and \nproductive work force, we must prepare our children to learn. In order \nto prepare our children to learn they must be well nourished, and that \nbegins with a good breakfast.\n  The best teachers in the world, with the best standards, cannot teach \na hungry child. A child who begins his or her school day with their \nstomach growling because they either did not have time to eat breakfast \nor there was no breakfast to be served, is simply too distracted to \nfocus on the lessons being provided by the teacher.\n  In 1994, the Minnesota Legislature directed the Minnesota Department \nof Children, Families and Learning to implement a universal breakfast \npilot program integrating breakfast into the education schedule for all \nstudents. The evaluation of the pilot project, performed by the Center \nfor Applied Research and Educational Improvement at the University of \nMinnesota, shows that when all students are involved in school \nbreakfast there is a general increase in learning and achievement.\n  Researchers at Harvard and Massachusetts General Hospital recently \ncompleted a study on the results of universal free breakfast at one \npublic school in Philadelphia and two in Baltimore. The study, to be \npublished in the Journal of Pediatrics in the near future, found that \nstudents who ate the breakfast showed great improvement in math grades, \nattendance, and punctuality. The researchers also observed that \nstudents displayed fewer signs of depression, anxiety, hyperactivity, \nand other behavioral problems.\n  As reported by the Community Childhood Hunger Identification Project \n[CCHIP], hungry children are more likely to be ill and absent from \nschool and are less likely to interact with other people or explore or \nlearn from their surroundings. This interferes with their ability to \nlearn from a very early age. School-aged children who are hungry cannot \nconcentrate or do as well as others on the tasks they need to perform \nto learn the basics. Research indicates that low-income children who \nparticipate in the School Breakfast Program show an improvement in \nstandardized test scores and a decrease in tardiness and absenteeism \ncompared to low-income students who do not eat breakfast at school.\n  According to the Tufts University Center on Hunger, Poverty, and \nNutrition Policy, evidence from recent research about child nutrition \nshows that, in addition to having a detrimental effect on the cognitive \ndevelopment of children, undernutrition results in lost knowledge, \nbrainpower, and productivity for the Nation.\n  If we are serious about improving productivity in America through our \neducation system, we must first prepare our children to learn. The time \nhas come, therefore, to build upon the pilot program in Minnesota, \nPhiladelphia, Baltimore, and other cities, and integrate school \nbreakfast into the education day, at least at the elementary school \nlevel.\n  Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today would not \nmandate the school breakfast program. A local school could still decide \nwhether or not to participate, and each parent can decide for \nthemselves whether or not to have their child participate.\n  I do appreciate that there is a cost involved with this initiative \nand, therefore, we may have to phase it in over a few years. However, \nthe time has come to set the course for our future direction in the \nSchool Breakfast Program and take our first step forward.\n  The Meals for Achievement Act raises an important policy question. \nThe question is: What is the basic purpose and goal of the School \nBreakfast Program? Is the School Breakfast Program a welfare program? \nOr, Is the School Breakfast Program a nutrition and education program \nintended to prepare children for a successful educational experience? \nIf the School Breakfast Program is a welfare program then my \nlegislation would not make sense. I do not believe that we should be \nproviding welfare to individuals who do not need assistance. If, on the \nother hand, the School Breakfast Program is a part of the education \nday, and is intended to prepare children to learn, then, in my opinion, \nit should include all children. School books are provided to all \nchildren without regard to their income; school buses are used by \nchildren without regard to their income; and that is how we should view \nthe School Breakfast Program.\n  I commend this legislation to my colleagues and to the \nadministration. As many of you know the child nutrition programs must \nbe reauthorized in 1998 and the Administration is currently drafting \nits proposal to send to Congress after the first of the year. I would \nhope Secretary Glickman and my friends at the Department of \nAgriculture, as well as those at the Office of Management and Budget, \nconsider making the Meals for Achievement Act a part of their \nlegislative initiative.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1396\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Meals for Achievement Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. EXPANSION OF SCHOOL BREAKFAST PROGRAM.\n\n       Section 4(b)(1)(B) of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 \n     U.S.C. 1773(b)(1)(B)) is amended--\n       (1) in the first sentence, by striking ``for each free \n     breakfast'' and inserting ``for each breakfast served in an \n     elementary school and each free breakfast served in a school \n     other than an elementary school'';\n       (2) in the second sentence, by inserting ``served in a \n     school other than an elementary school'' after ``reduced \n     price breakfast''; and\n       (3) in the third sentence, by inserting ``in a school other \n     than an elementary school'' after ``served''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, today I, along with my distinguished \ncolleague from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, am submitting this \nconcurrent resolution which calls for a United States effort to end the \nrestrictions on the freedoms and violations of the human rights of the \nenclaved people in the occupied portion of Cyprus. A little over 2 \nyears ago, Senator Mikulski and I had introduced a bill to address \nthese very same concerns which, unfortunately, are still with us.\n  Mr. President, I am aware that developments on Cyprus are not known \nto most Americans. Yet if I were to tell them that a small nation has \nhad part of its land illegally occupied by a neighboring state for over \n23 years, I know they would be both shocked and outraged. The 23 years \nsince the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus have seen the end of the cold \nwar, the collapse of the USSR, free elections in South Africa and a \nreunited Germany, yet while the line through the heart of Berlin is \ngone, the line through the heart of Cyprus remains.\n  Over two decades ago, Turkey's brutal invasion drove more than \n200,000 Cypriots from their homes. Turkey still controls about one-\nthird of the island of Cyprus and maintains about 30,000 troops there. \nHowever, there remains, in northern Cyprus, a small remnant of 497 \nenclaved Greek-Cypriots. The reason they are referred to as the \nenclaved of Cyprus is that during the fighting in 1974 they mostly \nresided in remote enclaves and therefore were not able to flee the \nfighting and thus were not immediately expelled. Nevertheless the \nenclaved people of Cyprus have still seen their numbers reduced from \n11,300 in 1974 to the 497 there are today.\n  Mr. President, I am hopeful that with the appointment of Ambassador \nRichard Holbrooke as the Special Presidential Envoy for Cyprus that a \nlong-overdue settlement will finally be reached. However, I believe \nthat this resolution is nevertheless important in serving to bring to \nthe attention of the American people and the world community, the \nhardships and restrictions endured by these enclaved individuals.\n  In 1975, representatives of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities \nagreed that the Greek-Cypriots in the northern part of the island were \nto be given every help to lead a normal life. Twenty-two years later \nthis is still not the case.\n  The presence of the Turkish-Cypriot police in the lives of the \nenclaved Greek-Cypriots is constant, and there are restrictions on land \ntravel. Other human rights restrictions and deprivations include:\n  Restrictions on private telephones;\n  Restrictions on hand-carried mail and newspapers;\n  Difficulties in receiving full educational opportunities;\n  Restricted access to and religious use of the monastery at Apostolos \nAndreas;\n  A requirement that enclaved males aged 18-50 must report once a week \nto those in control; and\n  A lack of investigation with regard to harassment, beating, rape and \nmurder.\n  Mr. President, this situation calls out for justice. By bringing \nthese human rights violations to the attention of the American people, \nit is my hope and that of Senator Mikulski, that we can bring the \nplight of these people to the World's attention. Our resolution urges \nthe President to undertake efforts to end the restrictions on the \nfreedoms and human rights of the enclaved people. I will remain \nactively involved in this issue until their rights and freedoms are \nrestored.\n  This is the least we can do for these people. That is why I wish \nAmbassador Holbrooke the best of success in his efforts to achieve a \nsettlement. While this resolution addresses the plight of the enclaved \npeople of Cyprus, work must not cease on efforts to bring about a \nwithdrawal of Turkish forces and a restorations of Cyprus' sovereignty \nover the entire island with the full respect of the rights of all \nCypriots.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator Snowe in \nsubmitting the Enclaved People of Cyprus concurrent resolution. This \nlegislation puts the Congress on record in support of human rights and \nfreedom for all the people of Cyprus.\n  In 1974 Turkish troops invaded Cyprus and divided the island. For 23 \nyears, the people of Cyprus have lived under an immoral and illegal \noccupation. The enclaved people in the northern part of the island have \nsuffered most. Their travel is restricted. They may not attend the \nschool of their choice. Their access to their religious sites is \nrestricted. They are often harassed and discriminated against.\n  The United Nations and the European Union have documented these human \nrights abuses and have called on the Turkish Cypriots to respect the \nbasic freedoms of the Greek-Cypriots and Maronites living in the \nnorthern part of the island.\n  Our foreign policy must reflect our values. The legislation we are \nintroducing calls for an end to the restrictions on the freedoms of the \nenclaved people in the occupied part of Cyprus. It states that Congress \nwill remain active until the human rights and fundamental freedoms of \nthe enclaved people of Cyprus are restored, respected and safeguarded.\n  Mr. President, I am hopeful that this year we will bring peace to \nCyprus. But our efforts to improve human rights on the island cannot \nwait. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/06/senate-section/article/S11881-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 144--RELATIVE TO THE LEWIS AND CLARK EXPEDITION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Ms. Moseley-Braun) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I am pleased to submit today, along with \nmany of my colleagues, a Senate resolution that designates the month of \nNovember 1997, as ``American Indian Heritage Month.'' I feel it is \nappropriate and deserving to honor American Indians and Alaska Natives, \nas the original inhabitants of the land that now constitutes the United \nStates, with this November designation as Congress has done for the \npast 7 years.\n  American Indians and Alaska Natives have left an indelible imprint on \nmany aspects of our everyday life that we often take for granted. The \narts, education, science, medicine, industry, and government are areas \nthat have been influenced by American Indian and Alaska Native people. \nMany of the healing remedies that we use today were obtained from \npractices already in use by Indian people.\n  Mr. President, many of the basic principles of democracy in our \nConstitution can be traced to ideologies already in use by Indian \ntribal governments including such doctrines of freedom of speech and \nseparation of powers. Our Founding Fathers benefited greatly from \nassistance given to them by Indian tribes in the early stages of \nestablishing our Nation.\n  Our respect for the preservation of natural resources, reverence for \nour elders, and adherence to tradition, were developed, in part, \nthrough contact with American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n  American Indian and Alaska Native people have proudly served and \ndedicated their lives in the military defense of our country in wartime \nand in peace. In fact, their participation rate in the Armed Forces far \noutstrips the rates of all other groups in this Nation. They gave their \nlives in defense of this Nation even before they were allowed to be \ncitizens in 1924.\n  Many of the words in our language have been borrowed from native \nlanguages, including many of the names of the rivers, cities, and \nStates across our Nation. Indian arts and crafts have also made a \ndistinct impression on our heritage.\n  It is my hope that by designating the month of November 1997, as \n``American Indian Heritage Month,'' it will encourage self-esteem, \npride, and self awareness in American Indians and Alaska Natives of all \nages. Many schools, organizations, Federal, State, and local \ngovernments also plan activities and programs to celebrate the \nachievements of American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n  November is a special time in the history of the United States; we \ncelebrate the Thanksgiving holiday by remembering the American Indians \nand English settlers as they enjoyed the bounty of their harvest and \nthe promise of new kinships. That is why, this is an appropriate time \nof the year for this designation.\n  Therefore, I ask for the support of my colleagues for this special \ntribute of this country, and urge the Senate to pass this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/06/senate-section/article/S11882-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11883-S11889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               THE RECIPROCAL TRADE AGREEMENT ACT OF 1997\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 DORGAN (AND CONRAD) AMENDMENT NO. 1593\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. DORGAN (for himself and Mr. Conrad) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by them to the bill (S. 1269) to establish \nobjectives for negotiating and procedures for implementing certain \ntrade agreements; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   .

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States has had 21 years of consecutive \n     annual merchandise trade deficits, totaling \n     $1,984,270,000,000.\n       (2) In 1996, the United States had the largest negative \n     trade balance in its history, amounting to $191,170,000,000. \n     It is the third consecutive year in which the trade deficit \n     has set a new record. Economic forecasts anticipate continued \n     growth in the trade deficit in the next few years.\n       (3) Private economic forecasts now project that the trade \n     deficit will nearly double within the next 10 to 15 years.\n       (4) The positive net international asset position that the \n     United States built up over 100 years was eliminated in the \n     1980s. The United States today has become the world's largest \n     debtor nation, with a net debt of more than $774,000,000,000.\n       (5) In recent times, the trade deficit has retarded growth \n     in the Nation's gross domestic product, increased the costs \n     of servicing higher net foreign debt, and made the United \n     States more dependent on international financial \n     considerations.\n       (6) The United States merchandise trade deficit is \n     characterized by large bilateral trade imbalances with a \n     handful of countries. Six countries (Japan, China, Canada, \n     Mexico, Germany, and Taiwan) accounted for 92 percent of the \n     United States trade deficit in goods in 1996. Japan and China \n     accounted for one-half of the trade deficit.\n       (7) Today the United States trade deficit primarily \n     consists of high-value manufactured items. Automobiles, \n     office machines, electronic goods, and telecommunications \n     equipment now comprise nearly three-fourths of the trade \n     deficit. The United States imports more cars from Mexico than \n     it exports to the rest of the world. Imports of manufactured \n     goods as a percentage of the United States manufacturing \n     gross domestic product have risen from 11 percent in 1970 to \n     more than 50 percent last year.\n       (8) While the United States has one of the most open \n     borders and economies in the world, the United States faces \n     significant tariff and nontariff trade barriers with its \n     trading partners. Current overall trade balances do not \n     reflect the actual competitiveness or productivity of the \n     United States economy. Instead, they demonstrate the \n     underlying structural nature of the trade deficits. Full \n     reciprocal market access remains an elusive goal as \n     documented in the annual reports of the United States Trade \n     Representative.\n       (9) Since the last comprehensive review of national trade \n     and investment policies was conducted by a Presidential \n     commission in 1970, there have been massive worldwide \n     economic and political changes which have profoundly affected \n     world trading relationships. The cold war has ended. It is no \n     longer necessary or prudent for United States trade policy to \n     be a residual of United States foreign policy. Globalization, \n     the increased mobility of capital and technology, the growth \n     of transnational corporations, and the outsourcing of \n     production across national boundaries, are reshaping both the \n     comparative and competitive trade advantages among nations.\n       (10) The United States is once again at a critical juncture \n     in trade policy development. The structural nature of the \n     United States trade deficit and its persistent growth must be \n     reversed. The causes and consequences of the trade deficit \n     must be documented and a plan must be developed to eliminate \n     the merchandise trade deficit within the next 10 years.\n\n     SEC. 203. ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--There is established a commission to be \n     known as the Emergency Commission To End the Trade Deficit \n     (hereafter in this title referred to as the ``Commission'').\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of the Commission is to develop a \n     trade policy plan to eliminate the United States merchandise \n     trade deficit by the year 2007 and to develop a competitive \n     trade policy for the 21st century.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Ozone and Particulate \n     Matter Research Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. __02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) implementation of the national ambient air quality \n     standards published in the Federal Register on July 18, 1997 \n     (62 Fed.

Reg. 38856), could nullify \n     many of the ozone provisions in Public Law 101-549 and lead \n     to disruptions and delays in the reduction of ozone and the \n     precursors to ozone;\n       (6) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency and the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee have \n     recommended that additional research be conducted to \n     determine any adverse health effects of fine particles \n     (including research on the biological mechanism for adverse \n     health effects, toxicity and dose response levels, and the \n     specification of the size and type of particle that might \n     have adverse health effects); and\n       (7) available atmospheric data regarding fine particle \n     levels in the United States are inadequate to provide an \n     understanding of any adverse health effects of fine particles \n     or a basis for designating areas under title I of the Clean \n     Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.).\n\n     SEC. __03.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nthe men and women who have served our Nation's Armed Forces and the \ntremendous sacrifices they have made for this country. It has always \nbeen my view that these citizens who are called upon to defend our \nNation, to risk and in many cases sacrifice their lives, deserve our \nupmost respect and gratitude, not only on Veterans Day, but for the \npeace and freedom we enjoy every day.\n  This day allows us all to contemplate the bravery and absolute \nimportance of the men and women who have served and are currently \nserving in our Armed Forces. It is in large part because of their \nefforts and sacrifices that we are ensured the domestic tranquility \nwith which to progress and become an even greater Nation. Moreover, \ntheir service has helped to ensure peace throughout the world and for \ngenerations of Americans to come. Whether directly involved in conflict \nor not, it is this mission the dedicated men and women in the Armed \nForces are sworn to uphold and we all value and recognize their hard \nwork and tremendous contributions.\n  The First World War ended on the 11th hour, of the 11th day, of the \n11th month, in 1918 on the day we now call Veterans Day. By the end of \nthe first world conflict there had been more than 37 million military \ncasualties, in addition to 10 million deaths among the civilian \npopulation. The effects of this war were felt around the world, but the \nsacrifice and tragedy associated with it were destined to be repeated \nwith more bloodshed and even deadlier consequences.\n  Mr. President, it is my view that the purpose of Veterans Day is not \nonly to understand and honor the depth of the sacrifice that has \nalready been made by our Nation's veterans, but to help strengthen our \nvows for peace in the future. It is the hope of many, indeed, all of us \nwho celebrate Veterans Day, that this day, through reflection, will \nstrengthen and foster peace worldwide. We should use this day as a link \nto our past in a way that helps us understand the depth of the tragedy \nand loss incurred in previous wars and thereby help us keep the peace \nand our democratic way of life. To ignore this link would deplete the \npurpose and meaning of this important day.\n  So, I rise today to pay the upmost tribute to our veterans, past and \npresent. As we celebrate Veterans Day, I want to extend my sincere \ngratitude to those who have sacrificed and died, those who have served, \nand those who are serving now. We will never forget your service and \nyour sacrifice.\n\n[[Page S11890]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/06/senate-section/article/S11889-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n       DEFENSE INDUSTRY INITIATIVE ON BUSINESS ETHICS AND CONDUCT\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. I rise today to congratulate the Defense \nIndustry Initiative on Business Ethics and Conduct for its 11 years of \nactive effort in creating high standards of business ethics, business \nconduct, and compliance in the defense industry. I know that many of my \ncolleagues in the Senate are not familiar with the unique DII effort.\n  In 1986, the DII was created as an outgrowth of the work of the \nPresident's Blue Ribbon Commission on Defense Management, known as the \nPackard Commission. At that time, a number of leading defense \ncontractors drafted a set of DII Principles. These Principles obligated \nsignatory companies to have written codes of conduct, to distribute the \ncodes to all of their employees, to have ethics training programs which \nmade certain that employees understood the codes, to have a hotline or \nombudsman system, to have systems to make voluntary disclosures of \nviolations of law or regulation to the Government, to attend annual \nbest practices forums, and to participate in a public accountability \nprocess.\n  The group of DII signatory companies has grown over these 11 years to \n48 companies, including virtually all of the largest defense \ncontractors. To be frank, I would think that at least all of our \nhundred largest defense contractors should be willing to sign up \npublicly to the Defense Industry Initiative Principles. Therefore, I \ncall upon those companies that are among this group which, for whatever \nreason, are not presently signatories to sign this statement in order \nto pledge themselves to the Defense Department and to the public as \nbeing committed to these ideals.\n  On June 5 and 6, 1997, in Washington, DC, the DII conducted its 12th \nBest Practices Forum. This session included some 160 representatives of \nthe signatory companies and 40 senior Government officials. The program \nwas a state-of-the-art exploration of best practices in corporate \nethics and compliance programs.\n  I understand that the Defense Industry Initiative is the only \nindustry ethics initiative of its type. There are any number of other \nindustries which have had sufficient ethical problems and should \nconsider something equivalent.\n  I will conclude by saying that all the evidence available to me \nsuggests that the participation of these 47 companies has had a very \npositive impact on their levels of compliance, as well as in the tone \nof the relationship with the Government. I am certain that we all \nrecall the events that gave rise to the creation of the Packard \nCommission--things such as high price spare parts or improper labor \ncharging. It is my understanding that the Government audits show that \nthe level of such problems has dropped dramatically among these DII \nsignatory companies. Furthermore, I believe that the DII effort has \nforged a true partnership in the best sense of the word between \nGovernment officials responsible for procurement and those in industry \nwho design, develop, and manufacture the items necessary for our \nnational defense.\n  So that the contribution that has been made and the excellent work \nthat has been done can be fully recognized, I would like to place into \nthe Congressional Record a list of those companies which are \nsignatories to the DII. All of these defense contractors are to be \ncongratulated for the leadership they have shown and their \naccomplishments to date. I am sure that we can count on them to \ncontinue this exemplary work in the future. And I hope other defense \ncontractors can be counted on to join this important effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/06/senate-section/article/S11890-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IN HONOR OF MSUSA'S 30TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, on November 7, 1997, the \nMinnesota State University Student Association [MSUSA] will celebrate \nits 30th Anniversary of representing Minnesota State University \nstudents.\n  MSUSA is an advocate organization which was formed in 1967 as an \ninformal coalition of student leaders. Today, it represents more than \n60,000 students at Minnesota's state universities in Bemidji, Mankato, \nMinneapolis/St. Paul, Moorhead, St. Cloud, Marshall, and Winona.\n  MSUSA is an independent, nonprofit corporation funded and operated by \nstudents. In order to fulfill its main objectives--affordable, quality \nand accessible State university education--students have taken an \nactivist approach to establish affordable tuition and child care \nfacilities, increase student work study wages, simplify transfer \nbetween institutions, improve cultural diversity, and advocate fair \nState and Federal financial aid programs including those in the Higher \nEducation Reauthorization Act.\n  In assisting State university students achieve their goals and voice \ntheir concerns, MSUSA provides liaisons to the Governor's office, the \nlegislature, the board of trustees of MnSCU, the Minnesota Higher \nEducation Services Council, the inter faculty organization, Congress, \nthe administration, and the U.S. Department of Education.\n  One of MSUSA's most outstanding activities is the Penny Fellowship \nProgram, which encourages students to take a leadership role in serving \ntheir communities by performing internships in public and community \nservice. Other noteworthy programs include the MSUSA newspaper, the \nMonitor, which has the largest circulation of any State system student \norganization, and the MSUSA Cultural Diversity Project, which fosters \nunderstanding and cooperation of students from all cultural \nbackgrounds.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to recognize and congratulate \nthe current officers of MSUSA, who are: Francis Klinkner, State chair \nfrom Mankato State University; Garret Melby Aanerud, vice chair from \nMoorhead State University; and Frank X. Viggiano, executive director. \nTheir hard work on behalf of Minnesota students has led them to many \nsuccesses, and I'm sure their continuing effort will mean a better-\neducated and a more productive Minnesota. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/06/senate-section/article/S11890-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11890-S11891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RETIREMENT OF DR. CHARLES TILL\n\n Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I take the floor today with \nsome sadness, but also with a great deal of gratitude. I rise today to \nmark the retirement and celebrate the career of one of our Nation's \ngreat leaders in science, my constituent and my friend, Dr. Charles \nTill.\n  At the end of this year, Dr. Till will conclude more than three \ndecades of outstanding accomplishment at Argonne National Laboratory. \nFor the past 13 years, Chuck has served as associate laboratory \ndirector over engineering research. Dr. Till's leadership, his vision, \nand his good humor will be sorely missed.\n  Chuck Till sprang from humble beginnings, with little early \nindication of the opportunities and demands that lie ahead. He grew up \non a farm in rural Saskatchewan, and by his own admission, and his \nfather's observation, showed no outstanding aptitude for technical and \nmechanical things. This would change.\n  Chuck entered the University of Saskatchewan, where he earned a \nbachelors degree in engineering physics and a masters degree in \nphysics. He then attended the University of London, where he earned his \ndoctorate in nuclear engineering. Apparently, somewhere along the way, \nthis small town farm boy developed an aptitude for technical matters.\n  Dr. Till's first job out of college found him in the unlikely, but \nnot surprising, position of being in charge. He was hired by the \nCanadian General Electric Co., as reactor physicist and given \nresponsibility for the start of the first prototype heavy water reactor \nin Canada--no small task for a first professional job. And of course, \nChuck excelled.\n  In 1963, Dr. Till joined Argonne National Laboratory as a reactor \nphysicist. His rise in this great organization is best traced by his \naccomplishments rather than the positions he has held.\n  Early on in his career, Chuck got the attention of scientists \nworldwide with a breakthrough advancement in fast reactor measurement \ntechniques. The Doppler Effect was known to be crucially important, but \nits measurement was uncertain. Dr. Till completely revamped the heated \nsample Doppler technique, and an order-of-magnitude improvement in the \nmeasurement resulted. The technique became the standard worldwide, and \nessentially has not changed to this day.\n\n[[Page S11891]]\n\n  Dr. Till soon became responsible for all fast reactor work at \nArgonne, and continued to emerge as a leader in his field. Chuck wrote \nseveral important works examining technical issues of nuclear physics \nand engineering. Dr. Till has also served on several advisory \ncommittees and evaluation boards, and testified numerous times before \ncongressional committees. Notably, Chuck served as technical director \nand a member of the U.S. delegation to the International Nuclear Fuel \nCycle Evaluation, and was largely responsible for the United States \nretaining its leadership role in fast-reactor technology.\n  But his greatest contribution, to both his discipline and to the \nworld, lies in the development of the Integral Fast Reactor, the IFR. \nThis inspired source of electrical power has the capability to achieve \nincredible efficiency in fuel use, while significantly lessening \nproblems associated with reactor safety and nuclear water. In 1986, the \nIFR showed that it can protect itself from overheating and meltdown. It \ndoes so through the natural physical properties of the materials used \nrather than by relying on operator intervention or an engineered safety \nsystem. The IFR was also designed to burn most of its own waste, as \nwell as that of other reactors and the material from dismantled \nweapons. Unfortunately, this program was canceled just 2 short years \nbefore the proof of concept. I assure my colleagues someday our Nation \nwill regret and reverse this shortsighted decision. But complete or \nnot, the concept and the work done to prove it remain genius and a \ngreat contribution to the world.\n  Through his work on the Integral Fast Reactor program, Dr. Till \ndemonstrated that his technical solutions out paced the ability of the \npolitical process to appreciate them. Dr. Till also demonstrated that \ntechnical leaders can take scientific material and present them in a \nmanner understandable by citizens and Members of Congress.

Mr. President, several months ago, during \nthe debate on the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, some of my colleagues \ncalled upon Congress to end its commitment to ethanol.\n  Ethanol, as my colleagues are aware, is an alcohol-based motor fuel \nmanufactured from corn.\n  These lawmakers, predominately from oil States, drew their daggers in \nprofessed horror, branding Federal support for ethanol as a ``deficit \nbuster,'' or a conspiracy of ``corporate welfare.''\n  While I know this mantra has become popular and convenient for many \nin Congress in recent years, the truth is that, in this instance, it is \nsimply false. I would like to urge my colleagues to examine an \nexcellent essay recently printed in the Wall Street Journal which \nillustrates the truth about ethanol, and which, I am hopeful, will \nconvince critics to reconsider their position.\n  The article, entitled ``Alcohol and Driving Can Mix,'' and authored \nby former Central Intelligence Agency Director James Woolsey, outlines \nthe environmental and energy benefits of replacing gasoline with \nalcohol fuels, like ethanol.\n  Mr. President, the concept of alcohol-based fuels is not new. Fifty \nyears ago, an Illinois lawmaker named Everett Dirksen encouraged \npolicymakers to consider ``processing our surplus farm crops into an \nalcohol of 10 percent.'' In doing so, Dirksen believed, we would \n``create a market in our own land for our own people.''\n  Half a century later, this idea has become reality. Today, demand for \nethanol is estimated at 1.5 billion gallons. There are approximately 50 \ncommercial facilities producing fuel ethanol in more than 20 different \nStates across the country. By 2005, 640 million bushels of corn will be \nused to produce 1.6 billion gallons of ethanol.\n  Ethanol has a wide range of benefits, such as its effects on the \nenvironment. Ethanol burns more cleanly than gasoline, and, according \nto the Environmental Protection Agency, diminishes dangerous fossil-\nbased fumes, like carbon monoxide and sulfur, that choke our congested \nurban areas.\n  Oil tankers will not spill ethanol into our oceans, killing wildlife. \nNational parks and refuges will not be targets for exploratory \ndrilling. When ethanol supplies run low, you simply grow more corn.\n  Ethanol also strengthens national security. Ethanol flows not from \noil wells in the Middle East, but from grain elevators in the Middle \nWest, using American farmers, and creating American jobs. With each \nacre of corn, 10 barrels of foreign oil are displaced--up to 70,000 \nbarrels each day.\n  And for farmers, ethanol creates value-added markets, creating new \njobs and boosting rural economic development. According to a recent \nstudy conducted by Northwestern University, the 1997 demand for ethanol \nis expected to create 195,000 new jobs nationwide.\n  The bottom line is that ethanol is the fuel of the future--and the \nfuture is here. Illinois drivers consume almost 5 billion gallons of \ngasoline, one-third of which is blended with ethanol. Chicago \nautomotive plants are assembling a new Ford Taurus that runs on 85 \npercent ethanol. More and more gas stations are offering ethanol as a \nchoice at the pump.\n  Isn't it worth cultivating an industry that improves the environment \nand promotes energy independence? Isn't it the responsibility of \nCongress to foster an economic climate that creates jobs and \nstrengthens domestic industry? Don't we have a commitment to rural \nAmerica, and a responsibility for its economic future?\n  Mr. President, I think the answer to these questions is a resounding \nyes, and that's why I will work to ensure that the Federal commitment \nto ethanol is kept.\n  I ask that the text of this article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                      Alcohol and Driving Can Mix\n\n                         (By R. James Woolsey)\n\n       President Clinton's global-warning proposal includes some \n     $5 billion in tax breaks to encourage the development of new \n     technologies to curb carbon dioxide emissions. But promising \n     technologies may already be in the offing. New microbes and \n     biocatalysts with names like zymomonas mobilis and KO-11 have \n     been genetically engineered to produce ethyl alcohol not just \n     from feed grains but also from other plants and common \n     organic wastes. The production of ethyl alcohol from biomass \n     may turn out to be as revolutionary as the production of \n     integrated circuits from silicon, vastly affecting the \n     world's distribution of wealth and the fundamentals of \n     international security.\n       Replacing gasoline with biomass-derived ethyl alcohol would \n     greatly reduce man-made greenhouse-gas emissions--estimates \n     put carbon dioxide emissions at 1/10th or less than those for \n     gasoline over the life cycle of fuel production and use. \n     Other changes in transportation would be far more costly: \n     Fuel-cell cars, for example, would require retooling \n     Detroit's factories; other efforts would need a vast new \n     infrastructure for fuel distribution; and a major shift \n     toward mass transit seems implausible in many of today's \n     fast-growing, sprawling cities.\n       In contrast, very little such new investment would be \n     necessary for ethyl alcohol to become a major share of \n     transportation fuel. Older cars' engines are able to burn \n     gasohol (10 percent ethyl alcohol); and a computer chip in \n     the fuel systems of this year's midsize Ford and Chrysler \n     minivans permits the use of up to 85 percent alcohol. Federal \n     fuel economy standards encourage these new ``flexible fuel \n     vehicles,'' and they have fortuitously arrived just as the \n     new technology is ready to reduce alcohol costs. Mixing these \n     fuels with gasoline is now done easily at filing stations \n     that sell gasohol. Environmental costs go down with alcohol: \n     its wide use would lead to a substantial improvement in air \n     quality. And an alcohol spill on an Alaskan shore would \n     produce nothing worse than dispersal, evaporation and \n     possibly some inebriated seals.\n\n\n                             volatile costs\n\n       The one real barrier to ethyl alcohol's replacing a large \n     share of gasoline is production cost, which today is \n     comparatively high and volatile. Alcohol's current feedstock, \n     corn, is subject to the caroming behavior of feed markets. In \n     1995 its price, normally\n\n[[Page S11892]]\n\n     around $100 a ton, nearly doubled, and the production of \n     alcohol for transportation consequently had to be cut by a \n     third. Ethyl alcohol feedstocks have been limited because the \n     yeast that has been used for millennia in fermentation can \n     only convert food crops. But advanced biocatalysts and \n     genetically engineered microbes now make possible the cost-\n     effective conversion of cellulosics: grass, trees and biomass \n     waste.\n       Even at today's fossil fuel prices, it is likely that as \n     ethyl alcohol's cost declines it will come to be used as the \n     emission-reducing oxygenate that is added to gasoline. But \n     the key issue is whether alcohol derived from biomass can \n     become cheap enough to begin to replace gasoline. Over the \n     past 15 years the cost of producing a gallon of alcohol \n     from corn has been cut in half, to about $1 a gallon. If \n     the new technology were to make it possible for costs to \n     fall another 30 to 40 cents, alcohol would become \n     competitive with gasoline when oil reaches around $25 a \n     barrel.\n       Is such a reduction in cost plausible? Consider switch \n     grass, common on the prairie. The U.S. Department of Energy \n     estimates twice as much alcohol could be produced per acre \n     from it than from corn. Since switch grass requires almost no \n     tilling, planting, fertilizing or other use of fuel or \n     chemicals, using it as a feedstock would yield several times \n     more energy than would be consumed during production--far \n     better than with either gasoline or corn-derived alcohol. \n     Switch grass and many biomass crops enrich the soil instead \n     of depleting it. Vastly more of the earth's surface is \n     available to grow such grasses, fast-growing trees and \n     aquatic vegetation than is available for feed grains. For \n     example, thinning forests by removing underbrush and small \n     trees reduces forest fires and preserves wildlife habitat--\n     and some cousin of zymomonas would doubtless love to dine on \n     such scrap brush.\n       Will oil prices hit $25 a barrel in a few years, making it \n     possible for even unsubsidized alcohol to replace a large \n     share of gasoline? The Energy Department forecasts a flat \n     market, but the oil bulls have a strong case because of \n     perennial instability in the Mideast and because demand will \n     burgeon as a growing share of the growing population in Asia \n     moves into cities. Fortune magazine noted two years ago that \n     once China's and India's energy consumption per capita reach \n     South Korea's current level, these two countries alone will \n     need almost 120 million barrels of oil a day--nearly double \n     what the world uses today. In spite of oil discoveries \n     elsewhere, it is likely that at least three-fourths of any \n     new demand will be filled from the huge reserves of the \n     Mideast, transferring more than $1 trillion over the next 15 \n     years to the autocratic (and worse) states of the unstable \n     Persian Gulf alone, in addition to the annual $90 billion \n     they receive today.\n       Thus, if genetically engineered microbes and advanced \n     biocatalysts can start a transition from fossil fuels to \n     biofuels, a major Middle East war involving the U.S. would \n     become less likely. We would become freer to support \n     democracies and our friends--Israel, Turkey, Jordan--without \n     weighing whether we might offend an oil state. At the same \n     time, subsistence farmers in Africa and Latin America, paid \n     to grow transportation fuel, would begin to climb out of \n     poverty; Ukraine, rich in fertile land, would become more \n     independent of oil-rich Russia; China would feel less \n     pressure to befriend Iran and to build a big navy to dominate \n     the oil-rich South China Sea.\n\n\n                            rural prosperity\n\n       What's more, new markets for biolfuel crops would help \n     rural America to prosper; substantial improvements in air \n     quality would let EPA Administrator Carol Browner stop \n     worrying about our power lawnmowers and let Detroit produce \n     four-wheel-drive sports vehicles to its heart's content; and \n     the U.S. trade deficit would shrink substantially, reducing \n     Wall Street's propensity to panic whenever the Japanese prime \n     minister gets grumpy about holding U.S. debt.\n       Who would lose? Chiefly oil-exporting states. But many \n     others would need an attitude check; oil companies, if they \n     resist diversifying; bureaucrats who don't like flexible-fuel \n     vehicles, because they aren't subsidized in their particular \n     fiefdom; environmentalists who don't like them either, \n     because they permit Detroit to build larger cars (the more \n     they burn alcohol, folks, the less you should care); Archer \n     Daniels Midland, which will have to get used to losing its \n     near-monopoly of the ethanol market; and of course Roger \n     Tamraz, because struggles over pipeline routes will become \n     boring.\n       What would we need to do before the December Kyoto summit? \n     Just announce that, in view of biofuels' advantages, we are \n     going to use government purchases and policies to help give \n     them a stable market until early in the next century while \n     production gears up, somewhat as we did with silicon chips. \n     We might even add that, except for continuing to do basic \n     research and development, we plan to phase out all energy \n     subsidies (including oil's remaining foreign tax credit) \n     toward the end of that period.\n       Then we could stand back, and let the new bugs and the \n     market do the rest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/06/senate-section/article/S11891-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CONGRATULATIONS TO THE CHRIST COMMUNITY CHURCH OF ALLEGAN, MI\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of the \nfirst Thanksgiving worship in Christ Community Church of Allegan, MI's \nnew meetinghouse. The Christ Community Church's congregation has \ntraveled a long way to get where they are today. Without a church home \nin December of 1993, a core group of Christian friends gathered to \ndiscuss the planting of a new church in the Allegan area. By December \nof 1996, this dedicated group grew nearly threefold, and was \nworshipping in a brand new facility built with their own hands and \nprayers. In just 3 years, a land contract had been drawn up and paid \nfor in full, and a church home was built that could serve up to 350 \nworshipers.\n  This faithful assembly of friends derives its members from over a 25-\nmile outlaying area encompassing much of southwestern Michigan. They \nare a contemporary group concentrating in non-traditional and \nculturally relevant Christian fellowship. The congregation focuses its \nenergy and resources on local and international missions and ministry. \nAlso, personal familiarity with the Bible and Christian ideals is \npromoted and nurtured.\n  Indeed, his Thanksgiving is a special one for the devoted men and \nwomen of Christ Community Church. The community is certainly well \nministered to by this congregation. As they look forward to building \nfurther services and facilities, Christ Community Church will continue \nto champion the needs of its members and community. Again, it is an \nhonor for me to recognize Christ Community Church and their first \nThanksgiving celebration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/06/senate-section/article/S11892-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11892-S11893]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ORDER OF AHEPA\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this past August, I was \nprivileged to address the Order of AHEPA during the celebration of its \n75th anniversary in Atlanta, GA, the city of its founding. AHEPA, \nAmerican Hellenic Educational Progressive Association, the largest \nGreek-American fraternal organization, has played a pivotal role in \nbringing Greek-Americans into the mainstream of American life, and \npromoting the ideals of Hellenic culture. It has also launched \nsignificant philanthropic and educational initiatives which have \nbenefited both the Greek-American community and American society at \nlarge.\n  As part of this 75th anniversary commemoration, James Scofield, a \npast supreme president of AHEPA, prepared for article on the early \norigins of AHEPA entitled, ``Forgotten History: The Klan vs. Americans \nof Hellenic Heritage in an Era of hate.'' This piece, written by Mr. \nScofield, recently retired after 30 years as a senior executive at the \nSt. Petersburg, FL, Times, has appeared in the AHEPA magazine and many \nGreek-American publications.\n  It records the struggle which Greek-Americans encountered in their \neffort to participate fully in American society. AHEPA's history, as \npresented by Mr. Scofield, also reminds us of the extraordinary \nprogress which our country has achieved in providing opportunity for \npeople of all races, religions, and backgrounds.\n  We are most appreciative to Mr. Scofield for his unique contribution \nand admonition to continue our efforts to ensure justice and respect \nfor all. I ask that his article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n Forgotten History: The Klan vs. Americans of Hellenic Heritage in an \n                              Era of Hate\n\n                         (By James S. Scofield)\n\n\n        ahepa emerges 75 years ago to win battle against bigotry\n\n       It was 1922, Americans of Hellenic heritage were suffering \n     personal and economic intimidation orchestrated by the \n     revived Ku Klux Klan. It was time for them to unify and \n     organize, to protect and defend life and livelihood.\n       The widespread and often violent discrimination against \n     immigrants from Greece is an almost forgotten page of \n     American history. This is probably because of their \n     subsequent success and the great accomplishments of their \n     descendants. Very few persons today, Hellenic or not, are \n     even vaguely aware of the massive continental strength of the \n     Klan of the 1920s and its intensive persecution of foreign-\n     born Greeks, including those who had chosen to become \n     American citizens.\n       They do not know how deeply the evil shadows of bigotry, \n     hatred and intolerance cast their malignant darkness over \n     North America. Perhaps it is time to remind them.\n\n[[Page S11893]]\n\n       The newly-reorganized KKK rampaged against frightened \n     immigrants and helpless minorities throughout the U.S. It \n     dominated politics in states in both the North and South. In \n     Canada, its dangerous wicked ways were transplanted and \n     flourished, especially in the western provinces.\n       An estimated three million militant hooded Klansmen stalked \n     across our continent, burning crosses and spawning terror.\n       During its reign of power, the Klan elected sixteen U.S. \n     Senators, eleven Governors and an undetermined large number \n     of Congressmen, both Republican and Democrat. It reportedly \n     exerted considerable influence in the White House.\n       Klan organizations ruled local politics in the major cities \n     of Dallas, Denver, Indianapolis and Portland, Oregon, as well \n     as in such smaller communities as Anaheim, California; El \n     Paso, Texas; Youngstown, Ohio and Portland, Maine.\n       In 1992, California and Oregon voters elected Klan-endorsed \n     gubernatorial candidates. Then in 1924, a Klan candidate won \n     the governorship in Kansas. The same year, the Klan endorsed \n     U.S. Senate winners in Alabama, Colorado, Georgia, Indiana, \n     Oklahoma and Texas. It also won the gubernatorial contests in \n     five of these six states, barely losing in Texas.\n       At U.S. election polls, Klansmen passed out cards which \n     crudely and defiantly declared:\n\n     When cotton grows on the fig tree\n     And alfalfa hangs on the rose\n     When the aliens run the United States\n     And the Jews grow a straight nose\n     When the Pope is praised by every one\n     In the land of Uncle Sam\n     And a Greek is elected President\n     THEN--the Ku Klux won't be worth a damn.\n\n       Meanshile, embattled but visionary Greek immigrant leaders \n     met on July 26, 1922, in Atlanta to form the American \n     Hellenic Educational Progressive Association, now better \n     known as the Order of Ahepa. Not by coincidence, Atlanta was \n     the home of the national Imperial Headquarters of the Klan.\n       The most important goal of the Ahepa founders was to \n     quickly and solidly establish better relations with non-\n     Greeks. They agreed to do this by taking the positive high \n     road of reason emphasizing assimilation, cooperation, \n     persuasion and unlike their marked foes, non-violence.\n       Their main discussion was how to best contain the wave of \n     hostility which had almost drowned them. The ominous specters \n     of twisted Americanism and KKK aggression spurred them to \n     create a patriotic fraternal order espousing undivided \n     loyalty to the United States. American citizenship, \n     proficiency in English, active participation in the civic \n     mainstream, economic stability, social unity and the pursuit \n     of education. The latter was considered vital for its obvious \n     gifts of knowledge and as the essential key to upward \n     mobility.\n       The Ahepa founders were profoundly disturbed and alarmed by \n     their bitter experiences with Klan prejudice and by reports \n     of worse bigotry elsewhere. Even before the Klan reappeared, \n     there had been senseless attacks on foreign-born Greeks, some \n     fatal. However, the new Klan expertly and abrasively honed \n     intolerance with brutal efficiency to silence and subdue all \n     of its alleged inferiors.\n       Many Greek-owned confectioneries and restaurants failed \n     financially or were sold at sacrificial prices to non-Greeks \n     because of boycotts instigated by the Klan. Greek \n     establishments doing as much as $500 to $1,000 a day \n     business, especially in the South and Midwest, dropped to as \n     little as $25 a day. The only recourse was to sell or close. \n     The Klan often bolstered its boycotts by openly threatening \n     or attacking customers entering and leaving.\n       A Klan Imperial Lecturer told Klansmen in Spokane that \n     Mexicans and Greeks should be sent back to where they came \n     from so that white supremacy and the purity of Americans be \n     preserved. Meanwhile, in Palatka, Florida, a Greek immigrant \n     was flogged for dating a ``white'' woman.\n       The Royal Riders of the Red Robe was a Klan affiliate \n     assembled ``as a real patriotic organization'' for approved \n     naturalized citizens unluckily born outside the United \n     States. However, in the ultimate snub of exclusion, \n     immigrants from Greece, Italy and the Balkans were not \n     eligible to join.\n       In Indiana, the state most politically controlled by the \n     1920s Klan, burning crosses were ignited in the yards of \n     outspoken Hellenes. Unprovoked beatings of Greeks were not \n     reported to police lest another beating soon follow. Others \n     were warned of dire consequences if they spoke Greek in \n     public, even in their own business establishments.\n       Hoosier Democrat and Republican leaders actively \n     discouraged naturalized Hellenes from filing for public \n     office, forcing them to run as Socialist Party candidates. \n     Fearful Greek Orthodox Christians indefinitely postponed \n     impending plans to organize parishes. To avoid constant \n     confrontation, long and difficult to pronounce first and last \n     names of Greek origin were shortened or changed to more \n     acceptable Americanized versions. False rumors spread by the \n     Klan about supposed unsolved murders of Greeks in other \n     states produced the desired dread.\n       The Klan Grand Dragon of Oregon said in a spirited speech \n     in Atlanta: ``The Klan in the western states has a great \n     mission to perform. The rapid growth of the Japanese \n     population and the great influx of foreign laborers, mostly \n     Greeks, is threatening our American institutions; and, Klans \n     in Washington, Oregon and Idaho are actively at work to \n     combat these foreign and un-American influences.''\n       Probably the most blatant hard-line bullying, almost \n     humorous, occurred in Pensacola, Florida. A Klansman handed a \n     note to a Greek restaurateur which read: ``You are an \n     undesirable citizen. You violate the Federal Prohibition Laws \n     and laws of decency and are a running sore on society. \n     Several trains are leaving Pensacola daily. Take your choice \n     but do not take too much time. Sincerely in earnest, KKK.''\n       Today, according to sociologist Charles C. Moskos, Jr., of \n     Northwestern University, American Hellenes proudly rank first \n     among all ethnic groups in individual educational attainment \n     and second in individual educational attainment and second in \n     individual wealth. They have succeeded in every facet of \n     American life. The Order of Ahepa has played the prime \n     historic role in this ascent.\n       True to its original mission, Ahepa financially supports \n     scholarships, educational chairs, housing for the elderly, \n     medical research, community programs, charitable projects and \n     other worthy endeavors through contributions of more than two \n     million dollars a year from its chapter, district and \n     national levels.\n       Ahepa validated its patriotic roots during World War II by \n     selling over five hundred million dollars of U.S. War Bonds, \n     more than any organization in America. Meanwhile, Ahepa \n     officials first visited the White House to meet with \n     President Calvin Coolidge in 1924 and have conferred with all \n     twelve Presidents since Presidents Franklin Roosevelt, Harry \n     Truman and Gerald Ford became Ahepa members.\n       More recently, Ahepa raised $400,000 for the restoration of \n     Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty and $775,000 for a \n     sculpture commemorating the Centennial Olympic Games in \n     Atlanta. Ahepa has received congressional and presidential \n     recognition for promoting friendship and goodwill among the \n     people of the United States, Canada, Greece and Cyprus. \n     President George Bush hailed Ahepa as one of ``the thousand \n     points of light.''\n       Ahepa moved its headquarters to Washington DC in 1924 and \n     later expanded its scope by adding three auxiliaries to \n     complete the Ahepa Family: the Daughters of Penelope for \n     women, the Sons of Pericles for young men and the Maids of \n     Athena for young women. Its combined eight hundred chapters, \n     consisting of about 35,000 members, cover the United States \n     and Canada and have planted successful units in Australia and \n     Greece. It held its 75th annual convention in Atlanta in \n     August.\n       In 1990, Ahepa filed an amicus curiae (friend of the court) \n     brief in the Georgia Supreme Court. It backed the legal \n     position of the National Association for the Advancement of \n     Colored People (NAACP) and the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) \n     of B'nai B'rith in support of a state law banning masks in \n     public which was challenged by the KKK. The court ruled 6 to \n     1 to uphold the constitutionality of the anti-mask statute.\n       The significance of the favorable decision to a jubilant \n     Ahepa was that it came in the city of its founding and helped \n     seal the doom of another failed Klan revival. Moreover, it \n     enabled Hellenes to join in victorious celebration with \n     fellow black and Jewish Americans whose forbearers also were \n     sadistically harmed physically, mentally and economically by \n     the KKK of yesteryear.\n       Along with Roman Catholics, Asians and other immigrants \n     considered unacceptable by the Klan, they were targeted \n     separately and together then because they did not fit the \n     rigidly narrow KKK concept of what constitutes a good and \n     loyal American.\n       For Hellenes, it is supremely ironic that the six \n     organizers of the original Klan in 1865 created the words Ku \n     Klux from kuklos, a variation of the Greek kyklos meaning \n     cycle or circle, and applied it to their own little circle.\n       Today the 1920s version of the KKK is long gone--and its \n     flickering reincarnations are virtual nonentities. The Klan \n     deserved to die--and died.\n       The Order of Ahepa thrives three quarters of a century \n     after its historic birth amid the fiery heat of hate--\n     generated by the toxic Klan cauldron of insane fanaticism. \n     Ahepa deserves to live--and lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/06/senate-section/article/S11892-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11893-S11894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              NORTHWEST UTILITIES' SUPPORT FOR WIND ENERGY\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as a supporter of the development of \nrenewable energy in this country, and in the Northwest in particular, I \nam pleased to see our region taking a leadership role in developing \nrenewable energy resources.\n  Several years ago, two forward thinking utilities in the Northwest, \nalong with the Bonneville Power Association, initiated an effort to \nsite and permit a new wind project in Carbon County, WY. The focus of \nthe project was to test a new generation of technology in Northwest \nclimates, and develop capability and experience with a resource which \nthe region has in abundance. Despite considerable changes in the \nelectricity market, and challenges presented by the project, these \nthree utilities persevered and made this\n\n[[Page S11894]]\n\nproject a reality. PacificCorp., the Eugene Water and Electric Board, \nand the Bonneville Power Administration demonstrated great leadership \nto create the first new commercial-scale wind project to serve the \nNorthwest. Their commitment marks the dawn of a new industry for the \nNorthwest, and a substantial contribution to a sustainable future for \nus and our children.\n  Three individuals deserve special recognition in this effort: Dennis \nSteinberg of PacifiCorp., Ken Beeson of the Eugene Water and Electric \nBoard, and George Darr of the Bonneville Power Administration. I thank \nthem for their dedication and hard work in bringing this project to \nfruition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/06/senate-section/article/S11893-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HISPANIC AWARDS CEREMONY\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nnomination of Bill Lann Lee to be Assistant Attorney General for Civil \nRights at the Department of Justice. I'm here today because I believe \nthat Bill Lann Lee should be favorably reported out of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. He should have his day. He should have a vote on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  I've heard of Bill Lann Lee for a number of years. I've heard about \nthis exceptional person, who brings a great deal of legal competency, \nenergy, and vitality to advocating for those who have been left out of \nthe mainstream. Contrary to what my Republican colleagues have \nasserted, Mr. Lee has used the law for the benefit of all Americans. It \nis so obvious from his record that he loves the law and uses it as a \ntool to help those in our society who need help.\n  I was troubled when I heard his nomination was being stalled in the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. Once again a capable person in the field of \ncivil rights law, a person of color, was being stalled in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee.\n  I feel so strongly about this nomination and about what Mr. Lee's \nadvocacy has meant for not only people of color but for women, for the \ndisabled, and those who are either overlooked or undermined by the law. \nI felt so strongly that I organized the Democratic women of the Senate \nto write a letter to Chairman Orrin Hatch asking to free Mr. Lee from \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  But because it is the Senate Judiciary Committee my letter used \nlanguage far more judicious than that which is being used against Mr. \nLee. My letter, which is signed by all the Democratic women Senators, \nurges favorable consideration of Mr. Lee's nomination. We bring to \nChairman Hatch's attention that Mr. Lee has dedicated his entire career \nto enforcing civil rights laws.\n  He has 23 years of professional experience ranging from cases dealing \nwith employment discrimination, providing access to health care, \nhelping children who have been victims of lead poisoning, to making \npublic transportation accessible for the disabled, and then guess what, \nfighting for something called equal access to education.\n  Isn't this exactly who we want to be heading up the Civil Rights \nDivision at the Department of Justice--someone who has practiced \nmainstream civil rights law, who believes in opportunity for everyone, \nand who has pursued this under the law?\n  We have sent this letter; I don't know what the response will be, but \nI will tell you once again it's the fall, so it must be the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. Once again, someone comes before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee with incredible legal competence, who is willing to \nserve the Nation and to come forth before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee only to once again face a humiliating experience.\n  We don't want Bill Lann Lee to be the Anita Hill of 1997. I think \nit's outrageous that once again we have someone with a great background \nwho is going to be stymied and humiliated. This is not what America is \nall about.\n  We've heard about Mr. Lee's exceptional background. The hard work of \nhis family, their willingness to fight for this country, and Mr. Lee's \nwork to fight in the courtrooms to make sure the law works for \neveryone.\n  It is not fair that after having an exemplary professional record, to \nbe a person of judicial temperament, to bring these great qualities to \nthis position, Mr. Lee has to face this. Now I don't think that the \nU.S. Senate should be a forum for attacking Chinese-Americans. I just \ndon't think that's right. We have seen them attacked in hearings on \ncampaign finance and now we hear them being attacked in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. I will tell you when talking to the Asian Pacific-\nAmerican constituents that I represent, they are concerned when their \nbest and brightest come forward for an appointment to the Justice \nDepartment, he's being brushed aside and all the Republicans want to \nfocus on is campaign finance.\n  I think it is outrageous. Now let me tell you Bill Lann Lee has \napplied for a job at the Justice Department. He is not applying to be a \nmember of a radical right wing foundation. He is applying for a job at \nthe Justice Department. And this is what his qualifications are all \nabout.\n  If Mr. Lee were applying for a radical right wing foundation maybe \nthe criteria the Senate Judiciary Committee is using would be \nappropriate, but it is not appropriate to use radical right wing \nfoundation criteria for a nomination to the Justice Department.\n  If the Republicans want to attack President Clinton, there's lots of \nways to attack President Clinton. If they want to attack civil rights \nlaw then do it through the legislative process but do not attack a \nnominee who comes forth, who is willing to put his life aside and the \npractice that he's developed working with the NAACP, to serve this \nNation.\n  I don't know how many additional nominations President Clinton can \nbring to the Senate. One, because they are either stalled out or people \nare humiliated when they come forth, or two, there is going to be an \nincreasing unwillingness to attract qualified nominees.\n  I want Bill Lann Lee to know that I'm on his side and so are the \nDemocratic women of the Senate. We would love to see him at the Civil \nRights Division in the Department of Justice. Not because he would \nfavor some but because he would fight for the women of this country, \nfor the people of color in this country, for the people that need civil \nrights advanced within the Justice Department.\n  And to the people of the Asian Pacific-American community I say not \nto lose heart. We're so proud of Bill Lann Lee. We're so proud of what \nyou do for America, but we're not proud at all of the Senate Republican \ncontrolled Judiciary Committee.\n  I ask to have printed in the Record a copy of the letter supporting \nMr. Lee's nomination from the Democratic women of the Senate. I urge my \ncolleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee to favorably report Mr. \nLee's nomination and let him have a vote in the full Senate.\n  The letter follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 4, 1997.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hatch: We are writing to urge you to \n     favorably report the nomination of Bill Lann Lee to be \n     Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights at the Department \n     of Justice. We understand that the markup\n\n[[Page S11895]]\n\n     on this nomination is scheduled for Thursday, November 6 in \n     the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n       Mr. Lee has dedicated his entire career to enforcing our \n     nation's civil rights laws. He has more than 20 years of \n     experience in a wide-range of areas in civil rights law, \n     including employment discrimination, access to health care, \n     prevention of lead poisoning, public transportation equity, \n     and equal access to education.\n       The Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights must \n     enforce our nation's civil rights laws for everyone. Mr. Lee \n     is a problem-solver and consensus builder. His work has \n     helped Americans regardless of age, race, and gender. He has \n     enabled thousands of Americans to shatter the glass ceiling.\n       Mr. Lee has practiced mainstream civil rights law. He does \n     not believe in quotas, which are illegal. He believes in \n     opportunity. To achieve this goal, he has pursued flexible \n     and reasonable remedies that in each instance were approved \n     by a court.\n       Numerous civil rights groups, women's groups, and elected \n     officials from both parties support Mr. Lee's nomination. The \n     next Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights will have to \n     address a number of potentially divisive issues. There is no \n     doubt that Mr. Lee has the integrity, competence, and \n     experience to lead this division.\n       In addition, Mr. Lee has agreed to recuse himself from \n     involvement with the California Proposition 209 case, if he \n     is confirmed. This action is entirely appropriate and should \n     help clear the way for his confirmation.\n       We urge you to support his nomination and report it \n     favorably.\n           Sincerely,\n         Barbara A. Mikulski, Barbara Boxer, Patty Murray, Mary L. \n           Landrieu, Carol Moseley-Braun, Dianne \n           Feinstein.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/06/senate-section/article/S11894-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n NOMINATION OF BILL LAN LEE TO BE ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR CIVIL \n                                 RIGHTS\n\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, earlier this year, I had the \npleasure of meeting Mr. Bill Lee, President Clinton's nominee for the \nAssistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. I was impressed with his \nintelligence, his strong sense of fairness, and his dedication to \nensuring that all Americans have the opportunity to enjoy the same \nbasic rights. Today I strongly urge my colleagues on the Senate \nJudiciary Committee to act favorably on the nomination of Bill Lan Lee.\n  Mr. Lee has an exceptional background. He is a graduate of Yale \nUniversity and Columbia University Law School, and has proven his \ndedication to the pubic sector by working for the Asian American Legal \nDefense Fund and the Los Angeles-based Center for Law in the Public \nInterest. Currently, he serves as western regional counsel for the \nNAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. During his 23-years as a civil \nrights litigator, Mr. Lee has earned a reputation for his legal \nexpertise and his integrity.\n  In July, the President nominated Mr. Lee to be the Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for Civil Rights at the Department of Justice. At the time of \nhis nomination, Mr. Lee was widely praised by both his allies and \nadversaries as a qualified and competent civil rights attorney, and was \nsupported by both Democrats and Republicans. No one questioned his \nintelligence nor his qualifications to competently serve this country \nas the Assistant Attorney General.\n  That is why it is so surprising, in the eleventh hour, to now hear so \nmuch opposition to this nomination. The vote on this nomination should \nbe based on Mr. Lee's competence, ability, and character. Instead, some \nSenators have decided that his nomination should be held hostage to \ntheir position on affirmative action. Rather that to fill this \nposition, which has gone vacant for over six months, my colleagues \ninstead have chosen to push their political agenda. I do not believe \nthat this is at all appropriate, nor do I believe that this action is \nin the best interests of the American people.\n  I must point out that this is not a lifetime position, nor is it a \nregulatory position that will out last the President's term. Rather, \nthis position carries a term that is served at the whim of the \nPresident. It seems to me that the President, who was elected by the \npeople, should have the right to choose those who will serve under him, \nthat he should have the option of choosing individuals whose personal \nviews reflect his own, so long as those individuals have the requisite \ncompetence, ability, and character. But the opposition to Mr. Lee is \nnot based on his abilities, rather, it is based on policy. I do not \nbelieve that this is a legitimate reasoning for opposing this \nparticular nomination.\n  I am especially troubled by this attack on Mr. Lee because I believe \nit does an injustice to the American dream. The American dream is a \nmajor part of what makes this country such a special place. It says \nthat everyone--whether rich or poor, male or female, gay or straight, \nblack or white--everyone should have the opportunity to go as far as \ntheir talent and hard work will take them. It's a dream that says that \nmerit, and nothing more, should determine your opportunities.\n  Mr. Lee is a shining example of this dream becoming reality. Out of \nadversity came this bright, enthusiastic gentleman who made a career of \nensuring that everyone has equal opportunities to share their talents \nand succeed. In fact, it was this belief in this idealistic view of \nAmerica that made Mr. Lee pursue this position. Lee insisted in his \nconfirmation hearing that as ``a son of immigrants, the opportunity to \nserve the nation by enforcing the Federal civil rights laws reaffirms \n[his] belief in the American dream.''\n  Despite this statement, and despite the fact that Mr. Lee has \nrepeatedly assured his critics that he is not in favor of quotas, that \nhe believes every talented and able individual should be given the full \nopportunity to compete and succeed, and that he would enforce the laws \nof our country, my colleagues continue to take issue with his \nnomination by attacking his personal beliefs and views on affirmative \naction. Unfortunately, these baseless allegations, unfounded attacks, \nand unwarranted comments about Mr. Lee have undermined the first real \nchance this Senate has had to fill this position with a qualified and \ncompetent individual. In short, they are refusing to give this \nqualified individual the opportunity to stand on his merit.\n  Mr. President, I thank the American people deserve better, and I \nbelieve we do an injustice to them by allowing this position to go \nempty for this long for no good reason. This is shameful, and I urge my \ncolleagues to reconsider their actions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/06/senate-section/article/S11895-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      INDEPENDENCE DAY OF LEBANON\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

MUSKIE DISTINGUISHED \n                          PUBLIC SERVICE AWARD\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, it was my singular honor this \npast September to attend the annual dinner of the Center for National \nPolicy where Representative Lee Hamilton of Indiana received the Edmund \nS. Muskie Distinguished Public Service Award. Representative Hamilton's \ndistinguished record of public service exemplifies, both in spirit and \ndeed, the principles which the late Senator Muskie brought to public \nservice.\n  The Congress and the American people will deeply miss Lee Hamilton's \nwisdom, sound judgment, and the 30 years of dedicated and independent \nrepresentation he gave to his fellow Hoosiers. These values were \ntangibly evidenced in Lee Hamilton's acceptance speech which \ndemonstrated why he is one of the most respected and listened to \nMembers of Congress. His plain Hoosier common sense and high standards \nof public service have well served the Nation.\n  It is most fitting that he should receive this award named for \nanother distinguished American legislator and that Congressman \nHamilton's remarks be recorded for posterity. Mr. President, I ask that \nthey be printed in the Record.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n   REP. LEE H. HAMILTON--REFLECTIONS ON THE CONGRESS AND THE COUNTRY\n\n\nremarks to center for national policy upon receipt of edmund s. muskie \n                   distinguished public service award\n\n       I really do not recall enjoying speeches any more than I \n     have tonight. Thank you one and all. Some I thought could \n     have been a little longer, others I found a bit restrained, \n     but overall it has been an immensely satisfying evening.\n       I shall think often of this evening and the high honor you \n     have paid to me. I've always wanted to walk off the stage \n     before I was shoved off, and your nice gesture makes me think \n     I have done that.\n       Politicians do a lot of things very well but I'm not sure \n     retiring is one of them. I've always felt that you should \n     leave when others think you should stay.\n       It has occurred to me in times past that the United States \n     government needed the equivalent of a House of Lords for \n     retired politicians. I'm beginning to think more favorably of \n     that idea. I'm not quite sure what its purpose would be and I \n     know that the taxpayers wouldn't tolerate it, but it would be \n     a nice gathering place for a bunch of has-been. It would keep \n     us out of mischief and perhaps more importantly keep us off \n     the television, and an occasional good thought or deed might \n     from time to time emerge.\n       No award comes to one person alone. All who receive an \n     honor stand on the shoulders of many others. I acknowledge no \n     all-inclusive list tonight of people who share this award \n     with me, but among them most importantly are: my wife, Nancy, \n     and our children, Tracy, Debbie, and Doug; I cannot begin to \n     tell you the contributions they have made--but for a sample \n     consider not having their husband and father around the house \n     for 30 weekends a year for 30 year; the man who got me \n     started in this political business, and he has remained a \n     trusted friend and advisor, Dick Stoner, and his wife, \n     Virginia; and, of course, a long list of outstanding staff \n     members, without whose help I would have accomplished very \n     little. The best advice for any Member remains--hire a staff \n     a lot smarter than you are; and I have done that.\n       The award is all the more meaningful because it is named \n     for Edmund Muskie. I still remember the clarity and \n     persuasiveness of his statements on the budget, the \n     environment, and foreign policy.\n       Mike Barnes and Mo Steinbruner have been doing an excellent \n     job of continuing his important work at the Center for \n     National Policy. As Madeleine Albright correctly noted last \n     year, CNP is more than a think tank, it's an action tank.\n       And a word of special appreciation to Hank Schacht, the \n     Chairman and CEO of Lucent Technologies. If you want a model \n     for an American business executive, look no further. He \n     combines all the skills of an outstandingly successful \n     business executive with a commitment to the public interest \n     that is simply extraordinary.\n       I've been asked to reminisce for a few minutes. Obviously \n     they didn't expect anything too heavy from me this evening, \n     and I'm pleased to comply.\n\n\n                        early years in congress\n\n       I've been fortunate to serve many years in Congress. I've \n     served with 8 Presidents; I've worked with 11 Secretaries of \n     State; and when I complete my 17th Congress, I'll be one of \n     only around 80 Member in the history of the House who have \n     served that long.\n       I remember, of course, my early years in Congress. I \n     remember that the Speaker of the House then, John McCormack, \n     could not remember my name. He called me John and Henry and \n     Carl on various days. Then one day before the Democratic \n     caucus to elect the Speaker he called me on the phone. I told \n     him I wouldn't vote for him, but would vote instead for Mo \n     Udall. That's probably not the smartest judgment I ever made. \n     From that day on, however, he knew my name, and the next time \n     he saw me in the hall he called me Lee. And to his eternal \n     credit he never held it against me.\n       I remember those early days when Members of Congress could \n     put a new post office in every village and hamlet, and I did. \n     I build 17 in my first year in Congress.\n       And I remember needing only one staffer to help me answer \n     constituent mail, and getting only an occasional visit from a \n     lobbyist. I also remember that I could accept any gift \n     offered, and make any amount of money of outside income, \n     unrestricted and unreported. I even remember--in those pre-\n     Vietnam and pre-Watergate days--people believing and trusting \n     what government officials and politicians said.\n       I remember that when I first ran for Congress in 1964, my \n     total campaign budget was $30,000, compared to $1 million \n     last election.\n       And I remember many close personal relationships across the \n     aisle. Early in my career, I made a parliamentary mistake on \n     the floor. A senior Republican (and good friend) came over, \n     put his arm around me, and gently pointed out my mistake and \n     how to correct it--and this was a bill he opposed. I can't \n     imagine that happening today.\n       I remember walking into the House Foreign Affairs Committee \n     room, which was then a small room now occupied by the House \n     TV-radio gallery. I was told by the staff director there were \n     no seats at the Committee table for me or the other two \n     freshmen Democratic Members. He told me that if I wanted a \n     seat I had to arrive before the lobbyists and the spectators \n     came in. But it really didn't matter whether I came or not; \n     as a freshman I was not going to be recognized to speak.\n\n\n                   unforgettable members of congress\n\n       I remember some unforgettable Members of Congress, \n     including the awesome--even fearsome--Chairman of the \n     Judiciary Committee, Emanuel Celler. I was the designated \n     spokesman when a group of us went to talk to him about the \n     President's proposal to extend the term of House Members from \n     two to four years. We favored the bill and had introduced it. \n     And I asked him how he stood on the bill. His response has \n     become a part of Washington lore. He said, ``I don't stand on \n     it, I'm sitting on it. It rests four-square under my fanny \n     and will never see the light of day.'' And of course it \n     didn't, and we learned something about congressional power.\n       I remember Chairman Jamie Whitten, who would bring the most \n     complicated appropriations bill, thousands of pages in \n     length, to the floor of the House and spend his entire \n     allotted debate time on a conference report thanking everyone \n     under the sun, and saying nothing about the bill. The first \n     few times he did it I thought he might not be smart enough to \n     explain the bill. I finally figured out that he was too smart \n     to explain it, and he never did, and he always got it passed.\n       I remember how deeply disappointed President Johnson was \n     when I offered the first amendment to reduce U.S. involvement \n     in Vietnam, It was a switch of position for me, although \n     others had preceded me. I was one of his favorites from the \n     class of '64, and he had come to campaign for me in '66. He \n     had taken a special interest in my career. I will never \n     forget his eyes when he asked me, ``How could you do that to \n     me, Lee?\n       I remember Hale Boggs addressing President Nixon and \n     members of his entire Cabinet in the Cabinet Room. He made an \n     impassioned plea as only he could do on a subject\n\n[[Page S11897]]\n\n     I've long since forgotten, and as he left the room he did so \n     with the observation, ``Now Mr. President, if you'll excuse \n     me, I have some important people waiting to see me in my \n     office.''\n       The memories go on and on in an endless line of splendor. \n     With each on of them it reminds me that serving in the House \n     of Representatives has been a high privilege, but a good bit \n     of fun too.\n\n\n                              good advice\n\n       And I remember the good advice I got. I got good \n     financial advice from President Johnson. He had the \n     freshmen gather in the Cabinet Room. I don't remember much \n     of what he said except one thing; he told us ``Buy your \n     home.'' He said, ``If you're like most politicians it'll \n     be the only decent investment you'll ever make.'' I did \n     and it was.\n       I remember Tip O'Neill putting his arm around me as we \n     walked down the hall and giving me some advice. He called me \n     Neal for my first decade here because I reminded him of a \n     Boston baseball player by the name of Neal Hamilton. He said, \n     ``Neal, you can accomplish anything in this town if you're \n     willing to let someone else take the credit.''\n       I remember Wilbur Mills, a marvelous man, a superb \n     legislator, who came, of course, to an unhappy ending. One \n     evening we walked out of the Capitol together. His picture \n     was on the cover of Time magazine; he was known all over the \n     country; he was the foremost legislator in Congress--people \n     sought his advice and clamored to speak with him even for a \n     few seconds. I asked him where he was going, he said ``I'm \n     going back to Arkansas. I'll have a public meeting.'' He \n     mentioned some small Arkansas town and said ``There'll be \n     about 15 or 20 people there.'' I never forgot it. As we \n     departed he said ``Lee, don't ever forget your constituents. \n     Nothing, nothing comes before them.''\n       And I remember Carl Albert who said always respect your \n     colleagues and never forget that each one of them serves in \n     this House because they were elected to do so by the American \n     people.\n\n\n                   public attitude toward government\n\n       But let me go beyond the specific remembrances and turn \n     more serious for a moment as we conclude.\n       There's been a massive change of attitude toward the role \n     of government since I first came here. In the early 1960s \n     many were brimming with optimism over the potential of \n     federal programs to solve all kinds of problems--alleviating \n     poverty, curbing racial discrimination, providing health \n     coverage, rebuilding American's cities.\n       Today the mood has shifted toward pessimism about what \n     government can achieve that is worthwhile. Many believe that \n     government creates more problems than it solves.\n       Over these past 30 years I've been struck by the decline in \n     public respect for government. In recent years it has \n     threatened the ability of government to make good policy. Of \n     course skepticism has always been a healthy strain in \n     American thinking. Our Constitution reflects that with all of \n     its checks and balances. And we all know that government can \n     be inefficient, inaccessible, and unaccountable. But when \n     healthy skepticism about government turns to cynicism, it \n     becomes the great enemy of democracy.\n       I think the operative question in American government today \n     is the same as it was at Gettysburg when Lincoln asked ``Can \n     this nation so dedicated and so conceived long endure?'' That \n     question may put it in rather apocalyptic terms, but it \n     nonetheless is on the mark.\n       A constituent put the right question to me the other day, \n     ``What's the most important thing you can do to restore \n     confidence in government?''\n\n\n                   restoring confidence in government\n\n       You'll be happy to know I'm not going to try to answer that \n     question in any length tonight.\n       But my basic response to my constituent was that to restore \n     confidence in government we have to make government \n     responsive, accessible, and workable.\n       I believe that representative democracy is our best hope \n     for dealing with our problems. We live in a complicated \n     country of vast size and remarkable diversity. When I was in \n     high school we had 130 million people. Today we have almost \n     270 million. So in my working lifetime the population of the \n     country has more than doubled. Our voters are many; they've \n     spread far and wide; and they represent a great variety of \n     races, religions, and national origins. It isn't easy to \n     develop a system that enables such a country to live together \n     peacefully and productively.\n       Representative democracy, for all of its faults, permits us \n     to do that. It works through a process of deliberation, \n     negotiation, and compromise--in a word, the process of \n     politics. Politics and politicians may be unpopular but \n     they're also indispensable. Politics is the way that we \n     express the popular will of the people in this country. At \n     its best, representative democracy gives us a system whereby \n     all of us have a voice in the process and a stake in the \n     product.\n       In many ways, we have lost what the founding fathers \n     possessed--the belief that government can work. Government is \n     certainly still needed to provide for our national security \n     and help promote our general welfare. Sometimes government \n     gets in our way, but other times it can be helpful to \n     ordinary people in their effort to succeed, to have \n     opportunity, and to correct instances of oppression and \n     injustice.\n       Those of us who see important reasons for government to act \n     must be willing not just to criticize government and try to \n     improve its operations, we must also work to improve public \n     understanding of what government can do, what it cannot do, \n     and what it has done. I simply do not see how it is possible \n     to deal with many of our problems without a minimal public \n     confidence in government.\n       I know that many people say the government and Congress \n     don't work very well. And it's certainly not difficult to \n     point out instances when they don't. But on the other hand, \n     given the size of the country and the number and complexity \n     of the challenges we confront, my view is that representative \n     democracy works reasonably well in this country. I do not for \n     a moment agree with those who think that the American system \n     has failed or that the future of the country is bleak.\n\n\n                    improving operations of congress\n\n       My main interest during my years in Congress has been to \n     make government responsive, accessible, and workable. Part of \n     that representative democracy system, of course, is the role \n     of Congress.\n       Congress is an enormously important and resilient \n     institution. I'm impressed almost daily with the way it \n     tackles difficult national problems, manages conflict in the \n     country, acts as a national forum, reflects diverse points of \n     view, and over time usually develops a consensus that \n     reflects the collective judgment of a diverse people. It has \n     helped create and maintain a nation more free than any other. \n     It is the most powerful and most respected legislative body \n     in the world.\n       It is not, of course, perfect. It has some major flaws. It \n     doesn't think enough about the long term, for example; it can \n     be much too partisan; and the system by which we finance our \n     elections is a mess. But I nonetheless believe that Congress \n     is--overall but not perfectly, often but not always--\n     responsive to the sustained and express will of the American \n     people. It's a much more responsive body than people think. \n     Congress does usually respond to public opinion if that \n     opinion is conveyed strongly by the American people, as we \n     have seen in the recent work to balance the budget.\n       I have seen many changes over the years, but I think \n     America is a better place today than it was when I came to \n     Congress in 1965: The Cold War is over, and we are at peace; \n     as the preeminent military power in the world, we do not \n     worry about an imminent threat to our national security; it \n     is hard to find a place on the map where the U.S. is not \n     engaged in some manner trying to make things better; we enjoy \n     the world's most competitive economy; the new global trading \n     system means new challenges and a host of new opportunities; \n     the Internet brings a world of knowledge to the most remote \n     classroom or the most remote home; we have greatly improved \n     the lot of older Americans with programs like Social Security \n     and Medicare; women and minorities have had new doors opened \n     to them like never before; and, by far the most important of \n     all, this still is the land of opportunity where everyone has \n     a chance, not an equal chance unfortunately, but still a \n     chance to become the best they can become.\n       Congress did not single-handedly bring about all of these \n     changes. But it played a major role in every one of them. \n     Congress is still the protector of our freedom and the \n     premier forum for addressing the key issues of the day.\n       As I receive this award from the Center for National Policy \n     and look back over my years in Congress, I'm not cynical, \n     pessimistic, or discouraged. I'm optimistic about Congress \n     and about the country. I am grateful for every day I've been \n     a part of this body and I do not know of any place in the \n     world that I would have preferred to be. I believe that inch \n     by inch, line by line, I've had a small--very small--part in \n     making this a more perfect union and making this country \n     stronger, safer, and freer.\n       What more could anyone want?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/06/senate-section/article/S11896-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11897-S11898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RONALD REAGAN WASHINGTON NATIONAL AIRPORT\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to \nthe chorus calling for the renaming of our national airport in honor of \none of our Nation's greatest Presidents, Ronald Reagan.\n  It is, of course, a long-standing tradition for us to name important \nbuildings and facilities after those who have rendered extraordinary \nservice to our country. Indeed, the monuments on the Mall outside this \nChamber were constructed to show our gratitude toward and honor the \nmemory of great men like Washington, Lincoln, and Jefferson, who helped \nbuild America, and save her in time of peril.\n  When Ronald Reagan became President, our Nation was in grave peril. \nCaught in the grip of economic stagnation and moral malaise at home, we \nremained locked in struggle with the most deadly and powerful of armed \nideologies, communism. Unlike his predecessors, President Reagan called \nthe home of that ideology, the Soviet Union, by its proper name: the \nevil empire. He called on us as a nation, not to\n\n[[Page S11898]]\n\nfoolishly court mutual annihilation, but to stand up for our principles \nand our way of life, confident that our cause was just, and would be \nlooked on with favor by God.\n  Ronald Reagan told us to have confidence in the American way, as he \nhad confidence in it himself. He cut taxes, fought to bring government \nunder control, and launched us on a peacetime recovery unprecedented \nfor its strength and longevity.\n  Mr. President, Ronald Reagan brought this Nation back. He brought it \nback to prosperity, he brought it back to self-confidence, he brought \nit back to an understanding of its fundamental principles, its \nattachment to well-ordered liberty and the freedom of the human spirit. \nThe results are all around us. A prosperous nation at peace, an evil \nempire that has become extinct, replaced by struggling democracies \nthroughout Europe, a new dawn of liberty around the globe.\n  Ronald Reagan wanted to lead his Nation into a brighter future. Like \nthe jet airplanes that carry us to our destinations, he carried the \nUnited States through turbulent times into a new and brighter era. I \ncan think of no more fitting tribute to his strength of character and \nhis monumental service to this country, than to name our national \nairport the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/06/senate-section/article/S11897-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to \nspeak in morning business about a bill that I believe we have an \nagreement to bring up at a later time, hopefully in the next few hours. \nIt is a bill that we worked on for quite a long time. We will be \ntalking about it again if we are able to bring it up tonight. But I \nwanted to get a head start, because I am such a believer in passenger \nrail transportation for our country. I think we are going to come to \nclosure on an Amtrak reform bill that will allow Amtrak at least to \nhave a chance to succeed.\n  It is not a slam dunk and there is no question that a lot of work is \nyet to be done, but I think passenger rail in America will add mobility \nfor people in this country who don't have other choices. We have a \nterrific aviation system and, in fact, there are Federal subsidies of \nour aviation system. There are Federal subsidies of our highway system. \nHighways, of course, provide the most flexible mobility for people. But \ntrains can also add something for people who don't live near airports.\n  I think we have a chance to do something that will allow for an \nintermodal system that will serve the best needs of our country, will \nbe the best for our economy and also will have, I hope, an impact on \ntourism and transportation in this country. I think it opens up a whole \nnew world if we can have a good, solid transportation system with \npassenger rail as part of it.\n  We have worked in this bill to try to bring the labor protections \ninto line so that, basically, we won't have protections that are above \nand beyond protections that most people have in this country. But we \nwould leave it to the collective bargaining system that exists between \nAmtrak and its unions. I hope, when we have the agreement, to announce \nthat the protections will be gone, and that collective bargaining will \nbe a viable way to determine exactly what the people who work for our \npassenger railroad will have in the way of protections and also allow \nthe railroad to be competitive, because, of course, if we are going to \nhave a system that will survive. I think Congress has sent the very \nclear signal that the subsidies are going to be phased out.\n  But in order for the subsidies to be phased out, we are going to try \nto give Amtrak a chance to succeed.\n  So I am hopeful that in the next few hours or perhaps tomorrow, we \nwill, in fact, have an agreement that we can announce and we will be \nable to pass this bill, send it to the House and send it to the \nPresident in very short order.\n  Of course, everyone knows that there is money from the budget \nreconciliation agreement that would help on the infrastructure costs \nthat we think will provide efficiencies for Amtrak and make it even \nmore profitable and make it more attractive for people to be able to \ntake high-speed trains, especially in the corridors where there is more \ndensity. But the $2.3 billion that has been set aside for the \ninfrastructure depends on the reform bill going through.\n  The reform bill includes taking away some of the protections that are \nrequired in law that should be instead agreed to at the bargaining \ntable, having some liability limits that will allow Amtrak and the \nrailroads to buy an insurance policy so that they will know what their \nliability potentials will be.\n  We also have some protections for lines that are going to go out of \nexistence. Right now there is a 90-day notice for a continuance of a \nline. I ran into a problem in my State of Texas in which they didn't \nhave the ability to make decisions quickly. Many State legislatures \nonly meet every other year. So if they have a notice of discontinuance \nof a line, they don't even have a chance to stand up and say, ``Look, \nwe will step in and try to help with some funding.''\n  We need to give the States more time. We give them, in fact, 180 days \nnotice, up from the 90 days notice, to give them a chance to address \nany kind of disruption in service that would affect their States.\n  Second, we allow States to create interstate rail compacts. I think \nthis is a very important possibility. It is not a mandate, of course, \nbut it allows the States to come together. States that have commuters \nthat go between two States can come together and form a compact and \nmake a high-speed rail line that both States can contribute to. I think \nthat should add to the ability to have more entrepreneurial spirit in \nour rail systems and perhaps allow States to work together for their \nmutual best interests.\n  Third, we provide for accountability. In fact, we want an independent \naudit of Amtrak. We are going to have, thanks to Senator John McCain, \nan Amtrak reform council that is going to look at everything Amtrak is \ndoing and determine if there are things they could do better, if there \nare ways they can give better and more efficient service. In fact, they \nwill report to Congress on their independent recommendations and if \nthey think Amtrak will be able to succeed if these recommendations, \nalong with the reforms in this bill, are put into place. If not, \nCongress will face that prospect with informed choices and must act on \nthem.\n  I think we have a good opportunity here. I believe very much that \nAmtrak can contribute to the mobility of our country.\n  It will give more citizens more access to be able to get on a train \nand, for example, go see a grandchild that they would not have an \nopportunity to do because they did not live in a city that has an \nairport. Or take Amtrak to connect to a city with a major airport, \nmaking Amtrak part of a connected intermodal system. These are just a \nfew examples of how important it is and can be to our transportation \nsystem.\n  So I am looking forward to discussing this bill further when the \nagreement is made and when we are able to actually act on the bill. But \nI wanted to give an outline of what we are looking at and what we are \ntrying to do. I am hopeful that we will be able to do it in the very \nnear future.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S11899]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we are in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to speak on a subject that I \nspeak on often on the floor of the Senate, the Department of Defense's \nillegal progress payment policy. Since early this year, I have spoken \non this subject many times. Most recently I spoke about the \nDepartment's commitment to bring the policy into compliance with law.\n  This commitment was made by the man who is now the Deputy Secretary \nof Defense, Mr. John Hamre. This commitment was made on July 22. I \nspoke about this 2 weeks ago, that he had a meeting with the leadership \nof the Armed Services Committee. At that meeting there was an agreement \namong all of us that certain accounting procedures would be brought \ninto accordance with the law. Mr. Hamre gave us his word. He promised \nto bring the policy into compliance with the law on October 1 of this \nyear. October 1 has come and gone and the illegal policy is still in \noperation. The Department of Defense is not complying with the law of \nthe land.\n  Recent news reports suggest that Mr. Hamre is a man of deep spiritual \nbeliefs. I know him to be that way. The roots of his faith go back to \nhis Lutheran upbringing in the small South Dakota town of Willow Lake. \nHis father was the town's church council president. His grandfather was \nthe pastor. John himself went to Harvard Divinity School to prepare for \nthe ministry.\n  So, Mr. President, it seems to me his faith runs deep, and I respect \nthat. I remind John about some Scripture. The Bible teaches us to: \nalways ``do as you promised.'' I will read a passage from Joshua 23:14: \n``You know with all your heart and soul that not one of all the good \npromises the Lord your God gave you has failed. Every promise has been \nfulfilled; not one has failed.''\n  The Bible teaches us that God kept His word, and He expects the same \nfrom each of us. I hope that Mr. Hamre will keep his word that was made \non July 22.\n  Now, I know it is not always possible to keep promises because \nsometimes things happen in the interim that bring about a change of \nevents that might cause some change of the original stance. Sometimes \nthere are unforeseen events that stand in the way. But there has to be \nan honest effort.\n  Mr. President, I'm trying hard to understand why the October 1 \ndeadline is being ignored. There are three letters that helped explain \nMr. Hamre's behavior.\n  First, there is a letter from the Armed Services Committee, signed by \nthe chairman, Senator Thurmond, and the ranking minority member, \nSenator Levin. It is addressed to Secretary Cohen, and dated September \n26, 1997.\n  Second, we have a letter from the inspector general, Ms. Eleanor \nHill, to Mr. Hamre, dated September 30, 1997.\n  Third, there is Mr. Hamre's letter back to the Armed Services \nCommittee, dated October 1, 1997.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have these letters printed in the Record \nso my colleagues have the benefit of the entire text.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 26, 1997.\n     Hon. William S. Cohen,\n     Secretary of Defense, The Pentagon, Washington, DC\n       Dear Secretary Cohen: Two months ago the Department \n     proposed a change to the Defense Federal Acquisition \n     Supplement (DFARS) to change its procedures for progress \n     payments under complex contracts using money from more than \n     one appropriation. Although there is no evidence that the \n     existing progress payment system has ever resulted in a \n     violation of the Antideficiency Act, we understand that the \n     Department does not believe that current procedures are \n     capable of meeting all applicable legal requirements.\n       The Council or Defense Industry Associations (CODSIA) has \n     indicated to us that the Department is considering the \n     possibility of implementing these new procedures effective \n     October 1, 1997--prior to final action on proposed DFARS \n     change. CODSIA estimates the changes to contractor accounting \n     and billing systems required by these new procedures could \n     cost the industry in excess of $1.3 billion a year. \n     Additional costs would be incurred by the taxpayers in \n     connection with the requirement for the Department to \n     manually process progress payment requests.\n       We ask that you review the proposed changes, consider all \n     public comments, and weigh the costs and benefits to the \n     taxpayers and the Department of Defense before these new \n     procedures are implemented by the Department. We would also \n     appreciate if you would let us know of any legislative \n     changes that may be needed to assist you in addressing this \n     issue in a rational and cost-effective manner.\n       Thank you for your attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Carl Levin,\n       Ranking Minority Member.\n     Strom Thurmond,\n       Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Department of Defense,\n\n\n                                            Inspector General,\n\n                                Arlington, VA, September 30, 1997.\n     Memorandum for Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)\n\n     Subject: Progress Payment Distribution\n\n       We do not concur with the recommendation that the Deputy \n     Secretary of Defense approve an open ended deferral in \n     implementing revised progress payment distribution practices.\n       Recently we were advised by the Office of the Director, \n     Defense Procurement, that an interim rule specifying the role \n     of contracting officers in the new procedures could not be \n     issued for at least 60 days. Likewise, we do not believe that \n     the Defense Finance and Accounting Service is ready to \n     proceed with the originally planned October 1, 1997 \n     implementation. A deferral of the implementation date is \n     therefore necessary, which is dismaying in light of the \n     several years that the Department has had to address this \n     problem.\n       At a minimum, we believe that the Deputy Secretary should \n     establish a revised implementation date no later than January \n     1, 1998. Any reviews of cost implications or other relevant \n     factors should be executable well before that date.\n                                                     Eleanor Hill,\n     Inspector General.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              The Deputy Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 1, 1997.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This letter is in response to your \n     September 26, 1997, letter to Secretary Cohen regarding \n     changes in the manner in which the Department distributes \n     progress payments. Consistent with your request, the \n     Department will review the proposed changes, consider all \n     public comments, and weigh the costs and benefits to the \n     taxpayers and the Department of Defense before these new \n     procedures are implemented. If the analysis indicates that \n     legislative changes are needed to address this issue in a \n     more rational and cost effective manner, such changes will be \n     proposed.\n       Additionally, the Department has initiated a change to the \n     Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) to \n     require that contractors provide the breakout of the progress \n     payment. The DFARS change cannot be effected until January \n     1998 because of the time required to complete statutory \n     administrative actions. Additional time is needed in order to \n     submit the proposed rule and its cost-benefit analysis to the \n     Congress, GAO, and OMB and for the required 60-day \n     congressional waiting period to elapse.\n       As a result of your request, and the need for additional \n     time to comply with statutory and administrative \n     requirements, I am delaying implementation of the planned \n     policy changes regarding the distribution of progress \n     payments. Those changes, which were scheduled to be \n     implemented on October 1, 1997, are being delayed until \n     January 1998, pending further review and evaluation of the \n     proposed changes.\n       A copy of this letter has been provided to Senator \n     Grassley.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    John J. Hamre.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Armed Services Committee's letter was obviously \nwritten in response to complaints from the defense industry. Industry \nclaims that the new policy would cost an extra $1.3 billion a year to \nimplement. The committee is concerned about that estimate. So the \ncommittee asked Mr. Hamre to weigh these factors: ``We ask that you \nreview the proposed changes, consider all public comments, and weigh \nthe costs and benefits to the taxpayers and the Department of Defense \nbefore these new procedures are implemented. * * *''\n  The committee is telling Deputy Secretary Hamre to do more homework \nbefore executing the new policy. This letter gave Mr. Hamre the \nauthority he needed to delay beyond the October 1 deadline that was \nagreed to after our July 22 meeting among Armed Services Committee \nmembers. Mr. Hamre parrots the committee's language in his\n\n[[Page S11900]]\n\nresponse: ``Consistent with your request, the Department will review \nthe proposed changes, consider all public comments, and weigh the costs \nand benefits to the taxpayers and the Department of Defense before \nthese new procedures are implemented.''\n  Mr. President, if I may paraphrase the letter, it says the committee \nrequests a delay, and Mr. Hamre is just complying. I am happy to report \nthat some of the delay may, in fact, be necessary.\n  Mr. Hamre provides an important piece of new information in the \nsecond paragraph of his letter. He says that the Defense Federal \nAcquisition Regulation Supplement--and we call that DFARS for short--\ncannot be issued until January 1998 due to ``statutory administrative \nactions.'' The DFARS is a key element in the new policy. But the DFARS \ncannot meet the timetable prescribed under the July 22 agreement that \nI've referred to.\n  There are some new procedures under current law. These are spelled \nout in Public Law 106-121, the Contract With America Advancement Act of \n1996.\n  Unfortunately, no one who put the July agreement together knew \nanything about the new rules. So if Mr. Hamre says that he needs more \ntime to get the DFARS ready, I can buy that and admit that extra time \nis needed.\n  But the final paragraph of his letter gives me heartburn. It makes me \nnervous. I quote from the final sentence: The new policy, ``which were \nscheduled to be implemented on October 1, 1997,'' is ``being delayed \nuntil January 1998, pending further review and evaluation of the \nproposed changes.''\n  Now, that wording bothers me for several reasons. It could be a big \nloophole to ask for more time so that effectively there is no \nimplementation of the agreement because January 1998 is not as specific \nas January 1, 1998, and January 1998 ``pending further review'' opens \nthe door for yet more delay. It suggests that January 1998 may not be, \nin fact, a deadline. It may be passed by, depending on the outcome of \nthe new review. The wording to me is very ambiguous.\n  The inspector general's letter--remember, the inspector general is to \nkeep all these people over at the Defense Department honest and keep \nthem abiding by the law--the IG's letter that I referred to and have \nprinted in the Record suggests that Mr. Hamre really wanted an open-\nended deferral. That is where the game playing may be going on. He may \nhave wanted an indefinite delay. Luckily, the IG put her foot down and \nsaid no, that was not possible, that would not be abiding by the \nagreement, that would not be abiding by the law.\n  This is what she said:\n\n       At a minimum, we believe that Mr. Hamre should establish a \n     revised implementation date no later than January 1, 1998.\n\n  The inspector general wants an unconditional deadline of January 1, \n1998--``with no pending further review'' language.\n  Mr. President, I can understand why the Department of Defense needs \nmore time to jump through new regulatory hoops. But why does the policy \nitself need further review? More study is the oldest bureaucratic trick \nin the book--always delay, delay, delay, never make a decision, never \nmake the changes that you don't want to make.\n  As far as this policy is concerned, this policy has been studied to \ndeath. The inspector general and the Pentagon bureaucrats have been \nwrestling with it since 1991. Isn't it about time to get to the bottom \nline? There have been countless papers, countless meetings, countless \nletters, and countless agreements, including the one of July 22. I was \na party to that, and I don't want to be hoodwinked by my colleagues. I \ndon't want to be hoodwinked by Mr. Hamre, who was there at that meeting \nand said he would get this job done.\n  Every possible issue has been addressed. Every point and counterpoint \nhas been weighed and reweighed. There is nothing else to weigh. It gets \ndown to the bottom line, Mr. President, that the law of the land is the \nlaw of the land and the law that the current policy violates. In other \nwords, what we are trying to get straightened around is section 1301 of \ntitle 31 of the U.S. Code, and this was enacted on March 3, 1809--this \nlaw that says that you can't spend money without the approval of the \nCongress of the United States, and it's a felony to do it. It has to be \nabided by or the power of the purse of the Congress means zilch.\n  So, Mr. President, that was in 1809, 200 years ago. It's a law that \nhas withstood the test of time, and it seems that DOD needs to get on \nthe stick and obey the law once and for all. But, most importantly, as \nfar as this Senator is personally concerned, at that July 22 meeting \nthere was an agreement, and I expect people who want you to believe \nthey are honest to keep their word.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/06/senate-section/article/S11899-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11900-S11901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MAIL ORDER HOUSES AND SALES TAX\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this morning, I was reading the New York \nTimes and came across an article truly exhilarating to me. It dealt \nwith a matter that the Presiding Officer is all too familiar with, too. \nA number of large States are in the process of negotiating an agreement \nwith some of the biggest mail order houses in the country, under which \nthose mail order houses will, in the future, pay sales tax on \nmerchandise they send into States that have either a use tax or a sales \ntax.\n  It was in the 1992 Quill decision the Supreme Court ruled that \nCongress could authorize the States to require collection of sales and \nuse taxes by mail order houses shipping goods across State lines. But \nCongress would have to make that decision formally by legislation.\n  So I sponsored such legislation because I was a former small town \nmerchant--I practiced law, I ran cattle, I had a small hardware retail \nand appliance store, and I even owned a cemetery one time, Mr. \nPresident. I did anything I could do to make money. Even back in those \ndays, a lot of people ordered things from catalogs. I resented it. I \nwas on Main Street collecting sales taxes, paying a corporate franchise \ntax to the city, paying all the taxes that make a decent place to live, \nand I was being competed against by people from other States who paid \nnothing.\n  In 1994, and again in 1995, I introduced legislation to authorize the \nmandated collection of interstate sales taxes. I got a vote on it and, \nof course, didn't get nearly enough to pass. Everybody got up and wept \nand wailed and said, ``This is another tax, all you tax and spenders.'' \nAs I say, I did it because I am a former retailer and I resented having \nto compete against people who did not have to collect a sales tax, \nwhich gave them a big competitive advantage on big-ticket items like \nrefrigerators, television sets, and so on. So I admit I came into the \ndebate because of my personal experience. But I also felt very strongly \nthat equity was on my side.\n\n  I never will forget the distinguished junior Senator from Utah, in a \nSmall Business Committee hearing one day, making a point, after having \nheard several mail order catalog executives talk about how this was \ngoing to be a terrible burden on them and some of them would go broke, \nand it was an impossible administrative nightmare to collect taxes for \n50 different States and a lot more jurisdictions than that because \ncities and counties also have sales taxes. I will never forget the \nlittle lecture that the Senator from Utah delivered, describing his own \npersonal experiences, and that it had not been a burden for his \ncompany. I will always be grateful to the Senator for having helped out \nso magnificently that morning.\n  Now, Mr. President, annual catalog sales are approximately $210 \nbillion. Now, there are a few good citizens like Home Shopping Network \nwho collect sales taxes on everything they sell. But most do not \ncollect the taxes except when their physical presence creates a nexus \nwith the State which requires that collection activity.\n  Let me explain that requirement. If a mail order firm has a physical \npresence in a State, the State may require that firm to collect sales \ntaxes on the goods it sells in the State. If a company has a presence, \nfor example, in the State of Arkansas and sells something through their \nmail order catalog to an Arkansan, the physical presence of that shop \nin Arkansas requires them to collect sales tax on any mail order sales \nto the\n\n[[Page S11901]]\n\nArkansas resident. But if they do not have a presence in Arkansas, they \ncan send all the merchandise they want to into the State and not \ncollect a dime in sales tax.\n  It is also unfair to the State and local governments which bear \nincreased burdens because of mail order activity. For example, every \nyear million of tons of catalogs go into the municipal landfills of \nthis country, and State and local governments must pay for that. I \nthink much of that comes to my house every year, frankly. Here it is, \ngetting close to Christmas, and every night when I go home, I can't \nopen my front door because there are so many catalogs behind it. But \nyet mail order companies pay virtually nothing to help States dispose \nof those millions of tons of waste.\n  So, Mr. President, I have always felt that this was terribly unfair \nto Main Street merchants in America. There is not a great incentive to \navoid taxes on small ticket items, but on big ticket items there is a \nhuge incentive. A few States, like Wisconsin and Maine, have put a \nprovision in their State income tax return for taxpayers to list the \nvalue of merchandise purchased through mail order. Last year, Wisconsin \ncollected $1.3 million from that provision. But there is no telling \nwhat the State should have collected had all mail order sales taxes \nbeen collected. The $1.3 million came from people who were honest and \nvoluntarily put on their State tax return what they purchased by mail \norder catalog and paid the sales tax on it. But there is no way the \nStates can enforce an effective sales tax collection system on mail \norder goods. Forty-five States impose sales taxes on mail order \npurchases, but they have no effective way to collect it.\n\n  Sometimes the States do collect the taxes on big-ticket items, \nhowever, and then the customer gets a rude awakening. I remember the \nstory of a family in Florida which went up to North Carolina and bought \nsome $25,000 worth of furniture because that company in North Carolina \nhad advertised no sales tax. The family furnished their entire house \nall with new furniture, loaded it onto a van, and took it back. And, lo \nand behold, they were stopped at the Florida border and had sales tax \nassessed against them. The tax came to several hundred dollars, and it \nwas a rude shock to that couple. There are a number of illustrations \nlike that.\n  But I do not want to take up too much of the Senate's time on this \nissue. All I want to say is that when mail order companies fail to \ncollect sales taxes on their sales, it is unfair for the Main Street \ncompanies who do collect such taxes. It is not right for some to do it \nand the rest to be exempt. Now this agreement, which will reportedly be \nannounced tomorrow between the largest States and the largest mail \norder houses, is a giant step in the right direction. I do not want to \nsay anything tonight that would in the least hinder those people \nnegotiating that agreement from finishing it. On the contrary, I \napplaud them, I thank them for doing what is right.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate \ncompletes its business today, it stand in adjournment until the hour of \n9:30 a.m. on Friday, November 7. I further ask unanimous consent that \non Friday, immediately following the prayer, the routine requests \nthrough the morning hour be granted and that the Senate proceed to \nmorning business for not to extend beyond the hour of 10:30 a.m., with \nSenators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each, with the \nfollowing exceptions: Senator Daschle, or his designee, for up to 30 \nminutes, from 9:30 a.m. to 10 a.m.; Senator Helms, or his designee, for \nup to 30 minutes, from 10 a.m. to 10:30 a.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I might say, Mr. President, since the Democratic leader is \nhere, we have a couple things we are trying to work out. I believe by \n10:30 a.m., we will have those problems resolved and that we can \ncontinue to consider the Inhofe amendment or the second-degree \namendment to it and get the Amtrak legislation also cleared and other \nissues we will still be working on.\n  Mr. President, tomorrow, the Senate will then be in a period for \nmorning business from 9:30 a.m. until 10:30 a.m. The Senate may also \nconsider and complete action on any of the following: Amtrak reform, \nthe D.C. appropriations bill--even though there may be some problems \nwith that now, we will continue to try to see if we can work through \nthat--and any other additional legislative or executive items that can \nbe cleared for action. Therefore, Members can anticipate rollcall votes \nthroughout Friday's session of the Senate.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will just ask for the information of \nour colleagues whether this might be an appropriate time to inform our \ncolleagues that we are not prepared at this point to talk about the \nweekend, but that they should be prepared to stay here this weekend, \ngiven the uncertainty of the schedule.\n  Would the majority leader care to comment on that?\n  Mr. LOTT. Well, I think that is a good notice. I think Members are \nalready thinking that may be the case. I have already canceled my own \nevents for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. And we will continue to work \nto see if we can find a way to complete action on the three \nappropriations conference reports. And, of course, we will be waiting \nto see what the House does on fast track. And depending on that, then, \nof course, we would proceed accordingly.\n  But if it is at all possible that we can finish our work on Saturday \nor Sunday, which I still think we can, I would think we should stay \nhere and get that work done. If we cannot, then we will have to \nconsider the alternatives, but Members should begin to be aware of it. \nAnd the odds are now that we will be in session Saturday and even \npossibly Sunday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/06/senate-section/article/S11902-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
