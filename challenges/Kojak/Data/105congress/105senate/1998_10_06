It happens, Mr. President, that is the \nchurch where my family and I often are seen--more over the few years \nprevious to the last 2 years, because of our recent change to our \nresidency here in Washington.\n  Father Kem's guidance, and what that has meant to us as he continues \nto give spiritual guidance to so many, has been unique. He is known far \noutside the boundaries of just the Midwest. I think that is quite \nevident by the elegance of his prayer and his eloquent statement, \nreflecting on who we are as a Nation: All creatures, children of God. \nFor Father Kem coming before this body today to offer guidance and \nprayer and hope, I am grateful. We are all better for Father Kem. To \nall the parishioners, those a part of the Saint Andrew's Episcopal \nfamily in Omaha, we know you are proud, as are we in the U.S. Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, in a 1985 speech attended by President \nRonald Reagan, the acclaimed writer and lecturer Elie Wiesel, a witness \nand survivor of the Holocaust, recounted the lessons he learned over \nthe years since this dark chapter in our history. He said:\n\n       I learned that in extreme situations when human lives and \n     dignity are at stake, neutrality is a sin. It helps the \n     killers, not the\n\n[[Page S11530]]\n\n     victims. I learned the meaning of solitude, Mr. President. We \n     were alone, desperately alone.\n\n  Mr. President, years from now, we may hear similar words from some of \nthe survivors of the recent atrocities committed in the former \nYugoslavia. This past week, Americans and people from all over the \nworld have been witness to some horrific images coming from the tiny \nprovince of Kosovo in the Republic of Serbia. These images, of murdered \nethnic Albanian civilians, from the very young to the very old, are the \nlatest in a series of systematic attacks over the last 7 months by \nSerbian military and security forces against Albanian Kosovars--both \nrebel insurgents and unarmed civilians.\n  The victims of this latest massacre included old men, women, and \nchildren. The death toll since last February is estimated to be as low \nas 500 and as many as 1,000 although, frankly, no one knows how many \nvictims there have been. Homes have been firebombed. Entire villages \nhave been bulldozed to the ground. Hundreds of thousands of Albanian \nKosovars literally have run for their lives and are seeking refuge in \nthe forests and mountains of Kosovo, or in the neighboring states of \nAlbania, Montenegro, Macedonia, and Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, what perhaps makes last weekend's attack more \ndifficult to bear is that it causes us to pause and wonder if these \nlives could have been saved if NATO had stepped in sooner. I think we \nall know the answer to that.\n  Congress has struggled with the issue of brutal violence in the \nBalkans for the better part of this decade. The images broadcast this \nweek are a somber reminder of very similar pictures that came from \nplaces not far from Kosovo--places like Mostar or Tuzla in Bosnia. I \ncan recall, as I am sure can many of my colleagues, during our many \ndiscussions on Bosnia in 1995, several of our colleagues, including our \nformer Majority Leader, Bob Dole, warning us that tensions in Kosovo \ncould lead to the level of outright violence and ethnic cruelty that \ncrippled Bosnia.\n  I am certain that this is one instance in which Senator Dole today \nwishes he had been wrong.\n  It has long been thought that Kosovo was an area where America's \nnational resolve was clear. In 1992, President George Bush warned \nPresident Milosevic that violent acts against Albanian Kosovars would \nlead to military intervention.\n  President Bush's warning was prompted by President Milosevic's \nsingle-handed efforts to strip Kosovo of its autonomy in 1989, and \nabolish Kosovo's parliament and government 1 year later.\n  At that time, the Albanian Kosovars, which represent 90 percent of \nthe total population of Kosovo, chose to exercise a form of nonviolent \nprotest against the Serbian government. A shadow government, \nparliament, and society emerged. Besides electing their own President \nand legislature, Kosovars established their own education and medical \nsystems.\n  Although there were scattered reports of human rights violations \nagainst Albanian Kosovars during this period, they were not connected \nwith the reports of an extensive ethnic cleansing campaign underway in \nBosnia. Many factors were involved, but perhaps most important was the \nthreat of a larger regional war that could be sparked if the carnage in \nBosnia spread to Kosovo. Besides the United States, the countries of \nAlbania, Macedonia, Turkey, and Greece at one time or another warned \nthat violence in Kosovo could force any one of these countries, if not \nall of them, to intervene. Certainly, with his resources engaged in the \nconflict in Bosnia, Serbian President Milosevic could not risk taking \naction in Kosovo.\n  Now, with instability in Albania and Macedonia, and the growth of the \npro-independence faction of Kosovars known as the Kosovo Liberation \nArmy, or KLA, President Milosevic has engaged his security and military \nforces in Kosova under the guise of putting down the KLA.\n\n  Mr. President, from the evidence that we have, Mr. Milosevic has gone \nbeyond a simple police action. This has been a seven month campaign of \nintimidation and conquest.\n  Our government, as well as European governments, vowed not to allow \nin Kosovo a repeat of the vicious war crimes we found in Bosnia. Yet, \nsome who have recently visited the region, believe these crimes have \nalready happened. The extent of these crimes cannot be confirmed. \nRelief workers and humanitarian organizations are being barred from \nreaching victims and refugees.\n  Should this be a surprise to any of us? Certainly not. Slobodan \nMilosevic is a cold, calculating tyrant. He is a war criminal. He was \nnot moved by diplomatic threats in Bosnia--what drove him to the Dayton \npeace talks was the military success of the Bosniak-Croat alliance in \nreclaiming land once held by the Serbs.\n  Kosovo is no different. Milosevic and his subordinates often have \npledged to end the carnage in Kosova. Yet, no pledge has been followed \nby a clear cessation of hostilities. Mr. Milosevic has demonstrated \nthat he will not withdraw his forces until he feels he has achieved the \nmost from the use of violence. And he will not engage in peace talks \nunless he believes that no other course of action will preserve his \nposition or advance his goals.\n  So it should not be a surprise to any of us that now, as NATO \nprepares for a military response, the Serbian government has declared \nvictory and now is making plans to reduce its military and police \npresence in the region.\n  We have been witness to a brutal military and police action against \nunarmed civilians that was done with the expectation, if not certainty, \nthat both Europe and the United States would not respond, or indeed \nwould not even know how to respond.\n  There is little to ponder about what must occur.\n  The threat or actual use of military action by NATO, such as air \nstrikes, is needed if some form of Serbian withdrawal or cease fire in \nthe Kosovo province is going to occur.\n  I believe we cannot escape the fact that, in the short term, some \nform of NATO or United Nations presence on the ground will be needed to \npolice any cease fire or withdrawal, or to ensure the transport of \nneeded food, medical and other supplies to the refugees. In addition, \nwar crime investigators will need to be able to determine the actual \natrocities committed and who is responsible.\n  It is uncertain if ground forces will be called for by NATO. In fact, \nwe know very little of what NATO plans to do beyond air strikes. That \nis of concern to me because a number of uncertainties remain--\nuncertainties that if left unresolved will not deal with the root cause \nof the conflict between the Serbs and Albanian Kosovars. The \nadministration needs to articulate a clear strategy or plan to address \nthe current humanitarian crisis, and the even larger questions about \nthe political future of the Kosovars over the long term.\n  For example, what fate lies ahead for the estimated 300,000 Kosovars \nwho were uprooted from their homes and villages and forced to seek \nrefuge as far away as Albania, Macedonia, or Bosnia? And of those \nrefugees, what lies ahead for the 50,000 or more who are in hiding in \nthe hills within the province--without shelter, food, or medicine--with \nwinter just around the corner?\n  Clearly, our first and foremost goal is to achieve a cease-fire. I am \nhopeful NATO air strikes can ensure a cease-fire. Second, we must \nensure humanitarian organizations can safely reach out to these refugee \npopulations without fear of obstruction or even destruction by hostile \nSerbian forces.\n  And once they get cared for, when can the displaced Kosovars return \nhome? And what kind of home do they expect to see when they return? It \nis estimated that approximately 200 villages in the province have been \ncompletely destroyed or heavily damaged. When can they expect to see \nsome restoration of the kind of livelihood that affords them the chance \nto live in peace?\n  These are the harder questions, but right now, it seems that NATO has \nyet to consider how they are to be answered. These issues must be \naddressed and answered if this conflict is going to be contained over \nthe long term.\n  I'm sure we all agree that these issues must be addressed and \nanswered not at either end of a rifle, but at a conference table. Yet, \nhow can NATO get both sides--the Kosovars and the Serbs--to the \nconference table? That remains unclear.\n\n[[Page S11531]]\n\n  And should some kind of long-term agreement be reached, how will that \nbe enforced? What role, if any, can we expect NATO to play to ensure \nlong-term peace in Kosovo? That too remains unclear.\n  What is clear is that the actions we take in the next few weeks have \nimplications for long-term peace not just in the province but \nthroughout the Balkans. That's why it's in NATO's interest to act, and \nact with resolve. Unfortunately, the only resolve we see is to strike \nat the Serbs by air, but nothing more beyond that.\n  NATO needs to begin to look at these larger questions and soon if our \nresolve for peace will achieve results and be real over the long-term. \nIt's in our interests to do so. We still risk the threat of a larger \nconflict in the region, involving Albania, Macedonia, Turkey, and \nGreece. We also put in jeopardy the progress we have made thus far to \nmaintain peace in Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, we cannot and should not dictate the terms of any \nagreement between the Serbs and Kosovars, but NATO can insist--through \nforce if necessary--that peace be achieved through cooperation, not \nconquest.\n  This, Mr. President, ought to be the U.S. policy. I thank the chair \nand yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized for \nup to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first of all let me commend our colleague \nfrom Ohio. At some point today or tomorrow I also want to address this \nissue of Kosovo.\n  I will tell you that the expressions given by our colleague from Ohio \nare certainly appreciated by all. I think for most of our colleagues it \nis our sincere hope that we will not once again play this game with Mr. \nMilosevic as he has played it so effectively over the last few years \nwith Bosnia, and now Kosovo, where the threat of retaliation causes \nsome warm statements to be made, and once again we back off, and once \nagain more people suffer terribly as a result of it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/06/senate-section/article/S11529-7", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         MEDICARE HMO BENEFICIARY EMERGENCY RELIEF ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, last week, close to 400,000 older Americans \nand individuals with disabilities, representing some 300 counties and \n18 States across this Nation, were notified by their Medicare health \nmaintenance organizations that as of January 1, 1999, their insurers \nwould be terminating their health coverage.\n  In my State of Connecticut, we were notified on Friday around 6 \no'clock that 6,000 seniors would see their HMO, Oxford Health Plan, \nleave their communities. When added to earlier withdrawals from the \nmarket by other HMOs in Connecticut, this announcement means that more \nthan 12,000 Connecticut Medicare beneficiaries will lose their present \nHMO providers.\n  One can only imagine the anxiety of seniors reading of the \nannouncement in their newspapers or hearing on television that their \nHMO would not be there for them on January 1 and having no one to turn \nto, no one to ask questions of, with offices closed for the weekend. \nEven the Health Care Financing Administration, which regulates these \nHMOs, had not yet received the news.\n  Only three weeks earlier, two other HMOs in Connecticut notified \ntheir customers that they would be backing out of New London, Windham, \nand Tolland Counties, jeopardizing affordable Medicare coverage for \nabout 6,000 seniors.\n  The precipitous withdrawal of managed care organizations from \nMedicare is a growing problem. Unless action is taken, on January 1, \n1999 thousands of seniors will find themselves at forced to leave \nestablished relationships with their doctors and without affordable \nhealth care coverage.\n  I am fearful that with Congress adjourning later this week or early \nnext week, and being out of session for the bulk of October, November, \nDecember, it may not be until January that we will again have the \nopportunity to do something about this.\n  I am going to be calling on the leadership today to enact an \nemergency piece of legislation, which I will be introducing today, to \nput a moratorium on HMOs leaving the Medicare market while we are not \nin session. This legislation will give us some time to see if we can't \nsort out this mess and prevent thousands more seniors from finding \nthemselves without HMO coverage on January 1, 1999, a matter of weeks.\n  My hope is that the leadership will find some time to consider this \nand adopt it before we leave, hopefully on a bipartisan basis, to stop \nthis serious problem we are seeing in my State and 17 other States \naround the country.\n  Mr. President, last Friday I also introduced legislation that deals \nwith the broader issues underlying the recent withdrawals of Medicare \nHMOs from certain communities. Because it takes a comprehensive \napproach, I do not expect that this bill would be adopted before we \nleave. However, I would hope that for now we can at least agree on a \nnarrowly defined moratorium which would at least give us time to find \nsolutions to the larger problem.\n  Mr. President, I would like to briefly outline for my colleagues the \nprovisions of the legislation I introduced last week. Specifically, the \nlegislation would not allow a flat termination of coverage if there are \nother less drastic options available. In the case of the withdrawals of \ntwo HMOs in eastern Connecticut, after causing considerable distress to \nseniors with an announcement that they were leaving, the companies re-\nevaluated their positions in the face of strong pressure from the \ncommunity, and said ``Well, maybe there are some other options we \nhadn't considered.'' This legislation will require they consider those \nother options first--before creating anxiety among our seniors.\n  Secondly, the legislation will stipulate that if a company maintains \nthere are no other options but ending coverage, they must demonstrate \nthat. In addition, the HMO would then be responsible for notifying \nconsumers of what alternative coverage is available.\n  The legislation also requires that HMOs commit to serving seniors for \nmore than just a year. Right now, HMOs are only required to contract on \nan annual basis. We would require them to make a 3-year commitment. It \nis important to keep in mind that we are talking about companies that \nhave made the careful determination that it is in their financial \ninterest to enter the Medicare market. These are companies that have \nextensively recruited seniors and convinced them to leave long-standing \nrelationships with their health care providers to join their HMO and \nthen, with very precipitous announcements, as we have seen in the last \nseveral weeks, they have left those communities.\n  Mr. President, this is a serious, serious problem that is going to \nget worse, in my view, if we don't take some steps. We passed similar \nlegislation a number of years ago dealing with plant closings. We \nfinally decided that having a company announce precipitously it is \nleaving, disrupting communities, disrupting the lives of their \nemployees, is unwise and that we ought to adopt legislation that \nrequires at least some advance notice so that communities and people \ncan try to rearrange their lives.\n  I am suggesting parallel legislation to deal with Medicare HMOs. Here \nit is so important, particularly for our older Americans or disabled \nAmericans, many of them living alone, who don't have the financial \nresources to hire lawyers and read through all of the morass of \npaperwork when it comes to finding a new HMO, that they be given \nadequate notice and provided with clear information about their \noptions.\n  We are hopeful we can build some support for the idea of considering \nall options, having more advanced notice, and extending the contract \nterm. If you are going to go out and try to entice people to sign up, \nit seems to me you have an obligation to stick with them for a while. \nCertainly just to make a decision that you are going to pull out of the \narea, with minimal notice, I think is wrong.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/06/senate-section/article/S11531-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11531-S11533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO FRED KRAL\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to take a minute to talk about an \nindividual in my State whom I only met for about 10 minutes, but who \nhad a profound impact on my view of this situation. He is a man by the \nname of Fred Kral. He is a person who led, in many ways, I suppose, an \nordinary life, but I think became sort of an extraordinary\n\n[[Page S11532]]\n\nfigure. He recently died at the age of 72.\n  Mr. Kral lived in Niantic, CT, for the last 48 years. He served in \nWorld War II. After the war, he attended the Rhode Island School of \nDesign. He later went to the University of Connecticut. He earned a \ndegree in agricultural engineering.\n  He worked at Electric Boat Company, a builder of submarines, for 38 \nyears and retired in 1989 as manager of materials for the Kessel Ring \nsite in Ballston Spa, NY.\n  He was a member of the Masons. He was also a member of the East Lyme \nWater and Sewer Commission. An avid golfer and a track letterman back \nin college, he was a founding and life member of the Niantic \nSportsman's Club where he served in various offices.\n  Most important, Mr. Kral was a loving husband and parent, survived by \nhis wife, his son Frederick, his three daughters Joyce, Freda, and \nHeidi, his sister Betty Lavelle, and his 11 grandchildren.\n  Fred Kral was a fine man. A lot of people would say Fred Kral was an \naverage guy, an average American. In many respects he was, but this \naverage man also was a very passionate man, a man who always fought for \nwhat he believed.\n  Earlier this month, Fred Kral and an estimated 6,000 other seniors in \neastern Connecticut were notified through the mail that two Medicare \nHMOs were discontinuing service in their communities, effectively \ncanceling these seniors' health care plans as of January 1, 1999.\n  Three Saturdays ago, Mr. President, I organized a forum at the Rose \nCity Senior Center in Norwich where more than 400 people gathered to \ndiscussed these insurance companies' actions and what steps might be \ntaken to preserve their health care.\n  At that meeting, Fred Kral spoke eloquently--eloquently--not only on \nbehalf of himself and his wife who, 2 weeks earlier, had a stroke, but \non behalf of all the seniors in eastern Connecticut who were worried \nabout their health care and what was going to happen to them when these \nHMOs left.\n  Fred Kral expressed anger and disappointment with his HMO's decision. \nHe specifically voiced his concern for his wife, who recently suffered \na stroke, and his fears he might be rejected when he tried to join \nanother plan. He wondered how he could be dropped from the same health \ncare plan that he and his wife were enticed to join only 2 years ago.\n  He also said he would be willing to pay higher premiums to keep his \nhealth care if that was the only choice. But at the time he wasn't \ngiven that option. He and thousands of others were simply told they \nwere being dropped by the same plan that had actively recruited them \njust 2 years earlier. He summed up the debate best when he said, ``It's \na moral issue.''\n  As he returned to his seat from speaking, Fred Kral suffered cardiac \narrest. After efforts to revive him at the scene, he was rushed back to \nhis hospital in Norwich and died shortly before noon on that day.\n  This is a tragic incident and an unfortunate way for this honorable \nman to die. But it is no accident that Fred Kral was at that meeting \ndelivering his speech from the front row of that audience that day. As \nI said earlier, he was a passionate man about everything he did. He was \nparticularly passionate about this issue. His daughter told me that he \nwas up at 2:30 in the morning the day of the meeting preparing \nquestions.\n  Of the hundreds of people attending the forum, Fred Kral had \napproached me before the event and struck up a conversation. He told me \nhe came to that forum to have his opinions heard. I told him I would \nrecognize him when the forum began.\n  I want my colleagues to know about Fred Kral. I want them to know \nthat this debate is not about nameless, faceless beneficiaries. It is \nabout individuals like Fred Kral. He was not a member of some consumer \nadvocacy group, he was just a normal citizen who cared very deeply \nabout health care and HMOs because no other issue had a more direct \nimpact on his life and his family.\n  There are a lot of people out in this country who feel the same way \nabout this issue as Fred Kral did. Just look at my own State. In a \nsmall community in this small State, there were 400 people who cared \nenough about this issue to spend their Saturday morning at a health \ncare forum. I guarantee each and every one of my colleagues that there \nare persons in their home States who have similar worries about their \nhealth care, and they want Congress to do something about it.\n  Before any of my colleagues say that the health care system in this \ncountry doesn't need changing, I urge them, again, to think about Fred \nKral of Niantic, CT. Here is a man who lived nearly half a century in \nthe same small town. He served our Nation in World War II. He spent 38 \nyears working to strengthen our national infrastructure, our defense \ninfrastructure. He supported and raised a family, and in his retirement \nhe enjoyed a good round of golf every now and then--in many ways he was \nyour average, solid citizen that we so often talk about. But despite \nplaying by the rules his whole life, he got a letter in the mail from \nhis HMO telling him that they no longer wished to take care of him, \njust weeks after his wife had suffered a stroke.\n  I say to you, my colleagues here, any health care system that allows \nsomething like this to happen to someone such as Fred Kral, and 12,000 \nother Connecticut citizens, is in need of serious examination and \nreview. Therefore, Mr. President, in the small amount of time we have \nleft in this legislative session, I would hope that we in this Congress \nwould do what is right and have a full and open debate on the issues of \nMedicare HMOs. Four hundred thousand people in the last 2 or 3 weeks \nwho have been dumped by their HMOs deserve better than just silence on \nthis issue.\n  I know the hours are waning. I know there is other business to do. \nBut I cannot think of anything that could be more important than \nhelping thousands and thousands of older Americans who, while we are \nout of session, may find themselves losing affordable health care \ncoverage because their HMO has decided some communities aren t quite as \nprofitable as they thought they d be.\n  We must act in the next few days. To be out of session for October \nand November and December and January while we know there are thousands \nof people who are worried about whether or not they are going to have \nHMO coverage, I think is terribly, terribly wrong.\n  In closing, Mr. President, Fred Kral's death is certainly a tragedy. \nIt is a tragedy for his family and for the people who knew him and \nloved him, but it did not come in vain. In southeastern Connecticut, \nthe insurance companies are reconsidering their decision. They \nannounced the Monday following the forum that they will try to come up \nwith some solutions. I hope they do. I am not confident they are going \nto be terribly comprehensive, but obviously they were mortified, as \nthey should have been, about what occurred.\n  So my hope is, Mr. President, that we might be able to at least pass \nan emergency piece of legislation that would place for the next 6 \nmonths a moratorium on HMOs leaving these areas to give us time to work \nwith the Health Care Financing Administration to try and renegotiate \nsome of the contracts and prevent these companies from just packing up \nand leaving. So in the midst of dealing with all these other lofty \nbills we have before us, a simple moratorium. I wish that we would get \ninto a full-blown debate of HMOs, but I do fear it is not going to \nhappen. I hoped we would be able to adopt a Patient Protection Act this \nCongress to allow patients and doctors to decide what medical \nprocedures are necessary and to allow patients to choose their doctors. \nBut for now, I am asking that we consider a simple moratorium on \nMedicare HMOs leaving the market to give us all time to consider more \ncomprehensive solutions. This is the very least, I think, we can do.\n  So, Mr. President, later today I will introduce the moratorium bill \nand make it retroactive to protect the seniors who have been so \nadversely affected. I urge our colleagues and the leadership to \nconsider this bill and to adopt it before this 105th Congress adjourns \nsine die.\n  Mr. President, I see no other colleague here on the floor, so I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts).

Mr. President, as we move into the final week of the 105th \nCongress, I am reminded by everything that is going on around us of the \nimportance of our work here. Most Senators would agree that this will \nbe a closing unlike what the majority of Senators have ever seen. It \nwill test each and every one of us and will remind Members just why we \nare here.\n  It will test our patience and stamina regarding each and every piece \nof legislation that we have toiled on throughout the 105th Congress in \nthe last 2 years. We have worked on legislation that has been in the \npipeline, and now we are coming down to the small end of the funnel. \nJust as air, when compressed, picks up velocity, legislation picks up \nmovement in the last week of a session.\n  The agenda of this Congress has been and should be simple. I gather \nit has been a simple one. We responded to emergencies all across the \nland and, yes, beyond the shores of our great land. We responded to the \nneeds of people within our borders, attended to the needs that were a \npart of circumstances beyond anybody's choosing or control. Basically, \nthat is what we do best.\n  There is a quality of statesmanship that is a part of each and every \none of us who serve here. It will be tested as reality sets in. Some \nhighly important issues to us all will need to be laid aside for \nanother day. Believe me, there will be another day. There will be \nanother battleground.\n  The decisions that are now before the Senate, should government be \nplaced above all else in the average lives of all Americans? My answer \nis, hardly. I think it is during these times that we must reassess the \nrole of the Federal Government and the role each of us must fill. \nCompetition is keen among all who serve the American people at each \nlevel of government. Can we forget that we are not a true democracy and \nremember that we are a Republic? Each State of this great Union plays \ntheir important role in the day-to-day business of public service.\n  The agenda for this week is appropriations, funding the important \npart of our Government, which could include national security, our \nrelations with the world community, and the economic well-being of our \ncitizens. In other words, ensuring each and every American is not \ndenied the American dream.\n  As we close the Senate and the 105th Congress, it may be asking \nsomething out of the ordinary, but it is not impossible that we lay \naside the issues that cloud and delay and wait for another day. This \nNation has survived for the past 200 years and will survive another 200 \nyears. Yesterday, we heard announcements coming from both sides of the \naisle and many other sources that the other side would risk shutting \ndown the Government should we not fulfill the agenda of \nappropriations. If the Government is shut down because of a lack of \nfunding, it will be the fault of the other person or party. That was \nthe message this weekend and all day yesterday.\n\n  It is time that we reassess what has happened to get us where we are. \nWe have been using delaying tactics either to block or slow progress of \nthe appropriations process--nothing but delaying tactics, pure and \nsimple. Now that we are at this point, someone must be to blame. Do we \nblame somebody else, or do we blame ourselves? Is there a mindset that \nthe responsibility or the lack of responsibility does not fall on each \nand every one of us, whether we serve in the legislative arm of this \nGovernment or the administrative arm? Are we really saying we don't \nhave the courage to accept the responsibility and suffer the \nconsequences of our own actions? How can we ask our younger Americans \nto develop a sense of responsibility if we do not do it? Are we a \nnation of laws or a nation of self-satisfaction and the impulses or \nemotions of the day?\n  What we do here matters. It matters more than any one of us can \nimagine. Now is not the time for posturing. It is time to let the \nstatesmanship that lives in each and every one of us come out and \ncomplete the Nation's business. I think the folks who sent us here will \nappreciate that, the Nation would be better off for it, and so will you \nas an individual. Then you will have earned and deserve the title of \nU.S. Senator, serving the people of the greatest nation ever \nestablished on this planet.\n  Mr. President, that is just a reminder, as we move into the closing \ndays, of some problems that we have to deal with before we all go home.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/06/senate-section/article/S11533-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11533-S11539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         READING EXCELLENCE ACT\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3740.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this is an important bill. It is a bill \nthat is designed to address what is probably the most serious problem \nwe have in the United States in our educational system, and that is the \ninability of our school system to provide young people who graduate \nfrom high school with the skills necessary, in just the very basics of \nreading. To enable our nation to proceed into the next century as we \nshould and to maximize the potential of these young people, we must \nassure that our high school graduates have these essential skills.\n  Back in 1983, the Reagan administration, through Education Secretary \nTerrel Bell, delivered a report to the Nation called ``A Nation At \nRisk.'' That report outlined the serious problems we have in our \neducational system and observed that the output of our primary and \nsecondary educational schools was not anywhere near what it needed to \nbe in order to meet the challenges posed by our Asian and European \ncompetitors. Many problems were delineated in that report. One on which \nwe have focused a great deal of attention is performance in \nmathematics.\n  The United States, among all the industrialized nations, was at the \nbottom in tests given to our young people to determine their abilities \nin mathematics. We were dead last among our competitor nations. So, in \na number of ways, we have tried to improve the results of our \neducational system with respect to mathematics. The studies have also \nshown that our industries have found that problems are not limited just \nto mathematics. Rather, they found that the basic problem was that \ntheir workers could not read the problems in order to determine the \nmathematics necessary to solve them. Mastering the very basics of \nreading was essential before they could understand how to answer the \nproblems in mathematics.\n  We have been trying to make improvements since 1983. In 1988, the \nGovernors met with the President and established national goals--\nsometimes referred to as Goals 2000--to try to emphasize that changes \nmust be made in our educational system in order to make this Nation \nwhat it ought to be as we go into the next century.\n  As a result of that initiative, in 1994, we established a goals panel \nin order to determine whether or not we were making any improvement in \nthese essential areas. I sit on that goals panel. I have been a member \nnow for some 4 years, and I am sorry to report--and this has already \nbeen reported--that, in those 4 years, there has not been any \nindication that we have made any progress toward these goals, even in \nthe area of reading. And the same is true with respect to mathematics. \nIn fact, just recently, the last IMS study--International Mathematics \nStudy --showed that our students graduating from high school were again \nat the bottom of all industrialized nations, as far as their capacity \nto solve mathematical problems.\n  That same study indicated that our fourth graders were the best in \nthe world, and our eighth graders were average. But, by the time they \ngraduated from high school, they were well behind. Part of that problem \nstems from problems with reading and the ability to understand \nproblems.\n  I point out another situation with respect to reading that is very \ninstructive in this regard.\n  Motorola, back in the early 1980s, was in a real fight with Japan on \ncellular phones. The CEO of Motorola said\n\n[[Page S11537]]\n\nhe had to develop a new factory employing individuals with the skills \nnecessary to produce cellular phones that would be equal to or better \nthan those of the Japanese. So a study group was established. The study \ngroup indicated that they had a problem with respect to trying to get \nthe skilled workforce necessary in order to compete with the Japanese. \nThey also took a look at Malaysia and other areas. They reported back \nto the CEO that our workers were not capable of the productivity \nnecessary. So they opted to locate the plant in Malaysia. The CEO, \nbeing a strong American, said ``No. We are not going to locate a plant \nin Malaysia. I want to find out why we are unable to find and to train \nthe workers necessary to get the best productivity.''\n  A study was conducted, which found out that the reason for the \nproblem was the inability to answer math problems. That was one thing. \nBut, then, they found that the reason workers were not able to solve \nthe math problems was that they couldn't read the math problems. The \ncompany created the necessary remedial training first to train the \nworkers how to read and then to allow them to do the math problems. \nBelieve it or not, they were able to do that with the remedial \ntraining.\n  So the CEO said, ``We are going to locate that plant in the United \nStates.'' They did. It proved to be the most productive plant in all of \nthe Motorola operations, with higher productivity than the Japanese. It \nis a long story about Motorola. But, finally, they were able to outdo \nthe Japanese and to outsell them. In fact, they were even able to break \ninto the markets in Japan and to outsell the Japanese. It goes back to \nthe basics. The workers couldn't read.\n  Another study which is instructional was done in, I believe, 1993. It \nwas a national literacy study that showed that 51 percent of the high \nschool graduates who were examined were found to be functionally \nilliterate. That is incredible. You wonder why our business people say \nthey don't even bother to look at a diploma of a kid out of high school \nbecause it doesn't mean anything. That is another area that we are \ntrying to improve and, at a minimum, to make sure that everyone who \ngets a high school diploma knows how to read.\n  We looked into this and found what had happened. The reason this \ndismal result was appearing was that, back in the 1960s, studies were \ndone at Cornell University. At that time, we had this big awakening \nabout the problems of neurosis and young people and things that \nstimulated mental problems. Researchers concluded that the worst thing \none could do was to fail a kid in school because that would create a \nneurosis and the child would have problems the rest of his or her life.\n  That led to the development of so-called ``social promotion.'' In \nother words, the attitude was, ``Well, if they can't read, pack them \non.'' That might have been fine from the second to the third grade and \nmaybe even from the third or fourth grades if somebody would have \npicked them up and taught them how to read. But nobody ever picked them \nup. The teachers were busy teaching the ones who knew how to read. They \ndid not have time for those who didn't know how to read. Social \npromotion is a reality in probably all of our schools.\n  You wonder why our CEO's say, ``We don't even look at diplomas to \ndetermine whether the kids should come to us to work.''\n  Getting to today, this problem with reading was emphasized, and we \ndetermined that we had to do something. Working with the \nAdministration, we prepared the reading bill before us today. This \nlegislation provides for ample funding and lays out everything that we \nbelieve we need to do in order to take not only corrective action \nbefore students get out of the third and fourth grades to make sure \nthat they read, but also to make sure we have remedial training for all \nof those in the higher grades who didn t master reading in their early \nschool years.\n  In the budget account, we attached $250 million for this bill to \nassist in trying to find a remedial program which will be successful in \ngetting our young people to read.\n  A number of people have worked very hard on this bill. Senator \nKennedy, I expect, will be here before too long. Senator Coverdell and \nSenator Coats and Senators Gregg and Hutchinson all really worked hard \nto bring about this bill and to make sure that it received favorable \nconsideration.\n  On the House side Representatives Clay, Hilleary and Riggs, and \nespecially my good friend Bill Goodling. Chairman Goodling has \nchampioned literacy throughout his tenure, and he has done a wonderful \njob in making sure that the reading bill got to us. I am now working \nvery closely with him as we go towards the reauthorization of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  In my view, the bill provides the necessary remedial help to get our \nschools on a path where we can assist substantially in getting young \npeople to read and to graduate from high school in a manner which will \nbe productive for them and for our society.\n  I mentioned Senator Kennedy. He is here. The work that he has done in \nchampioning this cause is very notable.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend Chairman Jeffords for his \nleadership in making child literacy a priority and developing this \nstrong legislation. I also commend Senator Coverdell for helping to \nmake this bill a priority in the Senate, and Senator Murray and Senator \nDodd for their leadership in issues involving young children.\n  I also want to thank Congressman Goodling and Congressman Clay for \nworking effectively to ensure that the Senate and House could reach \nagreement on this important measure.\n  I commend and thank all the staff members of the working group for \ntheir skillful assistance in making this process successful: Sherry \nKaiman of Senator Jeffords' staff; Townsend Lange of Senator Coats \nstaff; Suzanne Day of Senator Dodd's staff; Elyse Wasch of Senator \nReed's staff; Greg Williamson of Senator Murray's staff; Bev Schroeder \nof Senator Harkin's staff; and Danica Petroshius of my own staff. I \nalso commend the hard work of the House staff on the working group, \nincluding Vic Klatt, Sally Lovejoy, D'Arcy Philps, Lynn Selmser, and \nBob Sweet of the House Committee majority staff; Alex Nock, Marci \nPhillips, Mark Zuckerman, and June Harris of the House Committee \nminority staff; and Charlie Barone of Represenative George Miller's \nstaff.\n  Learning to read well is the cornerstone of every child's education. \nWe know that reading skills are fundamental to effective learning in \nall subjects. The ability to read effectively is the gateway to \nopportunity and success throughout life.\n  Many successful programs are helping children learn to read well. But \ntoo often, the best programs are not available to all children. As a \nresult, large numbers of children are denied the opportunity to learn \nto read well. 40 percent of 4th grade students do not achieve the basic \nreading level, and 70 percent of 4th graders are not proficient in \nreading.\n  Children who fail to acquire basic reading skills early in life are \nat a disadvantage throughout their education and later careers. They \nare more likely to drop out of school, and to be unemployed. We need to \ndo more to ensure that all children learn to read well--and learn to \nread well early--so that they have a greater chance for successful \nlives and careers.\n  In October 1996, President Clinton and the First Lady initiated a new \neffort to call national attention to child literacy by proposing their \n``America Reads Challenge.'' Many of us in Congress strongly supported \ntheir call for increased aid for reading tutors and other steps to \nimprove child literacy. Today, over 1,000 colleges and universities are \ncommitted to the President's ``America Reads Work Study Program,'' and \n59 of these institutions are in Massachusetts.\n  Many of the reading difficulties experienced by teenagers and adults \ntoday could have been prevented by better attention during early \nchildhood. By working to ensure that all children learn to read well in \nthe early grades, we can reduce the need for costly special education \ninstruction in later grades. We must make every effort to give our \npublic schools the resources necessary to ensure that all children \nobtain the reading skills they need--at an early age.\n  This bill is a major step toward meeting that goal. It provides \nchildren, parents, schools, and communities with the resources and \nopportunities they need to improve child and family literacy--and the \nhelp can't come a minute too soon.\n\n[[Page S11538]]\n\n  This bill also recognizes that teachers must have adequate resources \nand proper training in order to be prepared to teach reading well. \nTeachers must often provide special assistance to children who are \nhaving difficulty learning to read. Too often, teachers lack the time, \nthe skills, and the resources to provide children with that assistance. \nBuilding on the successful Eisenhower Professional Development Program, \nwhich trains teachers in math and science, this bill creates new \nopportunities for teachers to obtain the training they need to teach \nreading effectively.\n  Communities across the country are initiating innovative projects on \nreading. At Boston College, a fundamental part of teacher education is \ntraining teachers in the best research and practice on ways to teach \nreading, including helping children develop skills in phonics, sound-\nand-symbol relationships, and reading comprehension.\n  This bill encourages local school districts to build partnerships and \nwork in cooperation with community organizations and state agencies. It \nensures that local, state, and national efforts to improve literacy are \ncoordinated, and that the most effective resources and practices are \nused to meet the needs of children. It also provides communities with \nsupport to provide children with trained tutors to give them the \nopportunity to practice reading with adults.\n  In Massachusetts, 59 colleges and universities are providing trained \ntutors to school children through the Federal Work Study Program. At \nBoston University, 150 reading tutors are helping 400 needy children \nlearn to read. Students at Worcester Polytechnic Institute serve as \nreading tutors at the Belmont Community School. The Reading Excellence \nAct builds upon these successful programs to help communities find and \ntrain tutors who can make a difference.\n  In addition, children need to have useful reading materials outside \nof school to help them develop a love of reading early in life. To meet \nthis goal, the bill encourages strong links to a variety of programs \nfor early childhood literacy, and encourages cooperation between \ncommunity, state, and national organizations to ensure that every child \nhas access to good reading materials.\n  Physicians are also part of the effort. Successful pediatric \nprograms, such as Reach Out and Read, can benefit even more children as \na result of this bill. This program was created by a team of \npediatricians and early childhood educators at Boston City Hospital in \n1989. Pediatricians are encouraged to prescribe reading activities as \npart of childhood medical check-ups, and to see that children leave the \ndoctor's office with a good book in hand. Now, 4,500 health care \nproviders in 46 states have been trained to help nearly one million \nchildren and their families. Parents who participate in Reach Out and \nRead are 8 times more likely to read to their children than parents who \ndo not participate in this pediatric program.\n  Children whose parents are involved in their education, who read to \nthem, and who work with them on language skills are more likely to \nbecome successful readers. They achieve higher test scores. They have \nbetter school attendance records. They graduate at higher rates. And \nthey are more likely to go to college. But children whose parents lack \na strong educational foundation are less likely to do so.\n  Many parents want to help, but too often they are unable to do so \nbecause the parents themselves lack basic reading skills. We can do \nmore to help parents acquire the skills and resources needed to help \ntheir children learn to read. This bill will expand local family \nliteracy initiatives, and help states to increase parent involvement.\n  Family literacy efforts, such as the Home Instruction Program for \nPreschool Youngsters in Worcester, Massachusetts, concentrate on \nproviding parents with the education and skills they need to be their \nchildren's first reading teachers. These programs teach parents how to \nread aloud and work with their children at home, and give parents the \nopportunity to attend literacy and other classes.\n  Funds will also be available to the National Institute for Literacy \nto gather and disseminate information about the best practices for \nimproving child literacy, so that every school and community can take \nadvantage of them.\n  This bill targets funds for literacy programs on schools where the \nneeds are greatest. Children in poor schools are more likely to live in \nhomes with parents who have not completed high school and are \nunemployed. Children from such homes are 5 to 6 times more likely to \ndrop out of school than other children. We should help ensure that they \nget the opportunities they need to learn to read well.\n  Recent successes in Boston prove that targeted efforts to improve \nschools and student performance can produce real results. After three \nyears of reforms in Boston emphasizing early literacy, high academic \nstandards, and the best teaching practices, students in almost every \ngrade showed significant improvements in math and reading scores on \ncity-wide achievement tests.\n  The Samuel W. Mason School in Boston, where 91 percent of the \nchildren come from poor families, has gone from one of the lowest-\nperforming schools in the city to scoring in the top quarter of all \npublic schools in the city in reading achievement. They have \nimplemented a school reform approach that focuses on literacy. Teachers \nwere trained in the best reading practices. In addition, they adapted \nteaching styles to fit children's learning styles, tested the children \nevery six weeks to measure improvement, and focused on improving family \nliteracy in the community.\n  The bill will help provide children with the readiness skills and \nsupport they need to learn to read once they enter school. It will help \nteach every child to read in these early years--from preschool though \nthe 3rd grade. And, it will improve the instructional practices of \nteachers and other staff in elementary schools with the greatest need \nfor extra help.\n  The bill provides competitive grants to states to improve child \nliteracy. Each state will create a plan to address the needs of its \nteachers and communities for improving student achievement in reading. \nEligible school districts will be able to apply to the state for funds \nto support teacher training in how to teach reading well in elementary \nschools with the greatest need for help, and to support partnerships \namong eligible school districts and community organizations that \nsupport early learning, tutoring, adult literacy, and that provide \nchildren and families with access to books.\n  The lowest-achieving and poorest schools will benefit. Local school \ndistricts that are eligible for subgrants fall into three categories: \n(1) districts that have at least one low-performing school in school \nimprovement under Title I; (2) districts that have schools with the \nhighest and second highest number of poor children in the state; and \n(3) districts that have schools with the highest and second highest \npoverty rates in the states.\n  The bill amends Title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct, and authorizes $260 million each year for fiscal years 1999 and \n2000.\n  By building on successful programs such as the Eisenhower \nProfessional Development Program, the College Work Study Program, and \nthe Even Start Program, this bill provides state and local education \nagencies with the support they need to bring successful programs to \ntheir teachers, students, and communities.\n  Children do not learn to read on their own. Children need well-\ntrained teachers who can give them the assistance they deserve. \nChildren need trained tutors who can work with them outside the \nclassroom. They need involved parents who know how to read and know how \nto work effectively with their children at home. Children need access \nto effective reading materials at home. And, children need the \nopportunity to acquire reading readiness skills early, so that they \ncome to school ready to learn to read.\n  The Reading Excellence Act ensures that the best methods and \nresources are more widely available to schools, families, and children \nacross the country. I urge the Senate to pass this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise in \nsupport of the Reading Excellence Act. I am very pleased that, working \nwith the House committee and Secretary Riley, we have been able to work \nout a final bill that will improve reading skills. This\n\n[[Page S11539]]\n\neffort once again demonstrates that when we focus on what really \nmatters to America's families and work together, we can accomplish a \ngreat deal of good. And today, we are taking a substantial step in \nimproving the teaching of reading in our schools.\n  There are few skills that are more important than literacy. It is \nwhat makes us good workers, good parents, and good citizens. Imagine \nnot being able to read. Bus schedules, children's homework assignments, \nand local newspapers--all beyond your grasp. From start to finish, each \nday would be nearly impossible.\n  Yet, too many of our children leave school lacking this basic skill \nwhich is essential to their livelihood and their quality of life. But, \nfor the child who cannot read, the problem begins much earlier than \ngraduation. Research has shown that children who fall behind as early \nas the second and third grade do not catch up or become fluent readers \nunless expensive, intensive help is available to them. If such help is \nnot available, these children become increasingly frustrated and are at \nsubstantial risk of dropping out of school altogether.\n  Our goal must be to help all children to read well, to read \nindependently, and, importantly, to enjoy reading. We have a tremendous \nadvantage today in reaching this goal in that we know so much more \nabout the physiological process of learning to read. We also know what \nworks and what does not. This bill makes sure that this new base of \nknowledge gets out beyond academia and its scholarly journals and into \nclassrooms across the country where it can make a real difference in \nthe lives of our children.\n  Beyond the classroom, this legislation will also help empower the \nfirst and most important teacher of all children--their parents. \nChildren's literacy levels are directly related to the literacy ability \nand interest of their parents, especially their mothers. The values, \nattitudes and expectations held by parents and other care givers with \nrespect to literacy will have a lasting effect on a child's attitude \nabout learning to read. This bill will encourage parents to read to \ntheir children at an early age and foster the budding literacy skills \nof their children.\n  I am particularly pleased the bill also reaches out to Head Start and \nother local pre-school programs to bring them into these efforts to \nensure that young children have the necessary foundation for literacy. \nIn addition, the bill does not overlook the important contribution \ntrained volunteers and mentors can have in improving a child's reading \nfluency and comprehension. This bill encourages local communities to \ntap into these efforts and coordinate volunteers to bring their talents \nand time into the schools to read with children one on one.\n  Finally, Mr. President, this bill does not overlook the most basic \ntool in any literacy effort--Books. Good, engaging, age-appropriate \nbooks are critical to any successful effort to improve literacy. In too \nmany homes, books are a rarity. And yet any parent will tell you how \nbooks capture the imagination and attention of toddlers and, even \nbabies, better than any television show.\n  I think we need to do much more when it comes to books. Our tax laws \nhave set up very perverse incentives that make it more profitable to \ndestroy unsold books rather than donate them to schools or literacy \norganizations. I am hopeful that, when the Senate next revisits tax \nlaw, we can take a look at this issue and reverse these incentives to \nget more books into the hands of children. In the meantime, this \nlegislation is a good first step in ensuring that children will have \nincreased exposure and involvement with high-quality books.\n  Mr. President, this is a good thoughtful bill and I am very pleased \nthat we will complete action on it this year and begin this important \neffort to improve our children's literacy skills.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nAmendment be agreed to, the committee amendment, as amended, be agreed \nto, the bill be considered as read the third time and passed, as \namended, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any \nstatements relating to the bill be placed in the appropriate place in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3740) was agreed to.\n  The committee amendment, as amended, was agreed to.\n  The bill (H.R. 2614), as amended, was considered read the third time, \nand passed.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, today the Senate passed H.R. 2614, the \nReading Excellence Act, and I rise in celebration for the many \nAmericans this important legislation will help. Reading is critical to \nevery aspect of life, especially as we move into the high-tech world of \nthe 21st century. With the passage of this bill, more Americans will \nsecure the basic reading skills necessary to enjoy the benefits of \ncitizenship. It will enable many to do some of the things we take for \ngranted--being able to read a phone book, a dinner menu, directions on \na medicine bottle, or a job application.\n  Right now, only 4 out of 10 of our Nation's third graders can read at \ngrade level or above. This clearly can not stand. Our goal is to ensure \nthat every child is able to read by the third grade. This bill is a \ndown payment toward that goal. The Reading Excellence Act focuses on \nscientifically based methods for teaching reading, it provides for \ntutorial assistance for at-risk children, and addresses adult \nilliteracy so that parents can be their children's first and most \nimportant teacher. This bill stresses the basics, a return to proven \nteaching methods, and most importantly a return to methods that work. \nIt is unacceptable that only 10 percent of our teachers have received \nformal instruction on how to teach reading. Reading Excellence will \ngive our educators the resources needed to prepare our children to read \nbefore they advance to the next grade.\n  With the leadership of Chairman William F. Goodling, H.R. 2614 passed \nthe House last year. Earlier this year Reading Excellence was included \nin our Senate Republican blueprint for education reform. I also offered \nReading Excellence, S. 1596, as a freestanding bill in the Senate on \nFebruary 2, 1998. Again, in an effort to pass this legislation, I \noffered it as an amendment to my education savings accounts bill and it \nwas agreed to unanimously. Unfortunately, the President killed that \ncomprehensive education reform bill, vetoing the literacy language \nalong with it. The administration has endorsed this language as a \nfreestanding bill.\n  Helping kids read should not be a partisan issue. Both Chambers have \nnow passed Reading Excellence unanimously, and I urge the President to \nsign H.R. 2614 into law. I praise Chairman Goodling for his \nperseverance and dedication to helping over 3 million children at risk \nof falling behind. Senator Coats has also been a leader in getting this \nlegislation to its final passage and we all thank him for his \ndedication to education. Today we take a first step, and as the poet \nRobert Frost says, ``we have miles to go before we sleep.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/06/senate-section/article/S11533-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, this year began in a way unprecedented \nduring my years as a U.S. Senator. Just months after passing the \nbalanced budget agreement of 1997, budget forecasters released \nprojections that included the possibility of a budget surplus as early \nas 1999. By March, the Congressional Budget Office estimated an $8 \nbillion surplus by the end of fiscal year 1998.\n  I'll skip ahead a few months, because we all know that the surplus \nprojections continued to grow. Last week, fiscal year 1998 came to an \nend with the President and Congress announcing a $70 billion budget \nsurplus.\n\n[[Page S11540]]\n\n  In less than a year, the deficit-busting efforts started early in the \n1980s and culminating in last year's balanced budget agreement reached \nthe climax we have been waiting for since 1969--the first budget \nsurplus in 30 years.\n  All of this is very good news, everyone on Capitol Hill wants to take \ncredit for it. Despite the euphoric attitude that has overcome the \ncongressional budgeteers and appropriators, however, I want to sound a \nnote of caution.\n  This weekend, the Seattle Times published an editorial that sums up \nmy hesitation to jump on the pig pile scrambling to spend the projected \nsurplus on tax cuts, as advocated by a number of my colleagues, or new \ngovernment programs, as suggested by the President and Democratic \nleadership.\n  The editorial, aptly titled ``Surplus? What Surplus?'', reminds us \nall of a reality few are willing to face.\n  In July, the Congressional Budget Office predicted the Federal \nGovernment will run a $63 billion surplus in 1998 if the Social \nSecurity trust fund is included in the budget calculations. We still \nare running a $41 billion deficit, however, if the surplus in the \nSocial Security trust fund is excluded.\n  The Federal Government will not run a surplus without the inclusion \nof the Social Security trust fund until 2002, when CBO expects a $1 \nbillion surplus. By 2008, the surplus will rise to $64 billion, without \nincluding the Social Security trust fund.\n  We are close, but we are not out of the woods yet.\n  I remain deeply concerned about the future viability of Social \nSecurity.\n  Social Security is a sacred contract between the Federal Government \nand seniors. We cannot and must not use the current surplus in the \nSocial Security trust fund to offset deficit spending in other \nGovernment programs. Unfortunately, the President, among others in \nGovernment, has proposed to do precisely that.\n  As Congress speeds toward the end of the 105th Congress, we must keep \nthe future of the Social Security trust fund paramount in our \ndeliberations. Some Members of Congress want to pass a tax cut package \nbefore the election, which will be funded by the projected surplus.\n  The President--who urged us to ``Save Social Security First'' during \nhis State of the Union Address in January--opposes tax cuts for the \nAmerican people but has been pushing for $20 billion in so called \nemergency spending since September. He does not propose to offset this \nspending with cuts in other Government programs. In fact, by \ncategorizing his spending requests as ``emergencies,'' he plans to \nspend a large part of the surplus he himself designated for saving \nSocial Security in January.\n  Frankly, I question the legitimacy of the ``emergencies'' identified \nby the President--the year 2000 computer problem, military \nresponsibilities in Bosnia, and the decennial census. These so-called \nemergencies have been on the radar screen for years. Unfortunately, the \nPresident failed to place a priority on these challenges when he gave \nCongress his budget in February.\n  Now we have several ``emergencies'' for which the President is \nwilling to dip into the surplus he deemed sacred in January--a surplus \nthat does not exist unless we tap into the Social Security trust fund.\n  Allow me to discuss the trust fund for just a moment. Today the \nSocial Security trust fund is running a surplus. But that is by design. \nWhen the baby boom generation begins retiring in just a few years, that \nsurplus will be needed to ensure that Social Security can meet its \nobligations.\n  I believe that all Government surpluses must be used to guarantee the \nstability of the Social Security system so that everyone relying on \nSocial Security today, and everyone working and paying into the system \ntoday, will be able to count on Social Security without any cuts or \nincreased taxes tomorrow.\n  The President has said that he wants to save Social Security, but in \nfact his budget proposed to spend billions of dollars over and above \nthe balanced budget agreement he signed a year ago. Now he wants more \nmoney for the so-called emergencies I described earlier. Every one of \nthose dollars will inevitably come out of the surplus I am convinced we \nneed to preserve for Social Security. That is wrong.\n  We must use all of the Social Security and other future budget \nsurpluses to make entirely certain that the current generation, and at \nleast the next generation, have Social Security in its present form.\n  I believe so strongly in this position, that in a July strategy \nmeeting to discuss tax and budget issues my advice to Senate Majority \nLeader Trent Lott was to ``save Social Security first.'' I believe now \nthat that is exactly what we will do.\n  We cannot play smoke and mirrors with the Social Security trust fund.\n  At the beginning of September, I sent this chart, which you can see, \nMr. President, to more than 300,000 seniors in Washington State. I have \nreceived thousands of responses over the last 3 weeks.\n  This is a difference between a true deficit in our normal accounts \nand a surplus that is created simply by counting the Social Security \nsurplus, with the 0 point, as I said earlier, not reached until in the \nyear 2002.\n  Margaret Collins of Kent wrote: ``Keep Social Security money for \nSocial Security only.''\n  Alice Crawley of Seattle wrote: ``I am 82 years old and I say they \nshould use any available surplus, Social Security and otherwise to \npreserve and protect Social Security.''\n  Mr. and Mrs. Bill Pennock of Redmond wrote: ``The American people pay \ninto Social Security believing the money will be there when they \nretire. Our generation depends on Social Security and we feel future \ngenerations will also need it. Please do not spend the fund on other \ngovernment programs.''\n  Wallace Wickland of Bothell wrote: ``You people in Washington have \ngot to keep your hands off Social Security. This is all some people \nhave. Voting for Social Security will save your jobs!''\n  Anna Green of Tacoma wrote: ``We always voted for you, and I hope you \nthink of our children and grandchildren to preserve and protect the \nSocial Security for them.''\n  Barbara Murphy of Tumwater wrote: ``I'm in favor of using all the \nsurplus to shore-up Social Security. I know House Republicans propose a \ntax refund for citizens, but let's wait on that.''\n  My constituents support using all of the Social Security surplus and \nfuture budget surpluses to make entirely certain that the current \ngeneration and future generations are protected. Once Congress and the \nPresident agree to a plan that shores up Social Security for our \nchildren and grandchildren who will retire during the next century, I \ngladly will join my colleagues in providing tax relief for hard-working \nAmericans.\n  I want to make that point crystal clear. I am not opposed to tax \nrelief. In fact, I'm all for across-the-board tax cuts that provide \nrelief for middle class taxpayers. In fact, I have cosponsored two \nbills that reduce or eliminate tax penalties on married couples--a \nmajor component of the House-passed tax relief package. The taxpayers \nhave contributed more than their fair share to the balanced budget for \nwhich we so desperately want to claim credit in Washington, D.C.\n  Unfortunately, we have to eat the spinach on our plate before we eat \ndessert. We have one more challenge to face--one more hurdle to jump--\nbefore we can claim victory on balancing the budget and start returning \ntheir hard-earned dollars to taxpayers. Let's secure and protect the \nSocial Security trust fund for current retirees and future generations \nfirst.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in morning \nbusiness for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/06/senate-section/article/S11539-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11540-S11543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PRIORITIES OF THE 105TH CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, one of the items up for consideration as \nwe\n\n[[Page S11541]]\n\nfinish this 105th Congress is H.R. 10, the so-called financial \nmodernization bill. In fact, we have gone through a cloture vote on the \nmotion to proceed to that bill. H.R. 10 is a piece of legislation that \napparently has fairly wide support, I am told, in this Congress. I do \nnot happen to support it, but I assume we will go through a period this \nweek of debating and voting on a series of procedural motions dealing \nwith H.R. 10.\n  It is a 600-page bill, and it will make the most sweeping changes to \nthe financial sector and particularly the banking and other financial \nindustries since the 1930s. This piece of legislation repeals the \nGlass-Steagall Act, which restricts the ability of banks and security \nunderwriters to affiliate with one another.\n  The bill creates a new category of financial holding companies. The \nstructure will allow for a broader range of financial services now to \nbe done in one affiliated area--commercial banking, insurance \nunderwriting, merchant banking.\n  I do not know whether most people have forgotten the lessons of the \n1930s, but in the 1930s it was thought that perhaps we ought not to \nmerge or marry in any way inherently speculative activities with \nbanking because banking requires the perception--even just the \nperception--of safety and soundness to survive and do well. Safety and \nsoundness is critical.\n  When you bring into the realm of banking activity that is inherently \nspeculative, such as underwriting securities, insurance underwriting, \nmerchant banking, and a whole range of other activities, it seems to me \nwe have just forgotten the lessons of the 1930s. And we are told that \nwe must do this is the name of financial modernization. In order to be \n``modern,'' we must decide to step forward and change the structure of \nthese financial institutions.\n  This country learned tough lessons the very hard way decades ago \nabout marrying banking activities with other activities that are \ninherently speculative. I know they say, gee, we have created these \naffiliates with firewalls, all that sort of thing. I have heard that \nall before. I heard that with the Saving and Loans. The taxpayer got \nstuck for $500 billion bailing out the S mess.\n  I think this bill represents a huge step backwards for this country. \nFor that reason, I do not support the legislation. I will speak more \nabout it at some point later.\n  But the thing I find interesting is this rush to complete H.R. 10 \nright now. The big shots want financial modernization and the halls are \nfilled with people who are working to get H.R. 10 done because the big \neconomic interests in this country want financial modernization.\n  But what about school modernization? I have been on the floor of this \nSenate talking about school construction, I guess maybe 10 times in \nthis Congress. I have told about a young second grader at the Cannon \nBall elementary school. Let me just talk about this issue again, \nbecause school modernization does not seem to be a priority. \nApparently, second graders are not big shots. They do not have the same \nclout with this Congress.\n  The school in Cannon Ball, just on the periphery of an Indian \nreservation, is a public school. It is open today. Those little kids, \nmostly Native Americans, are in their crowded classrooms. There are 160 \nstudents and staff in that school with only one water fountain and two \nbathrooms. Part of the school that is now being used had previously \nbeen condemned. It is an old, old, old building in desperate disrepair.\n  One of the rooms they use for music is in the downstairs area. They \nmore than occasionally cannot use it because the stench of sewer gas \ncomes up and fills that area, and they have to evacuate that area. And \na little second grader came up to me when I toured that school, and \nasked, ``Mr. Senator, will you build us a new school?'' Well, the \nanswer is, modernization of a school building does not apparently have \nthe same priority to this Congress as modernization of our financial \nsystem.\n  Instead of financial modernization, how about modernization of the \nCannon Ball school so that little girl, Rosie, age 7, can walk into a \nsecond grade classroom that we can be proud of, where you can hook a \ncomputer to the Internet, a classroom that is not going to have to be \nevacuated because of seeping sewer gas, a classroom that has a bathroom \noutside or a water fountain close by. What about her needs? What about \nthe needs of all those kids?\n  Or maybe we can talk about the Ojibwa school. The kids there go to \nschool in trailers that are overcrowded and unsafe and classrooms that \nhave been condemned--and this Congress knows it. There is going to be a \ndesperate accident there some day. There is going to be a fire spread \nacross those trailers with their wooden fire escapes. My deep concern \nthat somebody is going to die unless somebody takes action first.\n  Study after study after study shows that school to be unsafe, but \nthere is no money to modernize that school. Those little children on \nthe Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation go to the Ojibwa school in \nconditions that, in my judgment, should not give any of us pride that \nwe send our children through its doorway.\n  We can do something about it. We can modernize those schools. We have \nhad proposals on the floor of the Senate for school construction, but \nguess what? The funds to modernize those schools is not nearly as \nimportant as modernizing our financial system because H.R. 10, the \nfinancial modernization bill, has all kinds of folks in dark suits \nstanding out here lobbying for it.\n  They have a lot of clout, a lot of resources. When they say, \n``Jump,'' we have people saying, ``How high?'' But what about the \nsecond graders? What about the Cannon Ball school? What about the \nOjibwa school? I could go on talking about the school construction \nneeds in our country and in my State, and especially on Indian \nreservations, about which we ought to do something.\n  I know the Senator from Massachusetts wanted to make this point with \nrespect to the Patients' Bill of Rights. Talk about modernization, what \nabout modernization with respect to the delivery of health care? Is it \nmodern to have a health care system in which people do not get the \nmedical care they need?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts has been talking about the Patients' \nBill of Rights. We cannot even get a vote on it. It is very simple. It \nsays that, when you are sick, you ought to be able to have a doctor or \na health care plan that tells you all of your treatment options, not \njust the cheapest. And yet today all across this country people find \nHMOs saying, ``We will only tell you what the cheapest option is, not \nall of your options, as a patient.''\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have before me--and I will include in the Record--an \nexcellent letter written by representatives of 30 different \norganizations representing women. I would like to ask if the Senator \nwould agree with me that this issue involving the Patients' Bill of \nRights has special importance to women. It does--as I will mention in \njust a moment--to those who have been afflicted with breast cancer. \nAnd, of course, the nurses in this country are all in support.\n  But would the Senator agree with this letter, which is sponsored by \nthe 30 organizations? I will include it in its entirety.\n\n       Few issues resonate as profoundly and pervasively as the \n     need for quality health care, and women have a particular \n     stake in the changes in our health care delivery system. \n     Women are the primary consumers of health care services in \n     this country, and we have unique health care needs. Women \n     also take care of the health care needs of our families, from \n     children to elderly relatives. Because of the great impact \n     any patient protection bill will ultimately have on women, we \n     ask that you support real reform that will truly improve \n     women's health.\n       The Patients' Bill of Rights Act (S. 1890) takes the needs \n     of all consumers seriously, and it pays particular attention \n     to the needs of women. The genuine and often unique concerns \n     of women are woven into the fabric of this bill. S. 1890 \n     recognizes that women's health can only be improved by \n     comprehensive reform.\n\n  I am just wondering if the Senator would agree, first of all, as a \nstrong supporter of the legislation, that he believes that the \nRepublican leadership is derelict in its duty by failing to bring up \nlegislation that can have that kind of importance to the mothers and to \nthe wives, to the sisters, to the daughters, of families in this \ncountry?\n\n[[Page S11542]]\n\n  This is supported by 30 organizations that represent women, children, \nand families.\n  Does the Senator not agree with me that the Republican leadership has \nbeen derelict in failing to give us an opportunity to address these \nissues which are central to the concern of women in our society and \ntheir health care needs?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I agree that there has been a concerted attempt to \nprevent legislation of this type from coming to the floor of the Senate \nunder regular order.\n  It is apparently not a priority. In fact, not only is this apparently \nnot a priority but they have also deliberately attempted to prevent us \nfrom having the opportunity to enact HMO reform, the Patients' Bill of \nRights, school modernization, and so on, because it is not something \nthey want to do.\n  I think this is a misplaced set of priorities.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator agree that is one of the most important \nissues before families in this country? We believe, as supporters of \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights, Senator Daschle's bill, that doctors \nought to be making decisions with regard to the health of women in our \nsociety. That is the key underlying difference between the Patients' \nBill of Rights and other substitutes, but this is a matter of urgency, \na matter of importance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from North Dakota has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional \nminutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. May I inquire how much time remains in morning business \nunder the order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The remaining time is about 18 minutes, until \n11:30.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The Senator from West Virginia and I would also like some \nof that time if at all possible prior to 11:30. If you would take that \nunder consideration, I would not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 more minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I require no more than 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the indulgence of the Senator \nfrom Idaho.\n  Let me make one final point, and if the Senator from Massachusetts \nwishes to make a final point in the form of a question, I will yield.\n  The point is that health care decisions ought to be made in a \ndoctor's office or in a hospital room, not by some insurance company \naccountant 500 or 1,000 miles away. That is the point the Senator from \nMassachusetts is making. That is the point that is made in the \nunderlying legislation dealing with a Patients' Bill of Rights. It is a \ncritically important point.\n  We ought to have been able to debate fully under regular order the \npiece of legislation called the Patients' Bill of Rights. I regret we \nhave not been able to debate that.\n  I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, to conclude, I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record the correspondence from various women's \ngroups, including the No. 1 consumer group in terms of protection of \nwomen, the Breast Cancer Coalition, 450 organizations that support this \nlegislation, and the American Nurses Association, who strongly support \nthe legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    July 29, 1998.\n       Dear Senator: The undersigned organizations work on a range \n     of issues that are important to women, including women's \n     health, and together we speak for millions of women around \n     this country. As women's organizations, we understand the \n     needs and concerns of women. We urge you to support the \n     Patients' Bill of Rights Act (S. 1890) because it is the only \n     bill that provides comprehensive and genuine patient \n     protections for the millions of Americans enrolled in managed \n     care plans.\n       Few issues resonate as profoundly and pervasively as the \n     need for quality health care, and women have a particular \n     stake in the changes in our health care delivery system. \n     Women are the primary consumers of health care services in \n     this country, and we have unique health care needs. Women \n     also take care of the health care needs of our families, from \n     children to elderly relatives. Because of the great impact \n     any patient protection bill will ultimately have on women, we \n     ask that you support real reform that will truly improve \n     women's health.\n       The Patients' Bill of Rights Act (S. 1890) takes the needs \n     of all consumers seriously, and it pays particular attention \n     to the needs of women, The genuine and often unique concerns \n     of women are woven into the fabric of this bill. S  1890 \n     recognizes that women's health can only be improved by \n     comprehensive reform. Some of the provisions in S. 1890 that \n     will improve women's health include: letting a patient's own \n     trusted health care professional make important treatment \n     decisions like how long a patient stays in the hospital; \n     ensuring and streamlining access to specialty care, including \n     access to non-network specialists (at no additional cost) \n     when the plan can't meet the patient's needs; giving women \n     the option of having direct access to ob-gyn services or \n     choosing an obstetrician/gynecologist as a primary care \n     provider; ensuring access to clinical trials that may save \n     women's lives; ensuring that pregnant women can continue to \n     see the same health care provider throughout pregnancy if \n     either their provider leaves the plan or their employer \n     changes plans; allowing health care professionals to \n     prescribe drugs that are not on the plan's predetermined list \n     when such drugs are medically indicated; providing a fast, \n     fair, consumer-friendly independent appeal whenever a \n     plan's decision to deny or limit care jeopardizes life or \n     health; having an internal quality improvement system that \n     measures performance on health care issues that affect \n     women; collecting data (and providing a summary of it to \n     enrollees) that allows plans to evaluate how they are \n     meeting the health needs of women; incorporating gender-\n     specific medicine when developing the plan's written \n     clinical review criteria; and ensuring that providers and \n     patients are not discriminated against on the basis of sex \n     or other characteristics.\n       The other health reform bill that the Senate may soon \n     consider, the Senate leadership's bill (S. 2330), does not \n     include the patient protections listed above. It attempts to \n     address a few of these issues (ob-gyn services, continuity of \n     care, appeal procedures), but in each case the provisions \n     fall considerably short of S. 1890. As a result, the bill \n     does almost nothing to correct the problems that insured \n     women encounter every day with their health plans--the very \n     point of enacting patient protection legislation.\n       The bill's sponsors tout Title V of the bill (entitled \n     ``Women's Health Research and Prevention'') as responding to \n     the needs of women. But this title consists mostly of routine \n     reauthorizations of research and public health programs that \n     Congress must attend to as part of the usual course of \n     business. Initiatives such as these have bipartisan support, \n     but have stalled in committee for 18 months. Now that these \n     proposals have the backing of the leadership, we hope they \n     can be passed swiftly. But let's not be fooled--these \n     provisions, regardless of their obvious merits, do not turn \n     S. 2330 into a patient protection bill that meets the needs \n     of women.\n       Only S. 1890 offers the range of common-sense patient \n     protections that women need. We need to invest in women's \n     health research, but not as a substitute for comprehensive \n     patient protections. We urge you to support S. 1890 and not \n     S. 2330 when these bills come to the floor for a vote.\n           Sincerely,\n         National Partnership for Women & Families; American \n           Association of University Women; American Nurses \n           Association; Association of Women's Health, Obstetric \n           and Neonatal Nurses; Catholics for a Free Choice; \n           Church Women United; Coalition of Labor Union Women \n           (CLUW); Feminist Majority; MANA, A National Latina \n           Organization; National Abortion Federation.\n         National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League; \n           National Association of Commissions for Women (NACW); \n           National Association for Female Executives; National \n           Association of Nurse Practitioners in Reproductive \n           Health; National Black Women's Health Project; National \n           Committee for Responsive Philanthropy; National Family \n           Planning and Reproductive Health Association; National \n           Organization for Women; National Women's Conference; \n           National Women's Law Center.\n         NETWORK, A National Catholic Social Justice Lobby; Older \n           Women's League; Religious Coalition for Reproductive \n           Choice; RESOLVE, The National Infertility Association; \n           United Methodist Church, General Board of Church and \n           Society; Wider Opportunities for Women; The Woman \n           Activist Fund; Women Employed; Women's Institute for \n           Freedom of the Press; Working Women's Department, AFL-\n           CIO; YWCA of the U.S.A.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Statement of Beverly L. Malone, President, American Nurses Association\n\n\n          press conference on managed care and women's health\n\n       Good afternoon. I am Beverly Malone, President of the \n     American Nurses Association.\n       ANA is proud to be one of the signatories of this letter \n     urging members of the Senate to support S. 1890, the \n     Patients' Bill of Rights Act. It is the only bill that \n     provides comprehensive and genuine patient protections for \n     the millions of Americans enrolled in managed care plans, \n     protections that are of particular importance to women.\n       Nurses have long been in the forefront of efforts to \n     recognize and provide for the distinct health care needs of \n     women. As patient\n\n[[Page S11543]]\n\n     advocates, most of whom are themselves women, and as health \n     care providers who focus on the health of the whole person, \n     nurses have a special concern for the well-being of women in \n     our society.\n       ANA strongly supports the patient protections recommended \n     by the President's Commission on Consumer Protection and \n     Quality in the Health Care Industry and embodied in Patients' \n     Bill of Rights of 1998. As a member of the Commission, as a \n     nurse, as a woman, and as a representative of the millions of \n     registered nurses in the United States, I say without \n     reservation that the nursing profession's commitment to our \n     patients demands our commitment to legislation that will \n     provide true protection from the abusive practices of the \n     managed care industry.\n       Nurses who are at the bedside when women undergo the trauma \n     of breast cancer and mastectomy are acutely aware of a broad \n     range of unsafe and insensitive practices that threaten the \n     health and safety of their patients. Certainly, requirements \n     by health plans that women undergo mastectomies as outpatient \n     procedures are unconscionable. But that practice is \n     symptomatic of more pervasive dysfunctions in the health care \n     system that impact women disproportionately and must be \n     addressed as well. It is not enough to address only one \n     instance of inappropriate interference in treatment \n     decisions. In fact, offering a token rather than a genuine \n     reform is shameful when there is such suffering in so many \n     other areas.\n       My colleagues from the women's community who are here today \n     know that aging women suffer the effects of prescription drug \n     limitations that do not allow for their complex health \n     requirements, that the scourge of breast cancer requires not \n     only humane treatment but access to clinical trials so that \n     true progress can be made for future generations, and that \n     women who make health care decisions for themselves and for \n     their families must have full information on which to base \n     those decisions.\n       The Americans Nurses Association believes that every \n     individual should have access to health care services along \n     the full continuum of care and be an empowered partner in \n     making health care decisions. We also believe that \n     accountability for quality, cost-effective health care must \n     be shared among health plans, health systems, providers, and \n     consumers. There is only one bill before the Senate which \n     will provide that kind of access and empowerment and \n     accountability for the women of our nation and their \n     families.\n       Nurses at the bedside have learned what happens when frail, \n     older women receive inappropriate medications, or when \n     mammograms come too late, or when misinformation or \n     misunderstanding lead to dangerous delays in care. For the \n     nurses at the bedside, the need for patient protection and \n     patient advocacy is played out every day, and we urge every \n     Senator to support S. 1890, the Patients' Bill of Rights Act \n     of 1998.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   Statement of Frances M. Visco, President, National Breast Cancer \n                               Coalition\n\n\n                  Patients' Bill of Rights Act of 1998\n\n       Once again, on behalf of the 450 organizations and tens of \n     thousands of individuals who are members of the National \n     Breast Cancer Coalition (NBCC), I would like to reconfirm our \n     support for the ``Patients' Bill of Rights Act of 1998'' (S. \n     1890). I applaud Sens. Daschle and Kennedy for introducing a \n     bill which offers real patient protections benefitting women \n     and the potential to help ensure effective, quality health \n     care.\n       The NBCC is dedicated to the eradication of breast cancer \n     through action and advocacy: it seeks to increase the \n     influence of breast cancer survivors and other activities \n     over research, clinical trials, and public policy and to \n     ensure access to quality health care for all women. NBCC \n     recognizes that the evolving health care system affords us \n     the opportunity to define and focus on true quality of care \n     for women and their families. We cannot afford to let this \n     opportunity pass.\n       The NBCC believes that breast cancer patients have \n     fundamental rights, including: the right to receive accurate \n     information about their health plans; access to the right \n     providers; involvement in treatment decisions that are based \n     on good science; confidentiality of their health information; \n     and coverage for routine health care costs associated with \n     participation in clinical trials. S. 1890 guarantees patients \n     these rights and offers women a legitimate ``Patients' Bill \n     of Rights.''\n       Other bills being considered by the Senate that are being \n     marketed as women's health bills do not in fact give women \n     the substantive protections that they need. Instead, the \n     bills offer routine reauthorizations of research and public \n     health programs that Congress must attend to as part of the \n     usual course of business. While these provisions and efforts \n     to move them forward quickly are extremely important, they do \n     not transform proposed health reform legislation into a \n     women's health care bill. To ensure true quality health care \n     for women and their families, we need legislation, such as S. \n     1890, which offers comprehensive patient protections against \n     the problems that insured women encounter every day with \n     their health plans.\n       One of the NBCC's most pressing concerns is that health \n     insurance and managed care plans are erecting barriers to \n     good science by increasingly refusing reimbursement for \n     routine patient costs when breast cancer patients participate \n     in approved clinical trials. This practice is preventing us \n     from finding desperately needed scientific answers about \n     breast cancer and severely affects the treatment breast \n     cancer patients receive. Only three percent of adult cancer \n     patients are enrolled in clinical trials--insurance \n     reimbursement is often a major obstacle to clinical trial \n     participation. In fact, one of our NBCC members who \n     participated in an NCI clinical trial five years ago, only \n     recently resolved her legal battles with her insurance \n     company over coverage of the costs associated with the NCI \n     trial. The Patients' Bill of Rights Act is an important first \n     step in ensuring third party coverage for the routine patient \n     costs incurred within a clinical trial.\n       The NBCC is prepared to work with the Congress, and will \n     mobilize our nation-wide network of advocates to ensure that \n     meaningful legislation like the Patients' Bill of Rights Act \n     is enacted into law. We offer thanks to all of the leaders \n     gathered here today for their work to ensure that breast \n     cancer patients and all American women and families receive \n     quality health care.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/06/senate-section/article/S11540-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11543-S11544]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SCHEDULE OF THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the floor today with a revelation \nthat I suspect will come as a bit of a surprise to some of my \ncolleagues and to a few Americans. Mr. President, fellow Senators and \nfellow Americans, President Bill Clinton, is in town. That is right. \nThe President is actually in the White House today.\n  For any who have followed the President's extensive travel throughout \nhis term in office, you would notice that I say his ``time in \nWashington'' because that has been far less than his term in office. \nThe fact that the President has actually planned to stay in town for a \nweek is, in my opinion, a bit newsworthy.\n  The President is supposed to be the head of our country. Instead, I \nsuspect that Bill Clinton has been our country's feet. This President \nis already the most foreign-traveled President in U.S. history, with 32 \ntrips abroad in less than 6 years in office. In just the last 2 years, \nhe has spent 79 days overseas. Those 79 days abroad in 2 years are \nalmost as many days as President Bush spent during his 4 years in \noffice.\n  If and when he has come home to the United States does not mean that \nhe came home to the White House. President Clinton spent almost half of \nlast year, 149 days, and over half of this year, now 155 days, out of \nthe White House. What has he been doing while logging those frequent \nflier miles on Air Force One? Well, a lot has been fundraising; 65 days \nover just the last 2 years have included out-of-town fundraising trips, \nand 14 more are planned for this month alone.\n  Now the President is back in town for one of his rare weeks in \nWashington. What did he do on his first day at work yesterday? He \nsought, once again, to divert attention from his own problems--this \ntime, by threatening to shut down the Government. It is hard to tell if \nthis President has come back to town to simply repack his bags or to \ntake, or attempt to take, Congress hostage.\n  President Clinton appears intent on making the sequel to the movie \n``Wag the Dog.'' The President hasn't participated in the process of \ngovernment at all this year, and now he returns, seemingly, to attempt \nto shut the process down. I have to say I think this is a bit of \ndiversion. I don't believe it is leadership.\n  Is it unfair to criticize? Is it partisan to be harsh? I asked myself \nthat question before I came to the floor this morning. I don't think \nso. Here is why I don't think so. Consider just two issues that we all \nbelieve are important issues, that even the President has acknowledged \nare important.\n  In just a few moments we are going to resume debate on a most \nimportant piece of legislation, the agricultural appropriations. It is \non that that I want to speak for just a few moments, an issue that \nPresident Clinton once ignored. He ignored solutions to help farmers \nand ranchers. He didn't speak about them in his first term of office \nand has spoken little about them in his second term. Now we have \nlegislation that we think will help farmers and ranchers, and on his \nfirst week back in town he says ``I'll veto it.''\n  ``Agriculture'' is a word that this President hasn't found a place \nfor in his vocabulary. Why? Because American farmers make up less than \n3 percent of the American public. They don't have as much political \nclout as they once had. So this President hasn't\n\n[[Page S11544]]\n\naddressed this issue. But just now, when American agriculture is in \ncrisis and this Congress, in a bipartisan way, is attempting to find \nsolutions to that crisis, our President comes to town, finds his \nfooting, and says, ``I'll veto the effort.''\n  Mr. President, that is fair if you had been part of the process, if \nyou had been in here working with us, if there had been legitimate \ngive-and-take and finally a breakdown. That is not the case at all.\n  The President was absent--traveling, fundraising--away from what is \nmost important. So he seeks now to make up for his absence by having \nnot just one position on agriculture but three positions. First of all, \nhe asked for about $2.3 billion in assistance on September 22. That was \njust 2 weeks ago. Congress then roughly doubled that amount. Yet now, \nto hide the fact that he had not been paying attention to American \nagriculture, President Clinton is demanding more, much more--nearly $7 \nbillion. And now he threatens to veto legislation that Congress will \nsend to him--legislation that will give twice the money that he asked \nfor less than a month ago.\n\n  For 2 years, he has failed to use the tools that could have addressed \nthe agriculture problems in substantial ways. He has ignored the \ntools--tools that I have requested the President not let rust away in \nsome storage shed down at USDA, tools of trade, tools of trade \nintervention, humanitarian aid. All of those kinds of things that would \nhave moved our products into the market were not used and have gathered \nrust and sat idle. Why, then, is the President coming back almost in an \neffort to demand a scorched-Earth policy? Is it politics, or is it the \nwag factor that is now at work? I am not sure. But, Mr. President, I \nthink you have little credibility in this area.\n  Let me discuss just one other area briefly. I know the Senator from \nWest Virginia is waiting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. CRAIG. There is the issue of Social Security. So important was it \nthat the President declared it in his State of the Union Address as an \neffort to save Social Security. Yet, the President has not bothered to \nmake one step in that direction. The Congress waited a year, but no \nplan came from the White House. Just as with the farm crisis, he has \nonly managed to use it--not address it, much less solve it. Like the \nfarm crisis, he sought to use it to turn attention from himself. \nInstead of buckling down, this President has traveled around; over half \nof the days of this year the President has been out of town. He has \nfound time to travel, he has found time to go overseas, he has found \ntime to fundraise; but he has not found time to send any one plan to \nsave Social Security to the Congress of the United States, or any one \nplan to alleviate a farm crisis that is now emerging.\n  Well, I suspect that if the solution to Social Security had been in \nBeijing, or Chile, or Ghana, or Uganda, or Rwanda, or South America, he \nmight have found it there because that is where the President was. Why \nnow, the last week that Congress plans to be in session, with a \nschedule that was established at the first of the year, did the \nPresident find his way back to the White House to sit and only \nthreaten--threaten to veto here, threaten to veto there?\n  Mr. President, are you planning to shut down the Government? Is it a \nplan for diversion? Is it a plan to hide? Well, we have some problems \nand we are going to work to solve them. Those solutions should come in \na bipartisan way. Mr. President, I hope you will be a part of the \nsolution. The American people deserve nothing less than that.\n  I don't like coming to the floor to give these kinds of speeches, but \nsometimes I feel they are important. Sometimes I feel it is important \nfor the American people to recognize, as we do, that there are times \nwhen we work together and not times when we simply find our footing to \nthreaten or to change the subject or to divert attention.\n  Is the Presidency in crisis today? Yes, it is. We all know why it is. \nThat is a constitutional tragedy. That will work its will. The House is \nunderway in that process. Let us be allowed to work our will to solve \nthe problem of financing our Government for the coming year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have some remarks, which may require 10 or \n11 or 12 minutes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I may be recognized for such time as I \nmay consume, and that the previous order to proceed with the \nAgriculture conference report be delayed until I complete my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, with the new school year now in full swing, \nour youngsters are brimming with the excitement of making new friends, \nradiating enthusiasm for new studies, and preparing for the challenges \nthat lie ahead of them. Students are tackling new reading assignments \nand committing algebraic formulas to memory. During recess hour, they \nare frolicking in the school playground with new classmates and old \nfriends, enjoying the waning days of shirt-sleeve weather. They feel \nsafe and secure--free from threatening situations and out of harm's \nway.\n  But as our children leave home each morning for the school day, we as \nparents, grandparents, educators, and legislators, must regretfully \nremember that, just a few months ago, some of our nation's schools \nlooked more like virtual war zones with bloodshed and the tragic loss \nof life. From Paducah, KY, to Springfield, OR, the notion of schools as \na safe haven was shattered by the sound of gunfire, and we must now \nbegin to face the formidable challenge of rebuilding that serene and \ntranquil school environment that each and every student deserves.\n  Today, responding to my concerns about this trend, I am unveiling a \nnew branch of my web site which contains the most up-to-date and \naccurate information available from authoritative sources on school \nsafety. I have designed this web site to be an electronic resource \nbook, complete with descriptions of school safety initiatives underway \nin West Virginia, updates on federal funding available for violence \nprevention efforts, and the latest information on legislation moving \nthrough the Congress. I hope that this addition to my web site will \nserve as an important tool for parents, students, educators, and \nlawmakers in addressing the issue of school safety in West Virginia and \nin other States.\n  In concert with the release of my school safety resources web site, I \nam also introducing companion legislation in the Senate today to \nRepresentative Bob Wise's recently introduced legislation, H.R. 4515, \nto provide for the establishment of school violence prevention \nhotlines. Often, a potentially harmful student confides in his closest \nfriend about his intentions to launch a violent attack on school \npremises. Or perhaps, teachers notice a change in a student's demeanor \nor an action completely uncharacteristic of a happy, well-balanced \nchild. Occasionally, the parents of an otherwise cheerful, amicable son \nor daughter detect hostility in their child's voice when talking about \na particular group of students. All of these scenarios may be just a \nbad day on the surface or semantics misinterpreted, but they also may \nbe the first signs of a potentially threatening student.\n  My legislation would provide funds to local education agencies and \nschools that have established or proposed to establish school violence \nprevention hotlines. It is essential that parents, students, and \nteachers have an outlet where they can report threatening situations to \nauthorities who will watch over the student's behavior and alert school \nofficials. School violence hotlines can prevent a disturbed student in \nneed of help from taking that next, sometimes fatal, step.\n  I have long been concerned about the increasing incidence of violence \nin the classroom and have supported numerous efforts to combat this \nkind of outrageous behavior and strengthen discipline for all students. \nAfter receiving a disturbing report in 1990 from the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention which stated that nearly twenty-four \npercent of West Virginia's students between grades nine and twelve\n\n[[Page S11545]]\n\ncarried a gun, knife, or other weapon to school at least once during \nthat year for self-protection or use in a fight, I began looking for \nways to better address the problem of school violence. In 1994, when \nCongress passed the Improving America's Schools Act in an effort to \nreauthorize and improve the existing Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct, I offered two amendments aimed at reducing the level of school \nviolence.\n  First, the Congress adopted my proposal directing local school \ndistricts to refer to the criminal justice system any student who \nbrings a weapon to school. Possession of a weapon on school property is \na crime, and when a crime occurs, the police should be notified. While \nschool discipline is an appropriate and essential first step in \nreprimanding a student for such a violation, it is simply not enough. \nPossession of a firearm on school grounds is an outrage and a true \nimpediment to the environment that teachers are striving to foster.\n  The second amendment that I authored in 1994, which was approved by \nCongress, required the U.S. Secretary of Education to conduct the first \nmajor study of violence in schools since 1978. In July of this year, \nthe National Center for Education Statistics, in concert with the \nDepartment of Education, released the results of this study, which was \nconducted with a nationally representative sample of 1,234 regular \npublic, elementary, middle, and secondary schools in all 50 States and \nthe District of Columbia.\n  In a snapshot of the 1996-1997 school year, the study revealed that, \nwith more than half of U.S. public schools reporting at least one crime \nincident, and one in ten schools reporting at least one serious violent \ncrime during that school year, violence continues to beset schools \nacross this country, all too often resulting in fatal situations.\n  Back in my day, no student would have considered such lawless and \nunruly behavior. We knew right from wrong, as it was instilled in us \nfrom our parents, sometimes with the aid of a switch that we were made \nto fetch ourselves. We were told that the classroom was a sacred \nprecinct. I was told that if I got a whipping at school I would get a \nthrashing at home.\n  The classroom was a place where quiet prevailed and where students \ncherished the opportunity they had to learn, and that was the attitude \nwe adopted. Unfortunately, today, students, many of them it seems, must \nbe threatened by an impending obligation before the criminal justice \nsystem to make them behave and, often, even that has proven inadequate \nin keeping guns out of the hands of children and off school properties. \nMr. President, what is it going to take to keep our students safe--\nmetal detectors in every elementary and secondary school in the nation? \nIs that the direction in which our country is headed?\n  In the wake of reports of violence and tragedy at schools across the \ncountry, Congress is, once again, honing in on the issue of school \nsafety. In more recent efforts, as part of the Fiscal Year 1999 \nCommerce/Justice/State Appropriations Bill, the Senate approved $210 \nmillion for a new national safe schools initiative to assist community-\nlevel efforts. Of that funding, $175 million is to increase community \npolicing in and around schools.\n  Just a few weeks ago, as part of the Fiscal Year 1999 Labor/Health \nand Human Services,/Education and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee reported out legislation which \ncontains more than $150 million for a comprehensive school safety \ninitiative to support activities that promote safe learning \nenvironments for students. Such activities may include targeted \nassistance, training for teachers and school security officers, and \nenhancing the capacity of schools to provide mental health services to \ntroubled youth.\n\n  Since the release of the 1990 report from the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention, my home state of West Virginia has made great \nstrides in addressing school violence, and is setting a true precedent \nfor communities around the country in helping to establish safe schools \nwhich support learning for all children and the professionals who teach \nthem. According to the West Virginia Department of Education, incidents \ninvolving a weapon have decreased by sixty-nine percent during the \nyears 1994 through 1997, perhaps, in large part, due to short- and \nlong-term initiatives underway in the State of West Virginia.\n  Mr. President, our nation has been grappling with the issue of \nimproved school safety for years, and I am frankly alarmed that \nAmerican school children continue to face increasing crime and \nviolence. It is time to stop wringing our hands over this issue and \ntake action.\n  We have a school system today run in many instances by hoodlums who \nare converting sacred temples for learning into terror camps with \ninnocent children becoming casualties in scholastic ``free fire'' \nzones. We have teachers working in fear, too anxious even to teach \ntheir students properly. We must get guns out of the schools and put an \nend to this sense of panic which is pervading our nation's elementary \nand secondary education system. I am hopeful that these initiatives we \nhave promulgated in the Senate this year will begin the mission of \nsetting our nation back on track.\n  One of the most important things that we can provide to our children \nis the opportunity for a good education. I was afforded the opportunity \nto obtain a good, solid education back when I was a student attending \nclass in a two-room schoolhouse. Today, we have mammoth schools, with \nall kinds of high-tech equipment, computers, and amenities that I never \nhad or had never even heard of, or couldn't even imagine in those \nyears. Yet our students are not learning. We owe our young people today \nthe chance to learn and excel in an environment free from guns, knives, \nand other weapons.\n  One of the National Education Goals, as included in the Goals 2000 \nlegislation enacted in 1994, states ``all schools in America will be \nfree of drugs and violence and the unauthorized presence of firearms \nand alcohol, and offer a disciplined environment that is conducive to \nlearning by the year 2000.'' To accomplish that goal--it is almost \ngoing to be impossible--we must send a message loud and clear that we \nwill not tolerate weapons in our schools.\n  Protecting our children is not simply a matter of public policy. It \nis a matter of basic values, of teaching children right from wrong and \npunishing those who insist on doing wrong, of instilling them with \nrespect for the law and providing them with limitations. Students must \nknow that they will be punished for doing the wrong thing, or for \nchoosing the bad route.\n  Mr. President, in the blink of an eye, we have lost the lives of \nprecious young children to school violence--children who may have grown \nto be teachers, doctors, businessmen and women, and perhaps even future \nSenators. We in Congress have a responsibility to stop this deadly \ntrend from striking other innocent families. The time has long since \ncome and gone for decency and sanity to re-enter the schoolhouse door--\nlet's get moving.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/06/senate-section/article/S11544-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11545-S11562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  AGRICULTURAL, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND \n      RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1999--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I intend to vote against the Conference \nReport on Fiscal Year 1999 Agriculture Appropriations bill for a number \nof reasons. In the final version, the congressional majority has added \na $3.6 billion unfunded emergency spending provision, while \nsimultaneously stripping out consumer and farmer protections.\n  However, today I will focus on the worst provision in the conference \nreport. I am extremely disappointed that\n\n[[Page S11546]]\n\nthe final version contains language from the House bill extending \nUSDA's rulemaking period on Federal Milk Marketing Order Reform. Once \nagain, on the issue of milk orders, bad politics prevailed over good \npolicy.\n  This extension will require the new milk pricing system to be in \nplace in October of 1999, instead of the original date of April, 1999 \nset in the Farm Bill. Mr. President, officials at USDA have assured me \nthat they did not request this extension nor do they need it.\n  House Appropriators argued that the extension was necessary to give \nCongress ample time to review, comment and act on the final rule. They \nclaim that if the rule were to be announced in late November, they \nwould not have time to act on it. Mr. President, let's examine this \nargument because it does not hold water. My House and Senate colleagues \nwho support this provision on these grounds surely remember passage of \nthe Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996. This \nlaw empowers Congress and the courts to overturn regulations with \nPresidential approval. This law gives Congress 60 days to act, once a \nrule has been published in the Federal Register. So, whether the rule \nis published in late November, early December, or mid-February of 1999, \nCongress has 60 days of session to act. So this really tells us what is \ngoing on here.\n  Mr. President, this dairy provision was included solely to intimidate \nand bully USDA and Secretary Glickman into an anti-Wisconsin dairy \npricing reform. Instead of allowing USDA to do its job, some Members of \nCongress want to do it for them, and do it to benefit their own \nproducers at the expense of dairy farmers in the Upper Midwest.\n  Let's just take a look at the current system which is shown on this \nchart, which some have called the Eau Claire system. I like to call it \nthe anti-Eau Claire system because it is an unfair system for Eau \nClaire, WI, and our entire state--in fact, the entire upper Midwest.\n  This chart shows that the Class I differential received by dairy \nfarmers in Eau Claire, Wisconsin is $1.20 per hundredweight. Believe it \nor not, Mr. President, Federal pricing policy dictates that the farther \nyou travel from Eau Claire, WI, the higher your Class I differential. \nYou will notice that the price in Chicago is $1.40, in Kansas City, \nMissouri it's $1.92 and in Charlotte, NC it's $3.08 per hundredweight. \nOur friends in Florida make $3.58 in Tallahassee, $3.88 in Tampa, and \n$4.18 in Miami. Dairy farmers in Miami make nearly $3.00 more per \nhundredweight than farmers in the Upper Midwest. Does that make any \nsense? Absolutely not.\n  Let me illustrate this with another chart.\n  To illustrate just how senseless this whole system is, I have \nborrowed this graphic from my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Rod \nGrams. As you can see, pricing milk based on its distance from Eau \nClaire, WI, is as arbitrary and ridiculous as pricing oranges from \ntheir distance from Florida, computers from their distance from \nSeattle, or--even more shocking to some of us--country music from its \ndistance from Nashville. But wait, now that I think about it, maybe \nCongress should pass legislation to price maple syrup based on its \ndistance from Burlington, VT, and white wine on its distance from \nCalifornia. While we are at it, lets pass a law to pay Members of \nCongress according to the distance of their hometown from Washington, \nDC. Sound ridiculous? It is, just as the current milk pricing system is \nridiculous. It would almost be funny if it weren't so destructively \nunfair to Wisconsin's dairy farmers, undermining the livelihoods of \ntheir families.\n  Mr. President, the current system desperately needs reform, a reform \nthe Secretary of Agriculture has indicated he is willing to make--but \nthat some members of Congress are very anxious to prevent. This poster \nis an illustration of today's Federal milk pricing system--how milk is \nproduced and priced in America. You can see that the price of milk \nbegins not with the cow, but with the Congress. Its interesting to note \nthat the market and the farmer don't enter into the equation until two-\nthirds down the page. I could walk you through all the confusing steps \nshown here, but I understand we are scheduled to recess sometime in \nOctober, and frankly, I would need until mid-November to describe fully \nthe inequity of this system.\n  This system has outlived its usefulness, its patently unfair and its \nbad policy.\n  The extension of USDA's rulemaking had another intent as well. \nExtending the rulemaking period automatically extends the life of the \nNortheast Interstate Dairy Compact. The 1996 Farm Bill requires a \nsunset of the Compact when the new federal pricing system is \nimplemented. At the rate Congress is going, tacking this issue onto \nappropriations bills, there is no telling when implementation will now \noccur.\n  The effects of the Compact on consumers within the region and \nproducers outside of it is indisputable. Dairy compacts are harmful, \nunnecessary and a burden to this country's taxpayers.\n  The worst part of this entire 65 year dairy fiasco is its effect on \nthe producers in the Upper Midwest. The 6 month extension puts an \nadditional 900 Wisconsin producers at risk. Wisconsin loses \napproximately 3 dairy farmers a day. Producers cannot stand 6 more days \nof the current program, let along 6 more months.\n  I am truly troubled by this turn of events and would like to read \ninto the record a few excerpts from letters I have received from \nstruggling dairy farmers in my home state of Wisconsin.\n  From Pulaski, Wisconsin a constituent writes:\n\n       I would love to encourage my son or daughter to take over \n     this farm someday. But without a fair pricing system, they \n     cannot earn a decent living, and I cannot and will not \n     encourage them to farm. That will be a great loss to the \n     world of agriculture.\n\n  A letter from Bloomer, WI reads:\n\n       We, in the Upper Midwest are not asking for a handout, just \n     a more level playing field. Fair competition and price reform \n     is our only hope.\n\n  Another constituent writes:\n\n       In my opinion, just because a pricing system has been in \n     implementation for years, doesn't make it useful today. It \n     must also change with the times. How many more farms are we \n     willing to let fall victim to the prejudiced pricing? . . . \n     Its much easier to put a pillow over our heads, roll over and \n     ignore the cry for help from the Wisconsin dairy farmers . . \n     . I realize changing the present milk pricing system will not \n     heal the strained economics of dairy farming. It's only a \n     step . . . I urge you to take this step and . . . hear the \n     cry of dairy farmers like me.\n\n  And finally, a dairy producer makes this comment:\n\n       Eau Claire was chosen as the reference point because it was \n     judged by the government to be the center of the dairy \n     industry's most productive region. Since California now \n     produces more milk than Wisconsin, this [rule] should no \n     longer apply. Maybe we should change the [milk pricing] \n     reference point to Fresno, California, to encourage dairy \n     production in the Midwest.\n\n  These examples illustrate the need for dairy pricing reform and \nillustrate the state of Wisconsin's dairy industry- struggling \nneedlessly under the burden of current dairy policy.\n  Mr. President, not only is legislating dairy policy on this bill \ninappropriate, its bad precedent, it circumvents the appropriate \ncommittees, the Agriculture and Judiciary Committees, and circumvents \nUSDA's authority. We ought to give USDA the opportunity to do the right \nthing for today's national dairy industry and put an end to the unfair \nEau Claire system now, not 6 months from now.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to take a second look at this \nantiquated and harmful policy. Stand up for equity, fairness, and for \nwhat is best for America's dairy industry, our consumers and our \ntaxpayers. I yield back the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we begin consideration again today of the \nAgriculture Appropriations Conference Report. Yesterday we were on that \nreport for 3\\1/2\\ hours and had a full discussion of views on the \nquestion of whether or not the conference report should be adopted. I \nwas pleased to see this morning an assessment of the situation by the \nWashington Post, in an editorial entitled, ``The Appropriations Game.'' \nI read excerpts from that editorial:\n\n       In the agricultural bill, an election-year bidding war has \n     broken out between the parties over aid to distressed \n     farmers. This is\n\n[[Page S11547]]\n\n     one from which the president should back away . . . The \n     Democrats want not just to give a larger amount but to do \n     so in such a way as to repudiate the last farm bill . . . \n     The administration earlier in the year rightly resisted \n     the position it has now adopted; it should revert.\n\n  That is the end of the quotation from the Washington Post editorial. \nI think it appropriately points out the difficulty we face in \nconfronting a threat from the President to veto this conference report. \nIt is not just about money.\n  The President is suggesting, through his Secretary of Agriculture and \nthrough the Democratic leadership, that this conference report is \nunacceptable, not because it doesn't appropriate enough money, but \nbecause it doesn't change the policy that was agreed upon in the 1996 \nfarm bill and signed by this President. It changes a fundamental policy \nof setting Government loan rates and using them to encourage the \nplanning of some five or more specific commodities.\n  To get away from that old way of Government support, the Congress and \nthe President, the administration, worked together to develop an \nalternative, a farm policy that would be driven by the dictates of the \nmarket, the demands of the market, the signals that the market would \nsend to producers to indicate what prices might likely be during a crop \nyear, and farmers themselves would make the choice as to what they \nwould plant.\n  Some call this Freedom to Farm--freedom to plant what you want to \nrather than what the Government dictates you have to plant in order to \nbe eligible for Government support. To make this a transition where the \nGovernment wasn't going to just say, ``OK, everybody, you're on your \nown, farmers are on their own,'' there would be a series, over 5 years, \nof transition payments made.\n  Interestingly enough, as pointed out by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Kansas, Senator Roberts, yesterday during the debate, this year's \ntransition payments are going to be higher. It was assumed by the \nwriters of that policy, the legislative committees, that at first \nfarmers would really need to have higher payments. They were very \nprescient figuring this out and including that provision in the farm \nbill.\n  What we have suggested in our disaster assistance plan is, not to \nchange the policy, but to provide bonus payments under the market \ntransition formulas to increase the amount that all producers who are \neligible for these payments would receive to help deal with the income \nlosses that are occurring because of lost markets in Asia and elsewhere \nduring this global economic crisis.\n  Then there are those who have sustained weather-related disasters in \ncertain areas, which has meant lost crops, not just lost income, not \njust diminished yields, which the increased market transition payments \nwill help deal with. But, for those who have suffered crop losses, no \nloan rate is going to help them. There is nothing to put under the \nloan.\n  The Washington Post points out, correctly, that we are not just in a \nbidding war on this bill--we are out of sorts because the Democrats \nkeep advertising that their plan is worth $7 billion plus, and the \nRepublicans only $4 billion; and therefore, the Democrats have a \npreferable plan and one that would provide more benefits--but the fact \nis, you change the policy instead of providing direct disaster \nassistance and you are not necessarily delivering money to those people \nwho need the disaster benefits.\n  The $4.2 billion plan is a direct assistance plan to those who \nqualify because they have suffered losses, plus the additional amount \nthat is included in the transition bonuses.\n  We continue to debate the issue. I am hopeful the Senate will approve \nthe conference report. We have voted twice in the Senate, at the \nDemocrats' insistence, on lifting the loan caps under the 1996 farm \nbill, and that has been rejected each time. We have voted twice on it, \nand twice it has been rejected. Now the administration is saying if you \ndon't reconsider those two decisions, put that or something similar in \nthe farm bill, in the disaster program, then the President will veto \nthe bill.\n  This is a $59.9 billion bill--$59.9 billion. We are talking about a \nvery small part, a disagreement on a matter of policy where the \nDemocrats are trying to get the Congress to be required by this \nPresident to repudiate a part of the 1996 farm bill so some Senators, I \nsuppose, can go home and say, ``I told you so; we had a better bill,'' \neven though it has been pointed out clearly that under the old farm \nbill, under the old policy that they are trying to reinstate pro \ntanto--a good law school phrase--they would be getting less money.\n  Under the Freedom to Farm bill, all farmers are getting more money \nfrom the Government as transition payments than they would have been \neligible to receive under the 1996 farm bill which they want to exhume, \nresurrect, breathe life into, and put back on the books. That is not a \nvery impressive proposal. That is not a very attractive proposal, and \nthis Senate ought to reject it.\n  I hope there will be votes enough to override the President's veto. \nIt has been done before on an agriculture appropriations bill. It was a \nlong time ago. But you usually don't see a President vetoing an \nagriculture appropriations bill. I hope somebody will get around to \npointing out what all is in this bill for production agriculture, for \nthe women, infants, and children feeding program, for food stamps for \npeople who are unable to provide for their own nutrition needs, for \nschool lunch and breakfast programs.\n  I just came from a conference with the House on a reauthorization \nbill for child nutrition programs. We have some very important needs \nthat are met in this legislation. Close to 65 percent of the funding in \nthis appropriations bill that we are approving today goes to help \npeople provide for their own nutrition needs.\n  The President may call this a veto of a disaster assistance program, \nbut that is one very small part of what he is saying no to. He is \nrejecting the hard work of many Members of this body and the other body \nas well in crafting a bill that meets the need for agriculture \nresearch, for rural water and sewer system loans and grants, for \neconomic development initiatives in small towns and rural communities \nthroughout the United States.\n  If one looks at the amount of money that goes to support production \nagriculture in this legislation, it is minuscule compared to the total \namount being spent on other programs. Many in agriculture have said \nthat this bill should not even be named an agriculture appropriations \nbill--that there should be a more accurate way of describing the \nfunding that is contained in the bill. It doesn't go to agriculture, or \nat least not most of it, very little of it, as a percentage of the \ntotal amount appropriated. But the President is willing to put at risk \nthose programs that are funded in this bill to accommodate the \ninterests of a few Senators who are suggesting that this is an unfair, \nan insensitive approach to providing disaster assistance to those who \nhave suffered weather-related disasters and suffered because of a \ndownturn in the world economic situation.\n  We are confronting a serious crisis in American agriculture. This \nbill responds to that crisis by providing direct assistance to those \nwho have been harmed and who are eligible for transition payments and \nweather-related disaster benefits.\n  I suggest the Washington Post is right about this, and to repeat what \nthey say this morning in this editorial, this is an election-year \nbidding war from which the President should back away.\n       The Democrats want not just to give a larger amount but to \n     do so in such a way as to repudiate the last farm bill. . . . \n     The administration earlier in the year rightly resisted the \n     position it has now adopted; it should revert.\n\n  And so the observers at the Washington Post have figured this out. I \nhope that Senators will resist the entreaties being made to vote \nagainst this bill. This conference report ought to be adopted. It is a \nfair allocation of resources across the programs that are funded in the \nbill.\n  I mentioned the Department of Agriculture programs that are funded in \nthe bill that the President is willing to put at risk and to create the \nuncertainty and the anxieties among those who are expecting benefits at \nthe beginning of this fiscal year. Right now we are operating under a \ncontinuing resolution. To veto the bill creates more delay, more \nuncertainty, more\n\n[[Page S11548]]\n\nanxiety. It puts in jeopardy the very benefits we are trying to make \navailable for people now.\n  Farmers need help now. They are beginning to be skeptical of the \nwhole process and promises that are made by the Federal Government. I \nwould like to do something to correct that. I would like to make sure \nthat Government is trusted again to do what it promises to do and what \nit says it is willing to do, and many of us have been trying to put \ntogether a package of benefits that makes sense, is supported by the \nfacts, can be administered.\n  We provide additional funds in this bill for the administration of \nthe program. And it is going to cost more. We have tried to work with \nthe administration to determine the amount needed so that there will \nnot have to be extra burdens assumed at county offices throughout the \ncountry, where there will be an increase in the workload, where there \nwill be more demands made on the administration, the farm service \nagency in particular.\n  We have tried to cooperate with this administration. It was our \nrecommendation at the conference that these funds be added to help the \nadministration deal with it. And now they turn right around and say, \n``We're going to veto that bill because it is inconsistent with the \nproposal made by Senate Democrats on the Senate floor,'' that was twice \nrejected by the Senate. ``If you don't include the disaster bill the \nway they want it written or in that respect, then we're going to veto \nthis entire bill.''\n  This entire bill, Mr. President, provides $56 billion in funding for \na wide range of programs, most of them nutrition assistance, as I \nmentioned. So I hope the people in the country will stop and think what \nthis administration is about to do to you if you are depending upon and \nlooking to the Federal Government for support in nutrition programs. If \nyou have free and reduced lunch and breakfast programs in your schools, \nthey are not going to be funded on time because this President says, \n``I'm vetoing this bill because it doesn't satisfy a few Senate \nDemocrats.''\n  That is not only bad politics, that is bad Government, and it ought \nto be repudiated by the Congress. If the President does insist on \ncarrying out this promise or this threat to veto the bill, I hope the \nSenate will--if the House can--overturn the veto and not sustain the \nPresident's action.\n  The Washington Post is right, the President ought to go back to the \nposition he earlier had taken. The President signed the 1996 farm bill, \nand now he is suggesting that we need to go back and rewrite portions \nof it and that that will satisfy the needs of production agriculture, \nthat that would be a better deal for farmers. The fact of the matter \nis, if we start going down that old road again, we will have an \nunworkable and unpredictable level of support from the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Now farmers know what the Federal Government is going to provide in \ntransition payments that are outlined in legislation over a 5-year \nperiod. Farmers can look at that. They can make judgments about what is \nbest for their own farm operation, what the market conditions are, so \nthat they can make decisions based on what is best for them at that \nfarm in that crop year, given their own economic conditions as to what \nthey will do. They will not lose benefits because they make a decision \nto change the crop they are planting. They would under the old law. If \nyou do not plant that same crop that you are eligible for, you lose \nyour eligibility for any assistance from the Government.\n  And another thing. If you do not make a crop, you cannot put any crop \nin the loan. You cannot put an empty basket under the loan program that \nthe Democrats are trying to resurrect. So if you would--like you have \nin southern Georgia--have crop losses, and you just plowed up a field, \nand you did not even try to harvest it because it was burned up, \nincreasing the loan rate would not help you--not a bit.\n  So my point is, the Democrats' plan is not all that it is cracked up \nto be. It is more an expression of frustration. And I sympathize with \nthe frustration in many parts of the country. It is an effort to grasp \nat some straw in the wind and hold out the hope that this is going to \nmake everything right.\n  We are doing a very workmanlike job, in my view, of bringing together \nall of the different problems in agriculture and trying to design a \nprogram of benefits and assistance that helps farmers make it to the \nnext year, helps compensate them to the extent that some will be spared \ngoing into bankruptcy or having to sell their farms at a forced sale. \nAnd it is that bad in some areas.\n  We think this is a balanced approach, not only for this disaster \nassistance program that is funded in this bill to the extent of $4.2 \nbillion. That is in addition to all the other transition payments that \nwe are providing under the existing law. And an option to obtain an \naccelerated payment of next year's market transition payment, that is \navailable now in October because of a bill that was passed just \nrecently.\n  We think the bill itself, the entire conference report, justifies the \nsupport of this Senate and an overwhelming vote to approve it and to \nsend it to the President.\n  Before I yield the floor, Mr. President, I want to point out that \nthis is just one aspect of what is being done or what is attempted to \nbe done by this Congress to help the outlook for farming in America and \nin agriculture. Our economy--that is one of the most successful of any \nsectors of our economy in terms of its ability to export, to generate \nincome for people not just on the farm but at the store, driving trucks \nin the transportation system, the inputs that go into production \nagriculture, the equipment that is purchased, the seeds, all the rest \nthat go into this giant part of our economy--is very important to our \ncountry.\n  We generate a positive trade balance. I think this year it is going \nto be almost $20 billion in trade surplus. This is comparing the amount \nand the value of exports with imports of agriculture and food products.\n  The House just recently passed a tax bill, reported out of the House \nWays and Means Committee. It was my hope that we could take that bill \nup here and pass it in the Senate, because it delivers to farmers and \nfarm families some new tax benefits that can help them in this time of \ncrisis on the farm and would be good policy changes for the future, one \nof which permits a 5-year carryback of operating losses. Another makes \npermanent the income averaging provision of the more recent tax bill \nthat was signed into law. Another accelerates the phasing in of \nexemptions of inheritance tax and gift tax for small businesses and \nfarms. That is very helpful to farmers and farm families.\n  Another provides 100 percent deductibility of the costs of self-\nemployed health insurance, health insurance for those people who work \nfor themselves. In the past, they weren't able to deduct the costs of \nthat health insurance.\n  Under the bill that was reported out of the House Ways and Means \nCommittee and passed by the other body, the total costs of that premium \ncould be deducted from income tax. We should make that the law now. \nFarmers need that now. Farm families need that benefit now.\n  Because of a threat by the Democrat minority, we can't call that bill \nup. We are told there will be an objection. And if a motion is made to \nproceed to consider the House bill, 60 votes would be required to shut \noff debate on the motion to proceed. So that bill is unlikely to be \nconsidered by the Senate, we are told, because of those objections and \nthat resistance. Again the President said, ``If you pass it, I will \nveto that.''\n  So farmers ought to know where the problem is. They are being told \nwith big speeches out here and a lot of charts that the Democrats are \nthe farmers' best friend. The evidence is piling up on the other side \nof that argument. I think it is going to become very, very clear that \nthat is not the case.\n  Here is another example. We have been told that American agriculture \nis suffering right now--unfairness in the international marketplace. \nPeople are erecting barriers to trade while we are trying to sell more \nin the market or break into a new market for agriculture products and \nfoodstuffs, that we are running into barriers of one kind or another, \nand that the importation of certain foodstuff--cattle, wheat--from \nCanada violates existing rules of fair trade in this hemisphere. For \nmonths, the administration has done absolutely nothing that I know of \nto try to deal with that situation.\n\n[[Page S11549]]\n\n  One thing they asked last year of the Congress was to enact fast-\ntrack negotiating authority for the administration so agreements to \nadjust these problems, to resolve the difficulties, could be negotiated \nand worked out. Congress would make a commitment that if fair \nagreements were worked out we would take them up under fast-track \nprocedures and vote them up or down. So the Speaker of the House, as we \nwere working to put together the disaster assistance program, agreed he \nwould call up the fast-track authority legislation in the House for a \nvote; the Senate has acted. The House couldn't pass it because the \nDemocrats wouldn't vote for it. A huge number of Democrats voted \nagainst it. The President, apparently without the ability to lead on \nthat issue in the House, couldn't turn out the votes to pass the \nlegislation he said was important, he said was needed to help \nagriculture. The Republican leadership called it up and most of them \nvoted for it.\n  I am suggesting that is another example of a problem that we have \nhere in the government. I am not trying to put this into a partisan \ndebate to say that the Republicans are right on everything and the \nDemocrats are wrong; but I am pointing out these facts that exist in \nthe context of trying to do something to help farmers and help \nagriculture.\n  Most people live outside the United States, and if the growth is \ngoing to be achieved in agriculture sales and we are going to see \nincreases in incomes and prices, we are going to have to sell more of \nwhat we produce in the export market. Mr. President, 95 percent of the \npeople in this world live outside the United States. It is that area of \nthe world where the population is growing the fastest. The needs are \ngreater for foodstuffs.\n  I hope, as Senators look at this problem and try to decide whether we \nare doing the right thing or not by approving this bill, they will \nrecognize we can't solve every problem that this sector has in one \nbill. But this is a very positive step toward dealing with the real \ncrisis that exists out there in agriculture today. I am hopeful that \nthe Senate will vote for this conference report and that we will have a \nresounding vote to overturn and override the President's veto, if he \ninsists on continuing down this path. It is wrong. It is not justified. \nI hope he will change his mind.\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from Idaho such time as he may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me join with my chairman, Senator Thad \nCochran, chairman of the Agricultural Appropriations Subcommittee, who \nspoke with a certain amount of frustration in his voice just a few \nmoments ago. He has every reason to be frustrated.\n  This chairman has bent over backwards in the last 6 months trying to \nunderstand and address the agricultural crisis that is now upon \nAmerica's production agriculture. He has joined with us--those of us \nhere in the Senate who come from strong agricultural States--at every \nstep along the way to see how we could resolve this under current \npolicy. I don't blame his frustration.\n  I came to the floor just a few moments ago to announce that the \nPresident is in town for the full week for the first time in a good \nmany weeks, and the first thing he says is that he is going to veto the \nagriculture appropriations bill. I am critical of this President. Mr. \nPresident, wake up. You haven't had a position on agriculture your \nentire term in office. Now you say, ``I'm going to veto,'' at a time \nwhen this Congress has worked collectively, on a very strong bipartisan \nvote on the House side just last week, 333 House Members, Democrat and \nRepublican, on the very issue that we have on the floor now that the \nchairman has spoken to and that we will vote on this afternoon.\n  I am not quite sure why he is doing that. I suggested this morning \nthat maybe it was a bit of ``Wag the Dog.'' I don't want to make \naccusations, but why isn't he helping us, working with us to resolve \nthis, rather than simply addressing it with a veto threat.\n  What has the bill to offer production agriculture? For the last \nseveral days, we have laid out the amount of money that is being spent \nthat will go directly to farmers to offset the market losses that they \nhave experienced, the very real and dramatic declines in commodity \nprices that are going to place some of our very good farmers and \nranchers in bankruptcy. We want to be sensitive to that. This Congress \nis being sensitive to that with a $4.2 billion package. Payments \ndirectly to farmers who have experienced natural disasters--$1.5 \nbillion for that--who through no fault of their own, have lost their \ncrops; market loss payments, reflective of what has gone on in the \nPacific Rim and the loss of markets there, payments of about $1.65 \nbillion, directly down through to the farmer and the rancher; a \nmultiple-year losses program of about $675 million; livestock feed \nassistance for those areas that were ``droughted'' out who obviously \nproduced no feed for their livestock this year and are having to reach \nwell outside their barriers and pay premium price for hay to be brought \nin; and, of course, emergency-related aid of about $200 million. This \nbill is very sensitive to the needs of production agriculture.\n  What is the debate really about? Why would the President want to veto \na bill that provides so much at a time of true need to production \nagriculture? As I said, it could be a ``Wag the Dog'' problem, but more \nimportantly it is probably a debate over significant problems.\n  We--Republicans--believe, and I think American agriculture supports a \nrecognition that farmers ought to be farming to the market. The Freedom \nto Farm bill reflected that and we made significant change to policy. \nWe also said government has a responsibility to break down the \npolitical barriers that the chairman spoke about to expand world trade, \nand yet the tools to do that are rusting down in the toolshed at USDA \nbecause they have failed to use them. Throughout the time this crisis \nwas growing, not one kernel of grain was purchased for humanitarian \npurposes. Yet, the Secretary had the tools to do it. The Secretary had \nthe tools to enhance trade for the purpose of moving the product that \nwas stored out there on America's farms, or in America's granaries. \nYet, that didn't happen. And now, all of a sudden, when we are trying \nto shape some form of aid to get us through this cropping season and \nkeep what American farmers say is a good farm policy in place, the \nPresident takes time off from his world travels and his campaign \nfundraising events to say, ``I am going to veto this bill.''\n\n  Mr. President, I hope you will study it a bit and change your mind, \nbecause if you think you are going to use an additional $3 billion or \n$4 billion from the surplus that you want to put in Social Security to \nsave Social Security, think again. It isn't necessary and it isn't \nneeded, and I don't think this Congress is willing to provide it. Those \nare the realities with which we are dealing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. CRAIG. With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, how much time do those in opposition \nhave?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Does the manager know whether or not others are going \nto come over on our side?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. If the Senator will yield, I think other Senators want \nto speak, but not right now. We have another hour, from 2:15 to 3:15, \nthat will be available for debate. So as long as you see no competition \non your side of the aisle, you have it all to yourself.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, I had a chance to speak yesterday and I don't want to \nreally repeat the arguments I made yesterday. I do not intend to vote \nfor this bill today, but I think that by the end of the week, or at \nleast I am hopeful, we will be able to resolve our differences and pass \na farm relief bill that will do the job--or at least will be a huge \nhelp for family farmers in Minnesota and across the country.\n  Mr. President, the President of the United States indicated on \nSaturday that the farm relief bill--this bill that we are looking at \nright now, which we will be voting on--is inadequate. He\n\n[[Page S11550]]\n\nhas said that more will need to be done with farm relief. It will have \nto be improved before he can sign an Agriculture appropriations bill. I \nam hopeful that either following the veto of this bill, or as part of \nthe negotiations --and I think I have a different view from my \ncolleague from Idaho, I am not sure--as part of the negotiations on the \nemergency supplemental packages, which may be included in an omnibus \nappropriations bill, we will see an improved version of this farm \nrelief package.\n  I said yesterday to my colleague from Mississippi, Senator Cochran, I \nmuch appreciate the work he has done. We have come a significant way \nfrom where we were. This is a $4 billion relief package. I think that \ngiven the position the President has taken --and as a Senator from \nMinnesota, I have certainly requested that he take this position; I \nhave said I hope he will veto this bill or wait until we get some kind \nof relief package that I think would do a better job. I have to \ncontinue to fight as long and as hard as I can for family farmers in my \nState, for what I think will be most helpful to them. Frankly, I \nbelieve that given the Senators who are dealing with this question on \nboth sides of the aisle--we all care fiercely about agriculture, and I \nthink we have an understanding about it--I don't see any reason why, by \nthe end of this week, given the position the President has taken, we \ncan't have some really strenuous, but I think substantive, negotiations \nand come up with a much better relief package.\n  Now, this relief package that my colleague, Senator Cochran, brings \nto the floor of the Senate is a credible effort. But I think it is \ninsufficient. There is an inadequate amount of money, and I think it \nutilizes the wrong mechanism to deliver the assistance that is meant to \naddress the price crisis. Let me just be clear about what is at issue \nhere. Surely, given the position the President is taking, which is the \nposition that the Senator from Minnesota and many other Midwestern \nSenators asked him to take, which is to make it clear that he will veto \nthis bill unless there are negotiations and we can get a better \npackage.\n  Why have we taken this position? Well, our proposal, $7 billion-plus, \nand the proposal we have before us on the floor of the Senate are \nsimilar in that both include between $2 billion and $2.5 billion for \nindemnity assistance for crop loss. This is an increase from the \noriginal $500 million, which many of us worked very hard to include in \nthe original Senate bill. It is not surprising. There are a whole lot \nof people who have really been hit hard and who need the help.\n  The Republican package, however, that is before us also contains an \nadditional $1.7 billion. So there is agreement on the indemnity part. \nWe went from $500 million to $2 billion to $2.5 billion. The Republican \npackage also contains about $1.7 billion to address the price crisis. \nThe way they deliver this assistance is through a supplemental or bonus \ntransition payment, and that is where there is a big disagreement. The \nprices for our major commodities, such as wheat, corn and soybeans, are \n15 to 30 percent below the 5-year market average. Our $5 billion \nproposal to address the price crisis--where there is the difference \nhere--would lift the current caps on the loan rate and raise those loan \nrates about 57 cents a bushel for wheat, about 28 cents a bushel for \ncorn, and over 20 cents a bushel for soybeans. This would not only \nimmediately boost farm income for the farmers of these commodities, but \nin raising the loan rate, it also has a beneficial effect on market \nprices. It tends to lift them up. That is why I think our proposal is \nsuperior.\n  Mr. President, I worry about these transition payments because I \nthink there are a couple of problems with them. First of all, these \npayments are based on the old farm program's historic yields. Farmers \nsuch as traditional soybean farmers, who never had a program based on \nthe old program, don't get any of these AMTA payments. That is one huge \nproblem. On the other hand, it is possible for some people who might \nnot even have planted a crop to receive them because the Freedom to \nFarm--or what I call the ``Freedom to Fail''--payments are completely \nunconnected to production or price.\n  I have to tell you, that is the key issue. That is the key \ndifference. At the very minimum, in dealing with the price crisis, we \nought to make sure that the payments are connected to production and \nprice. So what we have here in this bill is the wrong mechanism for \naddressing the price crisis. Our proposal would lift the cap on the \nloan rates. I think there can be negotiation. The President is correct \nin vetoing this bill if that is what is required to get better \nassistance. Thousands of family farmers across the country could go out \nof business due to conditions that are beyond their control. In \nMinnesota, up to 20 percent of our family farmers are threatened. Now, \nthe other part of this is that the Democratic proposal for the State of \nMinnesota is worth about an additional one-quarter of a billion \ndollars.\n  I ask the Chair, has 20 minutes expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twelve minutes remain.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The proposal is worth an additional one-quarter of a \nbillion dollars for agriculture in Minnesota, for rural Minnesota, for \nwhat we call ``greater Minnesota.'' It is no small amount of money, \nespecially when you consider the multiplier effect in our communities.\n  So I say to my colleague, Senator Cochran from Mississippi, this is a \nstart. I am going to vote against this. The President has said he is \ngoing to veto it unless there is further negotiation. I think we can do \nbetter. I don't like the rider that basically continues another 6 \nmonths with the dairy compact. I have dairy farmers in my State who are \ngoing under because of very unfair pricing mechanisms.\n\n  In addition, I emphasis again, we are in agreement when it comes to \ncrop losses, disaster, people who didn't have the insurance because of \nwet weather, scab disease or whatever. We are not in agreement on the \nprice.\n  There are two problems. The main one is at the very minimum you have \nto target the price, whatever you do by way of dealing with low prices. \nYou have to make sure that the payments are connected to the production \nof the price. Too many of these transition payments go to landowners, \nand not necessarily producers. I don't think that makes a lot of sense. \nSome, like soybean growers, won't be helped at all.\n  I think we can do better on the price part. I think we have to do \nbetter if this relief package is going to do the job. I think we have \nsome differences out here. They are honestly held differences. All of \nus care about agriculture. All of us know what the economic and \npersonal pain is out there in the countryside.\n  Some are quite often critical of some of the President's policies, \nbut I thank him for exerting strong leadership on this question and for \nmaking it clear that surely this week in negotiations we can do better. \nWe can come up with an even better package.\n  My colleague from Mississippi brings a package out here that is an \nimportant start. We are going to get the job done by the end of the \nweek or by next week. We are going to get the job done. We are going to \nhave a relief package, because we have to, because that is why we are \nhere. I believe we can do that through the negotiations that are to \ncome.\n\n\n                            bison inspection\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with \nmy good friend from Vermont, Senator Leahy regarding an issue that \nimpacts bison ranchers nationwide as well as in both of our States.\n  It is my understanding that the U.S. Department of Agriculture has \ntaken major steps during the past year to ensure that our country's \nfood supply is as safe as possible. USDA requires all firms that wish \nto sell meat to USDA and other Federal agencies to comply with newly \nadopted regulations known as HACCP.\n  It is also my understanding that the beef, pork, and poultry \nindustries are provided USDA inspection at no cost, and that ranchers \nwho raise American bison must pay a steep fee to USDA for inspection at \nslaughter and inspection of products to be sold to USDA. These costs \nexceed $40 per hour, per inspector, both for inspection at slaughter \nand at further processing.\n  I would like to ask my colleague on the Agricultural Appropriations \nSubcommittee, Senator Leahy, whether he\n\n[[Page S11551]]\n\nwould agree with me that USDA should explore what impact inspection \nfees has on the bison industry?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes, I do agree.\n  It is my understanding that USDA collects substantial fees from those \nbison ranchers and processing firms for Federal inspection. It is my \nunderstanding that this fee is set yearly by USDA and that it is \napproximately $41 per hour. I believe that these fees directly impact \nthousands of small ranchers who belong to the National Bison \nAssociation.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Would the Senator further support asking Secretary \nGlickman to report back this next year on ways in which USDA might \nlower the inspection fees to help strengthen the U.S. bison industry.\n  Mr. LEAHY. We have bison ranchers in my state and in every other \nState in the country. I agree with the Senator that while we are \nlooking for policies and programs that help small farmers and ranchers, \nwe look carefully at all other actions that could make a difference. I \nbelieve that the issue of inspection fees charged bison producers \nshould be explored by the Department of Agriculture, and that the \nDepartment should provide us with their analysis of this impact early \nin 1999.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator for his comments.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, on March 28, 1996, Congress passed the \nFederal Agricultural Improvement and Reform Act, most commonly referred \nto as the farm bill. This comprehensive, forward looking legislation \nprovides U.S. agriculture the free market principles that our farmers \nand ranchers requested and desired. Government no longer dictates to \nfarmers how much to plant, when to plant, when to buy, or when to sell. \nThe farm bill provides the flexibility, predictability, and simplicity \nthat our farmers and ranchers asked for from their government.\n  In the past few months, agriculture in the United States has been \nimpacted by chaotic world markets, natural disasters, and disease. \nThese occurrences are not the result of the Farm Bill, but without a \ndoubt have impacted the prices paid for U.S. commodities. As a member \nof the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, I had the opportunity \nto review and subsequently pass a disaster package as part of the \nFiscal Year 1999 Agriculture Appropriations Conference Report. This \npackage includes relief for those farmers who experienced one or all \nthree of the aforementioned occurrences.\n  The Pacific Northwest is experiencing misfortune that is not weather \nor disease related, but market related. Producers in the State of \nWashington rely heavily on international trade. Wheat growers in the \nstate export approximately 85 percent of their crop. Our apple and \nminor crop industries rely heavily on Asia as an export market. When \nworld markets collapse, so too does the price paid for each of these \ncommodities.\n  The disaster package which is included in the conference report \nprovides some relief for growers in Washington state. However, because \na bulk of the assistance provided in the package will benefit farmers \nin the mid-west states, I voted with Senator Burns to increase the \nrelief plan by $610 million. Although this plan was defeated, I believe \nthe overall package is adequate and a necessary starting point for \nrecharging the cash flow to the family farm. This package, combined \nwith the Agriculture Market Transition Act payments farmers will \nreceive in October and December of this year, and the loan deficiency \npayments for program crops totals over $17 billion in cash payments for \n1998 and 1999.\n  Because Pacific Northwest agriculture is so trade dependent, I \nbelieve we must focus on expanding trade and gaining new markets. In \nthis arena, I fear that the administration's silence has been \ndeafening.\n  Two weeks ago the House defeated the bill to provide the President \nfast track-trade negotiating authority. Unfortunately, a wounded \nPresident and a weak Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture \nfailed to convince our colleagues the importance of passing this \nlegislation. With one in four jobs in the State of Washington directly \nrelated to trade, and with agriculture being the State's number one \nemployer, the passage of fast track was essential.\n  Just last week I made a statement regarding the administration's \ntrade policy with China. Finally, a member of the Administration \ncommented on the inability of the President to make headway with \nChina's protectionist position. The Undersecretary of International \nTrade at the Department of Commerce admitted that U.S. trade policy \nwith China is flawed and that the Administration's policy of \n`engagement' has not moved China toward free trade practices.\n  China claims that wheat from our region is inflicted with a disease \ncalled TCK smut. At the bipartisan request of many Senators from the \nPacific Northwest, the President was asked to discuss this bogus \nphytosanitary concern with Chinese President Jiang Zemin. The President \npersonally met with President Zemin twice in the last two years, but \nthe Pacific Northwest wheat industry remains locked out of another \npotential, enormous market.\n  As a border state of Canada, Washington has encountered many trade \ndiscrepancies with our Northern counterparts. The beef trade between \nWashington and Canada has evoked bad feelings and more recently \ntensions escalated. Just two days ago, United States Trade \nRepresentative Charlene Barshefsky and Agriculture Secretary Dan \nGlickman announced their intention to begin intensive negotiations to \nresolve some of the restrictive trade practices utilized by Canada. \nWhile I applaud the Administration for taking this action, it is \nunfortunate that it comes only after ranchers in bordering States began \nblockading Canadian farm shipments. Agriculture trade relations have \nbeen thorny with Canada for quite some time, and many believe that the \nAdministration's inability to support and defend the U.S. beef and \nwheat industries in negotiations with Canada have left agriculture with \nthe short end of the stick. We are consistently being out-witted by the \nCanadian trade negotiators and the farmers and ranchers in this country \nare expected to pick up the pieces.\n  These are just a few of the Administration's trade policies which \ndirectly impact the bottom line of farmers in the State of Washington. \nWhile I recognize and empathize with the family farm at a time when \ncash flow is sparse, I do not support the President or the \nAdministration in its threats to veto the Agriculture Appropriations \nbill because the disaster package is not to their liking.\n  There are several items that in addition to this disaster package, \nAMTA payments, and LDP payments which deserve attention. While \nexpansion of trade is of obvious importance to the State of Washington \nand is certainly a long-term goal, regulatory relief, tax relief, \nadequate funding for agriculture research, and deductibility of health \ninsurance for the self-employed are immediate mechanisms to provide \nassistance to the family farm. Unfortunately, the vehicles providing \nthis relief--the Interior appropriations bill and the House passed tax \npackage--are also under the threat of a Presidential veto.\n  Mr. President, the Agriculture appropriations bill is a constructive \npiece of legislation that deserves our support. While the unfortunate \npolitics of partisanship has appeared to weigh heavily on this \nlegislation, I sincerely hope that the Administration would remember \nthe family farm and the longevity of production agriculture in this \ncountry and sign the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if ironies were flowers the area inside the \nWashington beltway would be covered with fields of flowers sprouting \nout of every square inch of land.\n  I am surprised that many of the same Senators who say they want \nfarmers to receive higher income for what they produce strongly oppose \nthe same for other farmers if the product is not produced in their home \nstates.\n  Many Senators have recently spoken on the floor about the disaster \nfacing their farmers. Some have likened it to losses caused by natural \ndisasters such as Hurricanes. Regarding this farm disaster, their \nbiggest concern is the huge loss in farm income. The culprit this time \nis low prices and the loss of farm income.\n  In speech after speech many complain that their farmers face low \nprices--and thus low income. And, as is so often said, farmers do not \nwant welfare they want higher income for their\n\n[[Page S11552]]\n\nlabors. These Senators assert that farmers do not just want a handout--\nthey want higher prices so they can earn an reasonable income and stay \nin business.\n  Whether the commodity is wheat, soybeans, corn, or other feedgrains \nwe hear time and time again that prices are too low--and thus their \nfarmers may go out of business.\n  There is a sense of great panic in the farm community. It is real. I \nam advised that farm income in some areas has been reduced by 98 \npercent. I have been moved by many of the compelling descriptions of \nthe agony faced by these farm families. I am concerned about this even \nthough my home state of Vermont is not as directly affected.\n  Thomas Paine made an interesting comment about these situations which \nis still as true today as is was in 1776. He said: ``Panics, in some \ncases, have their uses. . . . their peculiar advantage is, that they \nare the touchstone of sincerity and hypocrisy, and bring things and men \nto light, which might otherwise have lain forever undiscovered.''\n  There is indeed a touch of hypocrisy in this crisis. Some, including \nsome at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, see the loan deficiency \npayments as a great solution. If prices drop below a target price the \nfarmers get the difference between their market price and this target \nprice. If prices increase above a certain level then the farmers cannot \nreceive this cash payment. Recently I twice voted for these proposals \nalong with every Democratic Senator save one.\n  I do think this approach is a good idea and I hope in the end it is \nincluded in any continuing resolution we work out. It is important that \nany income relief in the resolution be targeted to 1998 year crop \nproduction and that it go to producers, not mere landowners.\n  Many strongly support this approach for commodities produced by their \nfarmers. However, if the benefit is to be provided to farmers not \nproducing their commodities some turn a deaf ear. This is an \nunfortunate irony--some will not listen to the very arguments they use \nto support additional income to their farmers if other commodities are \ninvolved. I voted for their solution even though it is of little \nbenefit to my home state of Vermont. Turning a deaf ear toward farm \nproblems in other areas of the country raises a lot of concerns.\n  The Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact is the perfect example. The \nmajor benefit of the compact is to provide income to farmers when milk \nprices are low--income is not provided to farmers when prices rise past \na certain point. The amount of the payment a farmer gets depends on how \nfar milk prices are below the target price. You could simply repeat \nthose two sentences but substitute the word ``corn,'' ``soybeans'' or \n``wheat,'' or whichever commodity, for ``milk'' and you have described \nhow the loan deficiency payment system works.\n  Many certainly want this benefit for their commodities. Some Senators \nwould rather their farmers get a check for increased ``freedom to farm \npayments'' instead of cash payments called loan deficiency payments. In \nthis way these Senators provide cash to feedgrains producers to make up \nfor the fact that farm prices are so low. Either way, almost all \nSenators want farmers to receive some additional cash payments. And \nfarms families deserve this.\n  But try to apply this system to milk prices and many Members of \nCongress and some in the Administration say ``no.''\n  This is a major issue for me since more than 70 percent of all farm \nincome in my state is from dairy. Vermont is first in the nation in \nterms of the relative importance of dairy to total farm income. This is \nwhy the Compact is crucial to me.\n  Dairy farmers like other farmers work hard--milking cows early in the \nmorning, moving cows around to pasture, feeding them, worrying about \nveterinary bills. I wish we could all work together on this matter--all \nareas of the country--and support farm income for all producers.\n  I freely admit that the Compact does give dairy farmers a lot more \nincome when prices are low. It is supposed to do that--just like loan \ndeficiency payments. We are not concealing the fact that during the \nfirst 6 months of operation OMB reported that ``New England dairy farm \nincome rose by an estimated $22-27 million . . . .''\n  Several Senators from the Upper Midwest insisted that OMB do a study \non the effects of the Compact. The OMB report is called the ``The \nEconomic Effects of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact.'' I will be \nquoting a lot from that study that those Senators wanted in this floor \nstatement.\n  As a little background, the Interstate Dairy Compact Commission with \n26 delegates appointed by the six governors is authorized to determine \na ``target price''--$16.94/cwt in this case. Under the Compact language \napproved by the six states any state can opt-out temporarily--until a \nlater date that the state determines--or opt-in and receive that \nadditional income for producers. The Compact is voluntary, it is up to \neach state.\n  As I just pointed out in this respect, when prices are low the effect \nof the Compact is similar to the loan deficiency payments made under \nmarketing loan programs in that, roughly speaking, producers get the \ndifference between a ``capped'' target amount and the current price. \nWhen farm prices are high, no cash payments are made to producers under \nthe Compact.\n  Why is this additional income for dairy farmers as justifiable as \nadditional income--whether in the form of loan deficiency payments or \nincreased freedom to farm payments--for feedgrain farmers? The answer \nis simple--it keeps their families on the farm. All farmers deserve to \nearn a decent income for their families.\n  This additional income to farmers in New England based on the Compact \nhas kept farmers in business. For example, news articles have focused \non how in Connecticut and Vermont the rate of farm loss is much less \nthan before the Compact went into effect. Before the Compact, OMB \nreports that New England suffered a ``20-percent decline'' in the \nnumber of farms with milk cows from 1990 to 1996. Now, this horrible \nrate of attrition has stopped. I wish other states could also stop \ntheir loss of farm families. I have supported reasonable efforts to \nkeep family farmers in business throughout our country and will insist \non that in any continuing resolution.\n  It is clear that efforts to keep dairy farmers in business will \nbecome more critical over time since, as OMB reports, ``the Farm Bill \nalso calls for the termination of many elements of USDA's current dairy \nprogram by January 2000.'' Also, dairy producers do not receive any so-\ncalled ``freedom to farm payments\" for milk production and the milk \nsupport program will be terminated in the year 2000.\n  Also, since dairy farmers sell a perishable fluid product that needs \nrefrigeration they are not able to hold product off the market until \nthey can get a better price. Feedgrains can be and are stored to get a \nbetter price--indeed the government will even give you a loan based on \nthe value of the grain you are storing. This provides farmers with cash \nto pay bills--this program is not available regarding the production of \nmilk.\n  Of course, by taking this grain off the market this can have the \neffect of increasing grain prices. FAPRI has provided Congress with \ninformation on these anticipated increases in grain prices based on the \nmarketing loan program.\n  One disadvantage to increasing the caps in marketing loan programs, \nor increasing freedom to farm payments, is that it costs taxpayers a \nbundle--in this case several billion dollars. I voted for the marketing \nloan proposals twice because I think it is worth it to increase farm \nincome in Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Missouri and a \nnumber of other states. While marketing loan programs do not benefit \nNew England dairy farmers, I have always felt that farmers should stick \ntogether and help each other out. I wish more Members of Congress felt \nthat way.\n  I am very willing to work with my Colleagues from the Upper Midwest \nto try to figure a way so that all of us can work together. But I will \ninsist on one thing--that our goal should be to protect income for \ndairy farmers and to keep farmers in business. I do have some ideas \nthat I think we can all agree upon and want to sit down with my \nColleagues from the Upper Midwest, and around the country, to work \nsomething out.\n  I will support reasonable programs that benefit their farmers, as I \ndo\n\n[[Page S11553]]\n\nfarmers in others states and as I do for other commodities.\n  As long as I am on the subject of the Compact I want to make a few \nadditional points about how well it is working.\n  First, I want to thank many of the Members of Congress who want to \nsupport farm income for all farmers--not just farmers producing \nfeedgrains. I am very pleased that the Compact will get a short \nextension in the appropriations bill. Some opponents have begun \ncomplaining that it is included in the Agriculture Appropriations bill. \nIt was included in the House bill and is now included in the Conference \nReport.\n  I am very pleased with this since the 1996 farm bill created a three-\nyear Compact pilot project for the Northeast. However, long delays in \nimplementing the Compact by USDA have cut that three-year period down \nto less than two years. That is not what the Congress had in mind when \nit passed a three-year time period in 1996. I am pleased that this \nAppropriations Bill will extend the Compact at least until September \n30, 1999, so that the Congress can find out how well it has served \nfarmers. Even with this extension, the time-period is less than \nCongress set forth in 1996.\n  It is interesting that one of my distinguished Colleagues blasted the \nCompact on the Senate floor by saying that dairy farmers have not seen \npositive benefits as a result of the compact. What surprises me about \nthis statement is that most dairy farmers would say that a significant \nincrease in their income over a six-month period was a ``positive \nbenefit.''\n  Maybe things are different in the Upper Midwest but New England \nfarmers like this increase in income and consider higher income a \npositive benefit. It could be that since New England only produces \nthree percent of the fluid milk in the nation that an increase of $22 \nmillion to $27 million in income over a six month period, according to \nOMB, is not considered large by Upper Midwest standards.\n  I also disagree with the complaint that under the Compact ``consumers \nhave been hurt by higher prices.'' OMB has an answer for that which \nproves the value of the Compact. OMB reported after an initial increase \nin prices at some stores just as the Compact was implemented that: \n``New England retail milk prices by December [the sixth month after \nimplementation] returned to the historical relationship to national \nlevels, being about $0.05 per gallon lower.''\n  So, OMB has concluded that consumer milk prices are lower in New \nEngland than the rest of the nation. I would like to repeat that--\nconsumer prices in New England with the Compact are lower than national \nlevels. I would encourage a study to check out that relationship now--I \nam very confident that prices in New England are still lower than the \nrest of the nation.\n  The Connecticut Agriculture Commissioner Shirley Ferris reports, ``In \nJune of 1997, the month before the Compact took effect, the average \nretail price for a gallon of whole milk was $2.72. This June, almost a \nyear after the Compact took effect, the price for a gallon of whole \nmilk is only $2.73. And the price of a gallon of 1% milk is even less \nexpensive now than before the Compact--$.03 less per gallon than last \nJune.''\n  Consumer milk prices, as economists had predicted, are lower in the \nCompact region than the average for the nation.\n  Another interesting assertion--that milk consumption has dropped in \nthe compact region--was made on the Senate floor recently. This is most \nodd since national data shows that the rate of milk consumption has \ndropped more in the rest of the nation than in the Compact region.\n  According to the most recent A.C. Neilson Corporation marketing \nresearch data, U.S. gallon sales of fluid milk are down 1.8 percent \ncompared to one year ago. New England gallon sales of fluid milk, \nhowever, have decreased by only 0.7 percent. National sales of fluid \nmilk have declined 1.1 percent more than New England sales of fluid \nmilk.\n  In another assertion it was said that ``The only real winners have \nbeen the largest industrial dairies of the Upper Northeast.'' First of \nall, I am not certain if the use of Upper refers to Maine. Second, I am \nnot certain what the ``largest industrial dairies'' means since our \nplants are so small compared to the Upper Midwest.\n  And third, under the Compact, and as confirmed by the OMB study, it \nis the producers of milk, the farmers, who get the increase in income \nunder the Compact. If anyone doubts that the dairy farmers in New \nEngland did not get increased pay checks someone should randomly call \nthem on the phone and see if they really got the checks. I certainly \nhave not heard complaints that the paychecks were lost in the mails.\n  My distinguished Colleague also said that the Compact puts \n``traditional dairy farms'' outside the region ``at a competitive \ndisadvantage.'' OMB reports just the opposite. But again, you do not \nneed an OMB report. Simply pick up the phone and call some dairy \nproducers who live near the Compact region. They are selling milk into \nthe region to take advantage of the Compact. If Wisconsin or Minnesota \nswitched places with New York State, farmers in Wisconsin and Minnesota \nwould do the same--sell into the Compact region to make more income.\n  While I do not know for sure, I suspect that dairy producers in \nWisconsin and Minnesota would like more income for all their hard \nlabor. Vermont dairy farmers and neighboring New York dairy farmers \nsure do.\n  OMB reports there has been ``an increase in milk shipments into New \nEngland equal to 8 percent.'' This is not surprising since neighboring \nproducers get higher prices for their milk in the compact region.\n  Except for this benefit for neighboring farmers living just outside \nthe Compact region, OMB reported that ``New England has little effect \non dairy markets outside its region, or on national prices or trends. . \n. . Its shipments outside the region in the form of cheese or milk are \nsmall.''\n  Opponents of the Compact have constantly repeated that it would be a \n``trade barrier'' on sales into New England. I could point to many \nstatements to this effect on the floor.\n  I predicted before the Compact was implemented, on the other hand, \nthat since the law required that anyone could sell into the region and \nsince the law required that these sellers get the benefit of the \nCompact, that there would be increased sales into the region.\n  I was correct--and the evidence reported by OMB shows that \nneighboring farmers get the benefit of the higher Compact price and \nthus there has been an increase of sales into the region of 8 percent.\n  This Compact has thus increased trade. Something that increases trade \nis not usually called a trade barrier.\n  As an interesting footnote OMB reports that the Compact commission \ndecided to provide additional money for New England WIC programs so \nthat more eligible infants, children and pregnant women would be able \nto participate than would have participated without the Compact. The \nOMB report states that the ``Compact could support a small increase in \nparticipation during the demonstration period.'' The Commission has \nrecently decided to provide additional funding to the school lunch \nprograms.\n  I also want to address the surplus production issue. As background, \nnote that if New England regional milk production decreases less--or \nincreases more--than the national rate, the farm bill requires that the \nCommission reimburse the federal government for the cost of Commodity \nCredit Corporation purchases of any ``surplus production'' that might \noccur.\n  This year the Commission will pay a reimbursement as determined by \nthe Secretary. Very favorable conditions in New England and low \nfeedgrain prices and very unfavorable weather conditions throughout \nmuch of the rest of the country created this shift even though there \nwas decrease--2,000 fewer--in cows milked from April to June 1998.\n  As these relatively very unfavorable weather conditions in the rest \nof the country subside I expect that New England's rate of production \nwill once again grow at a lower rate than the rest of the country--\nespecially with the drop in cows milked in New England. Also note that \nalmost all of the CCC purchases were of milk product from other regions \nof the country.\n  To provide some perspective, I also wanted to mention that OMB \nreports that in 1996, ``New England accounted for 2.93 percent of the \nNation's milk\n\n[[Page S11554]]\n\nproduction and 2.9 percent of its milk cows.''\n  As the OMB report shows if other states had a dairy compact, farmers \nin those states could receive a significant increase in income. So why \nare some supporting billions' worth of increases in payments to farmers \nproducing nondairy commodities but are opposed to increases in farm \nincome to dairy farmers?\n  The answer is easy. Sir Walter Scott knew many years ago that: ``Oh, \nwhat a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive.''\n  Corporate opponents of the Compact have tried to argue that this was \na fight between consumers and farmers. The OMB study proves that \nconsumer prices are lower in New England than the average for the rest \nof the country. So that is a false argument.\n  The fight is actually between large manufacturers of milk products--\nlarge multinational corporations--and farmers. Manufacturers of any \nproduct, not just manufacturers of cheese or ice cream, want to buy \ntheir inputs as cheaply as possible.\n  How do we know that? As with the answers to many questions all you \nhave to do is follow the money. Who is buying ads and time to distort \nthe truth? Who is staffing up to fight the Compact? And who mostly \nwants the Compact defeated?\n  It certainly isn't farmers in areas that border the Compact region. \nThey take advantage of the Compact's open invitation to trade--and make \nmore money selling into the Compact region.\n  It certainly isn't consumers since they get lower prices than the \naverage for the rest of the nation. It certainly isn't farmers living \nin the region since they have gotten a significant boost in farm \nincome.\n  To find out the answer one just has to look at lobbying reports that \nhave to be filed in Washington. Who funded efforts and hired people to \noppose the Compact?\n  Groups representing the large manufacturers of milk products--that's \nwho. The International Dairy Food Association for example. Their \nmembers, like any manufacturers, want to buy their inputs at low cost.\n  One of their members, Kraft, which is owned by a large tobacco \ncompany, wants to pass a bill that will allow them to buy milk at less \nthan the price set by milk marketing orders through something called \nforward contracting. This could greatly increase their profits.\n  They also oppose the dairy compact. The Compact has producers selling \nmilk at more than the level set by milk marketing orders. Under the \nDairy Compact, producers receive an over-order premium which means that \nthey get more money than the minimum set by the order, not less.\n  So why was there ever a concern about consumer prices increasing in \nthe Compact region? Prices should have never increased.\n  The Wall Street Journal and the New York Times discussed this in news \narticles about retail store price gouging. GAO raised the issue in 1991 \nand is looking at it now.\n  We do know that retail prices for milk are often over double what \nfarmers get for their milk--nationwide. Think about that.\n  Lets look at the time period just before the compact took effect--and \npick Vermont as the sample state. As the Wall Street Journal pointed \nout, in ``Are Grocers Getting Fat by Overcharging for Milk?,'' \nbeginning in November, 1996, the price that farmers got for their milk \ndropped by almost 25 percent--35 cents or so per gallon. Store prices \nstayed high which locked in a huge benefit to stores selling to \nconsumers. 35 cents a gallon is a significant increase in benefits to \nretail stores.\n  Comparing November 1996, to June 1997, the price farmers got for \ntheir milk dropped 35 cents a gallon, and stayed low, but the prices \nstores charged for milk stayed about the same.\n  I have always contended that Dairy Compacts can help reduce this \nretail store price inflation by stabilizing the price that farmers get \nfor milk--thus reducing the need for stores to build in a safety \ncushion to protect themselves in case it costs more for them to \npurchase milk.\n  Without a compact, the price farmers get for their milk can vary \nsignificantly. These variations in price are passed through to stores \nby co-ops and other handlers. Yet stores prefer not to constantly \nchange prices for customers so they build in a cushion. But this huge \nprofit margin can be reduced by Compacts which means that Dairy \nCompacts will save consumers money and provide more income to farmers.\n  Unfortunately, the OMB study is based on very limited information \nfrom USDA. USDA only gave OMB price information from 6 stores in New \nEngland--and only in two cities where it was announced in press \naccounts, in advance, that retail prices would go up even though store \nand wholesaler costs had dropped 35 cents per gallon.\n  Even in light of this OMB concluded that after 6 months, retail store \nprices in the compact region of New England were 5 cents lower than the \nrest of the nation.\n  New England newspaper accounts of the implementation of the Compact \nwere very interesting. For example, the July 1, 1997, the Portland \nPress Herald, Portland, Maine, points out that ``Cumberland Farms \nincreased the price of whole milk by four cents but dropped the price \nof skim by a penny'' when the Compact was implemented.\n  Also, they note that ``At Hannaford's Augusta store, Hood milk--a \nbrand-name product--was selling for $2.63 a gallon, while the Hannaford \nstore brand was selling for $2.32.''\n  Also, ``Shaw's increased its price by about 20 cents a gallon in \n[parts of] the five other New England states but kept the price the \nsame here [in Maine].''\n  The June 26, 1997, Boston Globe and the June 27, Providence Journal \npointed out before the Compact was implemented that one of the chains \nsignaled a price increase. A spokesman for Shaw's Supermarkets, Bernard \nRogan, is quoted as saying that milk prices will go up next week\n  The June 30, Boston Globe reported that ``The region's major \nsupermarkets are raising their milk prices 20 cents a gallon, ignoring \narguments that their profit margins are big enough to absorb a new \nprice subsidy for New England dairy farmers that takes effect this \nweek.''\n  As OMB discovered, after six months this initial signaled increase, \ndescribed above, was being subjected to competitive pressures and that \nconsumer prices in New England were on average lower than the rest of \nthe nation.\n  Studies of prices charged in stores in Vermont, for example, show \nthat the most important factor in the price of milk is the brand and \nthe store. In cities and towns in Vermont the variation in price among \nstores was in the 50 cents to one dollar range. In other words, in the \nsame town the price of a gallon of milk varied greatly and still does.\n  These store variations, and variations through the use of store \ncoupons, dwarf any possible impact of the compact.\n  Also note that reports have indicated that the dairy case is the most \nprofitable part of a supermarket. The product profitability of fluid \nmilk is $16.46 per square foot, whereas regular grocery items return \nonly $2.32 per square foot. This information is from testimony of \nProfessor Andrew Novakovic, on April 10, 1991, before the Committee on \nAgriculture of the U.S. House of Representatives.\n  All other food expenditures dwarf how much income that consumers \nspend on fluid milk. The savings consumers can achieve through buying \n``on sale'' or house-brand items, or through using discount coupons, \nfar exceed typical changes in the price of fluid milk. Only 3 percent \nof the average household's total expenditures on food go for fluid \nmilk. This information is from an article called ``Food Cost Review,'' \n1995, from the Economic Research Service of U.S.D.A.\n  Note also that OMB reported that the Northeast has the Nation's \nsecond highest cost of dairy production ($14.27 per cwt in 1996) and \nits milk generated the lowest returns per cwt after expenses. OMB found \nthat a smaller proportion of New England farms are competitive than in \nother regions. Net average returns per cow in Vermont are $350 per year \nand in Wisconsin are $460 year. OMB determined that the Compact \ngenerated about $70 more in annual income per cow.\n  So why all the fuss about the compact and who is generating it?\n  For one, Kraft, the international milk manufacturing giant, opposes \nthe\n\n[[Page S11555]]\n\ncompact. Kraft's annual U.S. sales exceed $16 billion. They are owned \nby Phillip Morris, the tobacco giant.\n  Perhaps the writer Ben Johnson said it best: ``Whilst that for which \nall virtue now is sold, And almost every vice--almighty gold.''\n  IDFA, which receives funding from Kraft which is owned by big \ntobacco, went on a spending spree. One big staff acquisition was from \nPublic Voice for Food and Health Policy. The very person who led Public \nVoice's press attack on the Compact was negotiating for a job with the \nmilk manufacturers who opposed the Compact.\n  Lobbying registration forms show the whole sad story.\n  In June 1996, the Senior Vice President for Programs at Public Voice \npublicly defended his organization from charges that its analysis was \ninfluenced by corporate contributions.\n  A Lobby Registration form filed in July 1996 shows that he worked for \nWilliam Wasserman of M & R Strategic as a ``consultant'' for this \nlobbying arm of IDFA.\n  This is the major reason I returned the golden carrot award back to \nPublic Voice. It is one thing to have honest disagreements about \npolicy. It is another to be working on getting a job with opponents of \nthe Compact at the same time you are leading the charge for Public \nVoice against the Compact. The Lobbying Reports tell the story.\n  There is an unseemly web of money and promises between the dairy \nprocessors and Public Voice.\n  For example, we know that during a critical time period between \nJanuary 1995 and June 1996, Public Voice accepted $41,000 from the \nInternational Dairy Foods Association (IDFA).\n  We do not know how much IDFA has contributed to Public Voice after \nJune 1996 or how much any of IDFA's corporate members and officers of \nthose corporations have individually contributed to Public Voice. We do \nnot know how much big tobacco gives to Public Voice. I have always \nexpected that it is a huge number considering the large salaries IDFA \npays to its top officers.\n  For a six-month period in 1996, IDFA paid at least $30,000 to M & R \nStrategic Services for its lobbying efforts.\n  These are all public facts documented by lobbying disclosure forms or \nderived directly from quotes from Public Voice officials.\n  This overwhelming and unseemly evidence compelled me to conclude \nthat, for Public Voice, when it comes to the Dairy Compact, \ncontributions come first, and analysis comes second. The New York Times \nand other editorial pages have relied upon the numbers provided by \nPublic Voice to substantiate their editorials against the Compact, but \nwe now know those numbers were cooked, and flat-out wrong.\n  I challenged Public Voice to release the names of any dairy-related \nor tobacco-related contributors and how much they contributed during \nthe last three years. They have not done so yet. I would be pleased \njust to know if the amount is $100,000 or $500,000, total, over the \nlast three years.\n  IDFA also made other major acquisitions. They hired the Director of \nConsumer Affairs at USDA, William Wasserman, who set up a subsidiary \ncalled the ``Campaign for Fair Milk Prices'' through M & R Associates.\n  Money can solve a lot of problems. For example, his Lobby Report \nfiled on August 15, 1996, shows his client as IDFA and shows him \nspecifically working on the ``Northeast Dairy Compact.'' His Lobbying \nRegistration form filed on February 13, 1996, shows he worked for IDFA \non dairy price supports and marketing orders.\n  A key USDA official who represented USDA at dairy meetings on Capitol \nHill was also hired by IDFA. Mr. Charles Shaw is now listed as Senior \nEconomist and Director of IDFA in the book 1997 Washington \nRepresentatives.\n  Listed as ``counsel or consultants'' for IDFA are--you guessed it--M \n& R Strategic Services lobbyists Allen Rosenfeld and William Wasserman \nin 1997 Washington Representatives.\n  I will explain the importance of this in a minute. Before I begin I \nwant to point out that the battle over the Compact is really a battle \nbetween well-off dairy manufacturers and struggling dairy farmers.\n  These huge dairy manufacturers cannot win over the editorial boards \nof The New York Times or The Washington Post on that basis.\n  But if a group like Public Voice carries their public relations \nmessage, casting this as a consumer issue, they have a foot in the \ndoor.\n  Public Voice has focused on the price increases which took place just \nas the Compact was implemented. I mentioned these price signaling \nnewspaper articles earlier.\n  But Public Voice has ignored the conclusion that consumer prices are \nlower in New England than the average for the nation. I wonder why.\n  I wonder how much money they have received from all the major \nmanufacturers of milk and tobacco companies throughout the country over \nthe last three years? I wonder how much money they have received from \nIDFA and other groups that represent manufacturers over the last three \nyears? I wonder how many others they will hire to influence public \nopinion in a way that supports the efforts of huge milk manufacturers \nagainst the interest of dairy farmers in New England?\n  I want to make one final point. The New York Times has reported on \nhow important the Compact is for the environment. In an article \nentitled ``Environmentalists Supporting Higher Milk Price for Farmers'' \nit was explained that keeping farmers on the land maintains the beauty \nof New England.\n  A lack of farm income resulting from low dairy prices is cited as the \nmajor reason dairy farmers leave farming in New England. Production \ncosts in New England are much higher than in other areas of the nation \nwhile the value of the land for nonfarm purposes is often greater than \nits value as farmland.\n  In many cases I am advised that this is very different as compared to \nvast areas of the Midwest and Upper Midwest where land is worth very \nlittle except for its value as farmland. As the Vermont Economy \nNewsletter reported in July 1994:\n\n       In the all important dairy industry, the decrease in farm \n     income has come from a continuation of the long term trends \n     the industry has been facing. Should these trends persist, \n     and there is every expectation they will, Vermont will \n     continue to see dairy farms disappearing from its landscape \n     during the 1990s.\n\n  One of the consequences of the exit of dairy farmers in New England \nis that land is released from agriculture. Given the close proximity to \npopulation centers and recreational areas in New England, good land is \nin high demand, and as a result there is often a strong incentive to \ndevelop the land.\n  What are the consequences of land being converted from farm to non-\nfarm uses?\n  One consequence is that the rural heritage and aesthetic qualities of \nthe working landscape are lost forever. The impact of this loss would \nbe devastating to Vermont and to much of New England. The tourists from \nsome of America's largest urban centers are drawn to rural New England \nbecause of its beauty, its farms and valleys, and picturesque roads.\n  Strip malls and condominiums do not have the same appeal to \nvacationers.\n  The Vermont Partnership for Economic Progress, noted in its 1993 \nreport, A Plan for a Decade of Progress: Actions for Vermont's Economy, \n``There are many issues that will influence the [tourism] industry's \nfuture in Vermont . . . [including] our state's ability to preserve its \nlandscape.'' The report went on to list among its primary goals:\n\n       1. Maintain the existing amount of land in agriculture and \n     related uses;\n       2. Preserve the family farm as part of our economic base \n     and as an integral factor in Vermont's quality of life from \n     ``A Plan for a Decade of Progress.''\n\n  The priority of these goals show that preserving farmland and a \nviable agriculture industry are important for the overall economic \nhealth of the region from Maine, to rural parts of Connecticut, Rhode \nIsland, and Massachusetts, to Vermont and New Hampshire.\n  Other consequences of farm losses are equally destructive. The \nAmerican Farmland Trust has completed cost of community services \nstudies in four New England towns, one in Connecticut and three in \nMassachusetts. The information is from ``Does Farmland Protection \nPay?''\n  These studies show the cost of providing community services for \nfarmland and developed land. It is true that developed land brings in \nmore tax revenues than farmland, especially when farmland is assessed \nat its agricultural value, as it is in most New England\n\n[[Page S11556]]\n\nstates. Developed land, however, requires far more in the way of \nservices than the tax revenues it returns to the treasuries of \nmunicipalities.\n  For example, residential land in these four New England towns \nrequired $1.11 in services for every one dollar in tax revenue \ngenerated while the farmland required only $0.34 of services for every \none dollar of revenue it generated. This demonstrates the major impact \nthat losing dairy farmland has on rural New England. This information \nis from ``Does Farmland Protection Pay?''\n  National Geographic recently detailed the risk of economic death by \nstrip malling otherwise tourist-drawing farmland. New England should be \nallowed to try to reverse this trend, especially in ways that help \nneighboring states such as under the Compact.\n  The American Farmland Trust Study pointed out that agricultural land \nactually enhanced the value of surrounding lands in addition to \nsustaining important economic uses.\n\n       Farming is a cost effective, private way to protect open \n     space and the quality of life. It also supports a profusion \n     of other interests, including: hunting, fishing, recreation, \n     tourism, historic preservation, floodplain and wetland \n     protection. ``Does Farmland Protection Pay?''\n\n  Keeping land in agriculture and protecting it from development is \nvitally important for all of New England, which is one reason all six \nNew England states have funded or authorized purchase of agricultural \nconservation easement programs to help protect farmland permanently.\n  Other economic uses, from condominiums and second homes for retired \nor professional people from New York, Boston, or Philadelphia to \nshopping malls to serve them, are waiting in the wings. The pressure to \ndevelop in New England is voracious.\n  A 1993 report from the American Farmland Trust called ``Farming on \nthe Edge'' showed that only 14 of the more than 67 counties in New \nEngland, were not significantly influenced by urban areas.\n  In fact, eight New England counties were considered to be farming \nareas in the greatest danger of being lost to development because of \ntheir high productivity and close proximity to urban areas. The \nChamplain and Hudson River Valleys were considered to be among the top \n12 threatened agricultural areas in the entire country according to \nthis ``Farming on the Edge'' study.\n  Dairy farming is New England's number one agricultural industry, and \na lack of farm income is a major cause for farmers leaving dairying. \nThis discussion underscores the compelling need for the Northeast \nInterstate Dairy Compact because towns will not only lose their rural \ncharacter with the loss of farms, but they will suffer economic \nconsequences as well. New England suffer the economic losses of the \neconomic activity from farming, but will spend more in services than \nthey gain in revenue as good farmland gets developed.\n  I need to address one more dairy issue, milk marketing order reform. \nThis bill does give USDA a few more months to study this critical \nissue. I have been fighting for a fair revision of the milk marketing \norders as have other Colleagues. Although dairy farmers across the \ncountry have told the Agriculture Department that they prefer Option 1-\nA, the Department continues to support Option 1-B.\n  It has been made clear that the U.S. Department of Agriculture \nprefers Option 1-B for fluid milk pricing, even though it has been \ndemonstrated that this system would be disastrous for dairy farmers \nacross the country. Economists for AgriMark estimate that under Option \n1-B, dairy farmers' income would drop by $365 million dollars next \nyear--that is a loss of $1 million each and every day of the year. I am \ntold by economists at AgriMark that Option 1-B reduces farm income in \nalmost every area of the country.\n  I am also told that every area of the country, including the Upper \nMidwest, will have higher farm income under Option 1-A as compared to \nOption 1-B.\n  At the close of the comment period for milk pricing reform, I was \njoined by 60 Senators in a letter to USDA supporting Option 1-A. Option \n1-A is the only option which is both fair and equitable to farmers \nwhile promising to continue providing consumers with reasonably priced \nfresh, wholesome milk.\n  Mr. President, this year Vermont farmers took a one-two punch from \nMother Nature. The unprecedented ice storm this winter that knocked out \npower across the state, forcing farmers to cull their herds, dump milk \nand scramble for feed. This summer's flooding hit many of these same \nfarmers just as their crops were starting to produce. Their fields have \nbeen saturated with water ever since leaving them without feed going \ninto the winter. Ten out of the fourteen counties in Vermont have been \ndeclared National Disaster Areas by the President this year.\n  Because the margins are already so close for many farmers, helping \nthese farmers recover from their feed losses could mean the difference \nbetween staying in business or selling out. The Livestock Feed \nAssistance Program will help Vermont farmers get through the winter and \nnot be overwhelmed by recovery costs. I visited these farms after the \nice storm and went back again to some of the same areas after the \nflooding.\n  What I heard at every farm I visited was very simple: farmers need \nenough assistance to get them through this season. They do not expect a \nlot of assistance, but they do expect it to be fast and they expect it \nto be fair.\n  Unfortunately, disaster assistance programs have not always worked \nthis way. Too often, the criteria and program thresholds developed by \nthe national office do not catch the small, family dairy farms we have \nin the Northeast. The disasters that hit Vermont this year caused \ndamage much like what you see after a tornado. One farm may have lost \nhalf his crop while his neighbor may not have been touched. But the way \nthe disaster programs work now, if the county as a whole did not \nsustain at least 40 percent damage, none of the farmers hit by the \ndisaster would be eligible for assistance.\n  In addition, these programs often require a farmer to sustain at \nleast 40 or 50 percent damage on his farm. This requirement has \nprevented many farmers who are barely making it anyway from getting \nassistance. After the ice storm, many Vermont farmers were tinkering at \nthe edge of losing their farms.\n  I know that Secretary Glickman shares my commitment to preserving the \nfamily farm and I look forward to working with him to make sure these \ndisaster programs are flexible enough to help our small, family farms. \nLet me quote a letter from Edie Connellee and Bill Cartright of \nWaitsfield, Vermont, ``I hope we all purposefully remember to use this \nexperience as a way to better be a community and especially remember \nthat small acts of kindness, even just a phone call, make a huge \ndifference when someone is hurting in any way.'' I hope this is the \napproach the Agriculture Department will take when implementing these \ndisaster programs.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me take a moment to talk about the \nfunding levels for the conservation programs in this year's Agriculture \nAppropriations bill. When we passed the 1996 Farm Bill one of \ncornerstones of that package was the mandatory funding for the \nconservation programs. We set aside $200 million a year for the \nEnvironmental Quality Incentives Program. Unfortunately, it was all too \ntempting for the appropriators to cap that program this year at $175 \nmillion and use the savings elsewhere. In a year where we have seen \nstate legislation regulating agriculture waste on farms and new \nregulations from the Environmental Protection Agency, this program is \nall the more critical to making sure farmers can comply with these \nrequirements.\n  Having worked with dairy farmers across Vermont, but especially \naround Lake Champlain and Lake Memphremagog, I know how committed they \nare to protecting our watersheds from farm run-off. Vermont farmers \nlead the country in developing innovative techniques to control \nagriculture waste. But they cannot do it alone. The EQIP cost-share \npayments help them do the right thing without putting them in a \nfinancial bind. Now is not the time to be slowing down such a \nsuccessful program.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to the debate \nregarding the FY 1999 Agriculture Appropriations bill. While I know \nthis bill\n\n[[Page S11557]]\n\ncontains numerous important items including funding for agricultural \nresearch, credit programs, conservation programs, and food safety \ninitiatives, I want to specifically mention my concern regarding the \nportions of this legislation which provide emergency relief to \nAmerica's farmers.\n  The last few years have been very difficult for America's farmers. I \nknow this very well because of the numerous difficulties suffered by \nfarmers in my state of Alabama. Last year, North Alabama was hit with \nan especially cold and rainy spring which greatly reduced the yields of \ncotton farmers. Peanut farmers in Southeastern Alabama were hit with a \ntoxic mold blight which cost them greatly when they tried to market \ntheir peanuts. Before the close of the Summer of 1997, Hurricane Danny \ndumped inches of rain on and brought devastating winds to Southwestern \nAlabama. This storm alone caused millions of dollars in crop losses and \nfarm related damages.\n  Mr. President, unfortunately I cannot say that weather conditions \nimproved much in Alabama this year. Early spring flooding was followed \nby devastating heat and drought. Alabama's cotton producers, corn \nproducers, cattle producers and peanut producers were forced to battle \nextreme conditions as they tried to keep crops and livestock alive. If \nthis was not enough, Hurricane Georges swept through the Gulf Coast \nthis past week and caused millions of dollars more in crop losses.\n  To add insult to these weather-induced injuries, the troubled \neconomic conditions in Asia and throughout other parts of the world \nhave decreased the number of available markets for our farmers. The \nloss of these markets has in turn led to lower prices. Where our \nfarmers have actually made a crop, they are finding that the market has \nbottomed out and there is very little profit available to them.\n  Mr. President, a series of natural disasters coupled with economic \ncollapse have hit Alabama's farmers extremely hard. They need help.\n  I am well aware of the fact that many other regions have suffered \nsignificant farm-related losses. As I have pointed out, however they \nhave not been affected exclusively. I want the devastation that \nAlabama's farmers have suffered to be recognized on the record.\n  Mr. President, this bill provides $2.1 billion in disaster assistance \nfunding and grants the Secretary of Agriculture broad discretion to \nimplement disaster assistance awards. I urge the Secretary to make a \nfull and complete review of all the factors affecting farmers in every \nregion of the country. I want it noted that I believe that it is \nfundamentally important that the Secretary be aware of the extreme \nconditions that have befallen farmers in my state.\n  When Secretary Glickman makes the awards for farm disasters and \neconomic losses, I want him to make them based on a fair appraisal of \nall farm losses throughout the country. I believe that all my \ncolleagues will agree. Our farmers deserve no less.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Agriculture \nappropriations conference report. I commend Senator Cochran for his \nhard work in putting together this bill to fund our Nation's \nagricultural and nutrition programs and to provide emergency assistance \nto America's farmers in this difficult year.\n  I am disappointed, however, that some provisions that would have \nbenefited our Nation's family ranchers who are also suffering from low \ncommodity prices were dropped from the final conference report. \nAlthough these measures were unsuccessful this year, I am confident \nthat they will come before the Senate again next year and I intend to \nwork hard for their passage.\n  In particular, I am disappointed that the amendment to require the \nlabeling of imported meat was dropped from the final package. I \nstrongly believe that we need to require foreign meat products to be \nclearly labeled as such. I support free trade, but in order to have \nfree trade you need to have full disclosure. American consumers have a \nright to know if the meat they are buying has been produced in our \nNation. American stockgrowers have a strong record of producing top \nquality products, and the American consumer should have the ability to \nidentify these top quality products in the grocery store.\n  I am also disappointed that the amendment to establish a price \nreporting pilot project was dropped. Many of my constituents who are \nfamily ranchers are very concerned about the current state of the \npacking industry, notably the increase in packer concentration. I share \ntheir concerns. Although I generally do not favor government mandates \non any industry, I believe that the price reporting amendment would \nhave provided us with more transparency to determine what effect the \nrecent trend towards consolidation in the packing industry has had on \ncattle prices.\n  In addition, I think we need to add fairness to our meat inspection \nprograms by allowing State-inspected meat to move across State lines. \nWe already allow Canadian and Mexican meat products to be sold in our \nNation based on a promise that their standards are the same as ours. \nThere is no reason for our government to trust foreign inspectors and \nnot State inspectors. We need to level the playing field for meat \ninspections to help out our small packers. Allowing small packers to \nship their products across State lines is not only fair, it would also \nincrease competition in the packing industry. Unfortunately this \nimportant issue was not considered this year at all.\n  So Mr. President, while I will not object to this Agriculture \nappropriations bill because I recognize how important it is to \nAmerica's farmers, I am disappointed that it did not do more to address \nthe financial problems facing our Nation's ranching industry. Family \nranchers are struggling with the lowest beef prices in over 20 years. \nTheir problems are not now and never have been addressed by huge \ngovernment spending programs. But Congress should take action to \nprovide free and fair competition in the livestock industry. The three \nmeasures I have just outlined would do just that, and I will work hard \nto make sure that they receive the careful consideration of Congress \nnext year.\n\n\n                         water quality research\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to ask a few questions of my \nfriend from Arkansas, Senator Bumpers, regarding the water quality \ncomponent of the Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension \nService (CSREES) Special Grants Program. In particular, I note that \nalthough the Senate agriculture appropriations bill for fiscal year \n1999 included $436,000 for water quality grant in North Dakota, the \nconference report now before us has moved those funds into a separate \nwater quality item. Could the Senator explain the reason for this \naction?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Over the past several years, the Congress has funded \nwater quality grants through three separate items with in the CSREES \nSpecial Grants Program, including the two the Senator from North Dakota \nmentions. The fiscal year 1999 appropriations bill which Senator \nCochran and I reported to the Senate earlier this year included a total \nof $2,897,000 for these activities. This amount includes funds at last \nyear's level for the North Dakota program and the balance directed to \nthe undesignated water quality item. The House included the third water \nquality grant and provided a total of $3,389,000 for all water quality \nspecial grants.\n  The conferees recognized the need to strengthen our cooperative \nresearch activities for water quality, in a manner similar to the \ntreatment of food safety and other priority research areas, and decided \nto consolidate and increase the funding level for water quality through \nthe CSREES Special Grants Program. Accordingly, all funding for water \nquality research was moved to a single item and in recognition of the \nexcellent record of the North Dakota program, language was included in \nthe Statement of Managers explaining that the North Dakota program \nshould continue to secure funding through that item.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Senator for that explanation. Is the Senator \nfrom Arkansas aware of the work underway in North Dakota regarding \nwater quality?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Yes, I am. I understand the North Dakota program, \ndeveloped through the Red River Water Management Consortium (RRWMC) is \ndoing important work to help understand the occurrence, transport, and\n\n[[Page S11558]]\n\nfate of agricultural chemicals in the Northern Great Plains region. I \nbelieve it is also noteworthy that the RRWMC is a basin-wide water \nmanagement group, comprised of a number of government and industry \nstakeholders throughout the water basin and has included partners from \nmunicipalities, agricultural industries, county governments, resource \nconservation and development organizations, and public utilities. \nCooperation and coordination of all these groups is vital and the \nnetwork established in North Dakota should serve as an excellent model \nfor other parts of the United States where water contamination, \nespecially from agricultural runoff, posses a real or potential threat \nto the environment and public health.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the Senator's understanding of the \nimportance of this research and his familiarity with the RRWMC's \nactivities. Is it the understanding of the Senator from Arkansas that \nthe goals of the North Dakota project are consistent with the overall \nwater quality research objectives of CSREES?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Yes, I believe they are. The CSREES water quality \nprograms are intended to help investigate the impacts of non-point \nsource pollution and recognize the public's concern about the possible \nrisks to the environment resulting from the use of agricultural \nchemicals. Therefore, the purpose of the RRWMC's activities are clearly \nconsistent with the goals of the agency's water quality research \nmission. Further, I understand that the RRWMC has been able to leverage \nnon-federal funds on a ratio of about two to one. Given current budget \nconstraints, this accomplishment is to be commended especially in \nrecognition of the fact that the CSREES water quality grant has \nreceived nearly $48 million in appropriations since 1990 and has only \nbeen able to leverage approximately $1 million per year during that \ntime. The record of RRWMC in leveraging non-federal funds is, \ntherefore, all the more impressive and worthy of these federal dollars. \nIn view of the important ongoing work of the RRWMC on the important \nissues of water quality protection, their cooperative relationships \nwith a wide variety of stakeholders, and their ability to leverage non-\nfederal resources, I believe the conferees would agree that RRWMC \nshould be able to secure funding of, at least, last year's level in the \ncoming fiscal year.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the Senator's understanding of the fine work \nof the RRWMC and his words of encouragement for their activities under \nCSREES in the coming fiscal year.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today to delcare my support for \nthe fiscal year 1999 Agriculture appropriations bill.\n  American agriculture is in a state of emergency. No one who has read \na commodity report in the last few months would disagree. Wheat and \nbarley prices are at record lows as are prices for other important \nIdaho agricultural products. In August, I talked to growers all over \nIdaho who are on the verge of bankruptcy, they tell me they are in \ntrouble.\n  This appropriations bill will help farmers get back on their feet. \nThe bill provides funding for a wide range of USDA programs, including \nagricultural research, export initiatives, foreign market development, \nnutrition programs and other department operations. Much-needed short \nterm relief is also provided--$1.5 billion in one-time payments to \nassist producers who have been hit by crop losses in 1998, an \nadditional $675 million to provide assistance to farmers who have \nsuffered multi-year crop losses, $175 million for livestock feed \nassistance in a cost-share program available to ranchers who lost their \n1998 feed supplies to disaster, and $1.65 billion for increased AMTA \n(Agriculture Market Transition Act) payments.\n  In a time when its farmers are experiencing severe economic hardship, \nIdaho is one of the big winners in the process. Many important Idaho \nresearch projects were included in the bill, including over $1.2 \nmillion for potato variety development, $329,000 for peas and lentils, \n$423,000 for grass seed and $550,000 for small fruit research, among \nothers.\n  The agriculture appropriations bill will also help promote American \nagriculture overseas. The Market Access Program continues to be a vital \nand important part of U.S. trade policy aimed at maintaining and \nexpanding U.S. agricultural exports, countering subsidized foreign \ncompetition, strengthening farm income and protecting American jobs. \nMAP has been a tremendous success by any measure. Since the program was \nestablished, U.S. agricultural exports have doubled. In fiscal year \n1997, U.S. agricultural exports amounted to $57.3 billion, resulting in \na positive agricultural trade surplus of approximately $22 billion and \ncontributing billions of dollars more in increased economic activity \nand additional tax revenues. This appropriations bill continues funding \nfor MAP.\n  Also included in the bill is funding for the Agriculture Education \nCompetitive Grants Program. This program funds grants for school-based \nagricultural education at the high school and junior college levels of \ninstruction. Competitive grants targeted to school-based agricultural \neducation will be used to enhance curricula, increase teacher \ncompetencies, promote the incorporation of agriscience and agribusiness \neducation into other subject matter, like science and mathematics, and \nfacilitate joint initiatives between secondary schools, 2-year \npostsecondary schools, and 4-year universities. This will help our \nyoung people be successful in an ever-increasing competitive \nagriculture market.\n  Is this is a perfect bill? No, but it is one that is fiscally \nresponsible and it does not return to the failed policies of the past. \nWe must allow American farmers to compete and give them the tools they \nneed to do so. This bill is another step in that direction.\n  Mr. President, I will vote yes for the appropriations bill and urge \nmy colleagues to do the same.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \nAgriculture Appropriations Conference Report. I oppose this bill for \nthree reasons. First and foremost, it does not meet the needs of my \nstate of Maryland. Second, it does not sufficiently fund agriculture \nprograms in order to help all American farmers. Third, the method by \nwhich the funding is spent is wholly inadequate to address the farm \ncrisis.\n  In my state of Maryland, we have been plagued by drought for the \nsecond consecutive year. Our farmers are losing crops and they are \nlosing money. They are struggling just to survive. Couple the drought \nwith the record low prices, high costs and a glut in the market and \nthat spells disaster for our farmers. Official data reports that \ndrought has destroyed between 30 percent and 65 percent of the crops in \nnine Southern Maryland and lower Eastern Shore counties. Loss of \nsoybean, tobacco, wheat and corn crops is making this a very tough \nseason for Maryland farmers. Let me assure you I will not just stand by \nand let this happen to my farmers.\n  I am already fighting with the rest of the Maryland delegation team \nto provide emergency loans from the Department of Agriculture to our \nfarmers and to officially designate them disaster areas because of the \ndrought. But this money does not really take care of the problem. This \nis not some heroic assistance program for our farmers. It is just a \nloan. This is money that must be paid back. It does not provide any \nreal long term assistance for our farming community. That is precisely \nthe job of Congress today.\n  Our farmers need help so they can continue to farm. They need help \nnow, this is true, and they need these loans. But eventually, loans \nmust be paid back with money earned. And this money will not and cannot \nbe earned without our help. We should be uplifting our farmers and \nhelping them to help themselves. Not just continuing their burden of \ndebt. We need help, and this Agriculture Appropriations bill neither \naddresses Maryland's agricultural problems nor the agricultural \nproblems scourging the rest of our country.\n  Farmers in my state of Maryland came to me with their priorities for \nthis bill, neither of which are adequately addressed. First, this bill \ndoes not provide adequate funding for operating loans so farmers can \nbuy the equipment and supplies necessary to plan for the next season. \nWithout these loans, many of our farmers will not have the funds they \nneed to plant. This then becomes a vicious cycle. Without the funds to \nplant, the farmers cannot make money for the next year, and pay\n\n[[Page S11559]]\n\nback or even be eligible for loan assistance.\n  The second, and most important reason this bill does not satisfy the \nneeds of my state is because this bill does not uncap the market loans. \nMy farmers have told me that their number one priority is to take the \nartificial caps off the market loans. In fact, my farmers have told me \nthey desperately needed the caps off the market loans. Last week, a new \nU.S. Department of Agriculture report forecasted a net farm income for \n1998 at $42 billion, down $7.9 billion from last year. This amounts to \nnearly a 16 percent drop in farm income. The report also said that farm \ndebt is anticipated to reach $172 billion by the end of 1998.\n  What do these forecasts tell us? This says that any federal response \nthat stops short of recognizing the fundamental problem of depressed \nprices will absolutely not address the problem. We cannot pass a band-\naid measure and expect it to stick in the long term. This is just not \npossible. The only way to start to correct the problem is to start at \nthe root. And this means acknowledging and dealing with the depressed \ncrop prices. Uncapping the market loans is crucial to confronting this \nproblem.\n  I will not vote for this bill today because it does not provide \nenough funding to deal with these problems. The Democratic farm relief \npackage offered by Senator Harkin in conference was sadly defeated \nalong partisan lines. This package would have provided the necessary \n$7.3 billion in funds to cover both disaster and economic losses, \nincluding a provision to increase marketing loan rates. The Republican \nplan--less than $4 billion--adopted by the committee came as an extreme \ndisappointment. All states suffer under the Republican plan. In my \nstate alone, Maryland would receive only $7 million in assistance \nverses $21 million under the Democratic plan.\n  The magnitude of losses suffered simply does not merit this meager \nand shallow attempt to pass this bill. All one need do is look at the \nfacts. The level of economic assistance contained in the bill is $1.65 \nbillion. The net farm income projected is expected to fall this year \nalone by $8 billion to $10 billion. Clearly, this bill does not \nincrease the amount of relief to a level that will help farmers weather \nthe economic crisis.\n  Finally, I will not support this bill because the method by which the \nfunding is spent is wholly inadequate to address the farm crisis. The \nassistance is not directed to the person who suffered the loss. \nIncreasing the Republican plan would simply send money to landlords who \nhave already been paid their cash rent for the year. These Agricultural \nMarket Transition Act (AMTA) payments benefit the absentee landowner, \nrather than the farmers who need the assistance. One recent study \nshowed that 73 percent of the nation's farmers feel the current farm \nbill does not provide adequate income during low-price periods. This \nmeans the current system is failing us. Rather than pump more money \ninto a failed system, it is time we overhaul the method.\n  Let me say that I absolutely agree with Senators Daschle and Harkin \nthat this bill does not sufficiently address the farm crisis. More \nneeds to be done. I am sorry not to vote for this appropriations bill. \nMr. President, let me be clear--I wanted to vote for an agriculture \nappropriations bill today. I think we all did. In fact, I want to see \nall thirteen of these appropriations bills pass, as they rightly \nshould. But I will not support a bill that short-changes our farmers. I \ndid not vote for the Freedom to Farm bill for this very reason, I will \nnot vote for the agriculture appropriations bill today.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I will vote for the 1999 agriculture \nappropriations conference report. Unfortunately, several unwise \nprovisions have been added since this bill passed the Senate. The \ncumulative weight of these mistaken policies does not outweigh the many \ngood things in the bill, but is still reason for substantial concern.\n  The bill is commendable in many ways. The conferees wisely rejected \nefforts to increase price support loan rates. Instead, they expanded \ndisaster assistance from $500 million in the Senate bill to $2.35 \nbillion. This aid will benefit farmers with 1998 losses as well as \nproducers in some regions who have suffered several consecutive years \nof loss because of weather or disease.\n  The bill also provides $1.65 billion in market loss payments to \nfarmers. These payments provide income support without doing violence \nto the basic structure of the 1996 FAIR Act. In preserving the FAIR \nAct's ``freedom to farm,'' the market loss payments are clearly \nsuperior to the higher loan rates preferred by our Democratic \ncolleagues. Raising loan rates, according to the non-partisan Food and \nAgricultural Policy Research Institute, would cause more production, \nhigher surplus stocks and lower prices and incomes in future years. \nEven though higher loan rates might raise prices in the short term, \nthey would have deleterious effects that would plague U.S. agriculture \nfor years to come.\n  Other parts of the bill deserve praise. The conferees adopted a \nbiodiesel provision in the Senate bill which I sponsored along with \nother Senators. Encouraging the use of biodiesel will advance, in a \nsmall way, the neglected cause of energy self-sufficiency and \nrenewability. The conference report will also facilitate an increase in \noverseas food assistance through Food for Progress.\n  I also commend the conferees for adopting a regulatory standstill \nthat will restore legal certainty to swap transactions. This standstill \nwill allow the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to take necessary \nactions in a financial emergency, as well enforcement actions. It \nleaves regulators free to act prudently. However, the provision will \nensure that the President's Working Group on Financial Markets has an \nopportunity to advance its current study of the appropriate regulation \nof over-the-counter derivatives, a study I asked the working group to \nbegin back in July. The turbulence in financial markets during recent \nweeks should finally convince everyone of the need to expedite this \nstudy. The standstill also allows crucial decisions about OTC \nderivatives to be made, as they should be, in Congress.\n  Restoring legal certainty to swaps will also help to calm markets: In \na volatile period, the last thing markets need to deal with is the \nthreat of valid contracts becoming unenforceable. I commend Senator \nCochran for his sponsorship of this provision, which Congressman Bob \nSmith and I proposed.\n  Unfortunately, the conference report has a number of undesirable \nprovisions. Most regrettably, this conference report adopts a House \nprovision to deny funding for the Initiative for Future Agriculture and \nFood Systems. It is difficult to understand why this initiative, which \npassed both Houses of Congress by overwhelming margins earlier this \nyear, was neglected when many less urgent--and more parochial--research \nitems were funded. The initiative's competitive grants and carefully \nchosen priorities represent the direction in which federal research \nfunding should go. To deny funding for research that will help us feed \nfuture generations is unconscionable.\n  The conference report has other flaws. It adopts new loan programs \nfor honey and mohair which were not contained in either bill. Programs \nfor these commodities were abolished only a few years ago. The \nconference report also adopts language from the House bill which will \ndelay the reform of milk marketing orders by six months. Such a delay \nis doubly unfortunate since the Secretary of Agriculture is already \nproposing only half-measures to reform this antiquated and byzantine \nsystem.\n  The report's statement of managers contains statements about the \nsugar program which, though not legally binding, would negate a \nprovision of the FAIR Act if they were taken seriously by the \nDepartment of Agriculture. The managers state, in effect, that the one-\ncent-per-pound penalty assessed on forfeited sugar should not be \nconsidered an effective reduction in the support price of sugar, \nespecially for purposes of determining the tariff rate quota for \nimports. But that was, of course, precisely the intent and effect of \nthis provision. The logical result of a one-cent penalty is to reduce \nby that amount the price at which a sugar processor would be \nindifferent to forfeiture or a market sale. It is instructive to read \ncomments on the floor of the House, during debate on the FAIR Act by a \nstrong advocate of the sugar program, former Congressman E de la Garza. \nThe former chairman of the\n\n[[Page S11560]]\n\nHouse Agriculture Committee said that the FAIR Act's sugar section \n``effectively reduces the loan rate by 1 cent and ensures an increase \nin foreign imports.''\n  The conference report also reverses one recent reform of the \ncatastrophic crop insurance program. Not only does the conference \nreport allow multi-million dollar operations to continue buying \ncatastrophic coverage for as little as $60, rather than a small \npercentage of crop value. It also extends this provision into the \nfuture, something that is simply not appropriate in a one-year \nappropriation bill. Finally, funding was cut for environmental \nassistance that mitigates non-point source pollution--the Environmental \nQuality Incentives Program. Like the Initiative for Future Agriculture \nand Food Systems, EQIP is funded through mandatory accounts that are \nunder the jurisdiction of authorizing, not appropriating, committees.\n  Even after listing disappointing actions, I have chosen to highlight \nthe positive achievements in this bill and other recent bills and \nenacted statutes in which Republicans have shown their ability to \nassist farmers in troubled times.\n  Under the Republican FAIR Act, loan deficiency payments and marketing \nloan gains for 1998 crops will total $4.2 billion. Most of this amount \nis not counted in the most recent Administration estimates of net farm \nincome. This summer, Republicans led the way in passing a bill to \naugment farm cash flow by speeding up 1999 ``freedom to farm'' \npayments. Now, Republicans are asking the President to join in a $4 \nbillion cash infusion into the farm economy--$2.35 billion in disaster \nassistance and $1.65 billion in market loss payments.\n  These Republican initiatives will lift 1998 net farm income to near \nthe 1997 level and above the average level of the 1990s. Without a \ndoubt, many producers are under severe stress. Not every operation will \nsurvive. Like most other commodity prices, farm prices are depressed \nbecause of the shock waves sweeping through the world economy. In such \ntrying times, Republicans have responded with practical assistance \nrather than ideological demagoguery.\n  We should send this conference report to the President, and he should \nsign it promptly.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, after two and a half months of debate on \nthe economic and disaster crisis facing rural America and thousands of \nfarm families, we are voting on a measure that provides $4.2 billion in \neconomic relief to our farmers.\n  During the course of this debate, we have heard from our Democratic \nLeader, who I want to commend for his leadership on this issue, our \nPresident, and many others who believe that much more assistance is \nneeded to adequately address the serious situation facing rural \nAmerica. I fully agree that the relief provided in this legislation is \nfar less than meaningful for Louisiana and other Southern states who \nare suffering one of the worst droughts in 100 years. Already, we have \nthousands of farmers whose crops and pasture land have been burnt up by \nthe heat and an estimated $450 million in crop losses in Louisiana \nalone. These same farmers are also facing some of the worst commodity \nprices in over a decade. Not only are Louisiana farmers hit with low \nprices, they also have no crop. Therefore, I have argued and strongly \nsupported additional funding to address this crisis. This funding is \njustified and should be provided.\n  However, Mr. President, we also have a conference report before us, a \nbill that provides a total of $55.7 billion in essential funding for \nsome very important agriculture, rural development, and nutrition \nprograms. Additionally, included in this measure is over $25 million \nfor much needed research and education projects in Louisiana.\n  Mr. President, the senior Senator from Louisiana and I have both \nadvocated for additional funding for our farmers. However, the bottom \nline is that many members in the House and Senate have differing views \nabout how this assistance should be delivered. Furthermore, many \nmembers have strong philosophical reasons for opposing even the $4.2 \nbillion provided in this relief package. Therefore, with only a few \ndays remaining, before the Congress adjourns and the $450 million in \nassociated crop damages facing Louisiana, the $4.2 billion provided in \nthis legislation, is the best option on the table for providing \nimmediate assistance to my state. Therefore, I am rising in support of \nthis measure, which as stated by the Chairman and Senator Bumpers has \nbeen one of the most difficult conference reports ever considered by \nthe Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee.\n  Mr. President, before I conclude my remarks I want to make two \nadditional points. While I recognize that this is not the appropriate \nbill to reform crop insurance, I want to make a prediction that if this \nissue along with revisions to the current loan rate structure are not \naddressed early next year, we will be back on the Senate floor debating \nan even greater economic farm crisis. Then, we will not only be hearing \nfrom farmers, but bankers, retail store owners and state chambers of \ncommerce.\n  I know that many of my colleagues strongly support crop insurance \nreform. However, many Senators are opposed to revisiting any of the \nloan rate provisions included in the 1996 Farm Bill. From my \ndiscussions with several reputable farmers in Louisiana this issue \nshould be reconsidered.\n  Mr. President, with the many complicated issues facing farmers, only \nthrough a bipartisan effort can we begin to address these matters. \nTherefore, I hope that the Democratic and Republican leaders in the \nHouse and Senate will take the additional steps needed early next year \nto address and resolve this pending economic agriculture crisis.\n  I thank the Chairman for yielding his time and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, during my October 5, 1998, floor statement \non the 1999 Agriculture Appropriations Conference Report, I referred to \nand inserted for the record a chart showing a state-by-state breakdown \nof the Democratic and Republican ag relief proposals. I wish to clarify \nthat the chart was not generated by the Congressional Budget Office, \nbut rather an estimate prepared by the Senate Agriculture Committee \nstaff based on the aggregate CBO estimate of the cost to remove the \ncaps placed on marketing loans in the 1996 Farm Bill.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity to make this \nclarification.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise today to briefly discuss two \nprovisions included in the conference report accompanying H.R. 4101, \nthe Agriculture Appropriations Bill.\n  First, I want to express my gratitude to the House and Senate \nconferees for retaining a provision in the conference report that was \noriginally passed here in the Senate relating to the Market Access \nProgram.\n  As my colleagues are aware, the Market Access Program is administered \nby the U.S. Department of Agriculture through its Foreign Agriculture \nService. MAP funding is designed to reimburse private companies, \nindustry associations and cooperatives for the promotion of brand-name \nproducts as well as generic commodities overseas.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, it has become quite clear that the \nMarket Access Program is a flagrant example of a federal spending \nprogram gone wrong--one that is simply unproductive, unjustified and \nunaffordable.\n  Over the past few years, I have stood here on the Senate floor \nseveral times to highlight the assorted flaws with this program, \nparticularly the outrageous reality that we are channeling millions and \nmillions of taxpayers dollars to some of the most prosperous \ncorporations in America, including Sunkist, Welch Foods, Gallo and \nGeneral Mills.\n  My efforts to terminate the Market Access Program were endorsed by a \nsweeping coalition of fiscal watchdogs, including Taxpayers For Common \nSense, National Taxpayers Unions, Citizens Against Government Waste, \nFriends of the Earth, Citizens for a Sound Economy and the U.S. Public \nInterest Research Group.\n  Unfortunately, proponents of this policy made claims about the \nprogram that were difficult for the General Accounting Office to refute \nas a result of the lack of available information about the \neffectiveness and value of the program. Clearly, greater scrutiny of \nthis program is appropriate and necessary.\n  In July of this year, the Senate passed an amendment that I authored \nto the Agriculture Appropriations bill that I believe will have a \nprofound effect on the future of the Market Access\n\n[[Page S11561]]\n\nProgram. I am pleased this provision has been retained in the \nconference report before us today.\n  This provision requires the USDA to estimate the impact of the Market \nAccess Program on the agriculture sector as well as on U.S. consumers, \nwhile also considering the costs and benefits of alternative uses of \nthe funds currently allocated to MAP.\n  Additionally, the amendment requires USDA to evaluate the additional \nspending of participants and the amount of exports additionally \nresulting from the Market Access Program.\n  I believe, Mr. President, that this information will allow the \nGeneral Accounting Office to produce a useful evaluation that will \nenable Congress to make an informed, responsible decision about the \nutility of continuing this program in future years.\n  Unfortunately, while this amendment will throw a spotlight on one \nwasteful federal spending program, I am concerned that another \nprovision in this conference report could compromise past and future \nefforts to rein in other wasteful and unnecessary federal expenditures.\n  As part of an effort to provide economic assistance to farmers and \nproducers who have been hit hard by the worsening weather and market \nconditions facing rural America, this legislation includes roughly $6.5 \nmillion in the form of recourse loans for mohair producers.\n  Perhaps this funding assistance is warranted. Clearly, the entire \nagricultural community is reeling from prolonged disastrous weather \nconditions, a 20-year low in commodity prices and dwindling overseas \nexports.\n  It is imperative that we provide to our producers in need, timely \ndisaster and other economic assistance for crop losses and other \nrelated dilemmas.\n  However, we must be clear in stating that the emergency assistance \nprovided in this bill for mohair producers is not in any way, shape or \nform an attempt to resuscitate the mohair subsidy program that was shut \ndown by the Congress just a few short years ago.\n  My colleagues will recall that the mohair subsidy program originated \nin 1954, when Congress passed the National Wool Act, authorizing a \nsubsidy program to guarantee the production of domestic wool for \nmilitary uniforms during the Cold War era.\n  Mohair, which was used for decorative braids on military uniforms, \nwas inexplicably affixed to the wool subsidy program.\n  Over the years, the need and justification for both the wool and \nmohair subsidies has plainly evaporated. Yet in 1992, years after the \nsun had set on the Cold War and the strategic need for wool and mohair \nhad long expired, wool producers were still receiving roughly 130 \nmillion dollars in subsidy payments while mohair producers were still \nreceiving about 48 million dollars.\n  In light of this, I joined with several of my colleagues in 1993, \nincluding Senators Kerry and Feingold, in terminating the wool and \nmohair subsidy that had existed for nearly forty years. We shut that \nprogram down.\n  That was no small accomplishment, Mr. President.\n  The Congress is clearly capable of, and has been somewhat successful \nin reducing the size, scope and funding for a number of federal \nspending programs.\n  But to actually terminate a program and to categorically wipe that \nprogram clean from the federal budget, is indeed, an uncommon \nachievement.\n  Mr. President, I am not here to dispute the contention that mohair \nproducers are deserving of emergency assistance. Certainly, virtually \nevery component of our agricultural community has been adversely \naffected by the crisis that is facing our Nation's farmers and \nproducers.\n  But I do want to take this opportunity to express to the \ndistinguished Chairman and distinguished Ranking Member of the \nSubcommittee my sincere hope that the inclusion of this funding for \nmohair producers is not an attempt to re-open the wool and mohair \nsubsidy program that was shut down by Congress just a few short years \nago.\n  Terminating the wool and mohair subsidy was a small step on the road \nto a balanced budget, and I fully intend to monitor this situation next \nyear. If we are to stay the course of fiscal responsibility, we must \nmake sure that the American taxpayer is not forced to subsidize those \nantiquated programs the Congress has deemed to be wasteful and \nunaffordable.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Agriculture Appropriations bill \ncontinues funding for the various agricultural and land-based programs \nwithin USDA and directs $4 billion in additional spending to support \nemergency farm relief and crop assistance to help farmers in need \nduring a critical year of disaster-related conditions.\n  Back in July, I reported more than $241 million in earmarks contained \nin the Senate bill for unrequested, unauthorized or purely parochial \nprojects. A review of the conference report leads me to determine that \nthe conferees jointly decided to overload this report with even more \nflagrant examples of wasteful and unnecessary spending. This year's \nconference agreement is more than $381 million above the budget request \nand higher than either the Senate or House had proposed.\n  Included in this spending bill is an added farm relief package that \ntotals $4 billion for crop loss assistance and market loss payments to \nhelp farmers cope with emergency situations and falling prices. We did \nnot vote on this measure as part of the original Senate or House bill, \nit was added in conference. This is a very serious issue which involves \na substantial amount of federal spending. Certainly, this deserves \nthoughtful deliberation and careful review through our established \nprocess, and should not be attached at the midnight hour to a \nconference report. This is not the way we ought to conduct the business \nof prioritizing taxpayer dollars.\n  Mr. President, each year, appropriations bills are a target for \nmembers to advance political platforms. I find that the accounts for \nthe Agricultural Research Service and the Cooperative State Research, \nEducation, and Extension Service are a virtual goldmine for member-\ninterest earmarks.\n  For example, specific earmarks are directed at the cost of:\n\n       $250,000 for ``alternative fish feed'' in Idaho; $750,000 \n     for grasshopper research in Alaska; $250,000 for lettuce \n     geneticist/breeding in Salinas, California; $1,000,000 for \n     peanut quality research in Dawson, Georgia and Raleigh, North \n     Carolina; $162,000 for peach tree shortlife in South \n     Carolina; $200,000 for tomato wilt virus in Georgia, and \n     $750,000 to the Fish Farming Experiment Laboratory in \n     Stuttgart, Arkansas.\n\n  While I am not an expert in the agricultural field, I find it \nincredulous that we can expend one million dollars on peanut quality \nresearch while we are experiencing a crisis in the farm economy! \nAdditionally, a quarter of a million is earmarked for ``alternative \nfish feed''? While I am certain that the members from these respective \nstates can make their case for directed funding for these projects, I \nquestion their desire to side-step a competitive and merit-based review \nprocess.\n  I was pleased to note in the conference report a recognition of the \nimportance of merit review procedures for grant funding. However, \ndespite this recognition, the report continues to include directive \nlanguage which explicitly leads the agency to grant specific projects \nwith special consideration.\n  For example, the report reads:\n\n       The House and Senate reports recommend projects for \n     consideration under various rural development programs and \n     the conferees expect the department to apply established \n     review procedures when considering applications.\n\n  The report then directs:\n\n       The conferees further expect the Department to give \n     consideration to business enterprise and housing preservation \n     projects in the city of Bayview, VA; aplications for rural \n     business enterprise grants from TELACU, for a project in \n     Selma, CA; for assistance for a community improvement program \n     in Arkansas; water and sewer improvements for the City of \n     Vaughn, NM; the Shulerville/Honey Hill Water project, South \n     Carolina; and a rural enterprise grant for Indian Hills \n     Community College in Iowa.\n\n  This is a true disservice to the many potential competitors who are \nvying for funding, yet decide to work through the designated \ncompetitive grant process.\n  Last year I noticed a practice by the appropriators of using the \nappropriations process to prevent Federal agencies from following \ngovernment-wide efforts to down-size and cut back on unnecessary \nbureaucracy. This year's conference report formalizes this practice as \na tradition by including language such as:\n\n[[Page S11562]]\n\n  Language whereby the conferees ``expect the Secretary, to the extent \npracticable, to avoid the use of reductions-in-force or furloughs for \nboth Federal and non-federal employees or any county office closings''; \nor,\n  Prohibitive language which prevents the expenditure of funds made \navailable by the Food and Drug Administration to close or relocate, or \nto plan to close or relocate, the Food and Drug Division of Drug \nAnalysis in St. Louis, Missouri.\n  Mr. President, I am not trying to undermine the hard work of the \nconferees for they do have a difficult responsibility. I commend the \nmanagers on both sides of the aisle in working out a careful \ncompromise. Unfortunately, the Agriculture Appropriations conference \nreport is representative of legislative circumvention and the troubling \npractice of pork-barrel spending.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

RES. 264, ESTABLISHING A DAY OF CONCERN \n                   FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nJudiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. Res. \n264 and that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration, that \nthe resolution and preamble be agreed to en bloc, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table without intervening action.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I really regret the objection and I rise \ntoday to really plead with my colleagues to lift the hold on this \nreally simple, bipartisan resolution that simply encourages our \nchildren to stay away from gun violence. I thank my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Kempthorne, who has been working with me to try to \nmove this resolution.\n  In 2 days it will be October 8, the day this resolution calls upon \nthe President to establish a Day of National Concern for Young People \nand Gun Violence. In 2 days, the Senate will have missed an opportunity \nto send a message to our kids that gun violence is the wrong way to \nsolve problems.\n  Fortunately, groups like the National Parent-Teacher Association, \nMothers Against Violence in America, the American Medical Association, \nand others are spreading the word without our help. They are \nencouraging young people all over this country to sign a pledge and \npromise they--will never take a gun to school; will never use a gun to \nsettle a dispute; and will use their influence to prevent friends from \nusing guns to settle disputes. That is what this resolution is about.\n  Mr. President, this is exactly the message the United States Senate \nshould be sending to our children. We want them to make a personal \ncommitment against violence. We want them to help convince their \nfriends to do the same. We want them to join together to fight against \nyouth violence. Just like we should be doing.\n  We must pass this resolution. Let me read to you a list of the \nSenators who have committed themselves to establishing this day of \nconcern and helping steer kids away from violence: Senators Kempthorne, \nLautenberg, Smith of Oregon, Kennedy, Baucus, Specter, Robb, Akaka, \nSarbanes, Chafee, Lieberman, Faircloth, Jeffords, Gorton, Reid of \nNevada, D'Amato, Daschle, Rockefeller, Kerrey of Nebraska, Lugar, \nFeingold, Bumpers, Abraham, Craig, Collins, Wellstone, Cochran, Grams, \nGraham of Florida, Durbin, Boxer, Hutchison, Levin, Glenn, Moseley-\nBraun, Biden, Moynihan, Feinstein, Dodd, Bingaman, Torricelli, Johnson, \nBreaux, Warner, Frist, Inouye, Landrieu, Burns, Kohl, Kerry of \nMassachusetts, Wyden, Conrad, Bumpers, Mikulski, McCain, Snowe, \nNighthorse Campbell, and Bennett. There are 59 Senators who are \ncosponsors of this simple resolution to prevent gun violence amongst \nour youths.\n  We all are convinced the best way to prevent gun violence is by \nreaching out to individual children and helping them make the right \ndecisions. This resolution gives parents, teachers, government leaders, \nservice clubs, police departments, and others a special day to focus on \nthe problems caused by young people and gun violence. October is \nNational Crime Prevention Month--the perfect time to center our \nattention on the special needs of our kids and gun violence.\n  A Minnesota homemaker, Mary Lewis Grow, developed this idea for a Day \nof Concern for Young People and Gun Violence. This will be the third \nyear the Senate has passed a resolution urging kids to take the pledge \nagainst gun violence. In 1997, 47,000 students in Washington State \nsigned the pledge card, as did more than 200,000 children in New York \nCity, and tens of thousands more across the country.\n  Just think of the lives we could have saved if all students had \nsigned--and lived up to--such a pledge last year. Consider that in the \nmonths between today and the day we demonstrated our concern about \nyouth violence last year, we have had an outbreak of school violence. \nEleven students and two teachers have been killed and more than 40 \nstudents have been wounded in shootings by children. In addition, we \nhave lost thousands of children in what has become the all-too-common \nviolence of drive-by shootings, drug wars, and other crime and in self-\ninflicted and unintentional shootings.\n  Last year, Senator Kempthorne and I led the cosponsorship drive of \nthis resolution after his 17-year-old neighbor was murdered by a 19-\nyear-old in a random act of violence in Washington State. Ann Harris' \nparents vowed to transform their grief into an opportunity to help \nteach our young people to care about each other and to stop the \nviolence. This month, they are suffering through the trial of her \naccused killer. We should support them.\n  Mr. President, we must, absolutely must pass this resolution. I urge \nwhomever has a hold on this resolution urging young people to say no to \ngun violence to drop his or her hold and let us send a message from the \nUnited States Senate to every young person in America: Stop gun \nviolence now.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/06/senate-section/article/S11562-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the order of \nbusiness is the agriculture conference report.\n  The Senate continued with consideration of the conference report.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I know that there is a vote at 3:15. I \nwanted the opportunity to address the conference report prior to that \nvote.\n  Let me begin first by complimenting the distinguished Chair for the \nmanner in which he has conducted himself in this debate, as he does \nwith all debate. We may have deep differences of opinion on this \nparticular issue, but in true form he has been a statesman and, I\n\n[[Page S11563]]\n\nthink, a model for all of us in the way he has conducted himself. As I \nsay, I take issue with the bill but certainly not with the manager and \nthe Chair of the committee. He has in so many cases done an outstanding \njob.\n  Let me also applaud our distinguished ranking member. This will \nprobably be the final bill that he manages. He knows how strongly I \nfeel about him and the friendship that I have and feel toward him. He \nis one of the finest Members of the Senate who has ever served, in my \nopinion. We will miss him more than we can ever possibly express. It is \nwith sadness that I acknowledge that this may be his last bill, but it \nis with a great deal of satisfaction in looking back over the past 12 \nyears in my service with him that I share many fond memories and many \nextraordinary legislative success stories.\n  The conference report that is before the Senate is one that I believe \nfails to recognize the extraordinary nature of the circumstances we \nfind ourselves in in the agricultural industry across this country. \nPeople on both sides of the aisle acknowledge the seriousness of the \ncrisis. They acknowledge the fact that prices continue to plummet. Many \nof my colleagues on the Democratic side have indicated that grain \nprices have already fallen at least 25 percent below the 1997 level.\n  I have asked people in the media and around the country to imagine \nwhat would happen if Wall Street prices had fallen in 1 year by 25 \npercent. How many Wall Street Journal articles would we see? How many \nfront page stories in the daily newspapers would we see if prices \nplummeted that far? Obviously, there would be tremendous national \nanxiety about those circumstances.\n  That is exactly what has happened in agriculture. Prices have \nplummeted by more than 25 percent. There are some who believe that \n``business as usual'' is acceptable here. I am not suggesting that our \nRepublican colleagues have approached this matter with that in mind, \nbut I do believe that there is a significant difference of opinion. \nUnfortunately, it does break partly along partisan lines in recognizing \nthe depth of the problem and in dealing with it prior to the time we \nleave this year.\n  Livestock producers today are losing somewhere between $100 and $150 \nper head. A number of States in the Midwest are likely to lose at least \n20 percent of our farmers in the coming year, according to state \nsecretaries of agriculture--these are not my figures, but the \nsecretaries of agriculture in the upper Great Plains who are reporting \nto us that one out of every five farm and ranch families will probably \nbe forced off their farm or ranch as a result of the circumstances we \nare facing today. In South Dakota, that means perhaps as many as 7,000 \nproducers who will no longer have the livelihood they have right now.\n  Nationwide, we expect an $11.4 billion reduction in farm income. That \nis over 20 percent. The sad thing is that the Department of Agriculture \nhas just released new figures to suggest that there is no real hope in \nsight. The fact is, for at least the next 12 months we don't see \ncircumstances improving.\n  The last time the Congress was in a situation similar to this was the \nmid-eighties. At that time, we had a safety net; we had policy \npositions that allowed us the opportunity to respond more equitably. \nSome might argue that maybe we went too far. I don't know, what is too \nfar? All I know is, during that critical timeframe, in 1986 dollars, we \ncommitted $26 billion to respond to the disaster. Now a lot of that was \nnot decided in the Senate, because there was a safety net already in \nplace. But it was so bad, we committed $26 billion in ways that would \nsoften the blow and keep farmers and ranchers on the farm. It did. A \nlot of them dug out, got back in the black, and continued to be \nproductive, tax-paying members of rural communities all across this \ncountry.\n  What we are suggesting is, we can't afford $26 billion, we can't \nafford $20 billion, we can't afford half that amount, $13 billion. All \nwe can probably commit to, given the array of needs that are out there \nand given our circumstances, is $7 billion.\n  The secretaries of agriculture said, ``That isn't enough, we need $9 \nbillion,'' and wrote in a letter to us just last week, ``We need $9 \nbillion, not $7 billion.''\n  What do our Republican colleagues propose? Something less than four--\nover $3 billion, a fraction of what we did in 1986 when the \ncircumstances were as bad as they are now.\n  Mr. President, what we are saying is that given the fact that we \ncould be out of session sine die--that is, without any real expectation \nof coming back before the next Congress--and recognizing that in the \nnext Congress there is very little chance of being back in this \nposition in January or February during the cold winter months, perhaps \nnot even in March or April--it could be at least 6 months before we \nhave a chance to really seriously consider this situation again. We are \nsimply saying that we cannot commit only this meager amount of \nresources to a situation that, in many respects, is every bit as bad if \nnot worse than in 1986. This cannot be the full extent of our response. \nThat is what the President is saying. The President has reluctantly \nsaid that he will veto this legislation. He will either veto it today \nor tomorrow. It will be vetoed this week.\n\n  So there is no doubt that we are going to be coming back and we are \ngoing to have to make a decision as a result of that veto about what we \ndo. Our hope is that our colleagues can come to some resolution \nquickly. It appears that we are going to have to go through the veto to \ncome back to the table. But, indeed, we will come back.\n  So, Mr. President, that is where I believe we have found ourselves. \nWe must, when we come back, negotiate a relief package that is based at \nleast on several principles that I hope will enjoy broad, bipartisan \nsupport. First, we must have strong indemnity-related relief for \nfarmers with no crop, and meaningful income relief for farmers with a \ncrop at low prices. In other words, there are two categories of farmers \nwho are in desperate condition today. In many cases in the South, we \nhave a problem of farmers not having a crop. I know that is especially \ntrue in Louisiana, and I suspect it is true in other Southern States as \nwell. In the Northeastern States, we have a problem of having a crop, \nbut absolutely no prices. And so we have circumstances that vary, \ndepending on the geographic area. Whatever it is we do, I hope we can \nagree that both circumstances have to be addressed.\n  Secondly, income assistance must be linked to 1998 crop year \nproduction. We don't know what it is going to be in 1999. We are told \nit is not going to get any better. So we must focus on the 1998 crop \nyear and target producers, not just anyone with an AMTA or Freedom to \nFarm contract, but all producers who otherwise will have no hope of \nfinding the kind of financial security or relief that they need to get \nthrough these winter months.\n  I hope, Mr. President, that we also could agree, on a bipartisan \nbasis, that losses born by livestock producers who have never had a \nfarm program, and for whom fair trade legislation is critical, could be \ndealt with successfully as well. There are two things that the Senate \ndid in July that I hope, on a bipartisan basis, we could restore once \nwe come back to the table. The first is country of origin meat \nlabeling. I don't think there is anything that would help more, \npsychologically as well as financially, than to have the same \nrequirement for meat that we have for virtually every other imported \nproduct--labeling. Our farmers and ranchers have said that they believe \nthat, more than anything else, this would improve competition in the \nretail and wholesale marketplaces. If the American consumer knew what \nit was they were eating and where it was from, our farmers and ranchers \nagree almost unanimously that they would be in a much stronger and \ncompetitive position.\n  The second is to do something that they talk about almost anywhere I \ngo in the country, but especially in the Dakotas, and my home State of \nSouth Dakota in particular, and that is improve price transparency. \nIncrease market reporting of prices paid for livestock, specifically by \nthe big packers of formula contract prices. We all know what is \nhappening right now. Secret contracts are being signed with no \nappreciation for what the market is. That has a devastating effect on \nthe marketplace. Farmers are left in the dark. It would be like going \nto buy a car or a pickup, or any kind of product, and not knowing what \nthe price was\n\n[[Page S11564]]\n\nand not knowing what the comparable prices are in the industry and \nwondering, based upon your best judgment, whether you were getting a \ngood deal or not. We would not do that were we buying a car. We could \nnot do that if we were buying a house. Yet, every day our farmers and \nranchers are expected to pit themselves against the big packers and try \nto guess, using some crystal ball that they don't have, what the market \nlooks like out there. So they are given a price, and in a very short \ntimeframe, they have to decide whether that is a good deal or not. They \nare losing $100 to $150 a head right now. So we know what kind of deals \nthey are getting.\n  We need price transparency. The Senate responded favorably to both of \nthose proposals, but unfortunately they were dropped in conference. I \nam very hopeful that they can be restored. These are steps we can take \nimmediately that will send a clear message that we understand the \ncircumstances that livestock producers are in. And now is the time for \nus to deal with it, not next spring after we have lost tens of \nthousands of producers all over the country.\n  Some of these matters that we have debated have a cost-related \nfunction. Mr. President, there is no cost to labeling, and there is no \ncost to mandatory price reporting. Keep in mind, we are suggesting that \nwe would even settle, at least at this point, for a pilot study of \nthose options. Let's analyze what happens when we have full price \nreporting. Let's analyze what happens when we have meat labeling. We \nare willing to sunset both of these in 2 to 3 years in an effort to \nevaluate whether or not they have worked. At least let's get started. I \ndon't think that is too much to ask.\n  So, Mr. President, that is why many of us have taken such a strong \nposition on this conference report. Number one, it is our last shot at \nproviding some meaningful economic assistance to agriculture, and, \nnumber two, it is an opportunity that we may not have again for 7 or 8 \nmonths. We can't wait that long. Our package--the proposal that we are \nhoping our colleagues would consider--is fair, and it is balanced among \nall regions suffering low prices and disaster. It is targeted to the \npeople who need it; that is, producers of 1998 crops. It is fiscally \nresponsible. Price relief is linked to the market price, and it \naddresses the real needs of agriculture.\n  Mr. President, what time remains? Is time allocated to both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was an hour, equally divided, starting \nat 2:15, with a vote scheduled at 3:15.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. How much time remains on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has just under 6\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I see no other Democratic Senators on the \nfloor, so I will use the remainder of the time.\n  We believe that our proposal is also fiscally responsible. We link \nprice relief to the market price, and we certainly recognize that it \naddresses the real problems that we are facing across the board in \nagriculture. I think our colleagues on the other side have failed to \naddress the dual nature of the crisis --that is, loss of crops and loss \nof income. I believe they are failing to recognize the severity of the \ncrisis. As I noted earlier, Mr. President, our Secretaries of \nAgriculture--the Association of State Departments of Agriculture--held \nan emergency conference last week to propose to us what they believe \nought to be done. Frankly, they said both of our relief packages were \ninadequate. They said that even $7 billion was inadequate, and even all \nthe policy changes we are recommending did not do what they felt was \nneeded to address the level of need they see today. So if $7 billion \nand all of the policy changes we have recommended doesn't even cut it, \n$3.5 billion doesn't cut it, either.\n  Over 150 Members of the House voted to send this bill back to \nconference. I hope that a large number of our colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle will agree to send it back as well. We simply can't leave \nthis Congress without providing essential disaster relief.\n  We must not lose this opportunity. We have a true emergency--an \nemergency that I think jeopardizes farmers' and ranchers' survival in a \nmyriad of ways, and the survival, frankly, of rural communities all \nacross this country. The loss in income that we are seeing has already \nstarted to translate into lost farms and ranches.\n  When I was home recently a friend told me that a banker he knows is \ngoing to be forced to foreclose on 35 farms in just one small community \nin South Dakota alone this winter. The banker is so disturbed by what \nhe is experiencing that he has actually joined a community prayer group \njust to deal with the stress he is feeling.\n  Another friend who is concerned about the impact that the depressed \nfarm economy is having on communities generally, said that a local \ncleaning service has laid off all of its employees because they have \nhad no business since the end of July.\n  These stories and many, many more are unfolding across the country. \nAs my colleagues have noted already during this debate, we simply \ncannot leave until we have successfully dealt with this matter. I hope \nthat we can earnestly come to some closure, successfully recognizing \nthe importance of this issue and dealing with it in as comprehensive a \nmanner as is humanly possible. The stakes are too high. The \nramifications of failure are too high. Our only real chance to address \nthis matter now is with this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I urge a ``no'' vote on the conference report. I will \nsupport the President's veto. More than enough Members of this Senate \nhave indicated already that they will support the President's veto. \nWhen that happens, let's get back to work, and let's deal with this \nissue successfully.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe distinguished Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, first of all, let me thank the Senator from \nMississippi for the work that he has done on this agriculture \nappropriations bill. It is a very difficult one. It is a large bill of \n$56 billion. It is very difficult. It comes at a time when we are \nseeking, I think properly, to make a transition from the old farm \nprograms with the acreage allotments and the subsidies to a market \nsystem which, in my State at least, most farmers and ranchers believe \nwe should do. Coupled with that, of course, has come some unfortunate \nweather disasters, flooding and those kinds of things and crop failures \nas well. And certainly the Asian currency problem has had an impact in \nterms of available foreign markets, which is very important when nearly \n40 percent of agricultural products are sold in that way.\n  So now we are faced with the problem of seeking to deal with these \nproblems. Everybody wants to do that. Everybody wants to be helpful for \nagriculture. Then we need to find the proper way to do it. We need to \nbe able to do this in a way that I think does not cause us to deviate \nfrom our policy position, which is to return to a marketplace in \nagriculture.\n  We are doing a great deal for agriculture in this bill. There will be \ntransition payments. There will be payments for disasters. As a matter \nof fact, as I understand it, the figures that I have indicate that \nthrough 1996 and 1998 farmers have been paid approximately $17 billion \nunder the old bill. That would have been $10 billion. There has been a \nsubstantial increase there. Farmers will receive approximately $500 \nbillion from the banks in transition payments in October of this year.\n  Actually all these numbers added together equal $31 billion paid to \nfarmers and ranchers over the past 3 years. If you take the 1998 bonus \nin advance for 1999, we would be paying $15 billion out in this 1 year.\n  There is a substantial interest being made and properly being made. \nThere are other things, in my view, that need to be done as well. We \nneed to do something about increasing foreign markets, of course. I \nhappen to be on the Foreign Relations Committee and am chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Asia. We are trying to do some things to reclaim that \nmarket--in all kinds of ways to get those markets back, particularly \nfor agriculture.\n  We have done something about the unilateral sanctions--the idea that \nif\n\n[[Page S11565]]\n\nsomething happens in Asia or Pakistan that the first thing you do is \nsanction off the sales of agricultural products. We have made some \nchanges there, as indeed we should.\n  I believe we should move forward in doing something with income \naveraging on a permanent basis for agriculture. This is the kind of an \nindustry where you may have a very good year, or have a very poor year, \nand you should be able to income average.\n  We need savings accounts for farmers so they hold back in good years \nso they are able to do better.\n  Crop insurance--crop interests need to be revised the way it came out \nof the farm bill. That was changed and has not been effective. We need \nto do that.\n  It is interesting. Our friends on the other side of the aisle talk \nabout this increase, and the President is now making speeches on \nSaturday, and so on. It turns out that he started out asking for less \nthan $1 billion. It went up to $2 billion, and suddenly politically he \nhas gone up to $7 billion, and probably more.\n  We have to really deal with this on that basis.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to say that I am disappointed in a couple of \nareas. I come from a State, of course, where the major activity in \nagriculture is livestock--cattle and sheep. I was very much interested \nin our moving forward with this matter of labels; this country of \norigin kind of thing so that buyers could decide what kind of meats \nthey choose to buy, whether they want to have American-made meats or \nmeats from other countries. But they should be able to know that. We \nput that in the Senate bill and lost it in the conference. I am very \ndisappointed in that.\n  We also, I believe, need to have our market reporting strengthened so \nthat all the cattle and all of the sheep that go in the market will be \nreported as part of the market, not those things that are held by \npackers and never reported that would impact the crisis.\n  I am disappointed in those things. I hope that we can go forward.\n  There is some indication apparently from the conference committee \nthat we would go forward with the study of the labeling. I hope we do.\n  On the other hand, I think it is going to be slow that way. I wish, \nfrankly, that we could change it before we have to go back and do it \nthat way.\n  Mr. President, I just wanted to say that I admire very much the work \nthat has been done. I know we must do something in agriculture. We are \npoised to do something.\n  I wanted to point out the two areas of disappointment that I have--\nthat of labeling in the country of origin, and that of transparency in \nmarket prices. We need something we can do about that.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the time. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, may I inquire? How much time remains on \nthe conference report on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi has 16 minutes; \nthe minority has 2 minutes 21 seconds.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am not managing time on our side. Did \nthe Chair say the minority has 2 minutes 21 seconds remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I wonder if my very great, good friend, the Senator from \nMississippi, would yield me some time, although I must upfront say that \nI am arguing against the conference report.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, let me inquire of the Senator, how much \ntime does he seek?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I was going to speak maybe 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I have no objection.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank my very, very good friend from Tennessee--\nMississippi----\n  Mr. COCHRAN. If you do not get my State right, I will not yield time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I will use some of my time to praise you because that is \nvery generous of the Senator from Mississippi, and it is typical of his \ngenerosity and his graciousness. He is a very, very fine man.\n  Mr. President, sometimes we have to disagree with one another, and I \nam about to say that as much as I respect and admire the Senator from \nMississippi, I have a different view than he has on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I rise toady to express my profound disappointment in \nthe conference report before the Senate.\n  The words of our forefathers speak volumes about many topics, \nincluding this one. ``Blessed is the man who expects nothing, for he \nshall never be disappointed.'' These words were written in a letter \nfrom Alexander Pope over 270 years ago. They paraphrase biblical verse. \nI believe they speak to rural America today about the farm relief \nprovisions included in this conference report.\n  But more accurately they speak to the matters excluded from this \npackage.\n  This package should include meaningful relief for farmers in the \nworst economic crunch of this decade. Instead, it includes a pittance. \nWhile the conferees could have adopted a package that provided roughly \n60 cents per bushel on wheat in addition to what farmers get now, which \nis virtually nothing in the market, the conferees did not provide that \n60 cents. Instead, the bill provides 13 cents per bushel. That is how \nit works out.\n\n  Frankly, I am stunned. I assumed that when the conferees met they \nwould work out some kind of compromise. The Democratic package had \neliminated the loan caps, it had the country of origin labeling, a \nprovision providing for price reporting on a pilot project basis of fat \ncattle bought by packers. It included several provisions which would \nhave helped farmers just a little bit.\n  On the other side of the aisle, on the Republican side, there was not \nmuch at all; as I said, 13 cents as opposed to 60 cents, with respect \nto wheat.\n  Mr. President, this package could only satisfy a farmer who expects \nnothing. I fear, as I hear from disillusioned producers across Montana, \nfar too many producers expect this Congress to fail in the effort to \nhelp out.\n  They believe instead that their pleas are falling on deaf ears. Their \ndisaster is being seen in academic terms. Their future--the survival of \ntheir farms and ranches has become little more than a laboratory test \nof the farm policy enacted a couple years ago.\n  I still believe in our producers--the top industry in our state. But \nthat very industry that generated about $2 billion in sales last year \nwill lose nearly $200 million this year. The Republican package will \nshort Montana producers another $100 million. Then multiply it by our \ntreacherous rank--46th in the Nation for per capita income--and you get \na grand total of $300 million that Montana can't afford to lose--not on \nthe farm and not on Main Street. Thus, what we do now portends what \nwill happen in the next year in our rural communities.\n  I think it is very irresponsible to end this Congress without \nmeaningful relief for our farmers and ranchers. We need to eliminate \nthe loan rate cap for this year and provide the funding to make it \nwork.\n  We need to mandate country of origin labeling on meat. And we need to \nrequire price reporting on the livestock sold each day.\n  We need to treat this situation like the crisis it is to producers \nacross Montana and across our country.\n  Mr. President, I assumed the two sides would get together and work \nout some kind of compromise. That is not what happened. Instead, the \nmajority party--I do not like being partisan about this stuff but I \njust have to be accurate--the majority party did not compromise at all. \nThey just stuck with their 13 cents and also stuck with rejecting \ncountry of origin labeling on beef, stuck with rejecting entirely the \npilot project on mandatory price reporting, instead replacing it with a \nstudy--essentially totally agreed to a pittance to farmers.\n  I must say, Mr. President--this is no exaggeration, I am not \nexaggerating--farmers find this an insult. They find it a slap in the \nface. They cannot believe that the U.S. Congress is sitting here in \nmany respects worried more about Ken Starr--certainly the majority \nside--than they are about paying attention to farmers and what is \nhappening in the country.\n  I have to tell you, Mr. President, it is really a bad situation in \nfarm country.\n\n[[Page S11566]]\n\nBankers are not going to be able to extend loans. Worse than that, they \nare going to begin to call in loans. Implement dealers, car dealers, \ngrocery stores, hardware stores in farm communities are finding their \nsales way down. That means they have to start digging deeper into their \npockets. This is the worst situation I have seen in at least 10 or 12 \nyears. And 10 or 12 years ago, in the late 1980s when farmers were \nfacing about the same situation--again, through no fault of their own, \nbecause of drought and because of world conditions--Congress spent \nabout $16 billion to help farmers.\n  Mr. President, 10 or 12 years ago we spent $16 billion. Today the \nDemocratic side is asking for, not $16 billion, $7 billion; and the \nRepublican side said no, no, not even $7 billion, but $4 billion. We \nare saying, we on our side of the aisle: Hey, $4 billion is an insult. \nIt is a slap in the face.\n  I plead with Senators to go back again and see if we can figure out \nsome way to agree, if not to the full 7, to virtually the 7.\n  Another point: I have been in the Senate a few years. I voted for the \nNew York City bailout, I voted for the Chrysler bailout, I voted for \nCalifornia disaster assistance. Guess what. All those efforts have been \nrepaid--in spades.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask the Senator for 1 minute on the time of our side.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I yield 1 minute.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. When we loaned money to New York City a few years ago, \nNew York repaid that loan with interest, ahead of time. When we loaned \nChrysler Corporation money to get its feet back on the ground, that \nloan was repaid ahead of time. I am just saying, today, if we can help \nfarmers a little bit today with the conditions they face through no \nfault of their own, because the world market supply is so large and the \nprice is so low, and the Asian economic crisis, at the very least that \nwill be repaid back again in spades.\n  I urge my colleagues, please show a little bit of statesmanship and \nvote to help this part of our country. It is going to come back and \nhelp all of us as a nation.\n  I thank very much my very good friend from Mississippi, again, for \nhis very generous offer to give me some time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield myself the remainder of the time \non our side.\n  Let me say to the distinguished Senator from Montana, I appreciate \nhis courtesies as well. It is a pleasure working with him on these \nissues. I am sorry we have to disagree on some of the issues contained \nin this agriculture appropriations conference report.\n  On the subject that the Senator mentions, and also the Democratic \nleader when he was speaking mentioned as a reason why the President \nought to veto this legislation, was the question of price reporting and \nmeat labeling. These are two separate issues. Frankly, I was surprised \nby the comments and also including this as a basis for urging the \nPresident to veto the legislation.\n  When we passed our bill in July, we received the reaction following \nthat, after the administration had an opportunity to study the \nlegislation--we received the reaction in a formal letter from the \nSecretary of Agriculture dated September 24, a ``Dear Thad'' letter \nfrom Dan Glickman.\n  Included is a table going down through the bills. This is prior to \nconference now--I think that is right--prior to our going to the \nconference with the House conferees to work out differences between the \nHouse- and Senate-passed bills. In Secretary Glickman's letter pointing \nout their reaction to the Senate-passed bill and the provisions in the \nHouse bill, they get down to the meat labeling provision, which is \ntitle X in the Senate bill. There is no House provision on that \nsubject. The USDA position as conveyed in this letter to me says: \nWorking with Congress to address concerns about adverse trade effects \nand concerns that implementation would divert resources needed to \naddress important food safety issues.\n  We tried to work with the administration, and did, to address those \nconcerns. If the administration had been supportive of the meat \nlabeling provisions, they would have said so, because they go right \ndown through the list and support some other provisions. Or if they \nopposed it, they point it out and they say so.\n  Here is another example, the Biodiesel Energy Development Act, which \nthe administration says, to a separate bill in the House, the \nadministration opposes.\n  The administration did not say that they supported the meat labeling. \nThey suggested they had concerns about it and they wanted to work with \nthe Congress to address those concerns. So here is what we did in \nconference to try to address those concerns. We provided conference \nreport language, statement of managers, to this effect:\n\n       The conferees direct the Secretary to conduct a \n     comprehensive study on the potential effects of mandatory \n     country of origin labeling of imported fresh muscle cuts of \n     beef and lamb. The report shall include the impact of such \n     requirements on imports, exports, livestock producers, \n     consumers, processors, packers, distributors and grocers.\n\n  We went on to say:\n\n       The report shall be submitted to Congress no later than 6 \n     months after the enactment of this Act, and shall contain a \n     detailed statement of the findings and conclusions of the \n     Secretary, together with his recommendations for such \n     legislation and administrative actions as he considers \n     appropriate.\n\n  I have suggested to the Senate that the action taken by the conferees \nis responsive to the objections and concerns that were raised in our \nletter from the administration on that subject. And here, at the very \nlast minute, the Democratic leader raises this issue and spends a good \ndeal of his time talking about this as the reason why the \nadministration ought to veto the conference report.\n  Another subject that was raised was price reporting. We also got a \nletter from the Office of Management and Budget as well as the \nSecretary of Agriculture, responding to our bill and suggesting things \nthat they think need the attention of conferees. If they have \nobjections to provisions, they say so in either the OMB letter or the \nSecretary of Agriculture's letter.\n  On the subject of price reporting, there was a USDA request to review \nany final language adopted by the conferees. Here is what the conferees \nprovided in the statement of managers on that issue:\n\n       The conferees direct the Secretary of Agriculture to take \n     steps to increase the voluntary reporting of fed cattle, and \n     wholesale beef carcass prices and volumes on a quality and \n     yield-grade basis, as well as the prices and volumes of boxed \n     beef. . . The Secretary shall encourage the reporting of the \n     price differential for USDA Prime, the upper 2/3 of USDA \n     Choice, and a sub-select price category. Reports should \n     include imported beef products and livestock.\n\n  Then we go on to say:\n\n       The Secretary of Agriculture shall compile and publish \n     price, volume sales, and the shipment information regarding \n     all exports and imports of beef, veal, lamb, and products \n     thereof which is collected via the expanded voluntary \n     process. . . . The Secretary shall also standardize the \n     Agriculture Marketing Service price reporting data \n     collection activities to ensure uniformity and complete \n     sales data capture and to maximize the information \n     available to all aspects of the industry.\n       The Secretary shall report to Congress, not more than 6 \n     months after enactment, on the feasibility or need for \n     mandatory price reporting. . .\n\n  I suggest, Mr. President, that the conferees have done a very good \njob of trying to deal with these two issues in this conference. We have \nresponded to the concerns expressed by the Secretary of Agriculture in \nhis letter to us of September 24 giving us his reaction to our bill. \nNever did they single out in the letters to us that this would trigger \na veto if we didn't do such and such with either one of those \nprovisions. There was no such suggestion made.\n  There was a veto threat in the letter from the Director of the Office \nof Management and Budget, and here is what the veto threat says:\n\n       If the bill presented to the President includes the \n     unacceptable FDA language--\n\n  And, by the way, that has been removed from the bill in conference, \nthe so-called RU486 issue--\n\n       and agriculture disaster provisions that provide inadequate \n     indemnity assistance or are inconsistent with the Daschle/\n     Harkin proposal, his senior advisers would recommend that he \n     veto the bill. We look forward to working with you to resolve \n     these concerns.\n\n\n[[Page S11567]]\n\n\n  The veto message, if this is a veto message, is that if we don't \nenact the Daschle/Harkin disaster indemnity assistance proposal, then \nthe senior advisers will recommend to the President that he veto the \nbill.\n  We have talked about the disaster assistance proposal and why we \nthink the direct assistance is much to be preferred over rewriting a \nportion of the 1996 farm bill as proposed by Daschle/Harkin, and we \ncertainly think that is not good policy. It won't serve to increase \nprices for farmers at market, which is what we are trying to do to help \nensure a brighter future for American production agriculture.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Senate to approve the conference report on \nAgriculture appropriations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I wonder if I may be yielded 1 minute or 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am happy to yield a minute to the distinguished \nSenator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized \nfor 1 minute.\n\n\n                             methyl bromide\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, this bill contains a rider that addresses \nmethyl bromide use. It is an anti-environmental rider offered by a few \nmembers of the other party, and slipped into the bill by the conference \ncommittee. It has not been debated by either body, and yet this \nlanguage amends the Clean Air Act and constrains our ability to \nnegotiate a more rapid phase-out of methyl bromide use with other \nnations.\n  Just last week, the White House, and specifically Vice President \nGore, called on the Congress to end what he called ``backdoor \nassaults'' on the environment. I sincerely hope that the President and \nVice President mean that to apply to all anti-environmental riders, \nincluding the ones offered by their own party.\n  This methyl bromide rider began as an effort to address a legitimate \nproblem, but changes sought by a few members of the other party go too \nfar. Methyl bromide is highly toxic and a potent ozone depleting \ncompound. It is also one of the most widely used pesticides in the \nUnited States. The 1994 Montreal Protocol requires a gradual phase-out \nof methyl bromide beginning next year. Industrialized countries have \nagreed to a phase-out by 2005, while developing nations must phase-out \nmethyl bromide by 2015. In the United States, the Clean Air Act \nrequires an even earlier phase-out date for methyl bromide--January 1, \n2001.\n  I share the concern that the Clean Air Act's accelerated phase-out \nschedule might put our farmers at a competitive disadvantage. However, \nI believe that addressing this problem in the context of an \nappropriations bill is entirely inappropriate. Putting constraints on \nan international treaty and modifying a major environmental statute \ndemands thoughtful debate. To do this with a rider on an appropriations \nbill allows almost no debate.\n  The principle argument for action on methyl bromide has been the \npotential competitive disadvantage for American agriculture. As I said, \nI am sympathetic to that problem, and I support the idea that we should \nallow the Montreal Protocol to dictate the phase-out in this nation. \nBut the language added to this bill would prohibit any phase-out \nearlier than the date currently contained in the Protocol--2005.\n  Could the deadline for phase-out be accelerated if, a few years down \nthe road, the international community decides that effective, \naffordable alternatives to methyl bromide exist? Not if we approve this \nrider. This language says that--no matter what--the United States will \nnot end methyl bromide use before 2005. The international community is \nnot going to negotiate an earlier date, because they know that the U.S. \nwill not comply with an earlier date. Inclusion of that language \nguarantees that worldwide methyl bromide use will continue until 2005.\n  This is an inappropriate limitation on our options regarding methyl \nbromide and our ability to negotiate changes to an international \ntreaty. More importantly, a last minute appropriations rider is a bad \nway to amend the Clean Air Act. I can only hope that the President, the \nVice President, and Democratic Senators who have spoken against other \nriders intend to oppose all anti-environmental riders, not just those \noffered by Republicans.\n  Mr. President, I am distressed over the methyl bromide amendment \nwhich is an antienvironmental rider that was put into this conference \nreport. It wasn't debated by either body, yet the language amends the \nClean Air Act and constrains our ability to negotiate a more rapid \nphaseout of methyl bromide when used by other nations.\n  I point out that the principal argument for action on methyl bromide \nhas been the potential competitive disadvantage for American \nagriculture. I am sympathetic of that, and I support the idea we should \nallow the Montreal Protocol to dictate the phaseout of this. If we \ndon't like it, then we should amend it.\n  The present time for the phaseout is 2005 but could be earlier. What \nthis legislation does is makes it no later than 2005 but prevents it \nfrom being earlier than 2005. In those intervening 7 years, there well \ncould be developed an alternative to methyl bromide. I think this is an \nunfortunate provision in the bill. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference \nreport accompanying the Department of Agriculture and related agencies \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 1999.\n  The final bill provides $59.6 billion in new budget authority (BA) \nand $44.8 billion in new outlays to fund most of the programs of the \nDepartment of Agriculture and other related agencies. All of the \nfunding in this bill is nondefense spending. The conference report now \nincludes ``emergency'' funding totaling $4.3 billion in budget \nauthority and $4.1 billion in outlays to provide relief to the nation's \nfarmers.\n  When outlays for prior-year appropriations and other adjustments are \ntaken into account, the conference agreement totals $59.4 billion in BA \nand $51.6 billion in outlays for fiscal year 1999. Including mandatory \nsavings, the subcommittee is $1 million in budget authority below its \n302(b) allocation, and at its 302(b) allocation for outlays.\n  The Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee revised 302(b) \nallocation totals $59.4 billion in budget authority (BA) and $51.6 \nbillion in outlays. Within this amount, $17.9 billion in BA and $18.1 \nbillion in outlays is for nondefense discretionary spending, including \nagricultural emergency spending.\n  For discretionary spending in the bill, and counting (scoring) all \nthe mandatory savings in the bill, the final bill is $4.0 billion in BA \nand $3.9 billion in outlays above the President's budget request for \nthese programs. The bill is at least $4 billion in both BA and outlays \nabove the Senate- and House-passed bills, all due to the addition of \nthe emergency disaster assistance for farmers.\n  The disaster aid package includes $2.2 billion in direct payments to \nfarmers experiencing crop losses due to natural and other disasters. \nThe Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act as amended \nprohibits ``emergency'' spending for purposes of crop disaster \nassistance. The conference agreement includes directed scorekeeping \nlanguage allowing the emergency designation to be used in this case. \nThis conference report therefore violates Section 306(a) of the \nCongressional Budget Act by including legislative language under the \njurisdiction of the Budget Committee that was not reported by the \nSenate Budget Committee.\n  I recognize the difficulty of bringing this bill to the floor at its \n302(b) allocation and in addressing the need for disaster assistance by \nfarmers in many parts of the nation, including New Mexico and parts of \nthe Southwest.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nSenate Budget Committee scoring of the final bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S11568]]\n\n\n\n              H.R. 4101, AGRICULTURE APPROPRIATIONS, 1999--SPENDING COMPARISONS--CONFERENCE REPORT\n                                   [Fiscal year 1999, in millions of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                   Defense     Nondefense     Crime      Mandatory      Total\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConference Report:\n    Budget authority...........................  ...........       17,909  ...........       41,460       59,369\n    Outlays....................................  ...........       18,121  ...........       33,429       51,550\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget authority...........................  ...........       17,910  ...........       41,460       59,370\n    Outlays....................................  ...........       18,121  ...........       33,429       51,550\n1998 level:\n    Budget authority...........................  ...........       13,930  ...........       35,048       48,978\n    Outlays....................................  ...........       14,227  ...........       35,205       49,432\nPresident's request:\n    Budget authority...........................  ...........       13,672  ...........       41,460       55,132\n    Outlays....................................  ...........       14,056  ...........       33,429       47,485\nHouse-passed bill:\n    Budget authority...........................  ...........       13,596  ...........       41,460       55,056\n    Outlays....................................  ...........       14,031  ...........       33,429       47,460\nSenate-passed bill:\n    Budget authority...........................  ...........       13,698  ...........       41,460       55,158\n    Outlays....................................  ...........       14,069  ...........       33,429       47,498\nConference Report compared to:\n    Senate 302(b) allocation:\n        Budget authority.......................  ...........           -1  ...........  ...........           -1\n        Outlays................................  ...........  ...........  ...........  ...........  ...........\n    1998 level:\n        Budget authority.......................  ...........        3,979  ...........        6,412       10,391\n        Outlays................................  ...........        3,894  ...........       -1,776        2,118\n    President's request:\n        Budget authority.......................  ...........        4,237  ...........  ...........        4,237\n        Outlays................................  ...........        4,065  ...........  ...........        4,065\n    House-passed bill:\n        Budget authority.......................  ...........        4,313  ...........  ...........        4,313\n        Outlays................................  ...........        4,090  ...........  ...........        4,090\n    Senate-passed bill:\n        Budget authority.......................  ...........        4,211  ...........  ...........        4,211\n        Outlays................................  ...........        4,052  ...........  ...........        4,052\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 12 seconds.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I join my friend and colleague, Senator \nCochran, in bringing to the floor the conference report to accompany \nH.R. 4101, the fiscal year 1999 appropriations bill for agriculture, \nrural development and related agencies. This is the last annual \nagriculture appropriations bill which I will jointly author with my \nfriend from Mississippi, and I regret to report that the progress this \nyear has not been as smooth as in years past. Last year, my fellow \nconferees were able to conclude the business of the committee on \nconference in approximately 5 minutes. By contrast, it took us 5 days \nthis year and I fear, at this late date, all hurdles toward enactment \nare not fully cleared. In fact, I, along with all Senate Democrat \nmembers of the conference committee who attached our signatures to the \nofficial conference papers, did so with an exception to one of the \ntitles included in the conference report.\n  Aside from the one area still in disagreement, the conference report \nbefore us is as good a product as was possible under the budgetary \nconstraints we faced. We include in this measure nearly $52 million in \nnew spending for food safety. This figure is well below the budget \nrequest, but represents a good increase in spending for the Department \nof Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration to help ensure that \nour Nation's food supplies remain the safest in the world.\n  The conference report also provides adequate levels for the Women, \nInfants, and Children (WIC) Program, including an increase for the WIC \nFarmers Market Program of up to $15 million. Overall, the USDA food \nassistance programs remain the single largest component of this \nconference report, totaling $36 billion in new spending.\n  Rural development is another key element of this conference report. \nIncluded is more than $4.25 billion in rural housing program levels and \nnearly $725 million in budget authority for the Rural Community \nAdvancement Program, which includes the water and wastewater program. I \nhave seen firsthand the benefits these programs bring to rural areas in \nmy State and I am glad we were able to achieve these levels for the \ncoming year. Also, the conference report includes a special recognition \nfor the needs of the Lower Mississippi River Delta, an often overlooked \nregion of our Nation that has long deserved our special attention. I \nhave worked for many years to improve conditions in this region and I \nam happy to have included special consideration for the delta in this \nmeasure.\n  Agricultural research continues to receive the attention of our \nsubcommittee. The level of spending for the Agricultural Research \nService in this conference report is higher than either the House or \nSenate levels prior to conference. In addition, we were able to \nincrease the levels of funding for basic formula research for our \nNation's 1862, 1890, and 1994 institutions. Funding for these \ninstitutions has been frozen for far too long, and this conference \nreport provides a 7 percent increase above last year. Enhanced \nagricultural research is a commitment the Congress has made to our \nfarmers and consumers and this conference report lies up to that \ncommitment.\n  I would be most remissed if I didn't pause to give credit, to my \nfriend, Senator Cochran, for facing the grim budgetary challenge we \nfaced this year. Our allocation was well below what was available for \nfiscal year 1998 and going into conference we had to adjust our numbers \ndownward toward the lower House allocation. Our task was made even more \ndifficult by the assumed enactment of hundreds of millions of dollars \nin user fees that looked good on paper but only served to raise faint \nexpectations beyond what was possible. This conference report includes \na general provision that will, hopefully, forestall the use of \nprojected user fees in next year's budget and keep everyone working \nwithin a budgetary framework more closely associated with the realities \nwe all must face.\n  Given my years of work on this subcommittee, and my close friendship \nwith Senator Cochran, I am greatly saddened by my reluctance to \ngive unequivocal support for all matters contained in this conference \nreport. As we began conference deliberations with the House, the \nPresident made it clear that two items under discussion were of such \nimportance that their inclusion in the conference report would result \nin a veto. I must admit that I never thought the agriculture \nappropriations bill would ever be the target of a Presidential veto. In \nfact, the agriculture appropriations bill is usually approved by the \nSenate 100 to 0. I remind my colleagues that a few years go when much \nof the Federal Government faced a shutdown from failed appropriations \nbills, the agencies funded under this bill were among the few not \nincluded in that Governmental debacle. Such has been the history of the \nagriculture appropriations process during my tenure and it saddens me \nto think that I might be leaving the Senate with that possibility \nlurking as strongly as it does today.\n\n[[Page S11569]]\n\n  One of the items which drew the attention of the President was a \nprovision in the House bill that placed a limitation on the Food and \nDrug Administration's funding for any testing, development, or approval \nof the drug RU-486, a chemical used to induce an abortion. Leaving for \na moment the argument that science is better left to scientists than \npoliticians, the inclusion of the abortion debate in the agriculture \nappropriations bill was a most unfortunate attempt to drag this bill \ndown with one of the most divisive and politically charged issues of \nour time. I am very pleased to report that the Senate conferees made it \ncrystal clear that the Senate was not going to allow the issue of \nabortion to infect the agriculture appropriations bill with the same \nparalysis that has inflicted other subcommittees. If the Senate had not \nheld firm, a very bad precedent would have been set and all agriculture \nappropriations bills in the future would become the venue for, and be \nheld hostage by, an issue best reserved for other forums.\n  The other item of Presidential disapproval is tied to the levels of \nassistance for farmers and ranchers who are facing the most pressing \nfinancial times in recent years, maybe ever. It is on this point that I \nhad to part with my friend Senator Cochran and express an opinion that \nour measure falls short of meeting current needs.\n  The conference report includes provisions put forward by the majority \nparty that strives to bring relief to farmers and ranchers who are \nsuffering from lost crops and low prices. However, my concern is with \nthe manner in which the assistance is to be provided. In order to help \nfarmers suffering from low prices, the conference report would simply \nallow for additional ``Freedom to Farm'' payments to go to all \nproducers who hold a Agricultural Market Transition Act contract. The \nfallacy with this approach is that it does not target the additional \nfunds to people who are suffering from either crop failure or fallen \nprices. Instead, it makes funds available to landlords who may have \nreceived cash rent for their lands, suffered no loss at all, and in \nmany instances never even faced a risk of loss in the first place.\n  We have to recognize that many, though not all, farmers across \nAmerica are suffering. Most are suffering from losses this year, but \nsome from losses over several years. Some farmers have a crop to \nharvest, but low prices preclude any chance of a profit. The purpose of \nthe Democratic alternative for disaster assistance is to make sure the \nrelief payments go to those in need.\n  I have heard from farmers in my State who have lost everything this \nyear. They tell me that this year is worse than the crop failures of \n1980, which was the worst year since the Great Depression. The \nDemocratic alternative provides more relief, 100 percent more in fact, \nfor farmers in my State and I feel we should not turn our backs on the \none segment of the national economy that has not been surging into \ndouble digit profits on Wall Street. The President has indicated he \nwill veto this bill if additional farm relief is not added. Congress \nneeds to act swiftly to amend the shortfall in this bill and send to \nthe President a package that truly meets the needs of farmers and \nranchers.\n  Mr. President, this brings me to the close of my last annual \nagriculture appropriations bill on the floor of the Senate. I want to \nonce more thank my distinguished colleague, Senator Cochran, for his \nyears of friendship on and off this subcommittee. I also want to thank \nall other members for their cooperation over the years.\n  Mr. President, I say in closing that this is a very complex matter, \nthis matter of disaster relief. The only disagreement on this side and \nthe other side of the aisle is over the disaster provisions. As I say, \nthey are both fairly complicated, and I am hoping that if the President \nvetoes the bill, as he has promised to do, we will be able to work out \nsomething--maybe not everything the President wanted, maybe more than \nothers wanted--and that we will be able to reach a compromise that will \nactually take care of farmers.\n  My fear is that, this being what I consider probably the worst year \nin the history for agriculture since the Great Depression, that the \nproposal in the bill is not adequate to save an awful lot of farmers \nwho deserve saving. So I am hoping if the President does veto the bill, \nwe can come back and hammer out an agreement that will save a lot more \nfarmers.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize former Navy \nand Marine Corps members who received the Distinguished Flying Cross in \naccordance with section 532 of the National Defense Authorization Act \nfor Fiscal Year 1999, which waived time limitations for award of this \ndecoration for specified persons.

Mr. President, I rise today to make a few observations \nregarding the state of the American economy and the steps policy makers \nshould take to ensure continued prosperity in the future.\n  Right now we have some good news about the state of the economy. \nOverall employment growth is strong. Unemployment is low at 4.5 percent \nnationally and an even lower 3.9 percent in my home state of Michigan. \nFamily incomes continue to rise. And the technological and information \nage revolution continues to increase productivity and wealth throughout \nAmerica.\n  Hi-tech companies in particular are growing fast and creating \nthousands of spin-off jobs. Economist Larry Kudlow reports that the \nhardware and software industries combined account for about one third \nof real economic growth. What is more, this industry is increasing \nproductivity throughout our economy in ways we can't even measure.\n  So, on the surface things look pretty bright right now, Mr. \nPresident. But there are economic storm clouds on the horizon. Stock \nmarket investors are riding a roller coaster of volatility. The August \nEmployment Report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows a drop in \nmanufacturing jobs of 55,000--indeed, the number of manufacturing jobs \nin this country has declined for 5 straight months. Bankruptcies have \naccelerated. On the international front, the Russian economy is in deep \ndistress. And our Asian economic partners continue in a state of crisis \nthat threatens our balance of payments and our general economic health.\n  As Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan noted recently in a speech at \nthe University of California at Berkeley, ``it is just not credible \nthat the United States can remain an oasis of prosperity unaffected by \na world that is experiencing greatly increased stress.''\n  I wholeheartedly concur in Chairman Greenspan's analysis. And that is \nwhy I believe it is necessary for us to look closely and seriously at \nour current economic policies so that we can face coming economic \nuncertainties from a position of strength. We must, in my view, address \na number of problems in current policy, lest they undermine continued \neconomic growth and prosperity.\n\n[[Page S11571]]\n\n  To begin with, Mr. President, we should consider the current state of \nour monetary policy. The Fed's recent quarter point cut in the federal \nfunds (or overnight lending) rate was followed by a significant drop in \nthe stock market. A number of analysts have observed that this may have \nbeen caused by investors' conviction that, even with the cut, short \nterm interest rates remain too high, and that the Federal Reserve \nshould seriously consider cutting them further.\n  The fed funds rate remained at 5.5 percent for two and a half years \ndespite a drop in inflation to 1.7 percent. Even at its current 5.25 \npercent, the real, after-inflation rate is about 3.5 percent--much \nhigher for example than between 1992 and 1994, when it was only 0.6 \npercent.\n  Chairman Greenspan, along with former Chairman Paul Volcker, deserve \ngreat credit for reducing inflation through sound monetary policies. \nBut real interest rates have remained high in the face of indications \nthat we may be entering an era of deflation, and this cannot continue \nif we are to maintain price stability and a strong economy.\n  Gold prices have fallen by more than 30 percent since early 1996. \nCommodity prices have fallen to 21 year lows. Corporate profits have \ndeclined on a year-over-year basis for the first time in a decade. Farm \nprices are plummeting.\n  What is more, Mr. President, a number of economies in recent months \nhave experienced significant currency devaluations. These devaluations \nhave produced increasing demands for U.S. dollars. But, by keeping \nshort term interest rates high, the Fed has refused to supply these \ndollars, precipitating a liquidity crisis around the globe.\n  I firmly believe that the best environment for business, workers, and \nconsumers is one of price stability. Price stability allows for \naccurate planning and investment over the long term. But price \nstability requires that we avoid both extremes, of deflation as well as \ninflation.\n  Monetary policy is a matter for Alan Greenspan and his colleagues at \nthe Federal Reserve. But it is my hope that they will examine the \noverall economic picture and conclude that it is time to lower interest \nrates in the interests of long term price stability and global economic \ngrowth.\n  We should not look solely to the Fed, however, in seeking to ensure \nprosperity for the future. In addition to excessively tight monetary \npolicy, the American economy and the American people are being put at \nrisk from too-tight fiscal policy. Specifically, Mr. President, the \ncurrent high and rising federal tax burden is keeping the economy from \nreaching its full potential.\n  In 1997 federal taxes took 20 percent of the Gross Domestic Product \nof this country, the highest percentage since World War II. Federal \ntaxes on the American people increased by almost a third in just four \nyears--going up from $1.2 trillion in fiscal year 1993 to $1.6 trillion \nover the course of President Clinton's first term. In 1997 Americans \npaid 45 percent more in income taxes than they had in 1993. And, unless \nwe act, this burden will increase. During the fourth quarter of 1997 \nfederal receipts approached a record 22 percent of GDP.\n  Neither the American people nor the American economy can sustain this \ncrushing tax burden. It discourages people from working, saving, \ninvesting, and engaging in the entrepreneurial activities that keep our \neconomy growing. It must be lowered substantially, expeditiously, and \nin a way that encourages economic growth.\n  Early on in the next Congress, Mr. President, I believe we should \nseriously consider significant pro-growth tax cuts, including:\n  Using revenues from our budget surplus to save Social Security and \nencourage investment by lowering the payroll tax and allowing workers \nto put some of their own money in Personal Retirement Accounts.\n  Marriage penalty tax relief.\n  A capital gains tax rate reduction, perhaps to 15 percent as proposed \nby Majority Leader Lott.\n  Estate tax relief.\n  Widening the current 15 percent income tax bracket to apply it to all \nmiddle class American families.\n  Expanding tax free savings accounts for education, health care, and \nretirement.\n  Reducing income tax rates across-the-board--perhaps up to 10 percent, \nand allowing businesses to more quickly write-off the costs for \ninvestment in plant and equipment. This pro-growth tax incentive would \nbe especially beneficial to America's struggling manufacturing sector.\n\n  These tax suggestions are neither new nor radical, Mr. President. But \nit is time for us to implement them. They would spur savings and \ninvestment, and encourage work and entrepreneurial activity, assuring \neconomic growth.\n  But they are not enough. Over the long term, Mr. President, we must \nmove toward more fundamental tax reform. We need to design an income \ntax that applies a lower rate to income, reduces the current bias \nagainst saving and investment, lowers the tax burden on working \nfamilies, simplifies the code, and reduces the cost of compliance. Only \nthis kind of fairer, flatter, simpler and more investment-friendly tax \nsystem can give us the sound fiscal policy we need to build a bright, \nsustainable economic future.\n  Congress needs to institute other pro-growth reforms as well.\n  We must reform our tort system to lower the ``tort tax'' from \nfrivolous lawsuits. The Rand Corporation recently reported that the \naverage lawsuit costs a company $100,000. Thus even a frivolous lawsuit \ncan put a small company out of business, and a good number of workers \nout of a job.\n  We need to institute serious cost-benefit analysis for federal \nregulations and federal unfunded, private sector mandates. Regulations \ncost our economy $647 billion per year, according to the GAO, and that \nis simply too much.\n  We have to do more to improve our children's education so that they \ncan qualify for good paying jobs in our technological, information age \neconomy.\n  We have to bring in a limited number of highly trained immigrants to \nfill some of the important positions our high-tech companies cannot \ncurrently fill and to help us solve the year 2000 or ``Y2K'' problem \nbefore it damages our economy.\n  And within the next few days the Senate will pass and President \nClinton will sign the American Competitiveness and Workforce \nEnhancement Act. This legislation will increase the number of temporary \nhigh-tech visas and provide scholarships and job training so that more \nAmericans can gain the skills necessary to fill these positions in the \nlong term.\n  We also must continue to build on America's pro-free trade \ntradition--by extending fast track negotiating authority, and \naggressively negotiating trade agreements that open markets for \nAmerican products.\n  We must reform the lending policies of the International Monetary \nFund. All too often, the Fund requires developing countries to raise \ntaxes and devalue currencies as a condition for receiving loans. These \nanti-growth policies only worsen a developing country's economic and \ndebt problems. The Fund should instead promote policies that spur \neconomic growth in these countries--lower tax rates, free markets, the \nrule of law, and sound currencies.\n  In general, Mr. President, we must do more to encourage hard work and \nentrepreneurship so that all of us can benefit from the income and the \njobs they create.\n  Through prudent steps ensuring price stability and reducing \ngovernmental burdens on the private sector, we can sustain economic \ngrowth for the foreseeable future. But the time to act is now. The \nwarning signs are there for us to see. I hope we will not wait until it \nis too late.\n  I plan to work for pro-growth reforms whenever and wherever possible. \nI believe it is my duty to the people of Michigan, as it is our duty to \nthe people of America, to safeguard their economic security by \nunleashing the entrepreneurial spirit that built this nation, and that \ncan build a bright future of growth and opportunity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/06/senate-section/article/S11570-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11572-S11577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11572]]\n                        INTERNET TAX FREEDOM ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 442, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 442) to establish national policy against State \n     and local government interference with interstate commerce on \n     the Internet or interactive computer services, and to \n     exercise Congressional jurisdiction over interstate commerce \n     by establishing a moratorium on the imposition of exaction \n     that would interfere with the free flow of commerce via the \n     Internet, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent it be in order for \nan amendment to be offered by Senator Graham of Florida with a time of \n30 minutes, 20 minutes on the side of the Senator from Florida, 10 \nminutes from the side managed by me.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would not object, but I add that there be no second-\ndegree amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3729\n\n   (Purpose: To require a supermajority of both Houses to extend the \n                              moratorium)\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3729.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 176, between lines 15 and 16, insert:\n       (c) Point of Order.--It shall not be in order in the Senate \n     or the House of Representatives to consider any bill, \n     resolution, amendment, or conference report if such bill, \n     resolution, amendment, or conference report would extend the \n     moratorium under subsection (a). This point of order may only \n     be waived or suspended by a vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members, duly chosen and sworn.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, as the amendment clearly states, its \npurpose is to establish to the extent possible under our rules that the \nmoratorium, whatever this body decides its initial length will be, will \nbe that length and that we will not fall into a situation of a \n``fluid'' moratorium, with efforts each year made to extend it further \nand further. This amendment does not go to the issue of what the length \nof the initial moratorium shall be.\n  The bill before the Senate today, which is the product of the Senate \nFinance Committee, provides for a 2-year moratorium. There are \namendments filed which would extend that up to 5 or 6 years. There are \nno amendments filed which would reduce the period of the moratorium. So \nit is fair to suggest that we will be dealing with the moratorium of at \nleast 2 years, possibly longer. The purpose of this amendment is to \nassure to the extent possible that once we have made that decision, \nthat will be the decision.\n  The underlying premise of this bill is an unusual one for the U.S. \nCongress--not unique, but rarely used. That is, we are about to \nconsider legislation which would preempt every State and every local \ngovernment in this country, for a period of time, from exercising their \notherwise legal powers relative to taxation on Internet access and \ntransactions which are undertaken through the use of the Internet. \nWhile it is perfectly appropriate for Congress to decide that the \nFederal Government should not tax Internet access or Internet \ntransactions, I am concerned we will face a proposal that tells States \nand local governments that they shall be denied the right to tax these \ntransactions.\n  The argument which I find to have some merit is that it is \nappropriate we have a ``pause,'' a period in which we can determine \nwhat is the appropriate means of taxing this new technology, and that \nduring that pause there should be a prohibition on State and local \ngovernments imposing taxes on Internet access or Internet transactions. \nWhat I am concerned about is that that pause does not become a \npermanent slumber, an elongated sleep in which there is a prohibition \non State and local government's ability to exercise what is their basic \nright under our constitutional allocation of responsibilities to raise \nthose revenues necessary to support necessary government programs.\n  The Federal Government has on many occasions passed legislation which \nconditions the receipt of Federal funds. For instance, in the highway \nbills we have frequently required the States to undertake a certain set \nof actions, such as setting a speed limit or imposing the requirement \nof seatbelts or motorcycle helmets or some other item which the Federal \nGovernment felt was of sufficient import, that the ability of the State \nto receive its otherwise due allocation of Federal funds would be \nconditioned upon their adopting that policy. But in those cases, the \nStates have a choice. If a State believes the Federal requirement is so \nonerous or so misguided that they will reject it, they can do so and \naccept the consequences of some reduction in their Federal funds.\n  What we are deciding here today is that the States do not have such \nan option. There will be a prohibition for the period of the moratorium \non the State's ability to exercise their policy relative to the \ntaxation of Internet access or Internet transactions.\n  What concerns me about this policy is its potential to ``morph'' from \nbeing a temporary pause to being a permanent prohibition. What are some \nof the risks that are involved in this? One of those risks is the \nunknown, the unknown potential of this new rapidly developing \ntechnology having implications to State and local governments which are \nbeyond our current ability to comprehend.\n  As an example, there is an emerging technology--it is not new, it is \nin place but will probably become more prevalent--which is known as \nInternet telephony which is essentially where the Internet system \nsubstitutes for the normal local or long distance telephone lines as a \nmeans of transmitting telephone services. This system, which is \ncurrently in use on a limited basis, has the potential of being a very \nmajor competitor with the traditional ways in which telephone service \nhas been delivered.\n  Probe Research, a telecommunications and data networking market \nresearch system, forecasts that the demand for Internet telephony will \nmake these services add up to a $6.3 billion market by the year 2002. \nThat is just some 3 years from now. At that point, according to Probe \nResearch, Internet telephone and fax traffic will account for nearly 10 \npercent of total long distance traffic, a very significant high-growth \nindustry.\n  What does this mean for State and local government? \nTelecommunications services and cable services are significant sources \nof revenue for State and local government. The Finance Committee bill, \nin fact, recognizes this by specifically preserving the Federal \nGovernment's taxing authority over many of these areas and preserving \nthe taxing authority of State and local government for access to \ntelephone and cable services.\n  Unfortunately, the bill is vague regarding the treatment of such new \ntechnologies as Internet telephony. While it specifically protects \nFederal revenue, it does not clarify that the moratorium does not apply \nto State and local governments with respect to Internet telephony. I \nuse this example because it is one that is before the Senate, an \nexample that the implications of allowing a specified moratorium to \nbecome a longer-term prohibition could have implications on State and \nlocal governments and on the fairness in the marketplace between \ncompeting forms of commercial transaction, telecommunications, and \nother aspects of our economy that will be affected that are beyond our \nability to currently estimate.\n  A second risk is that this moratorium will become ingrained into the \nlaw. We have had multiple examples of where laws that were originally \npassed as temporary moratoriums, or as a temporary benefit, have become \nde facto permanent. In fact, before this session is over, we may be \nconsidering what is referred to as an extender law, which is to add \nadditional months or years to a variety of tax benefits which were \ninitially adopted to have a specified time to limited life. But once in \nplace, once they have developed a political constituency, they have \nbecome, for all intents and purposes, permanent provisions in our Tax \nCode.\n  I am concerned that the same development of a political constituency \nthat has gotten used to the fact that they didn't have to pay any tax \nfor access, and particularly any tax on Internet transactions, will \ndevelop here and\n\n[[Page S11573]]\n\nthere and will be tremendous political pressure at the conclusion of \nthis moratorium, whenever that might be, for its extension.\n  Next, the potential of a long-term moratorium merging into \nprohibition would create an imbalance on the commercial playing field. \nI could foresee what is happening in a limited form becoming more \nprevalent as retail stores begin to open a back office Internet sales \nshop in order to be able to participate in tax-free Internet sales. So \nwhat today is a relatively limited application has the potential of \nbecoming a much larger threat to fairness and parity in the commercial \nmarketplace and to a fundamental source of revenue for State and local \ngovernment.\n  Finally, the potential of the specified moratorium being extended \nwould delay or obviate the accomplishment of the very objective of \nhaving the moratorium in the first place, which is to direct a \ncommission, representative of the various stakeholders in this issue, \nto sort out the conflicting theories and practices and give us a \nrecommendation for some uniform, fair, nondiscriminatory Federal, \nState, and local policies, as it relates to the use of the Internet as \na form of commerce.\n  So for all of those reasons, Mr. President, I am concerned, and I \nthink our Members should be concerned, about the prospect of the \nmoratorium, whatever length we finally decide is appropriate, becoming \na permanent prohibition on the use of State governments and of their \ninherent powers relative to the Internet.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I think the period of time that is in the \nSenate finance bill and the period of time that is proposed in various \namendments should be plenty to accomplish the objective of this study. \nWe have had a number of recent commissions that have been given a \nspecific time to accomplish their task.\n  Two or three years ago, the Congress established an Internal Revenue \nReform Commission. It gave that commission 18 months to look at an \nagency as complex as the IRS. That commission actually completed its \nwork in 15 months, made its report, and this year Congress used that \nreport as the basis of probably the most sweeping reforms of the \nInternal Revenue Service in a generation.\n  Last year, we established a Medicare Commission to look at one of the \nmost complicated, one of the most expensive, one of the most sensitive \nprograms that the Federal Government operates, the program that \nfinances the health care of some 35 million of our older citizens. We \ngave that commission 18 months in order to issue its report.\n  So I suggest that the 2 years that are in the Finance Committee \nrecommendation are ample to carry out a much more focused study of the \ntax implications of the Internet and that we should take this step by \nadopting the amendment that I proposed to assure that this moratorium \nwill not morph into a permanent prohibition.\n  Mr. President, the fundamental issue here is the issue that underlies \nthis legislation, and that is the desire to have parity, equality, on \nthe commercial playing field among all forms of sales, whether they be \nthe Main Street seller or the remote seller or the cyberspace seller; \nsecond, to assure that the Federal Government will not unduly intrude \ninto the areas of historic responsibility for State and local \ngovernment. It is appropriate for us to attempt to establish some \nstandards for uniformity of treatment and predictability of treatment. \nIt is not appropriate for the Federal Government to preempt State and \nlocal governments from their ability to exercise what they think is \nappropriate tax policy for their citizens.\n  So the amendment would provide that once the moratorium has been \ncompleted, whatever its length, it would require a three-fifths vote of \neach House to extend that moratorium for a further period.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. On behalf of Senator Mack, I ask unanimous consent that \nElaine Petty and Nancy Segerdahl, legislative fellows in Senator Mack's \noffice, be granted floor privileges during the week of October 5 for \nconsideration of S. 1868, the International Religious Freedom Act of \n1998.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Mary Jo \nCatalano and Heather Landesman of my staff be granted floor privileges \nfor the pendency of S. 442.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this \namendment. It circumvents the legislative process by requiring a \nsupermajority to extend the tax moratorium in the Internet Tax Freedom \nAct, it would bind the hands of future Congresses, and it would start \nsetting a rather dangerous precedent.\n  Mr. President, the Senate has a supermajority mandate that applies to \nall legislation; it is called a filibuster. Requiring three-fifths of \nCongress to agree to adopt any future actions in this matter is \nunnecessary, when all legislation considered and passed by the Senate \nmust essentially meet the test created by the filibuster.\n  This legislation before us, the Internet Tax Freedom Act, is an \nexcellent example of the proper manner in which legislation makes its \nway to the Senate for full consideration and a final vote. This \nlegislation has been fully considered by the Commerce Committee, \nreferred to the Finance Committee, and Senator Wyden and I have worked \nhard to address the concerns some Members have expressed.\n  S. 442 is before the Senate now, not because any extraordinary \nmeasures have been taken, but because the bill has undergone the \nlegislative process as it was meant to function. This legislation is \nbefore the Senate today because the majority of Senators support it and \na filibuster would have been defeated. There is no reason to institute \na supermajority for future actions on this issue, as Congress is fully \ncapable of addressing this issue under existing processes and \nprocedures.\n  I yield to the Senator from Oregon such time as he may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose \nthis amendment. I think we are making substantial progress on this \nlegislation. I believe that in a few minutes Senator McCain and I are \ngoing to accept something like seven or eight amendments that have been \noffered in an effort to try to bring the parties together, and I would \nlike to see us continue to work in this spirit.\n  Mr. President, and colleagues, I introduced the Internet Tax Freedom \nAct in March of 1997. Since then, this measure has been one of the most \nhotly debated measures in this Congress--debated in both the Senate and \nthe House of Representatives. Through the course of this year and a \nhalf discussion, never once has this idea been suggested--not in the \nHouse nor in the Senate. And the fact of the matter is we are still \nhaving important negotiations in order to get at the issue of how long \nthe moratorium ought to be. We are anxious to involve the Senator from \nFlorida in that effort. It would seem to me that our job--just as we \nhave tried to do with the seven or eight amendments which Chairman \nMcCain and I are going to accept in a few minutes--is to continue to do \nour work in good faith. The Senator from Florida knows that I have gone \nto considerable lengths to be supportive of his position with respect \nto what would be studied by the commission in an effort to be \nresponsive to his concerns.\n  I would like to see us continue those discussions, both with respect \nto what the commission will study and how long the moratorium ought to \nbe. When we arrive at that point, I and others believe that the \ncommission will do a thoughtful and responsible job. We think they are \ngoing to work in good faith. If at any point they indicate that they \nare unwilling to pursue their duties in that kind of fashion, the U.S. \nSenate can get back at it.\n  I think it is important that the Senate reject this amendment and let \nus continue in the kind of spirit that Chairman McCain and I have shown \nwith respect to the seven or eight amendments that are going to come up \nvery shortly that we have agreed to accept, and let us get this bill on \nthe President's desk.\n\n[[Page S11574]]\n\n  The President of the United States is for this legislation, the \nmajority leader of this body, Trent Lott, is for this legislation, and \nthe minority leader, Tom Daschle, has said that he wants to see this \nbill enacted. I think it is important that we reject this amendment and \nmove forward in good faith to work out the remaining issues.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes 55 seconds. The \nSenator from Arizona has 4 minutes 52 seconds.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I also add my name to the list in favor of \nthe residual purpose of this legislation, which is a pause of \nsufficient length to allow a serious study of the implications of \nInternet technology to be a party in the commercial marketplace, and \nthe role of State and local taxation, as well as international and \nFederal taxation on this new technology. The purpose of that latter \npoint is to achieve stability, predictability and uniformity in a way \nin which Internet transactions and access is treated and to avoid there \nbeing a discriminatory set of policies that are contrary to the \ndevelopment of their important new technology. I believe the Senate \nFinance Committee bill achieved that proper balance with a 2-year \nmoratorium.\n  What I am concerned about and what this amendment goes to is for that \nbrief pause not to become a permanent prohibition. For the reasons that \nI have already cited--the rapidly changing nature of this technology \nand its application, the potential for a constituency to develop that \nwould convert temporary into permanent, the basic unfairness of having \nsome forms of commerce subject to tax while others are given the \nbenefit of a moratorium, the inappropriateness of the Federal \nGovernment preempting appropriate State and local judgments for \nprotracted periods of time--all have led me to suggest that we should \nadd to the 2-year moratorium, as it is currently written, an additional \nprotection, and that is at the end of that moratorium, if there is a \nproposal to extend further, that it would take a 60-vote margin and an \nequivalent percentage of votes in the House of Representatives in order \nto do so.\n  That would give us some assurance that the objectives that are stated \nwill be achieved, but that this will not become the camel's nose in the \ntent where eventually the whole body of the camel will be inside the \ntent. We would be in the position of a permanent prohibition on legal \nand appropriate policy decisions that have and should be made at the \nState and local level for the purposes of maintaining not only fair \ntreatment in the marketplace but also the essential resources necessary \nfor State and local governments to carry out their responsibilities in \npublic safety, education and other critical areas.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of this amendment, which I \nconsider to be wholly consistent with the objectives of this \nlegislation as stated by its sponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote take \nplace at 5 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Florida yield back time?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes 42 seconds.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I withdraw my unanimous consent request. I yield such \ntime to the Senator from New Hampshire as he may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to support the position of the \nchairman of the committee on this issue in opposition to the Senator \nfrom Florida.\n  The proposal which the Senator from Florida is suggesting goes really \nto the essence of this debate, which is whether or not 30,000 \nmunicipalities and State agencies across this country are going to have \nthe right to essentially assess taxes in an arbitrary way on one of the \nmost dynamic vehicles of commerce that has never come forward in the \nexperience of the world. The chaos which those 30,000 municipalities \nand State agencies would create should they be able to assess that type \nof taxation on the Internet would be overwhelming. It might totally \ndefeat what has been one of the great engines of economic activity and \nprosperity which our Nation has enjoyed over the last few years.\n  It is not a unique situation. We can go all the way back to John \nMarshall to determine that the Congress has the right to make the \ndecision on the issue of policy relative to taxation in commerce. It \nwas, of course, Chief Justice Marshall who determined that when a ferry \nwas crossing a river between two States that that ferry could not be \ntaxed by the local State if it was going to interfere with interstate \ncommerce.\n  This concept has carried through our jurisprudence since that time--\nthat the Federal Government reserves the unique right to determine the \ntaxation of commerce.\n  There is no reason why we should arbitrarily handicap ourselves by \ncreating a supermajority within our own institution to exercise that \nright, which is what the Senator from Florida is proposing.\n  Let's continue the policies which have done us so well in the area of \ntax policy for the last 200 years, which is a majority of the Congress \nto make a decision as to what tax policy shall be in international \ntrade. Let's not create some artificial barrier for us to jump over as \nan institution as we try to deal with what is a tremendous real ferry \nthat may be created by having 30,000 municipalities and State agencies \nacross the country assess taxes against the Internet.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I may not need the entire 2 minutes, but I \nrise in support of the amendment offered by the Senator from Florida.\n  This issue is relatively simple. The whole purpose of a moratorium is \nto take kind of a time-out and establish a commission and review a \nseries of these issues. But all of us here know how difficult it is \ngoing to be when this moratorium, whatever it is, is to expire. We will \nhave people coming here saying this needs to be a perpetual thing; we \nwill continue the moratorium year after year after year. I want this \npiece of legislation with its moratorium to represent that time-out; to \ngive this country time to make the right decisions. But at that point I \nwant the decisions to be made, and I want the moratorium to be gone. \nThat is what the Senator from Florida is saying. It is a very important \namendment.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this amendment so that we will \ncomply with what I think the true spirit of this legislation really \nis--a time-out for thoughtful decisions to be made and then business as \nusual. We don't want permanent preemption of the State's tax base. That \nis what will happen if we don't decide now that this moratorium will \nbe--whatever it is. I hope it is 3 years.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I have time, I am happy to yield. Of course.\n  Mr. GREGG. Wouldn't the business as usual be that the majority would \ntake action rather than having a supermajority take place?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator misunderstood my business-as-usual comment. I \nwas talking about the business as usual allowing a State to describe \nits own tax base in a fair and thoughtful manner. My fear is that this \nmoratorium will continue forever, unless it becomes what we think it \nshould become--a time-out to make decisions, and then move on.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 5 seconds.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield the remainder of his \ntime, 29 seconds?\n\n[[Page S11575]]\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to table the Graham amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Arizona.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate now \nmove to a Bumper's amendment, with 10 minutes equally divided on either \nside, followed by a rollcall vote if the Senator from Arkansas wants \nit; I will make a motion to table; following that, that the Senate then \ngo into morning business, with Senators permitted to speak up to 5 \nminutes each until 6:30 p.m.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I add to that, no second-degree amendments be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new title:\n\n     TITLE    --CONSUMER PROTECTION TAX DISCLOSURE\n\n     SEC.    . DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENT.\n\n       (a) Disclosure Requirement.--Any person selling tangible \n     personal property via the Internet who--\n       (1) delivers such property, or causes such property to be \n     delivered, to a person in another State, and\n       (2) does not collect and remit all applicable State and \n     local sales taxes pertaining to the sale and use of such \n     property.\n\n     shall prominently display the notice described in subsection \n     (b) on every other form available to a purchaser or \n     prospective purchaser.\n       (b) Disclosure Notice.--The notice described in this \n     subsection is as follows:\n       ``NOTICE REGARDING TAXES: You may be required by your State \n     or local government to pay sales or use tax on this purchase. \n     Such taxes are imposed in most States. Failure to pay such \n     taxes could result in civil or criminal penalties. For \n     information on your tax obligations, contact your State \n     taxation department.''\n       (c) Regulatory Authority.--The Secretary of Commerce shall \n     issue and enforce such regulations as are necessary to ensure \n     compliance with this section, including regulations as to \n     what constitutes prominently displaying a notice.\n\n     SEC.    . PENALTIES.\n\n       Any person who willfully fails to include any notice under \n     section ____ shall be fined not more than $100 for each such \n     failure.\n\n     SEC.    . DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For purposes of this title--\n       (1) the term ``use tax'' means a tax imposed on or incident \n     to the use, storage, consumption, distribution, or other use \n     within a State or local jurisdiction or other area of a \n     State, of tangible personal property,\n       (2) the term ``local sales tax'' means a sales tax imposed \n     in a local jurisdiction or area of a State and includes, but \n     is not limited to--\n       (A) a sales tax or in-lieu fee imposed in a local \n     jurisdiction or area of a State by the State on behalf of \n     such jurisdiction or area, and\n       (B) a sales tax imposed by a local jurisdiction or other \n     State-authorized entity pursuant to the authority of State \n     law, local law, or both,\n       (3) the term ``person'' means an individual, a trust, \n     estate, partnership, society, association, company (including \n     a limited liability company), or corporation, whether or not \n     acting in a fiduciary or representative capacity, and any \n     combination thereof,\n       (4) the term ``sales tax'' means a tax, including use tax, \n     that is--\n       (A) imposed on or incident to the sale, purchase, storage, \n     consumption, distribution, or other use of tangible personal \n     property as may be defined or specified under the laws \n     imposing such tax, and\n       (B) measured by the amount of the sale price, cost, charge, \n     or other value of or for such property, and\n       (5) the term ``State'' means any of the several States of \n     the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth \n     of Puerto Rico, and any territory or possession of the United \n     States.\n\n     SEC.    . EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This title shall take effect 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act. In no event shall this Act apply to \n     any sale occurring before such effective date.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. Forty-\nfive States have sales and use taxes on sales of merchandise coming \ninto their State from another State. The problem is, they can't collect \nit because the people who are buying the merchandise don't know that \nthere is a sales tax on the goods coming in. I think Maine collects \nabout $1 million, and that is probably as much as any State collects.\n  People are always getting rude surprises. All of a sudden somebody \nknocks on the door and they say, ``We saw where you just bought $50,000 \nworth of furniture from North Carolina. You owe sales tax.'' They say, \n``The ad said no sales tax.'' ``I don't care what the ad says. There is \na North Carolina sales tax on merchandise brought in from out of \nState.''\n  My amendment says on Internet sales, if you sell into a State, you \nmust notify people with a short notice that simply says, ``This \nmerchandise may be subject to a sales or use tax in your State.'' You \ncould be subject to a civil penalty or a criminal penalty--something \nlike 100 bucks. If you want to check, you should check with your local \nrevenue department to determine whether or not your State has a tax.\n  I want every Member in this body to ask this question: Why would you \nvote against this when your legislature has specifically provided that \nsale of goods from across the State lines are taxable? If you say they \nare not taxable, you are flying right into the face of the will of the \npeople in your State who said they should be.\n  All I am saying, people should not be misled and should be told that \nwhen\n\n[[Page S11576]]\n\nthey buy this merchandise it may be subject to a sales or use tax. It \nis just that simple. Why wouldn't you? If your State is one of the 45 \nStates that have a tax, why would you not want a company selling goods \non the Internet--not mail-order houses on the Internet--why would you \nnot want to tell the customer he may be subject to it, instead of him \ngetting a rude surprise and some auditor knocking on his door?\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I strongly oppose this amendment. This amendment specifically singles \nout those who sell goods over the Internet for discrimination. It \napplies to one class of people and that is those who sell goods on the \nInternet. The amendment would impose on those sellers of goods on the \nInternet a new requirement that would not be imposed on someone who \nsells goods over the phone or someone who mails the goods when they get \na check.\n  Now, let's picture the kind of person who is going to be hurt by this \namendment. My State, the State of the Presiding Officer of the Senate, \nhas 100,000 home-based businesses. These are some of the most exciting \nbusinesses in the country coming up with new products. They are small. \nThey are entrepreneurial. If this amendment passes, those 100,000 home-\nbased businesses in Oregon--and there are thousands and thousands of \nother home-based businesses across the country in States that we all \nrepresent--they, and only they, will be subject to this new \nrequirement.\n  This amendment seeks to do what the Internet tax freedom bill seeks \nto prevent. Our legislation is about technological neutrality. We \nshould treat the Internet like we treat everything else. It shouldn't \nget a preference. It shouldn't be discriminated against. But if you \nread section (a) of this amendment, you will see that it applies \nrequirements to one class of people, and one class of people only. \nThose are individuals who sell goods over the Internet.\n  This is discriminatory. This does what our legislation seeks to \nprevent. Those who vote for the amendment, in my view, in this \nSenator's view, are fostering the kind of policy that is going to lead \nto selective and discriminatory activity against those who sell goods \nthrough the World Wide Web.\n  I yield back my time, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment \nbe expanded to include mail-order catalog sales.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. I object.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The reason there is an objection is because the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire and the Senator from Oregon do not come from the 45 \nStates that have sales taxes.\n  They are opposed to this because their State is not one of the 45 \nStates that do have a sales or use tax. Secondly, the unanimous consent \nagreement limits amendments to relevant amendments. If you put mail-\norder catalog sales in, it is not relevant. That is the reason I \nconfined it to the Internet and asked consent to extend it. That is the \nreason they objected. They don't have to face a legislature or people \nback home who passed a sales or use tax on Internet sales coming in \nfrom out of State, because their States don't have a sales or use tax. \nMy State does have that use tax, and we would like to collect it. Your \nrevenue departments and your Governors would like to collect it, too.\n  All I am saying is, Internet sales simply ought to state a simple \nthing--that the goods you are buying could be subject to a use or sales \ntax in your State; if you want to know whether it does or not, contact \nyour local revenue department. What is wrong with that? Who can oppose \nthat? The taxes have already been passed by the legislature. It is just \nthat they can't collect it unless they stand at the border and \nintercept every piece of merchandise that comes through the mail or on \nthe highway. They can't do it.\n  So all I am saying is, if these 45 States have seen fit to levy taxes \non out-of-State sales to make the playing field a little more level \nwith the main street merchants, we ought to give them such help as we \ncan. I am saying they ought to at least advise these people that these \npurchases might be subject to a use or sales tax.\n  Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my time \nif everybody else is, and we will go to a vote.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment of the \nSenator from Arkansas and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the amendment of the Senator from Arkansas. The yeas and nays \nhave been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Glenn) and the \nSenator from New York (Mr. Moynihan) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nremain on S. 442 for the purposes of offering a nonrelevant amendment \nthat has been agreed to by both sides, that the amendment be \nimmediately agreed to, and that the Senate return to morning business \nunder the previous order, except that the time be until 7:30 instead of \n6:30, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, reserving the right to object. I will \nnot object. My understanding is the amendment that is to be offered has \nbeen cleared with the authorizing committee, and we have no problem \nwith the amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have no intention of objecting. I merely want a little \nclarification on the time. Will that mean we have to wait until 7:30 \nand then may have a rollcall vote or so after that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, it is my understanding that there will \nnot be the likelihood of further votes, but we will have to clear that \nwith the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, who has the floor? The Senator from \nArizona?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. We are trying to get final clearance on the antinepotism \nbill. We think there is a probability that we would not have to have a \nrecorded\n\n[[Page S11577]]\n\nvote. But that is what we are trying to do right now; we are trying to \nmake sure everybody is satisfied with that. If we could get that \ncleared, move it on a voice vote, then we would have no further \nrecorded votes tonight. We are not able to announce it at this moment, \nbut we believe within the next 5 or 10 minutes we will be able to make \nthat clear.\n  I see the Senator from Vermont just came on the floor. He was one of \nthe ones we were wanting to get some information from about the \nantinepotism bill, being able to take it up, and whether or not a \nrecorded vote was going to be necessary on that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I tell my friend from Mississippi, we \ndiscussed, last night, what we were trying to do, as he knows. The \nSenator from Arizona has been most helpful in trying to help this \nalong, to get the antinepotism bill up, but also have the time to do \nthe Fletcher nomination.\n  What I understand the Senator from Mississippi and the Senator from \nArizona want to do is to get something locked in so we can take care of \nboth those.\n  There were some who wanted a rollcall vote on the nepotism bill. Is \nthe distinguished leader saying it would be easier for his scheduling \nif there was not one? I came to this conversation late; I apologize.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe it will be better from a scheduling standpoint; \ntherefore, we can advise Members what they can expect for the remainder \nof the evening and we can get this legislation completed. Then we will \nbe able to go to the Fletcher nomination tomorrow.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask my good friend, the distinguished leader--and we \nhave been friends for a long time--do I detect a hint in that \nsuggestion of being able to tell Members there may not be further votes \nif we voice vote the nepotism bill?\n  Mr. LOTT. That was very much an implied hint.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I think I can tell my friend from Mississippi we can \novercome those who are requesting a rollcall vote on this side. But we \ndo want a specific time for a vote on the Fletcher nomination, and I \nrely on the distinguished leader to work this to a time convenient for \nscheduling. It is, of course, with the understanding that there will be \na time set down for a vote on Mr. Fletcher that we would be able to \nreach an agreement.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is my intent, and, as the Senator knows, I had made a \ncommitment earlier we were going to do that. I will keep that \ncommitment. It is my intent to have that vote tomorrow, or the next day \nat the latest. We will have a vote on that nomination.\n  I thank Senator Kyl also for his effort. I say to all Members, if \nthey will bear with us just another 5 or 10 minutes, we will be able to \nmake it official that we won't have a recorded vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I withdraw my reservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3743\n\n    (Purpose: To provide support for certain institutes and schools)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for Mr. Frist, for \n     himself, Mr. Thompson, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Smith of \n     Oregon and Mr. Wyden proposes an amendment numbered 3743.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nSmith of Oregon and Senator Wyden as original cosponsors of this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nGregg and Lieberman be considered original cosponsors of amendment No. \n3722.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3743) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. BYRD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/06/senate-section/article/S11572-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

The clerk will report the bill.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1892) to provide that a person closely related \n     to a judge of a court exercising judicial power under article \n     III of the United States Constitution (other than the Supreme \n     Court) may not be appointed as a judge of the same court, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me thank Senator Leahy for his \ncooperation in allowing us to get this bill up at this time and deal \nwith it in an expedited fashion. I will describe briefly the reason for \nthe legislation, what it does. I will ask unanimous consent to submit \nfurther remarks for the Record.\n  Under existing law, section 458 of title 28 of the U.S. Code reads: \n``No person shall be appointed to, or employed in, any office or duty \nin any court who is related by affinity or consanguinity within the \ndegree of first cousin to any justice or judge of such court.''\n  I will read the words that pertain to judges: ``no person shall be \nappointed . . . to any court who is related . . . to any justice or \njudge of such court.'' That language seems pretty straightforward on \nits face--that you can't have relations on the same court, nominated by \nthe President or appointed by the Senate. Notwithstanding that \nrelatively clear language, there has arisen a controversy over whether \nit means what I suggest it says. The administration has actually \ninterpreted it in a way that could mean that it applies only to \nemployees of the court, not to judges of the court themselves.\n  This bill clarifies that it applies to both, which I think was both \nthe original intent and the best public policy. I note that the issue \nhas arisen because of the nomination of Professor Fletcher to be a \njudge on the Ninth Circuit, since his mother sits on the circuit \ncurrently. Frankly, most people were not aware of the statute, Madam \nPresident. But, in my view, we should not do something that is not \npermitted under the law. Therefore, while I acknowledge that the \nadministration has raised a question about the interpretation of the \nstatute, I think the statute is pretty clear. This bill makes it \ncrystal clear that it applies to both employees of the court and judges \nof the court.\n  In effect, what the legislation would do is to say that on the same \ncourt, like the same circuit or the same district court, you would not \nbe able to have a father and son, two brothers, two sisters, that sort \nof thing. But you could have people related on different circuits or \ndifferent Federal district courts. For example, you could have a \nbrother in the Fifth Circuit and a brother in the Second Circuit. You \ncould have two sisters serving in different circuits or different \ndistricts in the State of Maine, or of the State of Pennsylvania, or of \nthe State of Vermont. But you would not be able to have two close \nrelatives in the very same court.\n  The public policy reasons for that are fairly obvious. When a \nlitigant is before the court, the litigant wants to know that he or she \nis being treated fairly. When a relative who is that close to a judge \nthat may have decided a case on a panel of judges is then being called \nupon to review the decision of that close relative, the litigant \nclearly is going to have a question as to whether his or her case can \nbe treated fairly. Here is an example: A circuit court judge sits on a \npanel of three judges who decide against a plaintiff. That case is then \ngiven to the en banc panel of the circuit court in which the father, or \nthe brother, or the sister of that judge is also a member of the panel; \nthe litigant might well be a little skeptical that the brother, sister, \nfather, or whoever it is, is going to be treating him fairly, given the \nfact that the question is whether or not he will overturn the decision \nof his brother, or his son, or whoever the relative is.\n  So it is historic that we have tried to avoid that kind of conflict \nof interest. In most cases, it can be avoided. The kinds of situations \nin which this will arise are very rare. But since it has arisen in the \ncontext of this particular nominee, and since we think we can make the \nstatute crystal clear to apply to both judges and employees, it seemed \nlike a good thing to do.\n  I have two final points. One, this does not apply to the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. Constitutionally, we have the ability to set the criteria or \nqualifications for circuit and district courts, but we don't have that \nability for the Supreme Court. That is fixed in the Constitution. We \ncould not apply it there.\n  Secondly, it only applies to nominations made after the effective \ndate of the statute. For those interested in the nomination of \nProfessor Fletcher, this statute or change would not adversely affect \nhis nomination or confirmation by the Senate.\n  With that explanation, I yield to Senator Leahy for such comment as \nhe may want to make. I know he is in opposition to the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank my friend from Arizona. As he knows, I have \nopposition to this bill coming forward. I am not in favor of the bill. \nIt will pass, I understand, but I am not in favor of it. I know of no \nproblem created by the appointment of judges who are from the same \nfamily. Indeed, the three historical example of which I am aware lead \nme to the opposite conclusion. Justice David Brewer served with his \nuncle Justice Stephen Field on the United States Supreme Court after \nbeing appointed by President Harrison in 1890. Learned and his cousin \nAugustus Hand served together in the Southern District of New York and \non the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Richard and Morris \nArnold are brothers currently serving on the Court of Appeals for the \nEighth Circuit. All served with distinction.\n\n  I do not know why the country should be deprived of the judgment and \nwisdom of someone because a relative proceeded him or her to the bench. \nWe have had relatives serve simultaneously in government before and \nnow. Should one of the Levin brothers or Hutchinson brothers not serve \nin Congress? Should one of the Breyer brothers be barred from the \nfederal bench? For that matter, should federal judges be prohibited who \nare related to Senators who recommend them to the President and then \nvoted for their confirmation?\n  I believe that S. 1892 is an unnecessary and unwise bill. Moreover, \nit could lead to appointment barriers against daughters and nieces of \ncurrent judges. With people living longer and women as well as men \nhaving been practicing law and entered public service in the last \ndecades, I fear that the prohibition envisioned by the bill will serve \nas yet another barrier to keep qualified women from being appointed to \nthe bench. This may be an unintentional consequence of the bill, but a \nlikely consequence nonetheless.\n  Senator Kyl's bill is intended to do what section 458 of title 28, \nUnited States Code, does not; namely, prohibit the appointment to a \nfederal court of a relative of a judge already serving on that court. \nThe bill would amend the law to add a prohibition against the \nappointment of a person to a federal court on which a first cousin or \ncloser relative of that nominee was an active or senior judge.\n  In 1914 President Woodrow Wilson appointed Augustus Hand to the \nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of New York \nwhere he joined his distinguished first cousin and close friend Judge \nLearned Hand. In 1927, President Calvin Coolidge elevated Judge \nAugustus Hand to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second \nCircuit, where he rejoined his cousin Judge Learned Hand, who had been \nelevated three years before. Had the Kyl bill been in force, neither of \nthese appointments would have been in accordance with law.\n  The service of the Hand cousins on the Second Circuit was central to \nthe development of the law in our Circuit\n\n[[Page S11579]]\n\nand to its reputation as the finest federal appellate court in the \ncountry.\n  More recently, just six years ago in 1992, President George Bush \nappointed Judge Morris Arnold to the United States Court of Appeals for \nthe Sixth Circuit, where he joined his brother Judge Richard Arnold on \nthat court. In our confirmation proceedings, a number of Senators \ncommented favorably on the fact that Judge Arnold was joining his \ndistinguished brother.\n  When it was a brother being nominated by a Republican President, the \nfamilial relationship was seen as a plus, a benefit for the public. Now \nthat we have a Democratic President nominating a son to join a bench \nthat has included his mother, a new danger of possible appearance of \nconflict of interest is being conjured up as an excuse to delay and \noppose confirmation of a distinguished scholar and decent person.\n  I worry that we are raising something that we don't need to raise. I \nrealize this affects Professor Fletcher's appointment. But I think we \nmay have legislated beyond where we need to legislate.\n  There are problems with the appointment of judges to the federal \njudiciary, but nepotism in the appointment of judges does not appear to \nbe one of them. After all, it is the President who nominates and the \nSenate that consents. If we really wanted to do something about the \nevils of nepotism, we would prohibit Presidents from nominating their \nrelatives or the Senate from confirming theirs. Other judges, relatives \nor not, do not have a role in the appointment process.\n  The bigger problem with respect to the judiciary is the assault on \nthe judiciary by the Republican majority and its unwillingness to work \nto fill longstanding vacancies with the qualified people being \nnominated by the President. Professor Fletcher's nomination has been a \ncasualty of the Republican majority's efforts. Forty-one months and two \nconfirmation hearings have not been enough time and examination to \nbring the Fletcher nomination to a vote.\n  Professor Fletcher is a fine person and an outstanding nominee has \nhad to endure years of delay and demagoguery as some choose to play \npolitics with our independent judiciary. The Ninth Circuit continues to \nfunction with multiple vacancies among its authorized judgeships, \nalthough we have five nominees to the Ninth Circuit pending before the \nSenate for periods ranging from four to 41 months. Two await hearings, \none awaits a Committee vote, and two have been on the Senate calendar \nawaiting final action for many months.\n  This is too reminiscent of the government shutdown only a couple of \nyears ago and the numerous times of late when the Republican \ncongressional leadership has recessed without completing work on \nemergency supplemental and disaster relief legislation, on the federal \nbudget, campaign finance reform, comprehensive tobacco legislation, the \npatient bill of rights and HMO reform.\n  In his most recent Report on the Judiciary the Chief Justice of the \nUnited States Supreme Court warned that vacancies would harm the \nadministration of justice. The Chief Justice of the United States \nSupreme Court pointedly declared: ``Vacancies cannot remain at such \nhigh levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice that \ntraditionally has been associated with the federal judiciary.''\n  Once this bill is acted upon by the Senate, the Senate will finally \nbe allowed to turn its attention to the longstanding nomination of \nProfessor Fletcher. I have said from the outset of Senator Kyl's effort \nthat I would not hold up consideration of his bill but that I wanted an \nopportunity to note my opposition to it and to vote against it. Indeed, \nit was Senator Kyl who held his bill over for a week before it was \nconsidered before the Judiciary Committee.\n  Despite the Committee reporting of the bill on May 21, 1998, the \nmajority did not propose consideration of S. 1892 until Monday of this \nweek, October 5, 1998. I responded without delay that I was prepared, \nas I had been all along, to enter into a short time agreement to be \nfollowed by a vote on the bill. Consistent with that undertaking I have \nnoted my opposition and am prepared to vote.\n  Madam President, I am willing to yield the remainder of the time and \ngo to a vote.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I am happy to yield the remainder of my \ntime and am prepared to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill is before the Senate and open to \namendment. If there be no amendment to be proposed, the question is on \nthe engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill (S. 1892) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, \nwas read the third time, and passed as follows:\n\n                                S. 1892\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. LIMITATION ON CLOSELY RELATED PERSONS SERVING AS \n                   FEDERAL JUDGES ON THE SAME COURT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 458 of title 28, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(a)(1)'' before ``No person''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(2) With respect to the appointment of a judge of a court \n     exercising judicial power under article III of the United \n     States Constitution (other than the Supreme Court), \n     subsection (b) shall apply in lieu of this subsection.\n       ``(b)(1) In this subsection, the term--\n       ``(A) `same court' means--\n       ``(i) in the case of a district court, the court of a \n     single judicial district; and\n       ``(ii) in the case of a court of appeals, the court of \n     appeals of a single circuit; and\n       ``(B) `member'--\n       ``(i) means an active judge or a judge retired in senior \n     status under section 371(b); and\n       ``(ii) shall not include a retired judge, except as \n     described under clause (i).\n       ``(2) No person may be appointed to the position of judge \n     of a court exercising judicial power under article III of the \n     United States Constitution (other than the Supreme Court) who \n     is related by affinity or consanguinity within the degree of \n     first cousin to any judge who is a member of the same \n     court.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--This Act shall take effect on the date \n     of enactment of this Act and shall apply only to any \n     individual whose nomination is submitted to the Senate on or \n     after such date.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/06/senate-section/article/S11578-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11579-S11580]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SECTION 371 OF THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR \n                                  1999\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to clarify \none section of the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act \nwith my colleague, Senator Thurmond.\n  I want to clarify further the intent of the language in section 371. \nThis section deals with the ability of the children of U.S. Customs \nemployees living in Puerto Rico to attend the Department of Defense \nschool in Puerto Rico. It is my understanding that the Customs Service \nwill not be required to reimburse the Department of Defense for the \ncost of dependents attending the DOD school in Puerto Rico. Is this the \nSenator's understanding?\n  Mr. THURMOND. I appreciate the opportunity to clarify the intent of \nthis provision. The Conference Report authorizes children of Customs \nService employees to attend the Department of Defense school in Puerto \nRico during the period of their assignment in Puerto Rico. Our intent \nwas to remove the five-year limit on the eligibility for children of \nnon-Department of Defense personnel to attend the DOD school in Puerto \nRico since Customs employees are routinely stationed in locations like \nPuerto Rico longer than five years. The provision does not require the \nCustoms Service to pay tuition costs for these children to attend the \nDOD school; however, the Secertary of Defense may work with the \nSecretary of the Treasury to provide reimbursement for the tuition \ncosts for children of Customs Service employees.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That was my understanding as well. I would like to make \none additional point which I believe\n\n[[Page S11580]]\n\nyou just made in your comments. I understand that the intention of the \nConference was that the children of all Customs Service employees would \nbe eligible to attend the DOD school in Puerto Rico. The Conferees did \nnot intend to limit this eligibility to a single category of Customs \nService employee. The Statement of Managers language in the Conference \nReport refers to Customs Agents. Some may interpret this to mean that \nonly children of agents were eligible to attend the DOD school.\n  Mr. THURMOND. The Senator is correct in pointing this out. The term \n``agent'' in the Statement of Managers is not used in the technical \nsense, but was intended to be a generic reference to all Customs \nService employees stationed in Puerto Rico.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank my colleague for clarifying the intent of this \nprovision.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/06/senate-section/article/S11579-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11580]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, Tuesday, October 6, 1998, will always \nhold a spot dear to my heart. I hope that today will also be dear to \nthe hearts of the Cheyenne and Arapaho people, dear to Coloradans, and \ndear to Americans everywhere.\n  Today, S. 1695, the Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site Study \nAct of 1998, a bill I was proud to introduce, was signed into law at a \nspecial White House ceremony. Under this new law, our nation takes a \nmajor step toward honoring the memory of the many innocent Cheyenne and \nArapahoe people massacred there by instructing the National Park \nService to locate the site of the Sand Creek Massacre once and for all.\n  Somewhere along the banks of Sand Creek in Southeastern Colorado is a \nkilling field where many innocent Cheyenne and Arapaho, many of my \nancestors, fell on the cold morning of November 29, 1864. On that day, \nin the month known by the Cheyenne and Arapaho people as the Month of \nthe Freezing Moon, this ground was sanctified when the blood of \nhundreds of innocent Cheyenne and Arapaho women, children and elderly \nnoncombatants was needlessly and brutally spilt.\n  Once this sacred ground is located, I hope it will be acquired and \npreserved with honor and dignity and in a way that takes into account \nthe concerns of the Cheyenne and Arapaho decedents of those who died \nthere. This ground should also be open to all people as a reminder of \nthe national tragedy that occurred at Sand Creek.\n  On this special day, I would like to take a moment to thank a few \npeople who helped S. 1695 become law. I want to thank my colleague from \nColorado, Congressman Bob Schaffer, who introduced the companion bill \nand shepherded this legislation through the House of Representatives. I \nalso want to thank Senator Craig Thomas, who as the Chairman of the \nNational Parks Subcommittee, was gracious and helpful in getting this \nbill through the Senate.\n  I especially want to thank my friends William Walksalong, Steve Brady \nand Laird Cometsevah, who all spoke with such eloquence as witnesses \nduring the March 24th, 1998, hearing on S. 1695, that many in the room, \nincluding myself, were deeply moved. I also want to thank LaForce \nLonebear who sent in his testimony even though he could not attend the \nhearing. Finally, I want to thank David Halaas of the Colorado State \nHistorical Society and Roger Walke of the Congressional Research \nService for their dedication along the way.\n  Many of these and other friends joined me at the White House earlier \ntoday as S. 1695 was signed into law.\n  Finally, on this occasion I want to pay a long overdue tribute to one \nyoung Coloradan, Captain Silas S. Soule, whose actions over one hundred \nand thirty years ago saved many innocent Cheyenne and Arapaho lives on \nthat fateful day at Sand Creek.\n  When Captain Soule, who was under Colonel Chivington's command, heard \nof Chivington's plan to attack a peaceful Cheyenne and Arapaho winter \nencampment at Sand Creek, he vigorously tried to persuade Chivington to \nabandon the plan. However, Colonel Chivington, who was known to say \n``Nits make Lice'' as a justification for killing innocent Cheyenne and \nArapaho women and children, could not be dissuaded.\n  When Chivington ordered his men to attack the peaceful Sand Creek \nencampment, the vast majority of which were women, children, and \nelderly noncombatants, Captain Soule steadfastly refused to order his \nCompany to open fire. Captain Soule's refusal allowed many, perhaps \nhundreds, of innocent Cheyenne and Arapaho to flee the bloody killing \nfield through his Company's line.\n  While the Sand Creek Massacre was at first hailed as a great victory, \nCaptain Soule was determined to make the horrific truth of the massacre \nknown. Even though he was jailed, intimidated, threatened, and even \nshot at, Soule refused to compromise himself and made his voice heard \nthrough reports that reached all the way from Colorado to Washington, \nand even to the floor of the U.S. Senate. Even with the bloody carnage \nof the Civil War, the brutal atrocities at Sand Creek shocked the \nnation.\n  During hearings in Denver, Captain Soule's integrity and unwavering \ntestimony turned the tide against the once popular Chivington and the \nother men who participated in the massacre and mutilations at Sand \nCreek. Captain Soule fully realized that telling the truth about the \nmassacre could cost him his life, even telling a good friend that he \nfully expected to be killed for his testimony. He was right. Walking \nhome with his new bride a short time later, Silas Soule was ambushed \nand shot in the head by an assassin who had participated in the Sand \nCreek Massacre. Silas Soule's funeral, held just a few weeks after his \nwedding, was one of the most attended in Denver up until that time.\n  While Captain Silas Soule's name has largely faded into history, he \nstands out as one of the few bright rays of light in the moral darkness \nthat surrounds the Sand Creek Massacre. He should be remembered.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/06/senate-section/article/S11580-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11580-S11581]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:55 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 563, An act to establish a toll free number in the \n     Department of Commerce to assist consumers in determining if \n     products are American-made.\n       H.R. 633.

A bill to deauthorize the Blunt Reservoir feature of the \nOahe Irrigation Project, South Dakota, and direct the Secretary of the \nInterior to convey certain parcels of land acquired for the reservoir \nto the Commission of Schools and Public Lands of the State of South \nDakota, on the condition that the current preferential leaseholders \nshall have an option to purchase the parcels from the Commission; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                 the blunt reservoir land transfer act\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation to \nrestore to the original owners and operators, the Blunt Reservoir lands \nin Sully County, South Dakota. The time has come for Congress finally \nto return these lands to those who owned them and worked them before \nthey were acquired for the Oahe project. It is clear the lands will \nnever be used for their intended purpose and it makes no sense for the \nBureau of Reclamation to continue to manage them with the expectation \nthat someday this project ever will be constructed.\n  The history of this project has been one of contention and debate \nwithin South Dakota and the federal government. One of the promises \nmade to South Dakota when the Pick-Sloan dams were authorized was that \nwe would be compensated for hosting the dams with the development of \nabundant irrigation. The centerpiece of that promise was the Oahe \nIrrigation project, which was to have expanded the agricultural \npotential of central South Dakota. In anticipation of constructing the \nOahe Irrigation project, the Bureau of Reclamation acquired about \n25,000 acres of land in Sully County to be used as a reservoir to store \nwater for the irrigation project and for a canal from Pierre to carry \nthe water. Despite taking this initial step, the project became very \ncontroversial and, as a result, has never been built. Consequently, \ninstead of constructing the Blunt Reservoir feature of the project, the \nBureau of Reclamation has leased these lands to the original owners and \noperators on a preferential basis and to others on a non-preferential \nbasis, while waiting to see if Congress and the Administration would \never provide the funding necessary to build the project.\n  What has become clear during that time is that the Blunt Reservoir \nfeature of the Oahe project never will be completed. It is senseless to \ncontinue to ask the Bureau of Reclamation to manage these lands. We \nshould recognize this fact and take the steps necessary to return the \nlands to the county tax rolls by restoring them to their former owners \nand operators.\n  Those who have sacrificed their lands to this ill-fated project \nshould no longer be forced to live with the uncertainty of wondering if \nthey will be forever renting the lands they once owned. One farmer \nwhose family owned Blunt Reservoir land for four generations recently \nvisited me in Washington and told me that under their current \ncircumstances there is little incentive to invest in improving the \nland. Without the security of ownership, farmers feel more like hired \nhands than permanent stewards. At times like these, when the very act \nof\n\n[[Page S11583]]\n\nfarming is a precarious pursuit, we should pursue every means of \nproviding stability to our producers.\n  That is why today I am introducing legislation to deauthorize the \nBlunt Reservoir feature of the Oahe Irrigation Project in South Dakota, \nand to transfer to the South Dakota School and Public Lands Commission \nthe preferentially-leased lands. The Commission, in turn, will be \nrequired to offer the lands for sale to the original landowners or \noperators, or their heirs. The legislation also will transfer to the \nSouth Dakota Game, Fish and Parks Department the lands associated with \nthis project that are currently leased on a non-preferential basis. The \nDepartment will use the lands to help mitigate the wildlife habitat \nthat was inundated by the Pick-Sloan project.\n  Under my legislation, the preferential lessees will be able to \npurchase the Blunt Reservoir lands they currently are leasing for cash, \nat a 10% discount from the assessed value, or for a contract-for-deed \nat the full assessed value. The land also could be purchased with a \ncontract-for-deed if the purchaser makes a down payment of 20% of the \nvalue of the land, and pays the balance over 30 years at 3% interest \nper year. Existing preferential lessees would have 10 years from the \ndate of enactment to decide to purchase the lands, during which time \nthey could continue to lease the lands from the School and Public Lands \nCommission at the current lease rates. Money gained from the sale of \nthese lands by the School and Public Lands Commission will support \neducation in South Dakota, which has been adversely affected by the \nreplacement of property tax revenue with the perennially inadequate \nfederal payments-in-lieu-of-taxes for these lands and for the Pick-\nSloan project lands. It is my hope that in the near future, similar \nlegislation can be developed for the lessees using the Pierre Canal \nlands that addresses their objectives to purchase the land and the \nobjectives of those who hope to maintain the option of someday \ndeveloping an irrigation project for the area.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to present this \nlegislation to the Senate. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting its enactment. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of \nthe bill appear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2555\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the \nSocial Security Act, the Wagner-Peyser Act, and the Federal-State \nExtended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 to improve the method by \nwhich Federal unemployment taxes are collected and to improve the \nmethod by which funds are provided from Federal unemployment tax \nrevenue for employment security administration, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               employment security financing act of 1998\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I introduce the Employment \nSecurity Financing Act of 1998, a bill which seeks to reform the \nunemployment insurance program by giving states greater control over \nthe management of their unemployment insurance system.\n  Specifically, under this legislation, beginning January 1, 2000, \nstates would begin to collect Federal unemployment taxes, or ``FUTA \ntaxes,'' in addition to the state unemployment taxes that they \ncurrently collect. The legislation also repeals the ``temporary'' 0.2 \npercent FUTA surtax in 2004, restructures the accounts in the \nUnemployment Trust Fund and reduces paperwork for employers. Most \nimportantly, this legislation will return to the states the funding \nnecessary to effectively operate their employment security systems and \nservices.\n  Reform of the unemployment insurance program is essential to a state \nlike Ohio which receives less than 39 cents of each employer FUTA \ndollar. This shortfall in funding has led to the closing of 22 local \nemployment service offices during the past four years. In order to make \nup for the shortfall of FUTA dollars, the Ohio legislature has \nappropriated more than $50 million during the last four years to pay \nfor employment services, something that should be funded by FUTA \ndollars. This appropriation of state tax dollars forces Ohio taxpayers \nto pay twice to fund unemployment services.\n  Ohio is not alone--since 1990, less than 59 cents of every employer \nFUTA tax dollar has been returned to the states for funding employment \nsecurity. As a result, $2 billion sits in Federal accounts rather than \nbeing used as it was intended--to help put people back to work.\n  This is an important issue that Congress needs to consider. While \nthis legislation obviously will not be considered before adjournment, I \nlook forward to working with Representative Clay Shaw, the House \nsponsor of this bill, on legislation that can meet the budget rules, \nyet still achieve necessary reform of the unemployment insurance \nprogram.\n\n[[Page S11584]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Santorum):\n  S. 2557. A bill to authorize construction and operation of the Valley \nForge Museum of the American Revolution at Valley Forge National \nHistorical Park, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n       valley forge museum of the american revolution act of 1998\n\n Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today I introduce the Valley Forge \nMuseum of the American Revolution Act of 1998, which authorizes the \nSecretary of Interior to enter into an agreement with the private, non-\nprofit Valley Forge Historical Society to construct and operate this \nmuseum and visitor center within the boundaries of Valley Forge \nNational Historical Park.\n  I have worked closely with Congressman Weldon on this legislation, \nand the Valley Forge Museum of the American Revolution Act included in \nthe Omnibus National Parks and Public lands Act currently being \nconsidered in the House of Representatives.\n  This museum will combine the holdings of the Valley Forge National \nHistorical Park and the Valley Forge Historical Society, making it the \nlargest collection of Revolutionary War era artifacts in the world. The \nValley Forge Historical Society, established in 1918, has a long \nhistory of service to the park, and has amassed one of the best \ncollections of artifacts, art, books, and documents relating to the \n1777-1778 encampment of George Washington's Continental Army at Valley \nForge, the American Revolution, and the American colonial era. Their \ncollection is currently housed in a facility that is inadequate to \nproperly maintain, preserve, and display the Society's ever-growing \ncollection. Construction of a new facility will rectify this situation.\n  This project is supported by local officials, and a new facility is \npart of Valley Forge National Historical Park's General Management \nPlan, which has identified inadequacies in the park's current visitor \ncenter and calls for the development of a new or significantly \nrenovated museum and visitor center. The museum will educate an \nestimated 500,000 visitors a year about the critical events surrounding \nthe birth of our nation. Currently, there is no museum in the United \nStates dedicated to the American Revolution, and I believe it is \nimportant that Congress provide the authorization to bring this \nworthwhile project to fruition.\n  This legislation authorizes the Valley Forge Historical Society to \noperate the museum in cooperation with the Secretary of Interior. This \nproject will directly support the historical, educational, and \ninterpretive activities and needs of Valley Forge National Historical \nPark and the Valley Forge Historical Society while combining two \noutstanding museum collections.\n  Mr. President, this legislation holds enormous potential for \nvisitors, scholars, and researchers to the park. I therefore urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 2558. A bill to provide economic security for battered women, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                 Battered Women's Economic security act\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today, Senator Wellstone and I are \nintroducing the Battered Women's Economic Security Act. This \nlegislation was developed in order to address the numerous economic \nobstacles facing victims of domestic and family violence as they try to \nescape this violence.\n  I know that Senator Wellstone joins me in applauding Senator Biden's \nefforts in crafting legislation to reauthorize the Violence Against \nWomen Act programs. Senator Biden developed a bipartisan bill to build \non the success of VAWA and expand those programs aimed at the immediate \nneeds of victims of domestic violence.\n  The legislation we are introducing today takes the next step. As a \nresult of VAWA and the increased federal commitment to addressing the \ndomestic violence crisis, we now have an infrastructure in place that \nhelps the community respond to this violence. VAWA has been a success \nin helping local law enforcement, and the courts, prosecute those who \nbatter and abuse women. VAWA provides a strong law enforcement \ncomponent as well as services to provide immediate and emergency \nassistance to victims. But, the road to recovery is much longer and \nmuch harder because of economic barriers.\n  As I learned last year in my efforts to maintain a safety net for \nvictims of family violence, often times it is basic economics that trap \nwomen and children in violent homes and relationships. Economic \nbarriers threaten the success of VAWA and work to maintain the threat \nof violence.\n  We all know the cost of domestic and family violence. But, there is a \nmuch greater cost to the community that is often overlooked. How many \npolice officers have been caught in the cross fire when responding to \ndomestic and family violence calls? How many innocent children grow up \nin a violent home and bring this violence into the classroom or future \nrelationships? We have made a commitment to ending domestic violence, \nhowever, in order to succeed we must tear down the economic barriers.\n  We have insurance policies that discriminate against victims of \ndomestic violence. Some insurance companies think that victims of \ndomestic violence are engaging in high risk behavior similar to a race \ncar driver or sky diver. Life, homeowners, auto and health insurance \nare essential elements of economic security. Eliminating this \nprotection for victims of domestic violence threatens their ability to \nachieve economic independence. It also discourages women from coming \nforward and reporting this violence and abuse for fear that their \ninsurance company will use it against them.\n  Don't let anyone tell you this does not happen. I can give many \nexamples of insurance discrimination faced by victims of domestic \nviolence. Just ask Kaddas Bolduc from Washington, whose estranged \nhusband burned down her home. Her insurance company refused to honor \nher homeowner's policy as they decided this was not arson, but a \nviolent response to the break up of a relationship. Her husband had \nbeen released from jail shortly before the fire. She was told that she \nhad no claim and no way to rebuild her home. I would have to say that \nthis is a serious economic barrier that must come down.\n  I have met with many domestic violence advocates in Washington and \nhave listen to their concerns about finding long term security for \nvictims. I have heard horror stories about the lack of affordable \nhousing or the inability of victims to secure safe housing. Many \nlandlords refuse to rent to a victim for fear that the violence will \nfollow her. Many women do not have a lease or mortgage in their name. \nThey have no real credit history and certainly cannot prove that they \nwere reliable tenants. As a result they have a difficult time finding \nhousing. Shelters are simply temporary solutions and in many \ncommunities the need far outweighs the availability of emergency \nshelter space.\n  We need to expand Section 8 opportunities for victims of domestic \nviolence in order to ensure that they can find long term housing. A \nsafe, affordable home is often a goal that many battered women are \nunable to achieve. Many women end up back in violent homes or \nrelationships as they have no where else to go. In order to end \ndomestic and family violence we must provide greater housing assistance \nand opportunities to those who have suffered this violence.\n  Currently, there are many barriers to work for victims of domestic \nviolence. Safe, affordable child care would be the greatest barrier and \nI believe the bonus provisions included in this bill will provide the \nincentives to the states to address this problem. We need to expand \nchild care options and benefits for victims of domestic violence, but \nwe cannot do it at the expense of other low income women an families \nstruggling to stay off of welfare. I believe we need to work with the \nstates in addressing the unique needs of victims of domestic violence.\n\n  Unfortunately, the violence can follow women into the work place \nwhich jeopardizes their health and safety as well as their job. Many \nwomen are unable to take leave to seek relief in the courts. They do \nnot have the luxury of taking time off to file for a restraining order \nor to testify against their abuser. They cannot take sick leave to seek \nmedical attention or treatment. Many employers simply do not offer or \nprovide the flexibility that these women\n\n[[Page S11585]]\n\nneed. Included in this legislation we are introducing today is the \nEmployment Protection for Battered Women introduced by Senator \nWellstone. I believe these provisions will help battered women maintain \ntheir jobs without jeopardizing their safety.\n  But when the threat of violence becomes so great as to jeopardize the \nwoman and her coworkers she must be able to leave the job immediately. \nUnfortunately, many states refuse to allow these women the ability to \ncollect unemployment compensation as they rule that she left on her own \naccord. However, many women are forced to leave a job and should not be \npenalized because they are being harassed and have been subjected to \nabuse in the past. Our legislation includes provisions that would allow \na victim of domestic violence to collect unemployment compensation when \nthey are forced to leave their job due to the thereat of continued \nviolence.\n  I have also heard first hand from advocates who have been working \nwith women in an effort to change their Social Security number in order \nto flee a violent abuser. It is impossible to secure employment without \ngiving out one's Social Security number. It is impossible to rent an \napartment or even establish credit without a Social Security number. \nYet giving out this number can make it easier for an abusive husband or \nboyfriend to track a woman down. The ability to change their Social \nSecurity number becomes the difference between economic dependency and \neconomic independence. Yet it is easier to change one's number based on \nsuperstition than it is because one is trying to flee a violent \nrelationship.\n  The Office of Victims Advocacy at the Washington State AG's office \ntold me that it can take as long as six months to change a Social \nSecurity number and that is in a case where there was a clear need to \nchange the victim's identity. But, in most cases it takes more than 12 \nmonths and for some it may never happen. The Social Security \nAdministration must work to correct this threat. Included in our \nlegislation is a requirement that the Social Security Administration \nexpedite requests from victims of domestic violence for a change in \ntheir Social Security number in order to achieve economic independency \nfaster and safer.\n  The legislation is the result of months of drafting and working with \ndomestic violence advocactes to address the many economic barriers \nfacing victims. In working to strengthen the Family Violence Option in \nwelfare reform, I became painfully aware of the barriers that punitive \nwelfare reform provisions had created. But I realized that this was \nonly one of many barriers.\n  VAWA took the first step in dedicating federal resources to \naddressing the domestic violence crisis, but its whole focus is law \nenforcement and emergency response. We need to go to the next level to \ntruly end violence against women. We need to address these economic \nneeds and problems. I believe our legislation meets this test and will \neliminate many of the economic barriers that trap women and children in \nviolent homes and relationships.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in support of this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BREAUX (for himself and Mr. Cochran):\n  S. 2560. A bill to authorize electronic issuance and recognition of \nmigratory bird hunting and conservation stamps; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n                       electronic duck stamp act\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the \ndistinguished senior Senator from the State of Mississippi and my \ncolleague on the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission, Senator \nCochran, in introducing the Electronic Duck Stamp Act. I believe it is \nlegislation all of our colleagues should support.\n  The Electronic Duck Stamp Act would authorize electronic issuance of \nthe federal migratory bird hunting and conservation stamp. A number of \nstates are setting up electronic licensing systems so their hunters can \npurchase all their state hunting licenses at one time and in one \nlocation. This bill will help coordinate federal and state licensing \nsystems and provide sportsmen and sportswomen the convenience of \ngetting all their hunting licenses, federal and state, in one location. \nI believe this added convenience will increase ``duck stamp'' sales. \nThis, in turn, will increase the total funds deposited into the \nMigratory Bird Conservation Fund for the purchase of suitable habitat \nfor migratory birds. These funds are essential to the long-term \nsurvival of our migratory bird populations.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this \nworthwhile legislation, and I ask unanimous consent that the full text \nof this legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2560\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I submit a resolution \nexpressing the sense of the Congress that the United States should not \nextend preferential duty-free treatment on products to countries who do \nnot comply with their treaty obligations regarding the protection of \nintellectual property.\n  The United States leads the world in the production of intellectual \nproperty. Intellectual property-based industries, including those that \nrely on patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and trade \nnames, contribute over $500 billion annually to the U.S. economy. \nHowever, the current global reach of information is making it much \neasier for pirates to gain access to intellectual property. It is \nvitally important that we take adequate steps to discourage, and \nultimately prevent, other nations from allowing the rampant piracy of \nthe work of Americans.\n  Members of the World Trade Organization signed an agreement on Trade-\nRelated aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, or TRIPS, in 1995. \nThat agreement establishes minimum standards of intellectual property \nprotection and requires the signatory developing nations to be \ncompliant with their TRIPS obligations by January 1, 2000. Regardless \nof this, piracy continues in GSP beneficiary nations and around the \nworld, costing the U.S. intellectual property-dependent industries \napproximately $50 billion a year.\n  The United States has recognized the importance of protecting \nAmerican intellectual property and encouraging the growth of its \nrelated industries. The Administration has actively pressed other \nnations to engage in adequate protections, particularly through the use \nof the Special 301 ``watch'' list. However, this is not enough. We need \nto do more to remove the incentives for piracy. Linking GSP benefits to \nTRIPS obligations is an important first step, and a powerful way to \nsend a clear message to these and other nations that there is a price \nto pay for continuing to permit rampant piracy of American-made \nproducts.\n  Mr. President, this sense of the Congress does send an important \nmessage to these countries that the United States is watching, and that \nlegislation to implement the denial of duty-free treatment is imminent \nunless they take the necessary steps to respect and protect the \nintellectual capital of Americans.\n  At this point, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters in \nsupport of this resolution be inserted into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                 International Intellectual Property Alliance,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 1, 1998.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Frank Lautenberg,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Hatch and Lautenberg: On behalf of the \n     International Intellectual Property Alliance and its members \n     (listed below), we convey our strong support for your ``Sense \n     of the Congress'' resolution designed to warn developing \n     countries around the world that they cannot expect \n     preferential trade benefits under the Generalized System of \n     Preferences (GSP) program while, at the same time, condoning \n     the theft of U.S. intellectual property (in our case, movies, \n     business and entertainment software, music and sound \n     recording, and books and journals--products protected by \n     copyright laws).\n       Your resolution rightly sets, as the minimum standard of IP \n     protection, the TRIPS agreement negotiated during the Uruguay \n     Round and set to go into effect for most developing countries \n     on January 1, 2000. It warns these countries that they must \n     bring their statutory laws and, most importantly, their \n     enforcement systems into compliance with those standards if \n     they expect to receive these trade benefits. While the \n     current GSP provisions give the President discretion to deny \n     such benefits where U.S. intellectual property is \n     inadequately protected, we welcome the message you are \n     sending--that the Congress will consider tougher legislation \n     which would increase the risk of these benefits being denied \n     if these countries do not bring their IPR regimes into \n     compliance with their international obligations.\n       Piracy levels in developing countries often hover at or \n     above 90% of the marketplace. Rates at these levels simply \n     deny our copyright-based industries the ability to enter and \n     survive in many of these markets effectively. In total, IIPA \n     estimates that the copyright industries lose over $20 billion \n     to piracy worldwide, with a significant portion of this loss \n     coming from developing countries. IIPA and the Administration \n     have been working diligently to lower these piracy levels and \n     global losses and to a great extent we have achieved success \n     in obtaining improved legislation, the first step in this \n     process. Now we face the challenge of improving enforcement \n     systems and we welcome your resolution in the fight to meet \n     this next objective.\n       We also applaud the resolution's acknowledgment of the \n     importance of the intellectual property industries to the \n     U.S. economy and to our international trade. As we announced \n     last May before Senator Hatch's Judiciary Committee, the \n     copyright industries accounted for $278.4 billion in value \n     added to the U.S. economy, or approximately 3.65% of the \n     Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1996 (the last year for which \n     complete data is available). With respect to employment and \n     job growth, the core copyright industries grew at more than \n     twice the annual growth rate of the U.S. economy as a whole \n     between 1977 and 1996 (5.5% vs. 2.6%). Employment in the core \n     copyright industries grew at nearly three times the \n     employment growth in the economy as a whole between 1977 and \n     1996 (4.6% vs. 1.6%). More than 6.5 million workers were \n     employed by the total copyright industries in 1996, about \n     5.15% of the total U.S. work force. In 1996, the core \n     copyright industries achieved foreign sales and exports of \n     $60.18 billion, a 13% gain over the $53.25 billion generated \n     in 1995, for the first time leading all major industry \n     sectors including agriculture, automobiles and auto parts and \n     the aircraft industry. In the future, the copyright \n     industries will assume ever greater importance to revenue \n     growth, job creation and international trade. Your resolution \n     is right on target to ensure that these industries continue \n     to remain healthy and vibrant.\n       Thank you for your attention to these important matters. \n     Again, the nearly 1,400 companies represented by IIPA members \n     strongly support this resolution.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Eric H. Smith,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              Intellectual Property Committee,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 1, 1998.\n     Hon. Frank R. Lautenberg\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: The Intellectual Property \n     Committee (IPC), whose members represent the broad spectrum \n     of private sector intellectual property interests, strongly \n     endorses the concurrent resolution on worldwide intellectual \n     property protection that you are about to introduce.\n       The concurrent resolution demonstrates a clear \n     understanding that strong worldwide protection of U.S. \n     intellectual property is critical to the continued \n     competitiveness of U.S. industry and to our nation's ability \n     to create good jobs here in the United States. The \n     intellectual property (TRIPS) agreement, which developing \n     country members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) will be \n     required to implement on January 1, 2000, provides \n     international standards of protection and enforcement across \n     a broad range of intellectual property elements.\n       The concurrent resolution expresses the sense of Congress \n     that the United States should not give special trade \n     preferences, under the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences \n     (GSP), to goods originating from countries that will have \n     failed to meet their obligations on January 1, 2000 under the \n     TRIPS Agreement. It also expresses the sense of Congress that \n     Congress should consider legislation that would deny GSP \n     benefits to developing countries that will not be in \n     compliance with their TRIPS obligations beginning on January \n     1, 2000.\n       Through such linkage, your concurrent resolution and the \n     legislation that it envisages will provide the United States \n     with the leverage necessary to ensure that GSP-beneficiary \n     countries will live up to their WTO obligations. (These \n     countries have had a five year transition period to comply \n     with their WTO intellectual property obligations; the \n     transition period will expire as of January 1, 2000.) In the \n     absence of this type of leverage, the United States will face \n     real difficulty in achieving the critical goal of improved\n\n[[Page S11588]]\n\n     worldwide intellectual property protection in a timely \n     manner. In addition, your concurrent resolution will \n     underscore the importance of adequate and effective \n     intellectual property protection in stimulating economic \n     growth in GSP-beneficiary countries, which will lead to \n     expanded export opportunities for U.S. goods and services.\n       The IPC commends your continued efforts on behalf of strong \n     intellectual property protection and economic growth in the \n     United States.\n           Sincerely,\n     Charles S. Levy,\n                                                          Counsel.\n     Jacques J. Gorlin,\n     Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Interactive Digital\n\n\n                                         Software Association,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 1, 1998.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Frank Lautenberg,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Hatch and Lautenberg: I write to thank you \n     for your leadership on the issue of protecting intellectual \n     property, and in particular to express the support of the \n     Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA), which \n     represents the United States entertainment software \n     publishers, for your decision to introduce a ``Sense of the \n     Congress'' resolution on this issue. The IDSA believe this \n     resolution will provide developing nations an incentive to \n     meet pre-existing obligations to offer adequate and effective \n     protection to intellectual property rights (IPR), and in \n     particular to take all necessary steps to implement the \n     Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property \n     Rights (TRIPs Agreement.) Because the United States leads the \n     world in intellectual property production and experiences a \n     tremendous positive balance of trade in this area, better \n     global protection for IPR will directly benefit the United \n     States economy.\n       Piracy of intellectual property is a severe problem for \n     U.S. industries. In 1997, the U.S. entertainment software \n     industry, which had revenues of $5.6 billion in the United \n     States, experienced global piracy losses of approximately \n     $3.2 billion (not including online piracy losses.) Perhaps \n     more troubling, $894 million of those losses occurred in \n     developing nations that receive special trade preference from \n     the U.S. under the Generalized Systems of Preferences (GSP) \n     program. As a result, the U.S. provides special trade \n     preferences to the goods of nations whose inadequate \n     protection for IPR effectively bars many U.S. companies from \n     doing business therein.\n       Piracy losses in GSP beneficiary nations continue to mount \n     though many of these nations have signed the TRIPs Agreement \n     and are required to meet its obligations by January 1, 2000. \n     In fact, many of these nations have yet to begin the long \n     process of passing legislation to implement the TRIPs \n     Agreement, much less to demonstrate a willingness to enforce \n     such laws once enacted. Due to this lack of progress, it \n     appears that the vast majority of developing nations will not \n     be in full compliance with the TRIPs Agreement as required on \n     January 1, 2000.\n       Your resolution will, in a variety of ways, help to address \n     the problem of inadequate protection for IPR rights by \n     developing nations. Your resolution will send a powerful \n     message that the United States Congress places a high \n     priority on global IPR protection. By expressing a \n     congressional willingness to deny GSP benefits to nations \n     that do not meet their TRIPs Agreement obligations, your \n     resolution will provide developing nations a powerful \n     incentive to get serious about TRIPs Agreement \n     implementation. Furthermore, your resolution will supplement \n     and support the efforts of the United States Government, \n     particularly the Office of the United States Trade \n     Representative (USTR), and United States intellectual \n     property owners to convince developing nations to provide at \n     least the minimum of IPR protection required under the TRIPs \n     Agreement.\n       Therefore, I again express the full support of the IDSA for \n     your resolution, and offer any assistance we may provide in \n     seeing this resolution to passage.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Doug Lowenstein,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n         Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 6, 1998.\n     Hon. Frank Lautenberg,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: I am writing to express PhRMA's \n     support for the Concurrent Resolution regarding GSP and \n     intellectual property you are introducing today. The denial \n     of intellectual property rights protection abroad is one of \n     the American research-based pharmaceutical industry's most \n     serious challenges. Billions of dollars are lost annually to \n     patent pirates in such countries as Argentina, India, Egypt, \n     and many others.\n       By withholding GSP privileges from countries that refuse to \n     respect the intellectual property rights of American \n     biomedical inventors, your Resolution sends an important \n     signal to the world trading community. American foreign trade \n     policy is based on the fundamental principle of reciprocity, \n     and denial of intellectual property rights is, in fact, a de \n     facto denial of market access since the innovator cannot \n     enjoy the limited period of marketing exclusivity granted by \n     a patent. Since many pirating countries on the one hand deny \n     market access to American companies, but on the other hand \n     enjoy not only market access but GSP treatment on trade with \n     the United States, your Resolution is quite appropriate and \n     necessary.\n       PhRMA is pleased to offer its support for the Concurrent \n     Resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that GSP \n     benefits should be withheld from developing countries that \n     violate American intellectual property rights.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                Barry H. Caldwell,\n     Vice President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/06/senate-section/article/S11586-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11588-S11600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         READING EXCELLENCE ACT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      JEFFORDS AMENDMENT NO. 3740\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS proposed an amendment to the bill (H.R. 2614) to improve \nthe reading and literacy skills of children and families by improving \nin-service instructional practices for teachers who teach reading, to \nstimulate the development of more high-quality family literacy \nprograms, to support extended learning-time opportunities for children, \nto ensure that children can read well and independently not later than \nthird grade, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The economic, security, and humanitarian interests of \n     the United States and the nations of sub-Saharan Africa would \n     be enhanced by sustainable, broad-based agricultural and \n     rural development in each of the African nations.\n       (2) According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, the \n     number of undernourished people in Africa has more than \n     doubled, from approximately 100,000,000 in the late 1960s to \n     215,000,000 in 1998, and is projected to increase to \n     265,000,000 by the year 2010. According to the Food and \n     Agriculture Organization, the term ``under nutrition'' means \n     inadequate consumption of nutrients, often adversely \n     affecting children's physical and mental development, \n     undermining their future as productive and creative members \n     of their communities.\n       (3) Currently, agricultural production in Africa employs \n     about two-thirds of the workforce but produces less than one-\n     fourth of the gross domestic product in sub-Saharan Africa, \n     according to the World Bank Group.\n       (4) African women produce up to 80 percent of the total \n     food supply in Africa according to the International Food \n     Policy Research Institute.\n       (5) An effective way to improve conditions of the poor is \n     to increase the productivity of the agricultural sector. \n     Productivity increases can be fostered by increasing research \n     and education in agriculture and rural development.\n       (6) In November 1996, the World Food Summit set a goal of \n     reducing hunger worldwide by 50 percent by the year 2015 and \n     encouraged national governments to develop domestic food \n     plans and to support international aid efforts.\n       (7) Although the World Bank Group recently has launched a \n     major initiative to support agricultural and rural \n     development, only 10 percent, or $1,200,000,000, of its total \n     lending to sub-Saharan Africa for fiscal years 1993 to 1997 \n     was devoted to agriculture.\n\n[[Page S11604]]\n\n       (8)(A) United States food processing and agricultural \n     sectors benefit greatly from the liberalization of global \n     trade and increased exports.\n       (B) Africa represents a growing market for United States \n     food and agricultural products.

EFFECTIVE DATE OF PROVISIONS CONTINGENT ON SAVING \n                   SOCIAL SECURITY FIRST.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the social security program, created in 1935 to provide \n     old-age, survivors, and disability insurance benefits, is one \n     the most successful and important social insurance programs \n     in the United States, and has played an essential role in \n     reducing poverty among seniors;\n       (2) the social security program will face significant \n     pressures when the baby boom generation retires, which could \n     threaten the long-term viability of the program;\n       (3) Congress needs to act promptly to ensure that social \n     security benefits will be available when today's younger \n     Americans retire; and\n       (4) current budget law and rules that were established to \n     ensure fiscal discipline, including the pay-as-you-go system \n     (which requires tax cuts to be fully offset), prevent \n     Congress from using projected budget surpluses to pay for tax \n     cuts, except by a supermajority vote by three-fifths of the \n     membership of the Senate.\n       (b) Requirement for Social Security Solvency.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of, or amendment made by, \n     this Act, no\n\n[[Page S11627]]\n\n     such provision or amendment shall take effect before the \n     first January 1 after the date of enactment of this Act that \n     follows a calendar year for which there is a social security \n     solvency designation pursuant to subsection (c).\n       (c) Social Security Solvency Designation.--For purposes of \n     subsection (b), there is a social security solvency \n     designation for a calendar year if, during such year--\n       (1) the Board of Trustees of the social security trust \n     funds certifies in its annual report that both the Federal \n     Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal \n     Disability Insurance Trust Fund are in long-range actuarial \n     balance pursuant to section 201(c)(2) of the Social Security \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 401(c)(2)); and\n       (2) Congress, upon review of the Board of Trustees' \n     determination that the trust funds are in long-range \n     actuarial balance, so certifies by statute.\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am submitting an \namendment to the House-passed tax bill on the calendar. This amendment \nwould improve the House bill by directing more of its tax relief to \nmiddle income taxpayers, and by protecting Social Security.\n  The amendment would provide relief from the marriage penalty, help \nparents afford child care, promote the modernization of our schools, \nallow self-employed individuals to deduct the costs of health \ninsurance, encourage savings and investment by establishing new \nexclusions for interest and dividends for all Americans, promote \nresearch by reinstating the research and experimentation tax credit, \nprovide relief from the estate and gift tax, promote the revitalization \nof depressed areas, expand support for small businesses, and modify \nrules that discourage seniors from working.\n  The amendment differs from the House bill in two primary respects. \nFirst, it would target tax relief to middle income families, largely by \nproviding additional relief for families with children in child care, \nand by promoting the modernization of our nation's schools. Second, the \nbill protects Social Security, by deferring the effective date of the \ntax cuts until the Social Security Trust Fund is actuarially sound.\n  Mr. President, let me briefly review the items that are included in \nmy proposal.\n  First, the amendment would provide relief from the marriage penalty. \nAs proposed in the House-passed bill, the amendment would increase the \nstandard deduction for married couples so that each spouse would have \nthe same deduction as a single filer.\n  Second, the amendment would help families handle the costs of child \ncare. It would increase the child care and dependent tax credit to a \nmaximum allowable expense for inflation. It would make the credit \nrefundable, so that it benefits those with lower incomes. And it would \nprovide a new tax credit worth $90 per month for stay-at-home parents \nof children under one year of age.\n  Third, the amendment would promote education, by supporting the \nmodernization of our schools, and allowing schools of higher education \nto establish prepaid tuition programs.\n  Fourth, the amendment would allow self-employed individuals to fully \ndeduct the costs of health insurance.\n  Fifth, the amendment would promote savings and investment, by \nestablishing a new exclusion for dividends and interest. Individuals \ncould exclude up to $200, and couples could exclude up to $400 in \ndividends and interest.\n  Sixth, the amendment would extend several provisions of the tax code \nthat expired this year or would expire next year. These include the \ncredits for research, work opportunity and welfare-to-work, would be \nextended through Feb. 29, 2000. The credit for contributions of stock \nto private foundations would be extended permanently.\n  Seventh, the amendment would provide immediate relief from the estate \nand gift tax. Under the legislation, an additional $25,000 of estates \nwould, in effect, be excludable from this tax in 1999. This would \nincrease the total credit against this tax to $675,000.\n  Eighth, the amendment would encourage the revitalization of depressed \nareas, by providing a variety of tax incentives to businesses and \nindividuals in 20 so-called renewal communities. These low-income areas \nwould be designated by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.\n  Ninth, the amendment includes various provisions to assist small \nbusinesses. For example, the legislation would allow small-business \nowners to deduct up to $25,000 of the cost of business-related \nequipment.\n  Finally, the amendment would allow seniors to work more without \nsuffering a reduction in their Social Security benefits. Under the \nproposal, seniors would be able to earn up to $17,000 in 1999 without \nlosing a portion of their Social Security benefits. That limit would \nincrease to $39,750 in 2008.\n  Mr. President, there also are other provisions in this amendment, and \nI will not detail each one. Suffice it to say that, to a very large \nextent, this proposal tracks the tax cuts included in legislation \napproved by the House. However, as I have noted, the amendment is more \ntargeted to middle income taxpayers, largely because it includes \nsupport for child care and school modernization. Also, its estate tax \nprovisions are somewhat modified from the House version, to help us \nafford these other provisions, and to ensure that the bulk of the \nrelief provided in the bill goes to middle class and moderate-income \nAmericans.\n  The second key difference from the House Mr. President, it that this \nproposal includes significant tax relief while fully protecting Social \nSecurity. Under the proposal, all tax cuts would become effective when \nthe Social Security Trust Fund is in long-range actuarial balance. This \nensures that we will not squander our opportunity to reform Social \nSecurity next year, and that we will not force unnecessary cuts in \nSocial Security benefits for today's younger Americans. It also \nreflects a commitment to abide by the Balanced Budget Agreement and to \nmaintain fiscal discipline.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this proposal, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that a summary of the amendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The Lautenberg Amendment includes approximately $85 billion \n     in tax relief that would be available when the Social \n     Security Trust Fund is actuarially sound. The tax cuts are \n     largely the same as those proposed in the House-passed tax \n     bill (though the Amendment also includes tax cuts for child \n     care and school modernization so that its benefits are more \n     targeted to the middle class). Unlike the House-passed bill, \n     the Amendment would not reduce any budget surplus before \n     Congress saves Social Security first.\n       The main elements of the proposal (and cost in $ billions/5 \n     years) are:\n       From House bill: (1) Marriage penalty relief, 28; (2) \n     Interest and dividends exclusion, 15; (3) Self-employed \n     health deduction, 5; (4) Expiring provisions (e.g., R \n     credit), 6; (5) Social Security earnings test, 0.5.\n       Items not in House bill: (1) Child care, 17; (2) School \n     modernization, 5.\n       Item modified from House bill: Estate tax relief, 2 (House: \n     18).\n\n\n                           amendment summary\n\n      1. Family Tax Relief Provisions\n       A. Marriage Penalty Relief--Increase the standard deduction \n     for married couples so that each spouse would have the same \n     deduction as a single filer. The deduction for married \n     couples would increase from $7200 to $8600 in 1999, reducing \n     their taxes by an average of $243 per return. Cost: $28 \n     billion (House tax bill)\n       B. Interest and Dividends--Individuals, regardless of \n     income, would be able to exclude up to $200 of combined \n     interest and dividends from taxes. Married couples could \n     exclude $400. Cost: $15 billion (House tax bill)\n       C. AMT Relief--Individuals would not have to pay the \n     alternative minimum tax as a result of claiming certain tax \n     credits, such as the dependent care credit, the adoption \n     credit, and the child tax credit. Cost: $8.1 billion (House \n     tax bill)\n       D. Affordable Child Care--Increase the maximum credit rate \n     to 50% from the current 30%, index the maximum allowable \n     expense for inflation, and make the current dependent care \n     tax credit refundable. Provides a new tax credit worth $90 \n     per month for stay-at-home parents of children under 1. \n     Creates an employer tax credit for child care services. Cost: \n     $17.0 billion. (From S. 1610, Sen. Dodd's Affordable Child \n     Care for Early Success and Security Act)\n     2. Education and Infrastructure\n       A. Permit Schools of Higher Education to Establish \n     Qualified Prepaid Tuition Programs--These programs allow \n     parents to make contributions which are held for use when \n     their children attend college. Contributions accumulate on a \n     tax-deferred basis. Cost: $572 million (House tax bill)\n       B. Government Bonds--States would be able to issue more \n     private activity tax-exempt bonds, which typically finance \n     privately owned transportation facilities, municipal \n     services, economic development projects and social programs. \n     The current annual limits of $50 per resident or $150 million \n     (whichever is greater) would be increased to $75 per resident \n     or $225 million. Cost $1.1 billion (House tax bill)\n       C. Renewal Communities--To promote the revitalization of \n     depressed areas, the bill\n\n[[Page S11628]]\n\n     would provide a variety of tax incentives in 20 ``removal \n     communities.''--Cost: $1 billion (House tax bill)\n       D. School Modernization--Bond holders would receive tax \n     credits (a standard amount for all bonds) worth the full \n     interest cost on the bonds, allowing localities to construct \n     or renovate schools without paying any interest. Cost $5 \n     billion (President's budget proposal)\n     3. Small Business and Farmer Tax Relief\n       A. Estate and Gift Tax Unified Credit--The proposal would \n     accelerate from 2000 to 1999 an increase in the Estate and \n     Gift tax credit (increasing the credit from $650,000 to \n     $675,000). Cost: $1.8 billion (Revised provision from House \n     tax bill)\n       B Deduction for Health Insurance Premiums of the Self-\n     Employed.--Full deductibility is now scheduled to be phased \n     in by 2007. The bill would make the change effective in 1999. \n     Cost: $5.1 billion (House tax bill)\n       C. Agriculture--The bill would permanently extend ``income \n     averaging'' for farmers, which is scheduled to expire in \n     2000. Rather than pay high taxes in good years, a farmer \n     would have the option of paying taxes based on a three year \n     average. Farmers also could reduce their tax burden by \n     applying an operating loss in one year to their taxable \n     income in any one of five past years, or to a future year. \n     Under current law, they can apply it to two past years or to \n     a future year. Cost $126 million. (House tax bill)\n       D. Business Expensing--Starting in 1999, small-business \n     owners and farmers would be able to deduct up to $25,000 of \n     the cost of business-related equipment. Under current law, \n     the deduction is limited to $18,500 and is slated to rise to \n     $25,000 in 2003. Cost $1.1 billion. (House tax bill)\n       E. Expired Credits. Several tax credits that expired this \n     year or would expire next year, including credits for \n     research, work opportunity and welfare-to-work, would be \n     extended through Feb. 29, 2000. The credit for contributions \n     of stock to private foundations would be extended \n     permanently. Cost: $6.2 billion (House tax bill)\n     4. Social Security Earnings Test\n       Senior citizens ages 65 to 69 would be able to earn up to \n     $17,000 in 1999 without losing a portion of their Social \n     Security benefits. The earnings limit would gradually rise to \n     $30,000 in 2002 and $39,750 in 2008. Current law permits the \n     earnings limit to increase to $37,948 in 2008, but at a \n     slower pace.

Mr President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \ncourageous men and women who serve in the United States Navy.\n  The origins of the Navy can be traced back to October 13, 1775, when \nthe Continental Congress ordered the construction of ships for use in \nthe War of Independence. It was at this time that the Continental Navy \nwas formed, nine months before America declared itself independent. \nHowever, it wasn't until later, on April 30, 1798, that the Department \nof the Navy was established and Benjamin Stoddert was appointed its \nfirst Secretary. This past spring we celebrated the 200th anniversary \nof the Department of the Navy.\n  Today, the United States Navy has grown to a force of nearly 400,000 \nactive duty and 96,000 Reserves. During times of war, these brave \nindividuals join with the other Armed Forces and valiantly risk their \nlives to defend America's freedom and national interests. During times \nof peace, the Navy is engaged in promoting regional economic and \npolitical stability by maintaining a global presence both above and \nbeneath the surface of the seas.\n  The Navy is organized into three main components. The first \ncomponent, the Navy Department, consists of the Washington, D.C. \nexecutive offices and the Secretary of Defense. The second component, \nthe operating forces, includes the Marine Corps, the reserve components \nand during times of war, the U.S. Coast Guard. The operating component \ntrains and equips naval forces. The third component, the shore \nestablishment, provides intelligence support, medical and dental \nfacilities, training areas, communications centers, and facilities for \nthe repair of machinery and electronics. Together these components form \na strong force ready to defend the seas whenever freedom is threatened.\n  An important division of the Navy is the Naval Reserve. Today, the \nNaval Reserve comprises 20 percent of the Navy's total assets. These \ndedicated men and women have provided assistance as medical personnel \nand offered fleet intelligence support in operations such as Desert \nShield and Desert Storm. At other times, the Naval Reserve has helped \nprovide humanitarian assistance and has engaged in maritime patrol. \nOver the years, the Naval Reserve has evolved from a reactive to a \nproactive force ready to meet the challenges of the next century.\n  Minnesota is home to 282 active duty Navy servicepeople, of which 35 \nare officers and 247 are enlisted. In addition, Minnesota has 1,540 \nNavy reservists, of which 340 are officers and 1,200 are enlisted.\n  Mr. President, since its founding over 200 years ago, the Navy has \nshown the utmost dedication and service while protecting our national \ninterests. I truly appreciate its commitment to defending this nation \nand am honored today to pay tribute to the men and women of the United \nStates Navy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/06/senate-section/article/S11630-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HONORING JOSEPH C. AND LUCILLE PARISI\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to join the Holy \nName Healthcare Foundation in honoring Joseph C. Parisi and Lucille his \nwife as they receive the Lifetime Achievement Award. The Parisi's \nrecord of community activism and involvement has been extensive, and I \nam pleased to recognize them on this occasion.\n  Joseph C. Parisi has served as Mayor of Englewood Cliffs since 1976. \nPrior to that he served on the town council for four years and was also \nthe Englewood Cliffs Police Commissioner. His involvement in the \nEnglewood Cliffs community for over twenty-five years has made \nEnglewood Cliffs one of the finest towns in the North Jersey area. \nMayor Parisi has worked on behalf of a diverse pool of charitable and \ncivic organizations that include the Witte Scholarship Fund, the \nQuincentennial Columbus Day Celebration, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and \nthe Knights of Columbus. The Englewood Chamber of Commerce, UNICO, and \nthe New Jersey Insurance Agents, have all honored Mayor Parisi as their \n``Man of the Year'' in the past.\n  Lucille Parisi has equaled her husband's accomplishments in a number \nof civic organizations. As President of the Hudson County Independent \nInsurance Agents, President of the Englewood Cliffs Democratic Club, \nand Director of the Fort Lee Savings and Loan, Lucille has been an \nactive member of the community. For the past 16 years, she has also \nserved on the Board of Trustees and the Foundation of the Holy Name \nHospital.\n  As a native of Bergen County, I have known the Parisis well for many \nyears. I have seen their dedication to the Englewood Cliffs Community \nfirsthand, and I have consistently been impressed by their level of \ncommitment. They truly embody the activism and dedication to community \nthat is so vital.\n  I know they will inspire others to take an interest in improving \ntheir communities. They have earned a place in the hearts of Englewood \nCliffs residents, and it is my pleasure to be able to honor them and \ntheir family on this occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/06/senate-section/article/S11630-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11630-S11631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RETIREMENT OF DARLENE GARCIA\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, as United States Senators, we are \noften fortunate to have people of exceptional ability work for us. It \nis, however, unusual to have someone of unlimited compassion helping \nthe people in the State we represent. Darlene Garcia is a person of \nunlimited compassion and I have been very lucky to have her on my staff \nfor the last 20 years.\n  Darline is the Director of my Las Cruces office. This is one of the \nfastest growing areas in New Mexico, and Darlene has her finger on the \npulse on it all. She has helped hundreds of New Mexicans with their \nveterans benefits, social security, food stamps, and immigration \nproblems. Darlene knows how to make the Federal Government do what it \nis supposed to do for its citizens. In fact, Darlene knows how to make \nU.S. Senators do what is right by their constituents.\n  I sometimes say, there isn't any kind of care that Darlene hasn't \nchampioned be it health care, child care, or elder care. She has always \nworked for more and better care for the people of Southern New Mexico \nbecause it is Darlene who rally cares. Darlene is the doer of good \ndeeds. If good deed were dollars, she would have surpassed Bill Gates \nyears ago.\n\n[[Page S11631]]\n\n  Darlene always has a smile for everyone who walks into my office. She \nalways knows who to call to solve a problem. She has been a mother \nfigure and an inspiration to all of the young people who have interned \nin my Las Cruces office.\n  Darlene has been my representative to the business community, worked \nextensively with county and municipal government officials and of \ncourse, the Hispanic community. She has worked on border issues and has \nhelped keep the Texans under control The latter is no small feat.\n  I want to thank Darlene for all of her hard work, and wish her the \nbest in retirement. God bless you, Darlene, for all that you have done \nfor me and for the people of New Mexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/06/senate-section/article/S11630-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING RODRIGO d'ESCOTO\n\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, it is my honor to rise today \nto recognize a distinguished resident and successful businessman from \nmy home state of Illinois, Mr. Rodrigo d'Escoto. Last month, Mr. \nd'Escoto was named the National Minority Male Entrepreneur of the Year \nby the U.S. Department of Commerce's Minority Development Agency. This \naward recognizes Mr. d'Escoto's Hispanic heritage, his success as an \nentrepreneur, and his service and dedication to the community.\n  Mr. d'Escoto is the founder and chairman of d'Escoto, Inc., a \nChicago-based architectural engineering firm. Established in 1972, \nd'Escoto, Inc. is one of the largest Hispanic-owned firms of its kind \nin the Midwest. Over the last twenty five years, the firm has \nparticipated in some of the most ambitious and important design/\nconstruction projects in the Chicago area. These projects include the \nNorthwestern Memorial Hospital Expansion project, the expansion of the \nMcCormick Place Convention Center and Hotel, the construction of the \nnew Cook County Hospital, the ongoing expansion of O'Hare International \nAirport and the construction of the airport's new international \nterminal. Certainly, Rodrigo d'Escoto and d'Escoto Inc. have \ncontributed greatly to the look and structure of Chicago, one of the \nworld's great architectural cities.\n  As is often the case with someone who has achieved so much \nprofessionally, Rodrigo d'Escoto is a committed community member. Among \nthe many boards and organizations that Mr. d'Escoto has given his time \nand expertise to are: the Harold Washington Foundation, the Urban \nLeague, the United Way, the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, \nthe Pilsen Resurrection Development Corporation, the National \nAssociation of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, the Centro \nHispano Americano, the City of Chicago Planning Commission, the \nAlliance of Latinos and Jews, and the Hispanic American Construction \nIndustry Association. It is important to note that this is only a \npartial list of the many worthwhile and important enterprises that \nRodrigo d'Escoto has touched over the years.\n  Mr. President, as one can see, the dimensions of Rodrigo d'Escoto's \nprofessional and civic accomplishments are of breathtaking proportions. \nIndeed, he is quite deserving of being named the National Minority Male \nEntrepreneur of the Year. I am confident that my Senate colleagues will \njoin me in congratulating Mr. d'Escoto and d'Escoto, Inc. for this \nprestigious award, and in wishing them much continued success in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/06/senate-section/article/S11631-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HIGHER EDUCATION REAUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for the Higher Education Reauthorization Act that passed the \nSenate by a 96-0 vote last week.\n  Mr. President, this legislation illustrates this Congress' strong \nsupport for education, particularly higher education. This bill will \nmake strong investments in our future by increasing the availability of \nfinancial aid to students in need, thereby allowing more students to \nbenefit from our higher education system. Specifically, the bill lowers \nstudents' five-year loan rate to the lowest it has been for 17 years. \nCongress was able to strike a balance of lowering the rates students \npay on their loans to 7.46 percent while keeping commercial lenders in \nthe market. This reduction in interest rates will result in a savings \nof $700 on the average debt of $13,000 and savings of more than $1,000 \non a $20,000 debt. By striking this balance, the long-term stability of \nthe student loan program will continue.\n  The Higher Education Reauthorization Act also increases the maximum \nPell Grant available to low-income students. Beginning in 1999, the \nmaximum student Pell Grant authorization level will increase gradually \neach year from the current level of $3,000 to $5,800 in 2003. This \nchange will enable low-income students to afford college and accumulate \nless debt.\n  The bill also includes an important change to the State Student \nIncentive Grant (SSIG) program that is of particular importance to me. \nUnder this legislation, the SSIG program was reformed and changed to \nthe Special Leveraging Education Assistance Partnership (LEAP) Program. \nWorking with Senators Jeffords, Collins, and Reed, I was able to have \nlanguage included under the LEAP Program to provide scholarships for \nlow-income students studying mathematics, computer science, or \nengineering. I believe this language is particularly important given \nthe current shortage of high-tech workers. Through the LEAP program, \nStates are provided matching money from the Federal Government to \nprovide grants for students entering various fields of study.\n  The Higher Education Reauthorization Act makes a strong commitment to \npre-K and K-12 education by creating a loan forgiveness program for \nstudents who earn a degree and obtain employment in the child care \nindustry, as well as for students who gain teaching jobs in school \ndistricts serving large populations of low-income children. The loan \nforgiveness program will provide an important incentive for teachers to \ngo into underserved areas and fields. Coupled with this provision, the \nHigher Education Act strengthens and promotes greater accountability \nwithin current teacher preparation programs. The legislation provides \nState and local partnerships with incentives to place a greater focus \non academics and strong teaching skills for teacher certification \nprograms. By focusing on teacher preparation, this bill increases the \nlikelihood that students will be adequately prepared and able to \nsucceed in our higher education system.\n  In all, this legislation demonstrates the bipartisan nature of this \nCongress' commitment to education. This bill will impact thousands of \ncollege-bound students each year and will prepare thousands of school-\nage children for higher education in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/06/senate-section/article/S11631-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11631-S11633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE TRUE STORY OF HYDROGEN AND THE ``HINDENBURG'' DISASTER\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, for many years I have spoken of the \npromise of hydrogen energy as our best hope for an environmentally safe \nsustainable energy future. My vision, and the vision of many of our top \nscientists is simple. Hydrogen, which is produced by renewable energy \nwith absolutely no pollution and no resource depletion of any kind, \nwill prove a truly sustainable energy option.\n  I recognize that hydrogen is not yet a form of energy widely known to \nthe American public. In fact, hydrogen has an unfortunate association. \nI would like to spend a few minutes dispelling one unfortunate myth of \nhydrogen energy.\n  Mr. President, mention the word ``hydrogen'' and many people remember \nthe Hindenburg--the dirigible that caught fire back in May of 1937, \nkilling 36 of the 97 people on board. Now, thanks to the scientific \nsleuthing of Addison Bain, a retired NASA scientist with 30 years \nexperience with hydrogen, we can state with a fair degree of certainty \nthat the Hindenburg would have caught fire even without any hydrogen on \nboard.\n  This detective story was reported in a recent issue of Popular \nScience. I ask that the Popular Science article be printed in the \nCongressional Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  Addison Bain collected actual samples from the Hindenburg--the cloth \nbags that contained the hydrogen--which were saved as souvenirs by the \ncrowd awaiting the Hindenburg at Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937. \nWhen these samples were analyzed by modern techniques, Bain discovered\n\n[[Page S11632]]\n\nthat the bags had been coated with cellulose nitrate or cellulose \nacetate--both flammable materials. Furthermore, the cellulose material \nwas impregnated with aluminum flakes to reflect sunlight, and aluminum \npowder is used in rocket fuel. Essentially the outside of the \nHindenburg was coated with rocket fuel!\n  Addison now believes that the Hindenburg probably caught fire from an \nelectrical discharge igniting the cellulose-coated gas bags. Remember, \nthe ship docked at Lakehurst with electrical storms in the area, which \nwas against regulations.\n  I would like to personally thank Addison Bain for his valuable \ncontribution to the history of the Hindenburg, and to lessening the \npublic's concerns over the safety of hydrogen. Hydrogen, in my \njudgment, will become a premier fuel in the 21st century, since burning \nhydrogen produces no pollution of any kind, just pure, clean water. And \nhydrogen can be produced by using sunlight or wind electricity to split \nwater.\n  Hydrogen energy has been used safely in the Nation's space program \nfor many decades, and I believe it can be used safely for many other \napplications here on Earth. For example, hydrogen could be a safe \nalternative fuel for cars. It would be much less dangerous than \ngasoline in an accident. Hydrogen gas disperses rapidly, while gasoline \nlingers in the vicinity of the accident, increasing the risks to \nsurvivors of the crash. I believe there are also countless other uses \nfor hydrogen. We can pursue those options without fear because of \nAddison Bain's efforts. Thanks to Addison Bain, we can continue down \nthe path toward a renewable hydrogen future without the undue fear of a \nsingular event from 60 years ago.\n  The article follows:\n\n                   What Really Downed the Hindenburg\n\n                       (By Mariette DiChristina)\n\n       May 6, 1937. The sky still appears moody after a stormy \n     day. A stately, silvery marvel, the 240-ton Hindenburg \n     airship glides 200 feet above Lakehurst, New Jersey, at \n     around 7:21 p.m. In a 6-knot wind, the Zeppelin is attempting \n     its first ``high landing'': The crew throws the spider lines \n     out, preparing for mooring. The gigantic ship, nearly three \n     football fields in length, would be slowly winched down.\n       If you think you know exactly what happened next, Adison \n     Bain has a surprise for you. Six decades after the infamous \n     Hindenburg disaster, when 36 of 97 aboard died during the \n     horrific blaze that halted rigid-airship travel, Bain has \n     revealed a stunning new explanation for what started the \n     fire. Bain, a recently retired engineer and manager of \n     hydrogen programs who spent more than 30 years at NASA, has \n     recently concluded several years of scientific sleuthing work \n     in search of the culprit behind the conflagration. He combed \n     through thousands of pages of original testimony and \n     materials at four archives in the United States and one in \n     Germany, interviewed survivors and airship experts, and \n     ultimately tested original materials from the model LZ-129 \n     Hindenburg and its contemporaries. Contrary to what the \n     investigators ruled at the time, asserts Bain, the fire did \n     not start with free hydrogen lit by natural electrical \n     discharge or sabotage.\n       The hunt for the truth about the Hindenburg began in the \n     late 1960s for Bain, a genial man with slicked-backed dark \n     hair and a face lined by many smiles. He was working on a \n     hydrogen safety manual for NASA. Sitting in a ``Florida \n     room'' of mint and mauve tiled floors and furniture in a \n     Cocoa Beach apartment, Bain recalls how he paged through the \n     literature on hydrogen. ``Invariably,'' he says, ``the topic \n     of the Hindenburg would come up. At the time, I didn't think \n     a lot about it.''\n       Over the years, however, as he continued his NASA work in \n     hydrogen systems, the reference began to accumulate in his \n     mind. ``What I was starting to notice is that the authors \n     were inconsistent,'' he says. Hydrogen detractors said the \n     gas was so flammable it killed everyone on the Hindenburg, \n     which wasn't true--about one-third of those aboard had died. \n     On the other hand, hydrogen promoters pooh-poohed safety \n     concerns and claimed that those who perished did so only \n     because they jumped from the burning airship, which also \n     wasn't true. Says Bain: ``I thought, wait a minute! Where are \n     they getting their information?'' He has also seen the famous \n     photos of the Hindenburg's bright, blistering hot fire and \n     knew that hydrogen doesn't burn in that way. A hydrogen fire \n     radiates little heat and is barely visible to the unaided \n     eye.\n       By 1990, Bain pulled a one-year assignment in Washington, \n     D.C., at NASA headquarters, then across the street from the \n     National Air & Space Museum. ``I like airplanes, so I went \n     over there. Lo and behold, there's this 25-foot-long model of \n     the Hindenburg used in the 1975 movie with George C. Scott,'' \n     he recalls. ``I'm looking at that model and a plaque on the \n     wall. The plaque says something about how the hydrogen \n     exploded,'' As a hydrogen expert, he knew that the pure gas \n     doesn't just explode. That was enough: He made an appointment \n     with the archivists upstairs, dooned a pair of protective \n     gloves, and lost himself in decades-old original documents in \n     the museum's Hindenburg files for the rest of the day.\n       His research soon became something of a part-time \n     obsession. Over the next few years. Bain would steal away to \n     the archive and travel to others in College Park and \n     Suitland, Maryland, poring through thousands of pages and \n     copying documents in search of answers. He even traveled to \n     the Fires Sciences Lab in Missoula, Montana. He speculated \n     that, perhaps, some of the airship's materials had played a \n     role in the ignition. Maddeningly, however, he couldn't find \n     the exact formulations used. ``I had the idea of the problem, \n     but needed enough evidence to back my story up,'' he says.\n       That was as far as he got until 1994, when he ran into \n     Richard van Treuren, a space shuttle technician, at a \n     conference on hydrogen. Van Treuren, a self-avowed ``helium \n     head'' and member of the airship aficionados called the \n     Lighter-Than-Air Society in Akron, Ohio, was seeking Bain to \n     talk about hydrogen. Van Treuren had a book about airships. \n     Bain spotted the book in the crook of van Treuren's arm and \n     bought it from him on the spot.\n       ``The rain still spatters the wet ground in starts and \n     stops. The air is highly charged from the thunderstorms, \n     investigators would rule later. Six and three-quarter acres \n     of Hindenburg fabrics is kiting in the breeze. A witness \n     later would recall a bluish electrical phenomenon that dances \n     over the aft starboard side of the Hindenburg for more than a \n     minute.''\n       Through van Treuren, Bain learned that pieces of the \n     Hindenburg's skin still existed. Bain traveled around the \n     country to procure them, spending hundreds of dollars buying \n     original materials, books, and papers from collectors. ``What \n     I was trying to find out is, what did they use specifically \n     in the coating?'' he says.\n       Hepburn Walker, who had been stationed in Lakehurst in the \n     early `40s, was among those in possession of pieces of the \n     Hindenburg, Walker had found them in the soil. Another \n     sample, a part of the swastika painted on the Hindenburg's \n     side, was kept in a safe by Cheryl Gantz, head of the \n     Zeppelin Collectors Club in Chicago.\n       Bain remembers meeting Gantz. ``May I have a little \n     clipping, just anything to take to the lab?'' he begged. \n     Gantz was willing, but wanted to impress upon Bain the \n     fabric's value to her: ``How much do you value your \n     firstborn?'' she asked. Bain laughs: ``I got the message!'' \n     Bain also located fabric samples in Germany that were \n     representative of the top of the Hindenburg, where the fire \n     started.\n       Materials in hand, Bain headed to NASA's Materials Science \n     Laboratory at the nearby Kennedy Space Center. Over the next \n     14 months, he carefully laid out a systematic testing \n     protocol involving some 14 researchers who would volunteer \n     their spare time to assist in what became known as Project H.\n       ``A jagged fire licks along the aft starboard side of the \n     Hindenburg, another witness later recalls. Crewman Helmut \n     Lau, on the lower left of the craft, looks up through the \n     translucent gas cells and sees a red glow. In moments, cells \n     begin to melt before his eyes. The fire crests the top of the \n     Hindenburg and spreads outward and downward, toward lau and \n     the others. Girders start cracking and wires snap. With \n     hydrogen still in the cells, the giant airship maintains \n     level trim.''\n       What was in that fabric? Work to create a chemical and \n     physical analysis included using an infrared stectrograph and \n     a scanning electron microscope, which provided, respectively, \n     the chemical signatures of the organic compounds and elements \n     present.\n       A startling variety of highly flammable compounds proved to \n     have been added to the cotton fabric base. ``They used a \n     cellulose acetate or nitrate as a typical doping compound, \n     which is flammable to begin with--a forest fire is cellulose \n     fire,'' says Bain. ``OK, you coat that with cellulose \n     nitrate--nitrate is used to make gunpowder. And then you put \n     [on] aluminum powder. Now, aluminum powder is a fuel used on \n     the solid rocket boosters on the space shuttle.'' The wood \n     spacers and ramie cord used to bind the structure together, \n     along with the silk and other fabrics in the ship, would also \n     have added to the fuel-rich inferno. Even the duralumin \n     support framework of the Hindenburg's, rigid skeleton was \n     coated with lacquer, ostensibly to protect it from moisture.\n       In a flame test, a fabric section ignited and burned \n     readily. The arc test, in which 30,000 volts were zapped \n     across a piece of fabric several inches long, was even more \n     revealing: ``Poof, it disappeared. The whole thing happened \n     faster than I can explain it,'' Bain says. ``I guess the \n     moral of the story is, don't paint your airship with rocket \n     fuel.''\n       Bain is quick to point out, however, that it's not that the \n     Germans and other airship and aircraft makers of the era were \n     simply foolish in doping the fabric the way they did. They \n     had a number of technical problems to solve using the \n     materials of the time. Today's synthetic fabrics, with their \n     range of properties, did not yet exist. The cotton or linen \n     fabric skin was swabbed with the chemicals to make it taut \n     and reduce flutter for aerodynamics, and then painted with \n     the reflective red iron oxide and aluminum so the sun's heat \n     wouldn't expand the gas in the cells, to help prevent gas \n     from escaping. The skin had to be protected from \n     deterioration from sunlight and rot from moisture. When \n     engineers changed one part of the formulation to address \n     flammability concerns, the\n\n[[Page S11633]]\n\n     mixture might not have adhered well or other problems would \n     crop up.\n       ``And I'm not saying hydrogen didn't contribute to the \n     fire,'' adds Bain. It is after all a fuel, he notes--and one \n     he is hoping will develop into a replacement or supplement to \n     natural gas. ``But it was a fuel-rich fire already; the \n     hydrogen just added to it.'' Bain figures that maybe half of \n     the 5 million cubic feet of hydrogen remaining aboard the \n     Hindenburg after the Atlantic crossing burned in the fire. \n     ``But so what? It's academic.''\n       Also made academic, perhaps, are decades of speculation \n     over the causes behind the start of the Zeppelin fire. All \n     have blamed hydrogen, with various ideas about how the gas \n     became free and ignited. One popular theory has it that a \n     wire punctured a gas cell. Bain, obviously, finds this \n     doubtful. ``If that happened, it should have occurred \n     during one of the final maneuvers.'' But, ``The ship was \n     stationary for 4 minutes before the first fire was \n     indicated.'' If cells were leaking gas that long, ``The \n     ship should really start going like this,'' Bain says as \n     he tilts a handheld Hindenburg model nose upward. ``And \n     it's not. [At the start of the fire,] it's still in \n     trim.''\n       What about the possibility of loose hydrogen from the \n     vents? Hydrogen was released to help maintain level flight, \n     and others have theorized that a valve may have stuck open. \n     ``The Hindenberg had an excellent venting system'' says Bain, \n     with vents between cells that measured some 2 feet high and 7 \n     feet across. If hydrogen accumulated--difficult to imagine \n     for the lightest element, which has the greatest dispersal \n     rate in the universe--how come, he asks, none of the fires \n     were observed at the vent sites atop the ship?\n       ``In seconds, the rear half of the Hindenburg is engulfed \n     in bright, writhing flames. Gas cells one and two expand and \n     burst with explosive force; the released hydrogen adds fuel \n     to the conflagration. The ship lurches forward, breaking off \n     water tanks attached by light-release connectors near the bow \n     of the craft. Having lost ballast, the airship's nose heads \n     upward and people start jumping to escape the flames, some \n     too far from the ground to survive the fall.''\n       What is perhaps most stunning about Bain's research is that \n     what he has discovered comes 60 years after some German \n     airship experts already knew it. While visiting an archive in \n     Germany, he copied two 1937 letters handwritten in German \n     that had not been seen by earlier investigators. Their \n     shocking contents were revealed to Bain only after he \n     returned to Florida and had them translated. They were \n     written by an electrical engineer named Otto Beyerstock, who \n     had incinerated pieces of Hindenburg fabric during electrical \n     tests conducted at the behest of the Zeppelin Co. In the \n     notes, Beyerstock testily dismissed the idea that hydrogen \n     could have started the fire, stating with certitude that it \n     could only have been caused by the fabric's flammability in a \n     charged atmosphere. In a similar craft flying under the same \n     atmospheric conditions that the Hindenburg faced in \n     Lakehurst, the same sort of conflagration would occur, even \n     if noncombustible helium were used as the lifting gas. (In \n     fact, notes Bain, such a fire did take place in 1935, when a \n     helium-filled airship with an acetate-aluminum skin burned \n     near Point Sur, California.)\n       ``I beg you to kindly inform me about the corrective \n     measures to be taken or that have already been taken,'' \n     Beyerstock wrote to Zeppelin. Some modifications were made in \n     a subsequent airship plan, such as the addition of a fire \n     retardant. ``They knew,'' Bain says simply. But shortly after \n     the Hindenburg disaster, and probably because of it, the \n     great Zeppelins were removed from service.\n       Some detractors are still not ready to put aside the idea \n     of hydrogen as fire-starter. ``Addison Bain's hydrogen \n     background carries some weight,'' says Eric Brothers, the \n     editor of Buoyant Flight, the Lighter-Than-Air Society's \n     bulletin, but not everyone at the society is convinced. The \n     bulletin this year ran three articles detailing the skin-\n     ignition research, coauthored by van Treuren and Bain. As for \n     Brothers: ``I would like to see more independent verification \n     of the tests, though I recognize that that's difficult to \n     do,'' he says. Still, ``I'm 90 percent convinced that the \n     fabric had some role.''\n       One of the Buoyant Flight articles' most stringent critics \n     is Donald E. Overs, a retired engineer and pilot who worked \n     on Goodyear blimp construction and engineering for more than \n     20 years. ``Based on the authors' cover burn rate tests, it \n     would have taken anywhere from 15 minutes to probably an hour \n     or more for the cover alone to burn off. The entire ship, on \n     the other hand, was consumed in less than 60 seconds,'' he \n     says. Overs' detailed e-mail challenges to Bain's theory--and \n     the various defenses supporters--would occupy some 50 printed \n     pages. ``Bain can at most demonstrate or argue that the cover \n     was a brief link in the early ignition of the hydrogen, but \n     he cannot prove even that,'' concludes Overs.\n       ``Like the mythical Icarus who ventured too close to the \n     sun, the Hindenburg goes down in flames. As it touches the \n     ground, the ship bounces lightly, perhaps still buoyant with \n     remaining hydrogen.''\n       None of what Bain has learned has diminished his admiration \n     for the engineering achievement in creating the great \n     airships. ``With all due respect,'' he says, ``the Germans \n     did a fantastic job. I admire their technology.\n       ``It was just an unfortunate little flaw, just like the \n     flaw on the Titanic and the flaw in the Challenger,'' he \n     says, referring to the ``unsinkable'' ship's sulfurous, \n     brittle steel and the space shuttle's O-ring--both of which \n     failed under the prevailing weather conditions. ``You never \n     know what Mother Nature is going to do to you.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/06/senate-section/article/S11631-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11633-S11634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HIGH-INTENSITY DRUG TRAFFICKING AREA\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak for \na High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) designation for the \nState of Oregon. On October 1, 1998 Senator Wyden and I sent letters to \nthe Director of the Office of the National Drug Control Policy, General \nBarry McCaffrey and Attorney General Janet Reno requesting the \ndesignation.\n  High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (also known as HIDTAs) were \nauthorized in 1988 by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 and are \nadministered by the Office of National Drug Control Policy. HIDTA \ndesignations are granted to regions that are centers of illegal drug \nproduction, manufacturing, importation or distribution and have harmful \nimpacts on the entire country. Once a HIDTA has been designated, \nincreased funding is granted to the State, design strategies to combat \ndrug threats are adopted and these designs are then strategically \nimplemented. The Office of National Drug Control Policy's HIDTA Program \nhas been profoundly successful in those regions where it has been \nimplemented.\n  Mr. President, the State of Oregon is in desperate need of this \ndesignation. Western States--California, Washington, Arizona, New \nMexico, and regions in the Rocky Mountains--have received designations \nto help them combat tremendous drug trafficking challenges. Oregon has \nbeen too long without assistance, fighting national and international \ntraffickers.\n  This request is not idly made. It comes following more than a year of \nwork with local and federal law enforcement agencies, and the U.S. \nAttorney's Office. There experience, dedication and tireless commitment \nto eliminating drug production, trafficking, and use is to be \ncommended. Unfortunately, they have insufficient resources to combat \nthis scourge in Oregon or the country. I appreciate their coordinated \nefforts and have learned through meetings with them and extensive work \nin my State that we must act--and act now.\n  I am proud to report that in our first meeting of the HIDTA steering \ncommittee, of which I am a member, the Department of Defense announced \nit was sending Joint Task Force Six to Oregon to engage in a drug \nthreat assessment. As we speak, Task Force Six is conducting its study \nin our state and will present its report to us at our next steering \ncommittee meeting on October 29, 1998. Having requested a copy of the \nthreat assessment for Washington State's HIDTA Program in the Seattle-\nTacoma areas and met with Washington State Drug Enforcement \nAdministration (DEA) specialists, I am confident our request will be \naccepted. The obstacles we face in fighting drug production and \ntrafficking are similar.\n  Oregon's central location along the Interstate 5, and its proximity \nto the coast, render it particularly vulnerable to those who move \nheroine, cocaine and marijuana. For many years traffickers have moved \nlarge quantities of illegal drugs along interstate 5, highway 101, \nhighway 97 and interstate 84. Crackdowns along interstate 5 have been \nsuccessful, but the insufficiency of resources has produced an \nunbalanced, under-powered drug defense. Drug shipments from Central \nAmerica moving along these routes continue to increase, while Pacific \nRim countries feed the problem through Oregon ports. These drug \nshipments are then trafficked throughout the continental United States.\n  This flow, from sources outside Oregon, has introduced a criminal \nelement into the fabric of Oregon society. They came to produce and \nsell drugs, and stayed to enjoy the climate, the abundance of space and \nbreathtaking beauty, as well as the serenity and tranquility of our \nfields and forests. These very qualities that make Oregon unique are \nalso the qualities that drug traffickers found beneficial to their \ntrade.\n  The facts are indisputable. In 1991, only 7 years ago, there were 39 \ndrug-related deaths in Oregon. There were 221\n\n[[Page S11634]]\n\nsuch deaths in 1997. Methamphetamine use among incarcerated adults \nincreased from 30 percent in 1991-1992 to 49 percent in 1996-1997.\n  Children are the most victimized. There were 629 juvenile arrests for \ndrug offenses in 1991, and 2,392 in 1997. The number of juveniles \ntreated in drug treatment centers increased from 1,742 in 1991 to 4,028 \nin 1996. The Oregon Public School Drug Use Survey Key Findings Report \nstates that since 1990, marijuana use by eighth graders--eighth \ngraders--mind you!, has tripled, while marijuana use by eleventh \ngraders has increased 68 percent. General illicit drug use by eighth \ngraders has doubled since 1992, and over the same time period increased \nin eleventh graders by 21 percent.\n  I have given this problem much thought in the past few months. While \nI am confident that a HIDTA designation is vital to our ability to \ndeter drug trafficking and production, this problem has been further \nexacerbated by the current Administration's failure to focus and its \ndiminished emphasis on the international component to the war on drugs. \nThat is why I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Western \nHemisphere Drug Elimination Act of 1998 (S. 2522) which calls for an \nadditional $2.6 billion investment in international counter narcotics \nefforts over the next three years. This bi-partisan legislation \nrestores funding to international interdiction and eradication efforts \nthat were all but abandoned in 1993. Without decreasing domestic \nfunding or effort, this legislation recommits the nation to fighting \ndrugs with a comprehensive international approach.\n  We, Oregonians, are committed to the welfare of our State. We will \ndrive the criminal elements from our borders. Finally, Mr. President, \nwe have no choice but to fight. We have no alternative but to win. I \nthank the chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/06/senate-section/article/S11633-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JOSEPH MORGART\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \na very special young man, one who is close to my heart and certainly \nclose to my daughter's. He is my son-in-law Joe Morgart.\n  I rise to congratulate him not simply for being a terrific husband to \nmy daughter Nan and a loving father to my grandsons, Alexander and \nJonathan, but also to recognize some of his personal achievements. \nToday, I commend him for becoming a leader in the Jewish community in \nBoston. He was honored there recently with the 1998 Young Leadership \nAward given by the Combined Jewish Philanthropies (CJP) of Greater \nBoston.\n  CJP now raises nearly $25 million annually to support educational, \nhumanitarian and cultural causes, as well as providing funding for \nhealth care and social service programs in Israel and other Jewish \ncommunities around the world. The Young Leadership Division of CJP \ngives young Jewish people in the Boston area the opportunity to get \ninvolved in community service, as well as to participate in discussions \nabout Jewish issues from religious, ethical, social, political and \neconomic perspectives.\n  For Joe to receive this award is especially noteworthy, coming from \none of the oldest philanthropies in the country and one so dedicated to \neducating others about Jewish issues. That is so, Mr. President, \nbecause Joe has not always been a member of the Jewish faith.\n  Maybe Joe was attracted to Judaism to impress Nan when they were \ndating. Maybe he was attracted to Judaism to impress me! Or, knowing \nJoe and his thirst for knowledge when learning about Judaism, he found \nthat the Jewish religion fulfilled him spiritually and invited him into \nthe community. Joe then decided to convert, and he has become a most \nvaluable participant in the community.\n  Joe Morgart has served on CJP's Board of Directors, has been an \nactive fundraising campaigner and started a successful outreach and \neducational services program that drew in many new members for CJP. He \nhas participated in CJP's leadership development program, and has been \ndeeply involved in community service programs for the organization. \nBeyond his involvement in CJP, Joe is a leader of the Jewish Big \nBrother & Big Sister Association, part of the American Israel Public \nAffairs Committee, and is a member of the United Jewish Appeal's Young \nLeadership Cabinet.\n  Mr. President, I am proud that a well-regarded organization like CJP \nrecognized Joe Morgart's ability and contributions by honoring him with \nthis award. I know that his entire family is proud as well of his \naccomplishments and the love and respect that he has earned from all of \nthose who know him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/06/senate-section/article/S11634-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11634-S11635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY ACT OF 1998\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am very pleased that last night \nwe passed S. 2432, the Assistive Technology Act of 1998, the ATA. In \nthe spring of 1988, I made a commitment to individuals with \ndisabilities. I said that I would, with their help, and that of my \ncolleagues, develop and pass legislation that would provide greater \naccess to assistive technology for people with disabilities. Between \nApril and August of that year, we did just that. The Technology-Related \nAssistance for Individuals with Disabilities, commonly referred to as \nthe Tech Act, became P. L. 100-407 and received its first \nappropriation. That legislation has had a successful 10 year run. It \nsunsets on September 30, 1998.\n  This spring I made another commitment. I said I would, with the help \nof my friends in the disability community, my partners Senators Harkin \nand Bond, develop new technology legislation that would promote greater \naccess to technology for people with disabilities, promote greater \ninterest in and investment by the Federal Government and public and \nprivate entities in addressing the unmet technology needs of \nindividuals with disabilities, and create expanded means by which \nindividuals with disabilities could purchase assistive technology. We \nwere joined in our efforts by Senators Kerry, McConnell, Collins, \nKennedy, Reed, Frist, DeWine, Bingaman, Wellstone, Warner, Dodd, \nFaircloth, Ford, Mikulski, Sarbanes, D'Amato, Reid, Cochran, and \nJohnson. This legislation will equip individuals with disabilities \nthrough technology, to sustain their functioning, to expand their range \nof abilities, to be more independent, and to contribute at home, in \nschool, at work, and in the community.\n  S. 2432 builds on the success of the Tech Act. In recognition of the \naccomplishments of State Tech Projects, State protection and advocacy \nsystems, and technical assistance provided by the Rehabilitation \nEngineering and Assistive Technology Society of North America (RESNA) \nand United Cerebral Palsy Associations, Inc., the bill continues \nfederal support for activities proven to be effective in promoting \naccess to assistive technology. It also sets policies and authorizes \nfederal support for new challenges related to technology and its impact \non individuals with disabilities. It encourages states, the Federal \nGovernment, public and private entities, individuals with disabilities \nand their families and advocates, to form new partnerships, to stretch \nexpectations and to build consensus through common goals, to promote \nand to endorse meaningful accountability by measuring progress on \ncommon goals, and generally work together to make the environments and \nthe technology of tomorrow accessible to and usable by individuals with \ndisabilities.\n  The specific purposes of the bill are to: support states in \nsustaining and strengthening their capacity to address the assistive \ntechnology needs of individuals with disabilities; focus the federal \ninvestment in technology that could benefit individuals with \ndisabilities; and support micro-loan programs to provide assistance to \nindividuals who desire to purchase assistive technology devices or \nservices.\n  S. 2432 reaffirms the federal role of promoting access to assistive \ntechnology devices and services for individuals with disabilities. The \nbill allows states flexibility in responding to the assistive \ntechnology needs of their citizens with disabilities, and does not \ndisrupt the accomplishments of states over the last decade through the \nstate assistive technology programs funded under the Tech Act.\n  Title I of the ATA authorizes funding for multiple grant programs \nfrom fiscal years 1999 through 2004: continuity grants, challenge \ngrants, millennium\n\n[[Page S11635]]\n\ngrants, and grants to protection and advocacy systems, as well as \nfunding for a technical assistance program. The bill streamlines and \nclarifies expectations, including expectations related to \naccountability, associated with continuing federal support for state \nassistive technology programs. The bill targets specific, proven \nactivities, as priorities, referred to as ``mandatory activities''. All \nState grantees must set measurable goals in connection to their use of \nATA funds, and both the goals and the approach to measuring the goals \nmust be based on input from individuals with disabilities in the State.\n  If a State has received less than 10 years of Federal funding under \nthe Tech Act for its assistive technology program, title I of S. 2432 \nallows a State, which submits a supplement (a continuity grant) to its \ncurrent grant for Federal funds, to use ATA funds for mandatory \nactivities related to a public awareness program, policy development \nand interagency coordination, technical assistance and training, and \noutreach, especially to elderly and rural populations with \ndisabilities. Such a State also may use ATA funds for optional grant \nactivities: alternative State-financed systems for assistance \ntechnology devices and services, technology demonstrations, \ndistribution of information about how to finance assistive technology \ndevices and services, and operation of a technology-related information \nsystem, or participation in interstate activities or public-private \npartnerships pertaining to assistive technology.\n  If a state has had 10 years of funding for its assistive technology \nprogram, the State may submit an application for a noncompetitive \nchallenge grant. Grant funds must be spent on specific activities--\ninteragency coordination, an assistive technology information system, a \npublic awareness program, technical assistance and training, and \noutreach activities.\n  In fiscal year 2000 through 2004, if funding for title I exceeds $40 \nmillion, States operating under challenge grants may apply for \nadditional ATA funding, provided through competitive millennium grants. \nThese grants are to focus on specific statewide or local level capacity \nbuilding activities in an area or areas related to access to technology \nfor individuals with disabilities.\n  Title I of the bill also authorizes funding for protection and \nadvocacy systems in each State to assist individuals with disabilities \nto access assistive technology devices and services, and funding for a \ntechnical assistance program, and specifies administrative procedures \nwith regard to monitoring of entities funded under title I of the bill. \nThe bill contains an authorization for a National Public Internet Site \non assistive technology as part of the technical assistance program. \nThis site will have two distinct functions. First, once developed and \noperating, the site will have the capacity, through interaction with an \nindividual, both to identify a profile of the individual's specific \nassistive technology needs and to recommend alternatives for addressing \nthose needs. Second, once information is identified and links \nestablished, the site will be a location on the Internet through which \nindividuals may access information about assistive technology devices \nand services and be linked to state Tech Projects and other sites to \naccess additional information.\n\n  S. 2432 treats year 1999 as a transition year for current grantees of \nfederal funds for assistive technology. The bill provides the Secretary \nof Education with discretion to treat grantees who have completed 10 \nyears of Federal funding in that year as if those states were in their \ntenth year of federal funding. In addition, grantees who have received \nless than 10 years of funding for assistive technology programs may \nelect in fiscal year 2000 only to transition from continuity grant \nstatus to challenge grant status by submitting a grant application for \na challenge grant.\n  The authorization level for title I of the bill is $36 million for \nfiscal year 1999, and such sums for fiscal years 2000 through 2004.\n  Title II of S. 2432 provides for increased coordination of Federal \nefforts related to assistive technology and universal design, and \nauthorizes funding for multiple grant programs from fiscal years 1999 \nthrough 2004. Title II strengthens the mandate of the Interagency \nCommittee on Disability Research (ICDR) to include assistive technology \nand universal design research, and authorizes funding the joint \nresearch projects by ICDR members. Title II also provides for increased \ncooperation between the National Institute on Disability and \nRehabilitation Research (NIDRR), which oversees the State Tech \nProjects, and the Federal Laboratories Consortium.\n  Title II of the bill also authorizes increased funding for Small \nBusiness Innovative Research grants (an existing program under the \nSmall Business Act) related to assistive technology and funding to \ncommercial or other organizations for research and development related \nto how to incorporate the principles of universal design into the \ndesign of products and buildings so they can be used without alteration \nby all people. This title also authorizes funding for grants or other \nmechanisms to address the unique assistive technology needs of urban \nand rural areas, of children and the elderly, and to improve training \nof rehabilitation engineers and technicians.\n  Finally, title II of S. 2432 authorizes funding for the President's \nCommission on the Employment of People with Disabilities to work with \nthe private sector to promote the development of accessible information \ntechnologies.\n  The authorization of appropriations for title II is $15 million for \nfiscal year 1999, and such sums for fiscal years 2000 through 2004.\n  Title II of the bill provides for alternative financing mechanisms \nfor people with disabilities to purchase assistive technology devices \nand services from fiscal years 1999 through 2004. These funds are to be \nused to establish specified types of loan programs for individuals with \ndisabilities, and not to be used simply to purchase assistive \ntechnology for individuals with disabilities. The authorization of \nappropriations for title III of S. 2432 is $25 million for fiscal year \n1999, and such sums for fiscal years 2000 through 2004.\n  We would not have been successful in passing S. 2432 without the \ntechnical assistance and cooperation from the U.S. Department of \nEducation, the state Tech Projects, particularly, Lynne Cleveland, \nDirector of the Vermont state Tech Project, the National Association of \nProtection and Advocacy Systems, and the Technology Task Force of the \nConsortium for Individuals with Disabilities, especially Jennifer \nDexter, Jim Gelecka, Glen Sutcliffe, Sally Rhodes, and Ellin Nolan. I \nwould also like to recognize the efforts of Senate staff, Lloyd Horwich \nwith Senator Harkin, Dreama Towe with Senator Bond, and Pat Morrissey, \nHeidi Mohlman, and Carolyn Dupree of my staff.\n  In addition to being supported by the disability community, S. 2432 \nhas been endorsed by the Administration and the Chamber of Commerce and \nsupported by the Administration. Moreover, the National Governors \nAssociation, and individual governors have urged the passage of \nassistive technology legislation this year.\n  Everyone has worked especially hard to help us meet our ambitious, \ncompressed time table. Along the way, every Senate office now has a \nbetter understanding and appreciation of assistive technology--what it \nmeans to an individual with a disability who has it and what it means \nto an individual with a disability who needs it, but can't get it.\n  Technology has become commonplace and thus, is often taken for \ngranted. Yet, the power of technology is, in many ways, our last \nfrontier. As we push technology to do more for us, S. 2432 offers us \nthe tools to ensure that individuals with disabilities also benefit.\n  I appreciate the support of my colleagues in passing S. 2432.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/06/senate-section/article/S11634-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11635-S11636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EUGENE L. MC CABE\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, many years ago Eugene L. McCabe \ncame to Washington seeking financial support for his new North General \nHospital in Harlem. By then people living in Harlem, like many in our \ncities, suffered from hospital cutbacks and closings. They were in \ndesperate need of affordable and reliable medical care. The AIDS and \ncrack epidemics overburdened what few local facilities there were. But \nwhere others saw despair, Eugene saw hope and opportunity. He founded \nNorth General as a community hospital specializing in the treatment\n\n[[Page S11636]]\n\nof diabetes, cancer, and hypertension--common afflictions in urban \nareas. Still, North General did not become overnight what Kenneth \nRaske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, called a \nwonderful hospital. It took Eugene's dedication, vision, and compassion \nto see it through. When told his hospital would fail because there was \nno money to be made, he worked harder. The hospital became his life's \npassion. He appealed to banks, businesses, and political leaders for \nsupport. And he made good on his promise. North General became a \nthriving hospital that has never lost touch with its community. It \nremains the only minority-run hospital in New York State. Located at \n121st Street and Madison Avenue, North General Hospital stands as a \nmemorial to Eugene McCabe and his dedication to improving the lives of \nothers.\n  With his passing much will be said of him. Those who worked with him \nremember a leader--self-assured and inspiring--who, despite popular \nmotivations and trends, compelled himself and others to make affordable \nand quality health care a reality for many who might otherwise have \ngone without it. Those who loved him remember his smile, his \nhelpfulness, and his gracious presence. Eugene McCabe's life was a \nblessing and we are grateful to have been touched by it.\n  I ask that the obituary from The New York Times be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The obituary follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 1, 1998]\n\n       Eugene L. McCabe, 61, Founder of Harlem Community Hospital\n\n                          (By Barbara Stewart)\n\n       Eugene L. McCabe, a management consultant who founded and \n     was president of North General Hospital, a thriving, \n     minority-operated community hospital in Harlem, died there \n     yesterday. He was 61.\n       The cause was breast cancer, his family said.\n       ``He was indefatigable in putting it together,'' said Mario \n     M. Cuomo, who, as Governor, approved many of the grants and \n     loans to build North General. ``His strength was his will and \n     his total commitment.''\n       North General, a 200-bed hospital on 121st Street and \n     Madison Avenue, is the only minority-operated hospital in the \n     state. Most of its trustees are black. The hospital \n     specializes in treatment for diabetes, cancer and \n     hypertension, which occur widely among low-income blacks. It \n     recently built 300 units of condominium housing for low- and \n     middle-income residents of Harlem.\n       ``It is a wonderful hospital,'' said Kenneth Raske, \n     president of the Greater New York Hospital Association. ``And \n     Gene did it through sheer dogged persistence and sharp \n     business acumen.''\n       When another specialized hospital moved out of Harlem in \n     the late 1970's, Mr. McCabe, along with Randolph \n     Guggenheimer, a lawyer, developed the idea for North General: \n     a community hospital to serve the impoverished, medically \n     deprived area.\n       ``It became his passion, his life work,'' said Livingston \n     S. Francis, chairman of the board of North General.\n       Mr. Cuomo, who described the hospital's creation as ``a \n     miracle,'' said it took all of Mr. McCabe's persuasive powers \n     to talk him and others into approving the necessary loans. At \n     the time, many small community hospitals, overwhelmed with \n     the unexpected demands of AIDS patients and crack addicts, \n     were being closed. ``It didn't make financial sense,'' Mr. \n     Cuomo said. ``But he made a case for that hospital. He was \n     always entreating. He was never offensively pushy, but he was \n     insistent.''\n       As a result of Mr. McCabe's entreaties in Albany, \n     Washington and New York City, the state appropriated $150 \n     million to build the hospital. From the start, it was rooted \n     in the community. At one early point, the union asked the \n     hospital workers to continue working despite a missed pay \n     period, Mrs. Guggenheimer said. With the help of banks, local \n     businesses and politicians, it pulled through several \n     financial crises.\n       As president of the new hospital, Mr. McCabe drew on the \n     resources of the staff in unexpected ways, Mr. Francis said. \n     Nurses helped choose color schemes, and engineers installed \n     lighting and laid floors--tasks that would ordinarily be done \n     by outside workers. The process was repeated seven years ago, \n     when North General moved into its current facility, a modern \n     brick building on 121st Street and Madison Avenue, with a \n     bright interior decorated with art selected by staff members.\n       ``The hospital,'' Mr. Cuomo said, ``was his.''\n       Mr. McCabe, who grew up in New Haven, graduated from \n     Southern Connecticut State University.\n       He is survived by this wife, the former Elsie Crum, who is \n     the president of the Museum for African Art in SoHo; their 1-\n     year-old twins, Eugene and Erin, and a son, Kevin, from a \n     previous marriage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/06/senate-section/article/S11635-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11636-S11637]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 GOVERNOR RACICOT ON COMMUNITY SERVICE\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, Governor Marc Racicot of my home \nState of Montana recently wrote an op-ed on community service which \nappeared in the Washington Times and The Hill newspapers. For the \nbenefit of those who haven't seen it, I ask to have the op-ed inserted \ninto the Congressional Record.\n\n              [From The Washington, Times, Aug. 31, 1998]\n\n                      Community Service That Works\n\n                           (By Marc Racicot)\n\n       Governors meet together and routinely stake out areas of \n     broad bipartisan agreement that transcend the partisan \n     struggles that have become synonymous with election-year \n     politics. One issue that enjoys strong support from governors \n     of both parties is national and community service. The \n     support for service is based on a simple conviction that I \n     share with many other governors: that every generation of \n     young people needs to accept responsibility for its country \n     and its community.\n       As a first-term Republican governor in January, 1993, I \n     asked, and our legislature approved, a proposal to create a \n     Governor's Office of Community Service intended to enhance \n     the ethic of service and elevate the importance of \n     ``community,'' particularly among our young people. \n     Meaningful service, we believed, would nurture productive \n     young citizens committed to the future of our state because \n     they had invested their sweat and labor in that future. Here \n     in Montana, we sought to encourage service as a life-long \n     ``habit of the heart.''\n       When the National Community Service Act of 1993 was passed, \n     Montana was in an ideal position to move forward with the \n     opportunity offered through AmeriCorps. The Office of \n     Community Service's mission and the mission of AmeriCorps was \n     one and the same: to develop opportunities for young people \n     to provide meaningful, direct and demonstrable service to \n     their communities. It was our hope that AmeriCorps would help \n     us to build unique partnerships with public and private \n     agencies by engaging young people in productive and \n     meaningful service to their communities. These partnerships \n     would serve as clear examples of how we could work together \n     in Montana to improve how we, as fellow citizens, respond to \n     pressing needs.\n       Now in its fourth year, AmeriCorps offers a creative, \n     effective, and non-bureaucratic means of addressing the unmet \n     education, human, public safety and environmental needs of \n     our state-- and our country. Indeed, AmeriCorps has become a \n     model of devolution, where real authority and ownership for a \n     federal initiative is delegated to the states. Through \n     governor-appointed bipartisan state commissions, priorities \n     are established and projects are selected to receive \n     AmeriCorps funding.\n       The results are impressive. Last year alone, our locally-\n     run AmeriCorps programs generated nearly $1,000 hours of \n     service to Montana communities. Their service directly \n     benefits 50,000 children and families in Montana, and \n     indirectly almost one-third of our state population. \n     Nationally, similar results abound. This year, some 40,000 \n     AmeriCorps members will get things done for more than 1,200 \n     communities across the country.\n       When AmeriCorps was created, some feared it might replay \n     the worst of the welfare state--an entrenched, expensive, \n     Washington run program. Many feared, even more, that it would \n     undermine traditional volunteers with yet another federal \n     program. I can say from experience that the fears were \n     misplaced. As a governor who tries very hard to be careful \n     with tax dollars, I have witnessed time and again the fruits \n     of this prudent investment in Montana.\n       Now, after more than five years, we have seen a tremendous \n     rekindling of a sense of public service and civic duty, in \n     many ways, through the programs and opportunities generated \n     through the National Community Service Act. I am convinced \n     national and community service promotes core values--hard \n     work, self-discipline, civic duty, personal responsibility, \n     the cherishing of human life--that we too often sadly find \n     lacking. If the era of big government is finally over, \n     certainly the era of big citizenship must begin.\n       I have joined twelve of my fellow governors in urging not \n     only continued federal funding of AmeriCorps, but also \n     reauthorization of the Act, increasing the partnership with \n     states and the authority of directing these programs at the \n     state level. We join with our peers from the New England \n     Governors' Conference in urging Congress to support \n     reauthorizing the National Community Service Amendments Act, \n     in order to improve the laws's current language. As their \n     resolution notes, we support the bill's ``devolution \n     provisions that add authority and flexibility to states . . . \n     [to] provide Governor-appointed state commissions more \n     control over program selection.''\n       Community service is a vital element in the chemistry of \n     our existence as a society, renewing our sense of community \n     and civic initiative. It is the glue that bonds free peoples \n     together. We in Montana have seen how vitally important this \n     is, recently having completed our state Governors' Summit on \n     Youth, and witnessing the real necessity of promoting \n     opportunities for young people to give back to others. \n     Through community service they learn what it's like to belong \n     to\n\n[[Page S11637]]\n\n     something good and solid and decent. AmeriCorps helps provide \n     that opportunity and truly puts the states in the driver's \n     seat, which translates into meaningful ownership, and impact, \n     at the state and local level.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/06/senate-section/article/S11636-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11637]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ONE GUN A MONTH FORUM\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, on September 2, I convened a \nforum on gun trafficking. Across America, it is simply too easy for \ncriminals, particularly gangs, to purchase and distribute large numbers \nof guns. And more guns in the wrong hands means more murder and mayhem \non our streets.\n  Because we must move more aggressively to stop this deadly crime, I \nintroduced S. 466, the Anti-Gun Trafficking Act. The testimony I heard \nat the forum has made me even more determined to pass this sensible \nlegislation and help stop gun traffickers.\n  In order to share the insights of the witnesses at the forum with my \ncolleagues and the public, I am submitting the testimony presented for \ninclusion in the Congressional Record. Previously, I submitted the \ntestimony of Mayor Edward Rendell, James and Sarah Brady from the \nCenter to Prevent Handgun Violence and Handgun Control, and John \nSchuler, Kenisha Green and Quanita Favorite, three young people from \nthe D.C. area.\n  Today, I would like to submit a statement from Captain R. Lewis Vass, \nCommander of the Criminal Justice Information Services Division of the \nVirginia Department of State Police. His testimony bears witness to the \nsuccess of Virginia's one-gun-in-thirty-day law which was enacted in \n1993. Since 1993, the number of crime guns traced back to Virginia from \nthe Northeast dropped by nearly 40 percent. Prior to one-gun-a-month, \nVirginia had been among the leading suppliers of weapons to the so-\ncalled ``Iron Pipeline'' that fed the arms race on the streets of \nNortheastern cities.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the testimony of Captain R. Lewis Vass be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The testimony follows:\n\n         Testimony of Captain R. Lewis Vass, September 2, 1998\n\n       Senator Lautenberg, I am Captain Lewis Vass, Commander of \n     the Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division of \n     the Virginia Department of State Police. I have been a sworn \n     police officer with the Virginia State Police for the past 32 \n     years. Since the enactment and implementation of Virginia's \n     instant check firearms purchase approval program in 1989, I \n     have been responsible for the administration and operation of \n     the Firearms Transaction Center. One of the functions of the \n     center is the tracking of multiple handgun sales and issuance \n     of multiple handgun purchase certificates approving or \n     denying the application to purchase more than one handgun \n     within a thirty-day period.\n       I appear here today to speak with regard to Virginia's one-\n     gun-in thirty-day law and the impact the law has had on gun \n     trafficking in Virginia.\n       Prior to the enactment of Virginia's one handgun in thirty \n     day law, Virginia was described as one of the major source \n     states for illegal handguns being seized on the east coast. \n     Information provided by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and \n     Firearms regarding firearms seized from March to August of \n     1991 ranked Virginia as follows: New York Project Lead--(108 \n     Firearms), Ranked Number One; District of Columbia Project \n     Lead)--(244 Firearms), Ranked Number One; Boston Project \n     Lead)--(14 Firearms) Ranked Number Three; Total Firearms--366 \n     Firearms.\n       In 1989, the Virginia General Assembly enacted legislation \n     which created Virginia's instant background system to address \n     the flow of firearms going to prohibited persons. This \n     system, even though it prevents prohibited persons from \n     purchasing firearms from federally licensed firearms dealers, \n     does not eliminate the flow of Virginia handguns being seized \n     in other states. The Virginia General Assembly studied this \n     issue and amended the law to reduce the flow of Virginia \n     handguns to other states. The law was revised in 1993, to \n     limit the number of handguns to one that a person could \n     purchased during any thirty day period. The law went into \n     effect on July 1, 1993, to address the growing problem of \n     handguns being purchased from Virginia's firearms dealers and \n     being seized by law enforcement authorities in other states \n     namely New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts and the District \n     of Columbia. Another issue that was addressed by enactment of \n     this legislation was the influx of narcotics into Virginia as \n     payment for the firearms being sold in other states. Even \n     when cash was used to purchase the firearms from the \n     trafficker, the trafficker in turn purchased narcotics for \n     sale on Virginia's streets.\n       An example of illegal gun trafficking from Virginia to \n     states in the north eastern corridor involved a gun shop \n     located directly across the street from the Virginia State \n     Police headquarters. This was a mom-and-pop gun shop favored \n     by gun runners because of the ease in which firearms could be \n     obtained. During an investigation into illegal gun \n     trafficking, it was found that gun purchasers from New York \n     would come to Virginia and solicit the help of either street \n     people or college students possessing a valid Virginia \n     drivers license to purchase firearms for them for a small \n     fee. These ``straw purchasers'' would go into the gun shop \n     and purchase a box of guns, a box contains ten handguns. \n     The firearms would be turned over to the gun trafficker in \n     the parking lot of the store. Videos captured by ATF \n     agents during the investigation revealed that these types \n     of illegal transactions were conducted numerous times a \n     day almost every day of the week that the store was open.\n       During February 1992, the owner of the gunshop cut to five \n     the maximum number of firearms transferred per purchase to \n     five at the conclusion of a case in which a trafficking group \n     moved 240 firearms from Virginia to New York, 85 percent or \n     approximately 204 of them from this gun shop.\n       The investigation concluded with the arrest of the store \n     owners and closing of the firearms outlet.\n       A Project Lead report released by ATF in 1992 reporting the \n     results of firearms traced to New York from January 1, 1992 \n     through June 16, 1992 revealed that for 501 of 805 firearms \n     traces received the leading source states were as follows: 1. \n     Virginia--108 firearms, 20%; 2. Florida--92 firearms, 18%; 3. \n     Texas--39 firearms, 8%; 4. Connecticut--37 firearms, 7%; 5. \n     Ohio--34 firearms, 7%.\n       A 1997 trace report released by ATF shows that the \n     percentage of firearms from Virginia seized in New York has \n     dropped to 12.5 percent as compared to 20 percent in 1992. \n     While Virginia remains the leading source state for firearms \n     seized in Washington, D.C., the percentage of firearms \n     recovered in D.C. has dropped from 35.1 percent in 1991 to \n     26.8 percent in 1997. Additionally, Virginia has dropped from \n     the number two source state in 1990 to number eight in 1997 \n     for guns seized in Boston.\n       The law was designed to stop the flow of handguns being \n     purchased for illegal purposes and transported out of state, \n     but not to impede the law-abiding citizens from purchasing \n     more than one handgun in thirty days. The statute was \n     designed with provisions for the purchase of multiple \n     handguns for collections by collectors, business use, \n     personal use and estate sales. An individual desiring to \n     purchase more than one handgun in thirty days is required to \n     complete a multiple handgun purchase application. The \n     application is submitted to the State Police and processed by \n     the Firearms Transaction Center (FTC). The FTC conducts an \n     enhanced background check on the applicant. If the applicant \n     is approved, he/she is issued a multiple handgun purchase \n     certificate which permits him to purchase the number and type \n     of handguns requested in the application. The FTC has issued \n     2,245 multiple handgun purchase certificates from July 1, \n     1993 to July 30, 1998 while denying 164 applications because \n     the applicant did not meet the multiple purchase requirements \n     or had already exceeded the limit for the thirty-day period.\n       The one handgun in thirty days was studied by the Virginia \n     Crime Commission in 1995; copy attached. The results of that \n     study concluded that most gun control policies currently \n     being advocated in the United States (e.g., licensing, \n     registration, and one-gun-a-month) could, most fairly, be \n     described as efforts to limit the supply of guns available in \n     the illegal market. In other words, these are policies \n     crafted to keep guns from prescribed individuals. Once \n     enacted; however, it is important to demonstrate that they \n     are effective. This study, which is attached, looks at the \n     impact of Virginia's one-gun-a-month law, provides persuasive \n     evidence that a prohibition on the acquisition of more than \n     one handgun per month by an individual is an effective means \n     of disrupting the illegal interstate transfer of firearms.\n       As a follow-up to this previous study, the Bureau of \n     Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms provided this Department with \n     information on firearms seized on the east coast regarding \n     Virginia firearms. The information revealed that of the \n     firearms seized in 1997, 184 originated from Virginia. Of \n     that number, 87 of these firearms were obtained after the law \n     was enacted in July 1993. This demonstrates a significant \n     reduction from 366 firearms for six months in 1991 to 87 \n     firearms in 12 months of 1997.\n       We believe that Virginia's one handgun in thirty day law \n     has had its intended effect of reducing Virginia's status as \n     a source state for gun trafficking. At the same time, the law \n     does not appear to create an onerous burden for the law-\n     abiding gun purchaser who apply for and are granted multiple \n     handgun purchase certificates. Even though there is not \n     conclusive evidence that the one-gun-in-thirty-days reduced \n     the number of violent criminal offenses occurring with \n     firearms, the number of Murders, Robberies and Aggravated \n     Assaults occurring with the use of a firearm has \n     significantly dropped since 1993 the year the one-gun-in-\n     thirty-days was enacted.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/06/senate-section/article/S11637-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11637-S11638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            DOUGLAS FONTAINE\n\n Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to \nthe growing chorus of people proclaiming, ``Thank God for baseball!'' \nIn this otherwise tumultuous year, the national pastime is back. Mark \nMcGwire and Sammy Sosa broke Ruthian (and Marisian!) records, Cal \nRipken voluntarily ended his heroic streak of 2,632 consecutive games \nplayed (a record which may never be broken) and, most importantly, the \nNew York Yankees and the incomparable Joe Torre are back on top. Well \ndone!\n  While New Yorkers have grown accustomed to the success of the Bronx \nBombers, 1998 is truly a departure from anything we've witnessed of \nlate. The numbers astound. Their 114 regular season victories are the \nmost in baseball since the 1906 Chicago Cubs. Bernie Williams took the \nbatting title, and on May 17 David Wells hurled the first perfect game \nby a Yankee pitcher since Don Larsen's masterpiece in game five of the \n1956 World Series. (I was an aide to Governor Harriman at the time.) On \nFriday night, after a three-hour rain delay, the Yankees swept the \nprodigiously talented Texas Rangers 3-0 in their first-round American \nLeague playoff series.\n  Sadly, the season is not without its concerns. Darryl Strawberry, the \nembattled talent who so bravely and admirably turned his life and \ncareer around these past few years, was diagnosed last week with colon \ncancer. The Yankees outfielder/designated hitter underwent surgery \nSaturday and the prognosis of a full recovery is excellent. Our prayers \nare with him.\n  Tonight, in the Bronx, the Yankees will host the Cleveland Indians in \nthe first game of the American League Championship Series, the winner \nto face the Atlanta Braves or San Diego Padres in the World Series. No \ndoubt Darryl Strawberry will be in the hearts and minds of the entire \nteam and city, as the Yankees continue their most remarkable season. \nJust two years ago, the Yankees won the World Series, and I was honored \nto ride in a motorcade down Broadway with Joe DiMaggio, the original \nYankee Clipper. In all likelihood another parade is in the \noffing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/06/senate-section/article/S11638-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RECOGNIZING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF INSPECTORS GENERAL\n\n Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I applaud the Senate's action in \npassing a joint resolution, S. J. Res. 58, recognizing the \naccomplishments of Inspectors General during the last 20 years.\n  Inspectors General came into being in 1978, when with the leadership \nof the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, Congress passed the act \ncreating these vital positions. The initial legislation was modified \nand expanded in 1988, and today there are IGs at nearly 60 Federal \ndepartments, agencies, and other entities. IGs are a unique \ninstitution. By design, they are independent voices that owe duties to \nboth Congress and their agency heads. Their job, which is not easy, is \nto identify and report on waste, fraud, and abuse, and other problems \nin Federal Government and then recommend solutions.\n  IGs have served the taxpayers of this country well. Every year, they \nmake recommendations totaling billions of dollars on how our government \nshould spend money more wisely. They return hundreds of millions of \ndollars to the Federal treasury annually through investigative \nrecoveries. And they help protect the integrity of Federal Government \noperations by successfully prosecuting thousands of criminal cases and \nsuspending or disbarring thousands of individuals and entities who have \ntaken advantage of the government.\n  Naturally, IGs are not always popular at their agencies. No official \nlikes to hear that a policy proposal is going to cost too much money or \nthat a favored program suffers from waste, fraud, or abuse. But \ndelivering news about problems, while sometimes unpopular or unwelcome \nby an agency, is vital to responsive and wise government management.\n  Thus, we did well to pass this resolution recognizing the \nachievements of the IGs and thanking them for their services. The \nGovernmental Affairs Committee looks forward to working with the IGs in \nthe future, including considering possible improvements to the IG act \nto ensure that they are afforded the necessary independence and \nauthority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/06/senate-section/article/S11638-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      COMMEMORATION OF THE BICENTENNIAL OF THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS\n\n  Ms. SNOWE.

Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2561) to amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act \n     with respect to furnishing and using consumer reports for \n     employment purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, Senator Bryan and I have been working for \nnearly a year to address concerns within the motor carrier industry \nwith\n\n[[Page S11639]]\n\nrespect to the Fair Credit Reporting Act. I would like to thank Senator \nByran for his leadership on this important legislation. We have been \nworking to ensure all involved parties are in agreement with the \nchanges to the Fair Credit Reporting Act in this bill.\n  The Consumer Credit Reporting Reform Act of 1996, which passed as \npart of the Omnibus Conciliation Appropriations Act of 1997, contained \nreforms to the Fair Credit Reporting Act which are in conflict with the \nreality of how the motor carrier industry hires safe, responsible \ndrivers.\n  We have reached an agreement with consumer groups, including U.S. \nPIRG, the chairman and ranking member of the Banking Committee, the \nFederal Trade Commission, and the credit industry which will not reduce \nconsumer protections but will ensure a fair process for the regulated \ncommunity. I would like to thank everyone for their help throughout \nthis process on this important legislation.\n  This legislation will more appropriately address the manner in which \nthe trucking industry hires safe, responsible drivers. If an individual \napplies for employment by mail, telephone, or electronic means, the \nemployer can notify the potential employee orally, in writing, or \nelectronically, that a consumer report may be obtained for employment \npurposes. The applicant must then consent to the procurement of that \nreport.\n  This legislation will also allow an employer within the trucking \nindustry, if the potential employee has applied for employment by mail, \ntelephone, or electronically, to take adverse action based on the \nreport and then notify the consumer within three business days that \nadverse action has been taken.\n  In addition, this bill also includes a provision that will allow \ncriminal convictions to be reported past 7 years. This information is \ncritical to employers in the areas of child care, education, and \nhousehold services.\n  And finally we have included technical amendments to the Fair Credit \nReporting Act that, again, the Federal Trade Commission and the \nregulated community are in agreement with.\n  It is essential that this commonsense legislation pass the Senate \nthis year and I encourage my colleagues to support this bill. I want to \nagain thank everyone for their support on this issue and I thank my \ncolleagues Senator Sarbanes, Senator Bryan, Senator Mack, and others on \nthe Banking Committee for their leadership on the Fair Credit Reporting \nAct.\n  Ms. SNOWE.

Mr. President, I am pleased to offer my support for the \nMigratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp Promotion Act of 1998, or \nthe Duck Stamp Act as it is more commonly known.\n  In 1934 President Roosevelt signed into law the Migratory Bird \nHunting Stamp Act (Act). The Act required that all waterfowl hunters 16 \nyears of age and over must annually purchase and carry a Federal Duck \nStamp. The revenue generated from duck stamp sales is earmarked for the \nMigratory Bird Conservation Fund to buy or lease waterfowl sanctuaries. \nAs a result, many of the nation's wildlife refuges have been purchased \nin whole or part with duck stamp funds.\n  Although the Duck Stamp program has been extremely successful, the \nAct does not provide funds to market and advertise duck stamps. This \nlegislation authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to use up to $1 \nmillion a year in duck stamp receipts until 2003 for marketing \npurposes. To ensure that this program is a success the marketing plan \nhas to be approved by the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission prior \nto implementation.\n  Duck stamp sales could increase substantially if funds were available \nto market the stamp, and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support \nH.R. 4248.\n  Ms. SNOWE.

Mr. President, Senator Chafee has a substitute amendment \nat the desk, and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Snowe], for Mr. Chafee, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3749.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer my support today for \nS. 2095, legislation to reauthorize the National Fish and Wildlife \nFoundation Establishment Act of 1984. This legislation makes important \nchanges in the Foundation's charter, changes that I believe will allow \nthe Foundation to build on its fine record of providing funding for \nconservation of our nation's fish, wildlife and plant resources.\n  The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation was established in 1984, to \nbring together diverse groups to engage in conservation projects across \nAmerica and, in some cases, around the world. Since its inception, the \nFoundation has made more than 2,300 grants totaling over $270 million. \nThis is an impressive record of accomplishment. The Foundation has \npioneered some notable conservation programs, including implementing \nthe North American Waterfowl Management plan, Partners in\n\n[[Page S11641]]\n\nFlight for neotropical birds, Bring Back the Natives Program, the Exxon \nSave the Tiger Fund, and the establishment of the Conservation Plan for \nSterling Forest in New York and New Jersey, to name just a few.\n  Mr. President, the Foundation has funded these programs by raising \nprivate funds to match federal appropriations on at least a 2 to 1 \nbasis. During this time of fiscal constraint this is an impressive \nrecord of leveraging federal dollars. Moreover, all of the Foundation's \noperating costs are raised privately, which means that federal and \nprivate dollars given for conservation is spent only on conservation \nprojects.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is quite simple. It makes three key \nchanges to current law. First, the bill would expand the Foundation's \ngoverning Board of Directors from 15 members to 25 members. This will \nallow a greater number of those with a strong interest in conservation \nto actively participate in, and contribute to, the Foundation's \nactivities.\n  The bill's second key feature authorizes the Foundation to work with \nother agencies within the Department of the Interior and the Department \nof Commerce, in addition to the Fish and Wildlife Service and the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Mr. President, it is \nmy view that the Foundation should continue to provide valuable \nassistance to government agencies within the Departments of the \nInterior and Commerce that may be faced with conservation issues. \nFinally, it would reauthorize appropriations to the Department of the \nInterior and the Department of Commerce through 2003.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this legislation will produce real \nconservation benefits, and I strongly urge my colleagues to give the \nbill their support.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the substitute \nbe agreed to, the bill be considered read a third time and passed, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements \nrelating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3749) was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 2095), as amended, was considered read a third time and \npassed, as follows.\n\n                                S. 2095\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
