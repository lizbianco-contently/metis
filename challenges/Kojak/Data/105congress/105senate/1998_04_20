Trust in the Lord with all your \nheart, and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways \nacknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths.''--Proverbs 3:3-6.\n  Father, it is Your esteem we long for most of all. Remind us of the \nhigh value You place on mercy and truth. We want to build our lives \naround Your priorities. Help us to base our lives on Your absolute \ntruth. May we be as merciful in our empathy and care for others as You \nhave been for us.\n  As we begin this new week, may the Senators renew their commitment to \nserve You and to seek Your esteem above all others. May You be the \nAudience of One whose approval is important.\n  Lord, we pray that You will comfort and encourage those who have \nsuffered the damaging, shattering devastation from tornadoes in recent \nweeks. Today we ask for Your courage and strength for the people of \nNashville, Tennessee. Through our Lord and Savior. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/20/senate-section/article/S3239-4", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the Senate will be in a period for morning \nbusiness until 1 p.m. in order for Senators to make statements and to \nintroduce legislation. At 1 p.m. today, the Senate will begin \nconsideration of the Coverdell education A+ bill under the provisions \nof the consent agreement of March 27, 1998. As previously announced, \nthere will be no rollcall votes today, but it is hoped that Members \nwill be available to offer their amendments to H.R. 2646, the Coverdell \nbill. As a reminder, the next rollcall vote will occur tomorrow morning \nat 10 a.m. on or in relation to the Gorton amendment to S. 414, the \nOcean Shipping Reform Act.\n  Just to remind Senators, we did have debate on the Ocean Shipping Act \non Friday when we went out for the Easter recess period, and we \ncompleted all the work except for the vote on the amendment and then, \nof course, final passage after that, if that is necessary, and I \npresume it may not be.\n  Senators should expect further votes throughout Tuesday's session on \nor in relation to pending amendments to the Coverdell education bill.\n  In addition, it is hoped that during this week the Senate will be \nable to consider the NATO expansion treaty and the State Department \nreorganization conference report under the consent agreement of 6 \nhours.\n  I want to say again that there will be no rush to judgment on NATO \nenlargement. I want to make sure that Senators on both sides of the \naisle and on both sides of the issue will have a chance to make their \nstatements and point out their concerns or their reasons for support. \nSo, if it is necessary to take that over into next week before we get \nto the conclusion of the NATO enlargement, we will certainly do that.\n  During the next 5 weeks, the Senate can be expected to consider the \nfollowing items, and therefore Members can expect busy days with votes \nmost every day that we are in session, including Mondays or Fridays, \nexcept for those where we have already indicated we will not have \nvotes, and we will reconfirm those during the next 2 days so Senators \nwill know for sure the Mondays or Fridays where there will not be \nrecorded votes.\n  In addition to the items I mentioned, this week we also will take up, \nhopefully, with cooperation from both sides of the aisle, the IRS \nreform legislation; Department of Defense authorization; the budget \nconference report; supplemental appropriations conference report--\nperhaps even reports, depending\n\n[[Page S3240]]\n\non whether there are one or two there--the nuclear waste bill; a series \nof high-tech bills. There could be as many as three or four of those \ncoming out of the Commerce Committee. I will have to consult with the \nchairman as to exactly how many there will be. I believe they have \nalready reported a couple, and there may be two more.\n  The Iran sanctions legislation is pending. We have tried to be \ncooperative with the administration on this issue, but we did get an \nagreement right at the end of the session before we went home for \nEaster as to when action could occur on the Iran sanctions. I believe \nthat is before May 20, but we will reconfirm that later. And, of \ncourse, the tobacco legislation issue is pending before the Senate, \nhaving been reported by the Commerce Committee.\n\n  This is not an exclusive list, of course, and additional legislation \nor Executive Calendar items may be cleared for action. I look forward \nto a productive legislative period.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/20/senate-section/article/S3239-6", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          EDUCATION SAVINGS ACT FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I can just say a few brief words about S. \n1133, the Parent-Student Savings Account Plus Act, which is commonly \nreferred to now as the A+ Act. Everywhere I went during the recess \nperiod in my State of Mississippi--and I did a number of events \nthroughout the State in a variety of forums in towns and cities--\neducation was at the top of every list.\n  I spoke to the Mississippi Economic Council, which is an organization \nreally affiliated with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, but it represents \na variety of businessmen and women, professionals, people who really \nwant to make sure that we have what we need to create jobs and move \nforward economically and have opportunities for all our citizens. An \nimportant part of their plans for this year did include, of course, \ncontinued emphasis on education.\n  So I am really excited that a good portion of this week will be spent \non debate concerning the education savings account and the other \nportions that we have added to this education bill in the Finance \nCommittee and other amendments that will be offered on the floor of the \nSenate on both sides of the aisle.\n  Some people have said, ``Well, it could be messy debating education \nwith as many as a dozen or more amendments being in order and with \nsecond degrees being in order.'' I think there are very few issues that \nwe could be debating in the Senate this year in America more important \nthan education. Of course, there are differences as to how to proceed \non this education issue.\n  I feel very strongly that we should encourage parents to save more \nfor their children's education, not only for college but also for \nelementary and secondary education. We should make it possible for \nparents and grandparents and scholarship groups to set aside money in \nsavings, in an education IRA, and that money then could be used for a \nvariety of needs for children, whether it is tuition, books, supplies, \ncomputers, transportation, even uniforms. In my hometown, I was \nsurprised to learn that the school board had voted that the students \nwill begin wearing a certain form of uniform because they think it will \nhelp cut down on some of the violence associated with the clothes that \nare worn to school.\n  I think there are a whole variety of options now that could be \navailable. There are those who oppose the savings account for education \nfor elementary and secondary students, but I ask why--we just last \nyear, and the President signed into law, increased the opportunity for \neducation savings accounts for higher education, and we raised the \nlimit of those savings that could be set aside up to $2,000 a year--\nwhy shouldn't it be available for elementary and secondary education?\n\n  There are some other components of this legislation that have the \nguarantee that it would be bipartisan. In addition to the bipartisan \nsupport for the education savings account, other components in the bill \ninclude the expansion of the exclusion of employer-provided educational \nbenefits to graduate education, which is a policy strongly advocated by \nthe Senator from New York, Senator Moynihan. We should encourage \nemployers to provide education benefits as a part of the package that \nthey get in the agreement between employer and employee. This bill does \nthat.\n  While I was home, I spoke with the treasurer of our State of \nMississippi. He made a particular point of coming over and asking me, \ndid the bill still include the State prepaid tuition programs? I \nassured him that it did. We should encourage parents and students to \nsave for their tuition. In this bill they will be able to exclude from \nincome payments from State prepaid tuition programs.\n  Also, this bill does provide for some opportunity for bonds for \nschool construction. I personally do not think the Federal Government \nshould begin paying for school construction at the local level. I think \nthat is a decision that should be made by the States, by the local \ngovernments.\n  Some people say, ``Well, they can't afford it.'' I represent the \npoorest State in the Nation--or what was the poorest State; thank \ngoodness we are making progress now and getting off the bottom of many \nlists--but one of the ways we have done that is we have been putting \nmore money into education, more money into building new high schools \nand new elementary schools. The education level in the State has \ngenerally been rising. The credit goes to the parents, the \nadministrators, and the teachers at the local level. But to provide \nsome process where there would be this bonding opportunity for school \nconstruction is one that I think we should consider. And it is in the \nlegislation.\n  There will be a number of other amendments that will be offered from \nboth sides of the aisle. I will agree with some of them, and I will \ndisagree violently with some of the others. But I think this is a \ndebate worth having. I commend Senator Coverdell for his dogged work in \nsupport of education in this bill and the cooperation he has had from \nand with the Senator from New Jersey, Senator Torricelli.\n  So this will be a great opportunity this week to do some things that \nwill help education. One of the amendments that will be offered could \nbe to consolidate some of the many, many Federal education programs \ninto block grants and then allow that money to go back through the \nStates with the direction that 95 percent of the money go to the school \ndistricts. Only 5 percent of it can be eaten up by administrative \ncosts; 95 percent of it will go to the school districts without strings \nattached. Let the schools decide. Let the local school officials decide \nif that money will be used for STAR teachers or for construction, if \nyou will. It would be their choice. That is the fundamental difference \nbetween what some others will be trying to do, which would mean more \ndecisions, more money, more direction and more strings from Washington. \nThat is not the answer. I think in many cases that is the problem.\n  So, it will be an interesting debate. I commend the Senators for \nworking with me to try to get an agreement as to how this process will \ngo forward. We will spend today and all of tomorrow and possibly or \nprobably even part of Wednesday completing this legislation, but it is \ntime well spent.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/20/senate-section/article/S3240-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          EDUCATION SAVINGS ACT FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

GLOBAL CLIMATE TREATY\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, last month the U.N. global climate treaty \nbecame available for the formal signatures of those countries who \nreached\n\n[[Page S3241]]\n\nagreement in Kyoto, Japan, in December. President Clinton has not \nsigned the treaty. There is speculation, however, that he may sign the \ntreaty this week.\n  Today we remind the President that the U.N. global climate treaty \ndoes not meet the standards clearly established by the U.S. Senate in \nits 95-0 vote last year on the Byrd-Hagel resolution, Senate Resolution \n98. The President should not sign any treaty until that treaty complies \nwith Senate Resolution 98 in its entirety.\n  The administration completely ignored the strong position of the \nSenate when it agreed to this treaty last December.\n  I led the Senate observer group delegation to Kyoto, Japan, in \nDecember. After Vice President Gore came to Kyoto and instructed our \nnegotiators to show ``increased flexibility,'' the doors were thrown \nopen and the objective became very clear. The objective was: Let us get \na deal at any cost. The clear advice of the U.S. Senate and the \neconomic well-being of the American people were abandoned under \npressure from the U.N. bureaucrats, international environmentalists and \nthe 134 developing countries that were not even included--not even \nincluded--in the treaty. The United States of America was the only \nNation to come out of these negotiations worse than it came in. In \nfact, there was no negotiation in Kyoto; there was only surrender.\n  When the Senate voted last year on the Byrd-Hagel resolution, it was \nvery clear as to what the resolution said.\n  First, it directed the President not to sign any treaty that placed \nlegally binding obligations on the United States to limit or reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions unless--unless--and I quote directly from S. \nRes. 98 passed last year by this body 95-0--\n\n       . . . unless the protocol or agreement also mandates new \n     specific scheduled commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse \n     gas emissions [for all nations] for Developing Country \n     Parties within the same compliance period.\n\n  Meaning simply that if this was a global problem, it required a \nglobal solution. All nations had to be bound by legally binding \nmandates, not just the United States and the other developed nations. \nThe message was simple. There was no ambiguity. This was not the \nadministration's nebulous definition of ``meaningful participation'' \nfor developing countries. This word of the Senate was quite clear.\n  The Kyoto Protocol does not include a single developing nation. The \nKyoto Protocol agreed to by the United States in December does not \ninclude a single developing country; 134 developing nations, including \nChina, Mexico, India, Brazil, and South Korea, many of whom compete \nfiercely--fiercely--with the United States for trade opportunities, are \ncompletely exempt from any obligations or responsibilities for reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions.\n  During a recent hearing in the Foreign Relations Committee, \nUndersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat, the lead U.S. negotiator in \nKyoto, admitted the administration failed on this account. Secretary \nEizenstat said--and I quote the Undersecretary--``You're absolutely \nright; we did not get binding commitments [from any] developing \ncountries.''\n\n  The second requirement of the Byrd-Hagel resolution speaks directly \nto the impact this treaty would have on the American people. And it, \ntoo--it too--fell victim in Kyoto. Senate Resolution 98 stated that the \nPresident should not sign any treaty which ``. . . would result in \nserious harm to the economy of the United States.''\n  The Kyoto Protocol would legally bind the United States to reduce our \ngreenhouse gas emissions to 7 percent below 1990 levels by the years \n2008 to 2012. It even goes much further than the President's own bottom \nline that he personally announced last October when President Clinton \npledged he would not accept a baseline below 1990 levels in greenhouse \ngas emissions, and he said there must be ``meaningful participation'' \nfrom all developing countries.\n  Numerous independent economic studies predicted serious economic harm \neven if the administration had held to its position that it enunciated \nlast October. These studies found job losses in the range of over 2 \nmillion, large increases in energy costs, a 50-cent increase in gas \nprices per gallon, a drop in economic growth rates of more than 1 \npercent a year, and major American industries being driven out of \nbusiness or driven out of the United States--industries like steel, \naluminum, petroleum refining, chemicals, iron, paper products, and \ncement.\n  That is why American agriculture, American labor, American business \nand industry and many consumer groups have all united in opposition--in \nopposition--to this treaty. Yet, our negotiators in Kyoto--the ones who \nwere supposed to be looking out for the American people--agreed to a \ntreaty that would have had an even more devastating impact on the U.S. \neconomy and on the lives of the American people.\n  The administration's recent anemic attempt to develop an economic \nanalysis showing ``minimal'' harm to the U.S. economy is laughable. It \nis truly laughable. No models, no numbers, no percentages, no \neconomics. It is laughable. It is based on fabrication and vapor, on a \nwildly optimistic assumption--as an example, China, India and Mexico \nagreeing to the binding commitments in this treaty. That is nonsense, \nMr. President. These very nations blocked language in Kyoto, Japan, \nlast year that would have allowed developing countries to even \nvoluntarily--voluntarily--undertake the obligations of this treaty. \nThey will never agree to binding commitments, and have so stated.\n  Even from an environmental standpoint, the Kyoto Protocol is a \nfailure. This Wednesday is Earth Day, and some will undoubtedly attempt \nto hold up this treaty as an example of a significant accomplishment to \nhelp our environment. The truth is, this treaty is so flawed that it \nwill do virtually nothing to slow the growth of manmade greenhouse \ngasses in the atmosphere. Even if one accepts the validity of the \nscience on global warming, which is still uncertain and at best \ncontradictory, this treaty would do nothing to stop any of these \nemissions. The Kyoto Protocol excludes the very developing nations who \nwill be responsible for more than 60 percent of the world's manmade \ngreenhouse gas emissions early in the next century.\n  China will be the world's largest emitter of manmade greenhouse \ngasses by the year 2015. On February 13 of this year, the Washington \nPost reported, ``But even if the accord is ratified and fully \nimplemented, it would barely dent the world's output of manmade \ngreenhouse gasses * * * .'' This treaty makes no sense. It is folly, \ncomplete folly.\n  Yet, the administration has made it clear that President Clinton \nintends to sign this treaty at some point during the period it is open \nfor signature between now and next March. The administration has also \nmade it very clear that it understands the treaty has no chance of \nratification in the Senate and that it intends to withhold this treaty \nfrom Senate consideration. The President claims that the treaty is, in \nhis words, ``a work in progress.'' This leaves people with the mistaken \nimpression that the treaty remains under negotiation and that \nobjectionable parts of the treaty can be negotiated away before it is \nsubmitted to the Senate. Mr. President, this is not the case. This is \nnot the case. Why would anyone sign a legally binding treaty they \nconsider a work in progress? That is complete nonsense.\n  This treaty cannot be amended until it goes into force, and even \nthen, only by a three-quarters vote of all countries that have become \nparty to the protocol. The 134 developing countries that would not even \nvoluntarily sign on to this, which are not bound by any emissions \nlimits, make up more than the three-quarters of the world's nations. \nHence, they control any amendment to this treaty. The countries that \nhave no obligations in this treaty are the very nations that dictate \nand enforce its terms. This is outrageous.\n  My coauthor of S. Res. 98, Senator Byrd of West Virginia, said \nrecently on the floor of the Senate that the Kyoto Protocol did not \nmeet either of the Senate standards laid out in the Byrd-Hagel \nresolution. Senator Byrd said, ``I hope that the President will not \nsign his name to the protocol at this point * * * I am concerned that \nif the President signs this protocol at this point, it will compromise \nhis flexibility in dealing with the developing countries over the next \nyear.''\n\n[[Page S3242]]\n\n  Senator Byrd is absolutely correct. It makes no sense to sign a \nflawed treaty, thereby giving away our leverage and our negotiating \nstrength. If the President believes this treaty is good enough to sign, \nit should be good enough, Mr. President, to submit to the Senate for an \nhonest and open debate. The American people have a right to know \nexactly what obligations the United States would have under this \ntreaty.\n  Members of the Senate and the House will remain actively engaged in \nthis issue. Oversight hearings will continue. We will continue to hold \nhearings this year to ensure that the administration does not attempt \nto implement this treaty or any part of this treaty prior to Senate \nratification through Executive order, budget fiat, or regulatory \naction.\n  During the Foreign Relations Committee hearing in February, I asked \nSecretary Eizenstat about any attempts to implement this treaty prior \nto Senate ratification. He replied, ``We have no intention through the \nback door or anything else, without Senate confirmation, of trying to \nimpose or take any steps to impose what would be binding restrictions \non our companies, on our industry, on our business, on our agriculture, \non our commerce, or on our country until and unless the Senate of the \nUnited States says so.'' That is Secretary Eizenstat.\n  Mr. President, we will hold the Clinton administration to its word. \nRecent news reports, however, have brought to light a very dishonest \nattempt by the EPA to impose carbon emissions caps through the \nderegulation of the electric industry. I was glad to see that the \nadministration dropped this nonsense from its final electric \nderegulation proposal. There will be no implementation of this treaty \nbefore ratification by the Senate of the United States.\n  The Senate's bottom line, as represented in the unanimous 95-0 vote \non S. Res. 98, remains unchanged. The U.S. Senate will not support the \nratification of the Kyoto treaty because it does not include binding \ncommitments by the developing nations and does serious harm to the U.S. \neconomy.\n  This has become an economic treaty, not an environmental treaty, and \nit is a bad treaty for America. So bad that it will not be ratified by \nthis body.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, Wednesday is Earth Day--a good time to \nreflect on our responsibilities to preserve and protect the environment \nthat we will pass on to our children and grandchildren.\n  I have six children, and, at last count, eleven grandchildren. I \nobviously care about the environment they will grow up in.\n  I am encouraged by the fact that the air we breathe and the water \nthat flows though America's rivers are far cleaner today than they were \non the first Earth Day in 1970. You might not know that is the case if \nyou listen exclusively to the gloom and doom pronouncements of many \ninstitutional environmental groups.\n  Sometimes, these groups place my name on a list or issue a ``report \ncard'' on my voting record that might lead one to believe that I do not \ncare about the environment. This is, of course, nonsense. You cannot \nhave eleven grand kids at the center of your life while working to \nshortchange the environment.\n  Having said that, I must join my colleagues in reporting to the \nSenate that Vice President Gore returned from Kyoto with a climate \ntreaty so fatally flawed that it will never be ratified by the Senate \nor enter into force. Nor should it.\n  While the climate issue must be taken seriously, the Senate would be \nshirking its constitutional responsibilities if it were to ratify a \ntreaty that is so blatantly unfair, economically burdensome, and of no \nbenefit to the environment.\n  The unfairness of the treaty lies mainly in its exclusion of \n``developing'' nations such as China, India, South Korea and Mexico. \nEmissions from these nations will exceed ours in about 15 years, and \ntheir exclusion will only encourage the shift of manufacturing (and \nresulting emissions) from the nations subject to controls to the \nnations that are not. Thus, global emissions would not decrease. Since \ndeveloping nations are less energy-efficient than we are, emissions \nmight even increase. Under the treaty there would be no global \nenvironmental gain--but America would suffer economic pain.\n  According to the respected economic firm Wharton Econometrics, the \nKyoto Treaty would reduce Gross Domestic Product by more than $2,000 \nper household in 2010--and $30,000 per household between 2001-2020. \nMoreover, 2.5 million Americans would lose their jobs. Since the \nclimate change problem will one day be addressed through technological \ninnovation fostered in a healthy economic environment, the last thing \nwe want to do is adopt a treaty that would create a national economic \ndecline reminiscent of the oil shocks of the 1970s.\n  If we are truly concerned about carbon emissions, we will revitalize \nnuclear energy and hydropower--our only large-scale, base-load sources \nof carbon free electricity. Nuclear energy generates 22% of our \nelectricity, and hydropower adds an additional 11%. Solar and wind \nenergy, in comparison, fill one-tenth of one percent of our total \nenergy needs. Although solar and wind energy will grow, the immutable \nlaws of physics limit that growth to just a few percent. Presidential \ninitiatives to place solar panels on a million roofs around the country \nmay have symbolic value, but what is the administration doing to \npromote nuclear and hydropower--the carbon-free emission sources that \ncan really make a difference?\n  Unfortunately, the President opposes the nuclear waste bill that has \npassed the Senate twice by a wide, bipartisan margin. Any failure to \naddress the nuclear waste issue will result in the premature closure of \nnuclear power plants, whose capacity will be replaced with carbon-\nemitting, fossil-fuel plants.\n  Bruce Babbitt aspires to be the first Interior Secretary to tear down \nhydropower dams. Additionally, other dams around the country are \nendangered by a cumbersome regulatory process that can make it cheaper \nto tear down the dam and purchase fossil-fuel generated power rather \nthan endure the ordeal of relicensing before the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission.\n  On the international energy front, administration policy is in \nopposition to China's Three Gorges hydroelectric project--the \nalternative to which is thirty six new carbon-belching 500 megawatt \ncoal plants. Is this part of a consistent carbon reduction strategy? In \nan intellectual contortion that defies common sense, Administration \nenergy policy is anti-nuclear and anti-hydropower while professing to \nbe anti-carbon. To appreciate that, one only needs to read the \nPresident's Climate Initiative unveiled last October. Nuclear energy \nisn't even mentioned, and hydropower is explicitly discounted in the \ndocument's exclusive discussion of ``non-hydro'' renewable energy.\n  What is the President's answer? The President's strategy is to push \nthe issue off to someone else's watch. The Kyoto Treaty doesn't require \ncarbon reductions until the year 2008.\n  Meanwhile, by agreeing to a fatally flawed treaty in Kyoto, the Vice \nPresident revealed his own Achilles' heel--he can't say no to any \nenvironmental cause, even if it directly harms U.S. interests and jobs \nhere at home. Kyoto has exposed that weakness, and now it is the \nSenate's Constitutional responsibility to ensure that a bad treaty will \nnever be ratified.\n  Ninety-five Senators rarely agree on anything--but they agreed with \npassage of the Byrd-Hagel resolution that any climate treaty must be \nglobally applied, without harm to our economy. In the case of the Kyoto \ntreaty, the President failed to take our advice--so he cannot expect to \nreceive our consent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I have just returned from a very enjoyable time of \ntraveling around Wyoming, attending town meetings, going to school \nclassrooms, pounding a little bit on a Habitat for Humanity house.\n  When I left Wyoming, it was snowing. But the folks in Wyoming \nunderstand that if there hadn't been a little bit of global warming, we \nwould be under about 300 feet of ice. So they may not be as concerned \nas perhaps some other places in the world, but I want to talk today a \nlittle bit about the global warming treaty as well. I went to the \ntreaty conference in Kyoto. I went\n\n[[Page S3243]]\n\nwith Senator Hagel and a couple of other Senators. The purpose of our \ntrip was to convey the importance of the Byrd-Hagel resolution.\n  We went over there to talk about a resolution that passed this Senate \n95-0. That is a pretty clear message, and it was also a very simple \nmessage. The developing nations have to participate in the treaty and \nthe treaty cannot result in serious harm to the U.S. economy. I have to \nsay the treaty fails. It is unfair. The benefits are unclear. The costs \nare unknown, and the administration is unresponsive to our requests for \ninformation.\n  Kyoto was titled ``a global warming'' conference, but I have to say \nit was an economic conference disguised as an environmental conference. \nWhile we were over there, we got to meet with the Chinese delegation. \nThe Chinese, by the year 2010, will be the world's largest polluter, \nunquestionably. We wanted to know what they intended to do about that. \nThey said nothing, they are a developing nation. We asked them what \ntheir definition was of a ``developing nation'' so that we would know \nwhen they would no longer be a developing nation. They said, ``We will \nalways be a developing nation.'' We asked them if they would do \nvoluntary restraints on their pollution. They said no. We asked, How \nabout voluntary restraints at some future unspecified date? I don't \nknow how you can make any negotiation looser than that. Their answer \nwas no.\n\n  We also got to hear from some of the island nations that are refusing \nto be a part of any voluntary restraints. Island nations. We are \ntalking about nations that, if global warming is true, the polar icecap \nwill melt and their island will be inundated with water; they will \ndisappear as a country. They said they would not be a part of it, that \nthey were a developing nation and they didn't need to do it. To me, \nthat is the best evidence that there isn't global warming.\n  There is no consensus on global warming. Some scientists argue that \nthe carbon dioxide in global warming is even good. The important thing \nis that we are already doing more than others. We are doing more \nwithout recognition. We are doing more without penalties. We are doing \nmore because it is the right thing to do. But this was an economic \nconference disguised as an environmental conference. It was a \nconference where we lose.\n  I remember an incident in the Northwest, near my home up in \nWashington, where we got concerned about the spotted owl, that it was \nheaded for certain extinction. We halted the Northwest logging \nindustry. We put an entire industry and its employees out of work. Our \nnational forests were left unmanaged, and they are now a big tinderbox; \nthey burn whenever lightning strikes. It is not very good stewardship \nwhen we are wasting what we have. After all this, we have discovered \nthat this timid little bird has been building nests in billboards by \nthe highways and they are undisturbed by the passing cars and trucks.\n  A part of our economy moved to other countries where they don't have \nthe environmental laws. Logging moved to Siberia. Russian loggers are \ntearing down 10 million acres of forest each year. In our effort to \nsave the spotted owl, we have wiped out the Siberian tiger. We have to \nbe careful with the consequences of what we are promoting.\n  The Vice President believes we can get rid of coal and use clean \nenergy, like wind. I have to tell you, there are few places that are \nwindier than the little belt that goes across southern Wyoming. It is \nup in the high plains, where the wind doesn't have any trees to block \nit. We have tried some wind experiments there. They built a generator, \nonly to have the wind velocity blow the rotors off. I asked the \nenvironmentalists, what about wind energy, what is the potential for \nthat? It only makes up one-third of 1 percent of our country's energy \nuse at the present time. Their response was that it will kill the bald \neagles; the eagles will fly into the generators and get chopped up. Not \na good solution. I asked about water. Well, water changes the nature of \nthe fish that use it, if we use it for hydraulic power. Nuclear power--\nwe don't even have to talk about nuclear power and the problems \nsupposed to be caused by it and the way that we haven't met our energy \nrequirements for the storage of nuclear waste.\n  The biggest thing that disturbed me about the Kyoto trip was that we \nwent there without the data we requested. Before we went to Kyoto, we \nmade it clear that there was information which we were certain any good \nnegotiators would be gathering to use for their case. We still haven't \ngotten that. When we went over there, we talked about a 1990 date and \nmaintaining the levels that we had in 1990. Our negotiators allowed the \nother countries to relax the criteria they had already agreed to \nwhile we made ours more difficult. Marvelous negotiating. They never \ndid answer the questions about the kind of administration that would be \nnecessary, the kind of bureaucracy that we build internationally, what \nkind of regulations, and to whom the United States would be subject. We \ndidn't talk about the pollution topic, and that is going to be \ninvolved.\n\n  I do remember, from some of the discussion of the Chinese, that they \nhad a solution for penalties. There ought to be penalties for those \ndeveloping nations that could not meet their criteria, and their idea \nwas that the penalties then would be distributed to those developing \nnations on the basis of population. Now, there is negotiation.\n  Numbers. We still don't have numbers. I put in an amendment last year \non the foreign operations spending bill. It asked for the numbers that \nthe administration has been collecting on global warming: How many \nAmerican jobs would be lost with the treaty? How much will it cost the \ntaxpayers to pay for Federal programs? What Federal programs will be \nneeded? We haven't received an answer. Apparently, none of the agencies \ninvolved can say how much they are going to spend on climate change.\n  This lack of accountability is a disgrace. The taxpayers should be \noutraged. Maybe we ought to sic some of those IRS auditors on the \nOffice of Management and Budget until we get the numbers we asked for a \nyear ago. Nobody knows exactly how much will be needed, where it is \ngoing, or what the purpose of it will be. Now, according to the numbers \nI am reading, that ought to be about a $6 billion to $10 billion \nviolation of the Government Performance and Results Act.\n  Yes, we have a law that says that the Government agencies are \nsupposed to tell us what they are doing. Here is the important part. \nThey are supposed to tell us how we can tell if it is getting done. And \nthen it is supposed to be reflected in their budgets so that we can see \nthat what they said they were going to do will get done within the \nconstraints of the money that is there. Somewhere the numbers have to \nbe available for what global warming--no, for what the administration's \nproposal of anti-economic development will cost us.\n  It is time for the administration to tell us exactly how much, how it \nis going to be done, if there will be incentives or just penalties, how \nwill it administer it and give a little bit of credit to those that are \nalready working the problem without the international treaty. Americans \nhave a right to know where their tax dollars are going. This last week, \nthe American people spent their tax dollars, sent their tax dollars, \nwill be audited on their tax dollars. It is time that we audit the \nFederal Government on the use of those tax dollars and hold them to the \n95-0 treaty that protects American jobs, and make sure that if we say \nwe are going to do a job, we are able to do the job. We owe it to the \nAmerican people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, it is great to be back from our recess and \nonce again to convene the Senate in the work of the citizens of this \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, let me, first of all, recognize my colleague from \nNebraska and my colleague from Wyoming and, for the record, praise them \nfor the leadership they have demonstrated on the most critical issue \nthat we address here on the floor this morning. Senator Hagel has \nbecome the Senate's leader, along with Senator Byrd of West Virginia, \non this issue of climate change and trying to convince the \nAdministration, and I think some of our critics, that the course this \nAdministration\n\n[[Page S3244]]\n\npursues is not only unrealistic, it really is unjustified. Both Senator \nHagel and Senator Enzi, as was recognized by the Senator from Wyoming, \nwere in Kyoto to watch as this Administration negotiated and began to \nwork on some form of protocol.\n  I think we three Senators join on the floor this morning proud that \nduring this century our Nation has developed into the strongest \neconomic and military power ever to exist on the face of the Earth. Our \ndemocratic system of government, which ensures unparalleled freedom for \nits citizens, is the envy of the world. All of us in this body are \nentrusted with the responsibility to protect and enhance that very \nstature.\n  Because I feel so strongly about that responsibility, it is with the \nmost chilling concern that I comment today on the President's \ncontemplated signing of the Kyoto Protocol on Global Climate Change. \nDespite grave bipartisan warnings from the Congress since the \nconclusion of the U.N. Global Climate Summit in Kyoto, the President \ninsists on committing our country to an agreement that I believe \nthreatens our way of life; indeed, it threatens the heart of our \nNation's power--and the American economy.\n  I, like many of my Senate colleagues, am confounded as to why the \nPresident is contemplating signing this agreement. I can only hope that \nit is not simply misguided loyalty to the Vice President, who every \nAmerican knows is the main protagonist in this ill-conceived campaign \nto avoid what he calls ``an imminent environmental holocaust'' caused \nby global warming.\n  Let me repeat those words. Catch the flavor and the emotional ring of \n``an imminent environmental holocaust.'' If anybody stood on the street \ncorner of America and spoke with those terms, surely they would catch \nthe attention of some. When the Vice President speaks in those terms, \nhe catches the attention of many. There is only one problem with that \nkind of rhetoric. Few, if any, scientists today believe that the world \nis facing an environmental holocaust from global warming, much less an \nimminent one.\n  In fact, as more and more American scientists review the available \ndata on global warming, it is becoming increasingly clear that the vast \nmajority believe the commitments for reduction of greenhouse gas \nemissions made by the Administration in the Kyoto Protocol is an \nunnecessary response to an exaggerated threat--``to an exaggerated \nthreat'' that the Vice President himself is caught up in making. \nIndeed, just today more than 15,000 scientists, two-thirds with \nadvanced academic degrees, released a petition they signed urging the \nUnited States to reject the Kyoto Protocol. The petition, expressly \nstates that:\n\n       There is no convincing scientific evidence that human \n     release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gases \n     is causing or will cause catastrophic heating of the Earth's \n     atmosphere and disruption of the Earth's climate.\n\n  Mr. President, why must the United States be a party to an agreement \nthat will substantially and negatively affect our economy, change our \nway of life, and potentially weaken our ability to maintain the world's \nmost powerful military without sufficient scientific evidence of \nimpending doom--sufficient scientific evidence of impending doom? I \nsubmit that this Administration has yet to adequately answer that \nquestion. The President of the United States, over anyone else in our \ncountry, must answer that question.\n  Even if we were to ignore the scientific evidence and assume that the \nworld is facing an imminent environmental problem, this agreement does \nnothing to avoid the threat. Bert Bolin, a Swedish meteorologist and \nthe outgoing chairman of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange, recently said that ``[t]he Kyoto conference did not achieve \nmuch with regard to limiting the buildup of greenhouse gases in the \natmosphere.''--The Washington Post, February 13, 1998\n  Therefore, I ask again: Why is the President going to sign this \nagreement, which, if ratified in its current form, will raise the costs \nfor nearly everything in a typical American budget, in both the short \nterm and long term?\n  The Administration has attempted to relieve our economic concerns \nwith a superficial analysis that presents a simplistic view of how \nAmerican industry can adapt to new economic challenges and includes \nassumptions about the success of emission trading proposals that are \nuntested in the international arena. This so-called economic analysis \nis contained in a 20-page paper by Janet Yellen, the Chairman of the \nPresident's Council of Economic Advisers, submitted as testimony to the \nHouse Commerce Committee and the Senate Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  However, in testimony recently given before the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee examining the Kyoto Agreement, Mary Novak, senior vice \npresident of a respected economic forecasting forum --you have heard of \nthem--called Wharton Econometrics Forecasting Associates, well-known \nworldwide for its expertise, stated that the Administration's economic \nanalysis of the impact of the Kyoto Agreement is terribly flawed--not \npossibly flawed, not flawed in limited ways, but terribly flawed. Ms. \nNovak predicted that the total U.S. cost of meeting the Kyoto Agreement \nwould be $250 billion, or a loss of 3.2 percent of gross domestic \nproduct. In addition, Ms. Novak stated that about 2.5 million jobs \nwould be lost, and the annual expense per family would exceed $2,700 a \nyear.\n  If the Senate of the United States were, at this moment, \ncontemplating an income tax increase that would increase the average \nfamily's taxes by $2,700, and if we passed it, very few, if any, of us \nwould withstand the public outcry, let alone the voters at the ballot \nbox in November. Yet, this President, because he thinks he can hide it \nthrough the processes of time and the procedure of international \nagreement, is proposing just that. That is what the WEFA says--an \nannual expense per family to exceed $2,700.\n  Mr. President, if this administration were sincere about reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions, we would have seen in the President's budget \nproposal strong support for an array of reliable electric energy that \nwe all know has a benign impact on the very environment that we all \ncherish and want to protect. Conspicuously absent from the President's \nClimate Change Technology Initiative was any support for nuclear or \nhydroelectric power. In fact, the President and the Vice President are \nhostile to nuclear and hydroelectric power. This very Administration \nhas initiatives that will ultimately grind nuclear energy generation to \na halt and would restrict us from any further development of hydro, let \nalone maintaining the status quo. Yet, both of these sources of power, \nas we know, do not produce one single molecule of greenhouse gas \nemissions into our atmosphere. Indeed, it is hard to imagine a cleaner \nsource of power than falling water, or nuclear fission.\n  What about the sincerity of this Administration's commitment to our \nNation's global competitiveness?\n  I was watching television yesterday catching the news shows and talk \nshows discussing the American economy. Many pundits were concerned \nabout the aggressiveness of the stock market. Well, concerned, yet \nhappy; but will this happiness last? We are surely concerned about the \neconomics of the Pacific rim at this moment; and, nearly every \neconomist on these shows were talking about the power of the current \neconomy of the United States, how it pulls other economies with us, and \nthat we continue to expect growth in the coming year; growth of about \n2.5 percent, growth very similar to the kind we had last year. And, \nwhile we are talking about that, while we recognize that our \ncompetitiveness in the global environment drives the global market, we \nhave an Administration that is tinkering around with the idea of \nrestricting the ability of our country to lead economically and to help \nout all other nations of the world with their own economic problems.\n  Mr. President, our Nation's agricultural industry is one of several \nindustries that will be adversely affected by the requirements of the \nKyoto Agreement. American agriculture has evolved with the rapid \nadoption of new technology; it is both highly capital and energy \nintensive. Energy use in both direct and indirect ways, including the \nfuel and lubricants for machinery and vehicles, the natural gas used to \ndry crops and pump irrigation water, and the electricity used in a wide \nvariety of ways, has caused the American agricultural economy to be the \nmost competitive and the most\n\n[[Page S3245]]\n\nproductive in the world. We use fertilizer and pesticides, all \ncontaining large energy components. For these reasons, our agricultural \nsystem is very sensitive to the kinds of changes the Vice President and \nthe President are proposing. American farmers buy $166 billion worth of \ninputs and services, sell about $212 billion worth of products and \nservices, and receive just about $54 billion in cash income to cover \ncosts and provide incentives for future investment. Moreover, American \nagriculture is deeply integrated into the world economy and depends on \nmore than $60 billion in export sales--the fastest growing market for \nour food and our fiber products.\n\n  That is just one example of an economy in this country that helps set \nthe pace for the world.\n  The Kyoto Agreement would cause fertilizer prices to go up, and while \nthe President says carbon taxes are not a part of his plan to meet the \ntreaty's requirements, the administration intends to pressure fossil \nfuel prices through other ways that would have the impact of burdensome \ntax increases. One of the results of the Administration's approach to \ncompliance will be higher costs for diesel fuel for trucks and \ntractors.\n  It takes no genius to understand what that means: Increased costs for \nfarmers, which translates into increased costs for food and finished \ngoods at the grocery store. In addition, since most products are \ndelivered by diesel-powered trucks, nearly every item in nearly every \nstore in America will cost more. And all of this will be done by an \nAdministration that pursues a policy which it has no strong scientific \nor economic basis or logical reason to pursue.\n  One of the many potential tragedies of this treaty would be the \nhigher cost of food, not just for those who can afford it but for those \nwho cannot. And remember our Judeo-Christian ethic as a country, the \nhundreds of millions of dollars of food we send around the world to \npoor nations, to starving people. Could we afford to send more if it \ncost more? I doubt it. And yet that is exactly what the President \nproposes.\n  According to Data Resources, Inc., another respected economic \nforecasting firm, 37 percent of American households have less than \n$20,000 after-tax income and spend about 21.2 percent to more than 100 \npercent of after-tax income on food. For these families, the impact of \nAmerica's compliance with the Kyoto Agreement would be severe and very \nnegative.\n  Mr. President, I believe this will be the first time in the history \nof our country that a President has allowed foreign interests to \ncontrol and to limit the growth of the American economy.\n  Let me repeat that for the record because I believe, after our \nresearch, that is a pretty profound statement, not just coming from me \nbut coming from the historic records of our country, that this would be \nthe first time in our history that an American President has allowed \nforeign interests to control and limit the growth of the American \neconomy. Never before have we allowed foreign interests to dictate the \namount of energy Americans can use.\n  The Kyoto Agreement requires Americans to cut energy use by the year \n2010 to 7 percent below what it was using in 1990. That was just 8 \nyears ago.\n  This weekend, I was at a special school out in Idaho, a collection of \nbright young kids. They are developing an electric car. They are going \nto race it next week in a race in north Idaho, an electric car. But \nguess what. You have to use nuclear hydrocarbons to generate the \nelectricity that goes in the battery that powers the car that creates \nno pollution.\n  Get the message. No matter where you turn, whether it is fueling the \ncars for the great urban areas of our country that might be powered by \nelectricity in the future, that electricity still has to be generated. \nAnd a lot of bright people are trying to accomplish that, so we can \nreduce that kind of impact on our environment. And yet, Mr. President, \nyou are denying the ability to generate the energy by suggesting that \nwe progressively reduce our ability to consume.\n  Mr. President, to illustrate the emissions requirement of the \nAgreement, Jay Hakes, head of the Energy Information Administration--a \nstatistical arm of the Department of Energy--said in February testimony \nbefore the House Science Committee: ``A 7 percent reduction [below \nbaseline levels under the agreement] for energy-related carbon \nemissions alone would require a reduction of about 550 million metric \ntons of carbon in 2010, or about 31 percent,'' below current \nprojections. According to EIA data, the mark of 550 million metric tons \nis greater than the total carbon emissions produced by electricity \ngeneration in the United States for 1990 or 1996 which were 477 million \nmetric tons and 517 million metric tons, respectively.\n\n  So let me say to all Senators and to the American people, tonight, \nwalk around your house. Think about the light fixture you have just \nturned on, the appliance you have just turned off, the telephone device \nyou might make a call on, or the computer you will sit down to, to \ncommunicate anywhere in the world. Many of these things you have added \nto your home since 1990. Look at the car you drove home from work. And \nto the farmer who is out there on the plains and the farmlands of \nAmerica this very hour, that marvelously efficient diesel tractor that \nis pulling the plow and the drill to plant the crop that creates the \nabundant harvest that feeds not just the people of America but the \npeople of the world. All of those tools are a product of energy. In \nfact, Americans today are consuming more energy as the economy \ncontinues to grow, and we will need to consume more. We will need to \nturn on our lights and our computers. We will need our cars. In the \nfuture, they will be better and they will be cleaner, but they still \nmust consume energy.\n  The Administration knows this protocol is seriously flawed. In a news \nconference held in Kyoto, Japan, on December 8, 1997, Vice President Al \nGore acknowledged: ``We've said from the beginning that, in order to \nsend an agreement to the Senate, we must have meaningful participation \nby key developing countries.'' We now know that developing countries \ndid not sign the agreement. Is it fair to let these countries off the \nhook while we Americans are subject to such stringent requirements?\n  Here's what Stephen L. Miller, President of the Center for Energy and \nEconomic Development had to say about the Kyoto Treaty: ``The proposed \nKyoto treaty is like a card game where the deck is stacked. American \nworkers are being dealt a losing hand through the negotiating process. \nIn the end, there will be no real environmental benefit and America's \nworking families will be forced to pay higher energy and consumer costs \nwhile we export U.S. jobs to countries that are exempted from action \nunder the Treaty.''\n  So let us call once again upon our President to incorporate in this \nagreement developing nations, growth nations like China, Mexico, and \nIndia, that have simply walked away because they cannot be a part of an \nagreement that would cut back on the opportunity they are trying to \noffer their citizens.\n  Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, sign something that is a winning \nagreement for America. Sign something that promotes our economy, that \npromotes the environment of the world. Sign something that all \ncountries of the world can agree with. Please do not turn us away from \nthe kind of economic growth and development that all of our citizens \nexpect and demand. There is simply no compelling reason for our \ngovernment at this time to force Americans to take preventive measures \nof uncertain competence against a problem that may or may not lie in \nthe Earth's future.\n  The Administration carries a heavy burden of persuasion that the \nCO2 compliance measures contained in the Kyoto Agreement are \nworth the sacrifice it will require of the American people. We here in \nthe Senate must, and will, ensure that our nation's global economic \ncompetitiveness, our nation's military readiness, and our way of life, \nare not compromised merely to advance misguided political agendas.\n  It bears repeating--the Kyoto Agreement is flawed. It is based on \npolitic science and not lab science. And it is only through sound lab \nscience that we, working collectively together with our colleagues \naround the world, will produce a better world.\n  Once again, I thank my colleague from Nebraska for recognizing the \nimportance of this special order this morning as we talk about global \nclimate change and its importance to our\n\n[[Page S3246]]\n\ncountry and to our friends and neighbors around the world.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senate is in morning business; is that \nnot correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. And the minority leader has 1 hour under his control?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent to yield myself 15 minutes of the \nhour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/20/senate-section/article/S3240-4", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3240-S3246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       U.N. GLOBAL CLIMATE TREATY\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, last month the U.N. global climate treaty \nbecame available for the formal signatures of those countries who \nreached\n\n[[Page S3241]]\n\nagreement in Kyoto, Japan, in December. President Clinton has not \nsigned the treaty. There is speculation, however, that he may sign the \ntreaty this week.\n  Today we remind the President that the U.N. global climate treaty \ndoes not meet the standards clearly established by the U.S. Senate in \nits 95-0 vote last year on the Byrd-Hagel resolution, Senate Resolution \n98. The President should not sign any treaty until that treaty complies \nwith Senate Resolution 98 in its entirety.\n  The administration completely ignored the strong position of the \nSenate when it agreed to this treaty last December.\n  I led the Senate observer group delegation to Kyoto, Japan, in \nDecember. After Vice President Gore came to Kyoto and instructed our \nnegotiators to show ``increased flexibility,'' the doors were thrown \nopen and the objective became very clear. The objective was: Let us get \na deal at any cost. The clear advice of the U.S. Senate and the \neconomic well-being of the American people were abandoned under \npressure from the U.N. bureaucrats, international environmentalists and \nthe 134 developing countries that were not even included--not even \nincluded--in the treaty. The United States of America was the only \nNation to come out of these negotiations worse than it came in. In \nfact, there was no negotiation in Kyoto; there was only surrender.\n  When the Senate voted last year on the Byrd-Hagel resolution, it was \nvery clear as to what the resolution said.\n  First, it directed the President not to sign any treaty that placed \nlegally binding obligations on the United States to limit or reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions unless--unless--and I quote directly from S. \nRes. 98 passed last year by this body 95-0--\n\n       . . . unless the protocol or agreement also mandates new \n     specific scheduled commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse \n     gas emissions [for all nations] for Developing Country \n     Parties within the same compliance period.\n\n  Meaning simply that if this was a global problem, it required a \nglobal solution. All nations had to be bound by legally binding \nmandates, not just the United States and the other developed nations. \nThe message was simple. There was no ambiguity. This was not the \nadministration's nebulous definition of ``meaningful participation'' \nfor developing countries. This word of the Senate was quite clear.\n  The Kyoto Protocol does not include a single developing nation. The \nKyoto Protocol agreed to by the United States in December does not \ninclude a single developing country; 134 developing nations, including \nChina, Mexico, India, Brazil, and South Korea, many of whom compete \nfiercely--fiercely--with the United States for trade opportunities, are \ncompletely exempt from any obligations or responsibilities for reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions.\n  During a recent hearing in the Foreign Relations Committee, \nUndersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat, the lead U.S. negotiator in \nKyoto, admitted the administration failed on this account. Secretary \nEizenstat said--and I quote the Undersecretary--``You're absolutely \nright; we did not get binding commitments [from any] developing \ncountries.''\n\n  The second requirement of the Byrd-Hagel resolution speaks directly \nto the impact this treaty would have on the American people. And it, \ntoo--it too--fell victim in Kyoto. Senate Resolution 98 stated that the \nPresident should not sign any treaty which ``. . . would result in \nserious harm to the economy of the United States.''\n  The Kyoto Protocol would legally bind the United States to reduce our \ngreenhouse gas emissions to 7 percent below 1990 levels by the years \n2008 to 2012. It even goes much further than the President's own bottom \nline that he personally announced last October when President Clinton \npledged he would not accept a baseline below 1990 levels in greenhouse \ngas emissions, and he said there must be ``meaningful participation'' \nfrom all developing countries.\n  Numerous independent economic studies predicted serious economic harm \neven if the administration had held to its position that it enunciated \nlast October. These studies found job losses in the range of over 2 \nmillion, large increases in energy costs, a 50-cent increase in gas \nprices per gallon, a drop in economic growth rates of more than 1 \npercent a year, and major American industries being driven out of \nbusiness or driven out of the United States--industries like steel, \naluminum, petroleum refining, chemicals, iron, paper products, and \ncement.\n  That is why American agriculture, American labor, American business \nand industry and many consumer groups have all united in opposition--in \nopposition--to this treaty. Yet, our negotiators in Kyoto--the ones who \nwere supposed to be looking out for the American people--agreed to a \ntreaty that would have had an even more devastating impact on the U.S. \neconomy and on the lives of the American people.\n  The administration's recent anemic attempt to develop an economic \nanalysis showing ``minimal'' harm to the U.S. economy is laughable. It \nis truly laughable. No models, no numbers, no percentages, no \neconomics. It is laughable. It is based on fabrication and vapor, on a \nwildly optimistic assumption--as an example, China, India and Mexico \nagreeing to the binding commitments in this treaty. That is nonsense, \nMr. President. These very nations blocked language in Kyoto, Japan, \nlast year that would have allowed developing countries to even \nvoluntarily--voluntarily--undertake the obligations of this treaty. \nThey will never agree to binding commitments, and have so stated.\n  Even from an environmental standpoint, the Kyoto Protocol is a \nfailure. This Wednesday is Earth Day, and some will undoubtedly attempt \nto hold up this treaty as an example of a significant accomplishment to \nhelp our environment. The truth is, this treaty is so flawed that it \nwill do virtually nothing to slow the growth of manmade greenhouse \ngasses in the atmosphere. Even if one accepts the validity of the \nscience on global warming, which is still uncertain and at best \ncontradictory, this treaty would do nothing to stop any of these \nemissions. The Kyoto Protocol excludes the very developing nations who \nwill be responsible for more than 60 percent of the world's manmade \ngreenhouse gas emissions early in the next century.\n  China will be the world's largest emitter of manmade greenhouse \ngasses by the year 2015. On February 13 of this year, the Washington \nPost reported, ``But even if the accord is ratified and fully \nimplemented, it would barely dent the world's output of manmade \ngreenhouse gasses * * * .'' This treaty makes no sense. It is folly, \ncomplete folly.\n  Yet, the administration has made it clear that President Clinton \nintends to sign this treaty at some point during the period it is open \nfor signature between now and next March. The administration has also \nmade it very clear that it understands the treaty has no chance of \nratification in the Senate and that it intends to withhold this treaty \nfrom Senate consideration. The President claims that the treaty is, in \nhis words, ``a work in progress.'' This leaves people with the mistaken \nimpression that the treaty remains under negotiation and that \nobjectionable parts of the treaty can be negotiated away before it is \nsubmitted to the Senate. Mr. President, this is not the case. This is \nnot the case. Why would anyone sign a legally binding treaty they \nconsider a work in progress? That is complete nonsense.\n  This treaty cannot be amended until it goes into force, and even \nthen, only by a three-quarters vote of all countries that have become \nparty to the protocol. The 134 developing countries that would not even \nvoluntarily sign on to this, which are not bound by any emissions \nlimits, make up more than the three-quarters of the world's nations. \nHence, they control any amendment to this treaty. The countries that \nhave no obligations in this treaty are the very nations that dictate \nand enforce its terms. This is outrageous.\n  My coauthor of S. Res. 98, Senator Byrd of West Virginia, said \nrecently on the floor of the Senate that the Kyoto Protocol did not \nmeet either of the Senate standards laid out in the Byrd-Hagel \nresolution. Senator Byrd said, ``I hope that the President will not \nsign his name to the protocol at this point * * * I am concerned that \nif the President signs this protocol at this point, it will compromise \nhis flexibility in dealing with the developing countries over the next \nyear.''\n\n[[Page S3242]]\n\n  Senator Byrd is absolutely correct. It makes no sense to sign a \nflawed treaty, thereby giving away our leverage and our negotiating \nstrength. If the President believes this treaty is good enough to sign, \nit should be good enough, Mr. President, to submit to the Senate for an \nhonest and open debate. The American people have a right to know \nexactly what obligations the United States would have under this \ntreaty.\n  Members of the Senate and the House will remain actively engaged in \nthis issue. Oversight hearings will continue. We will continue to hold \nhearings this year to ensure that the administration does not attempt \nto implement this treaty or any part of this treaty prior to Senate \nratification through Executive order, budget fiat, or regulatory \naction.\n  During the Foreign Relations Committee hearing in February, I asked \nSecretary Eizenstat about any attempts to implement this treaty prior \nto Senate ratification. He replied, ``We have no intention through the \nback door or anything else, without Senate confirmation, of trying to \nimpose or take any steps to impose what would be binding restrictions \non our companies, on our industry, on our business, on our agriculture, \non our commerce, or on our country until and unless the Senate of the \nUnited States says so.'' That is Secretary Eizenstat.\n  Mr. President, we will hold the Clinton administration to its word. \nRecent news reports, however, have brought to light a very dishonest \nattempt by the EPA to impose carbon emissions caps through the \nderegulation of the electric industry. I was glad to see that the \nadministration dropped this nonsense from its final electric \nderegulation proposal. There will be no implementation of this treaty \nbefore ratification by the Senate of the United States.\n  The Senate's bottom line, as represented in the unanimous 95-0 vote \non S. Res. 98, remains unchanged. The U.S. Senate will not support the \nratification of the Kyoto treaty because it does not include binding \ncommitments by the developing nations and does serious harm to the U.S. \neconomy.\n  This has become an economic treaty, not an environmental treaty, and \nit is a bad treaty for America. So bad that it will not be ratified by \nthis body.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, Wednesday is Earth Day--a good time to \nreflect on our responsibilities to preserve and protect the environment \nthat we will pass on to our children and grandchildren.\n  I have six children, and, at last count, eleven grandchildren. I \nobviously care about the environment they will grow up in.\n  I am encouraged by the fact that the air we breathe and the water \nthat flows though America's rivers are far cleaner today than they were \non the first Earth Day in 1970. You might not know that is the case if \nyou listen exclusively to the gloom and doom pronouncements of many \ninstitutional environmental groups.\n  Sometimes, these groups place my name on a list or issue a ``report \ncard'' on my voting record that might lead one to believe that I do not \ncare about the environment. This is, of course, nonsense. You cannot \nhave eleven grand kids at the center of your life while working to \nshortchange the environment.\n  Having said that, I must join my colleagues in reporting to the \nSenate that Vice President Gore returned from Kyoto with a climate \ntreaty so fatally flawed that it will never be ratified by the Senate \nor enter into force. Nor should it.\n  While the climate issue must be taken seriously, the Senate would be \nshirking its constitutional responsibilities if it were to ratify a \ntreaty that is so blatantly unfair, economically burdensome, and of no \nbenefit to the environment.\n  The unfairness of the treaty lies mainly in its exclusion of \n``developing'' nations such as China, India, South Korea and Mexico. \nEmissions from these nations will exceed ours in about 15 years, and \ntheir exclusion will only encourage the shift of manufacturing (and \nresulting emissions) from the nations subject to controls to the \nnations that are not. Thus, global emissions would not decrease. Since \ndeveloping nations are less energy-efficient than we are, emissions \nmight even increase. Under the treaty there would be no global \nenvironmental gain--but America would suffer economic pain.\n  According to the respected economic firm Wharton Econometrics, the \nKyoto Treaty would reduce Gross Domestic Product by more than $2,000 \nper household in 2010--and $30,000 per household between 2001-2020. \nMoreover, 2.5 million Americans would lose their jobs. Since the \nclimate change problem will one day be addressed through technological \ninnovation fostered in a healthy economic environment, the last thing \nwe want to do is adopt a treaty that would create a national economic \ndecline reminiscent of the oil shocks of the 1970s.\n  If we are truly concerned about carbon emissions, we will revitalize \nnuclear energy and hydropower--our only large-scale, base-load sources \nof carbon free electricity. Nuclear energy generates 22% of our \nelectricity, and hydropower adds an additional 11%. Solar and wind \nenergy, in comparison, fill one-tenth of one percent of our total \nenergy needs. Although solar and wind energy will grow, the immutable \nlaws of physics limit that growth to just a few percent. Presidential \ninitiatives to place solar panels on a million roofs around the country \nmay have symbolic value, but what is the administration doing to \npromote nuclear and hydropower--the carbon-free emission sources that \ncan really make a difference?\n  Unfortunately, the President opposes the nuclear waste bill that has \npassed the Senate twice by a wide, bipartisan margin. Any failure to \naddress the nuclear waste issue will result in the premature closure of \nnuclear power plants, whose capacity will be replaced with carbon-\nemitting, fossil-fuel plants.\n  Bruce Babbitt aspires to be the first Interior Secretary to tear down \nhydropower dams. Additionally, other dams around the country are \nendangered by a cumbersome regulatory process that can make it cheaper \nto tear down the dam and purchase fossil-fuel generated power rather \nthan endure the ordeal of relicensing before the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission.\n  On the international energy front, administration policy is in \nopposition to China's Three Gorges hydroelectric project--the \nalternative to which is thirty six new carbon-belching 500 megawatt \ncoal plants. Is this part of a consistent carbon reduction strategy? In \nan intellectual contortion that defies common sense, Administration \nenergy policy is anti-nuclear and anti-hydropower while professing to \nbe anti-carbon. To appreciate that, one only needs to read the \nPresident's Climate Initiative unveiled last October. Nuclear energy \nisn't even mentioned, and hydropower is explicitly discounted in the \ndocument's exclusive discussion of ``non-hydro'' renewable energy.\n  What is the President's answer? The President's strategy is to push \nthe issue off to someone else's watch. The Kyoto Treaty doesn't require \ncarbon reductions until the year 2008.\n  Meanwhile, by agreeing to a fatally flawed treaty in Kyoto, the Vice \nPresident revealed his own Achilles' heel--he can't say no to any \nenvironmental cause, even if it directly harms U.S. interests and jobs \nhere at home. Kyoto has exposed that weakness, and now it is the \nSenate's Constitutional responsibility to ensure that a bad treaty will \nnever be ratified.\n  Ninety-five Senators rarely agree on anything--but they agreed with \npassage of the Byrd-Hagel resolution that any climate treaty must be \nglobally applied, without harm to our economy. In the case of the Kyoto \ntreaty, the President failed to take our advice--so he cannot expect to \nreceive our consent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I have just returned from a very enjoyable time of \ntraveling around Wyoming, attending town meetings, going to school \nclassrooms, pounding a little bit on a Habitat for Humanity house.\n  When I left Wyoming, it was snowing. But the folks in Wyoming \nunderstand that if there hadn't been a little bit of global warming, we \nwould be under about 300 feet of ice. So they may not be as concerned \nas perhaps some other places in the world, but I want to talk today a \nlittle bit about the global warming treaty as well. I went to the \ntreaty conference in Kyoto. I went\n\n[[Page S3243]]\n\nwith Senator Hagel and a couple of other Senators. The purpose of our \ntrip was to convey the importance of the Byrd-Hagel resolution.\n  We went over there to talk about a resolution that passed this Senate \n95-0. That is a pretty clear message, and it was also a very simple \nmessage. The developing nations have to participate in the treaty and \nthe treaty cannot result in serious harm to the U.S. economy. I have to \nsay the treaty fails. It is unfair. The benefits are unclear. The costs \nare unknown, and the administration is unresponsive to our requests for \ninformation.\n  Kyoto was titled ``a global warming'' conference, but I have to say \nit was an economic conference disguised as an environmental conference. \nWhile we were over there, we got to meet with the Chinese delegation. \nThe Chinese, by the year 2010, will be the world's largest polluter, \nunquestionably. We wanted to know what they intended to do about that. \nThey said nothing, they are a developing nation. We asked them what \ntheir definition was of a ``developing nation'' so that we would know \nwhen they would no longer be a developing nation. They said, ``We will \nalways be a developing nation.'' We asked them if they would do \nvoluntary restraints on their pollution. They said no. We asked, How \nabout voluntary restraints at some future unspecified date? I don't \nknow how you can make any negotiation looser than that. Their answer \nwas no.\n\n  We also got to hear from some of the island nations that are refusing \nto be a part of any voluntary restraints. Island nations. We are \ntalking about nations that, if global warming is true, the polar icecap \nwill melt and their island will be inundated with water; they will \ndisappear as a country. They said they would not be a part of it, that \nthey were a developing nation and they didn't need to do it. To me, \nthat is the best evidence that there isn't global warming.\n  There is no consensus on global warming. Some scientists argue that \nthe carbon dioxide in global warming is even good. The important thing \nis that we are already doing more than others. We are doing more \nwithout recognition. We are doing more without penalties. We are doing \nmore because it is the right thing to do. But this was an economic \nconference disguised as an environmental conference. It was a \nconference where we lose.\n  I remember an incident in the Northwest, near my home up in \nWashington, where we got concerned about the spotted owl, that it was \nheaded for certain extinction. We halted the Northwest logging \nindustry. We put an entire industry and its employees out of work. Our \nnational forests were left unmanaged, and they are now a big tinderbox; \nthey burn whenever lightning strikes. It is not very good stewardship \nwhen we are wasting what we have. After all this, we have discovered \nthat this timid little bird has been building nests in billboards by \nthe highways and they are undisturbed by the passing cars and trucks.\n  A part of our economy moved to other countries where they don't have \nthe environmental laws. Logging moved to Siberia. Russian loggers are \ntearing down 10 million acres of forest each year. In our effort to \nsave the spotted owl, we have wiped out the Siberian tiger. We have to \nbe careful with the consequences of what we are promoting.\n  The Vice President believes we can get rid of coal and use clean \nenergy, like wind. I have to tell you, there are few places that are \nwindier than the little belt that goes across southern Wyoming. It is \nup in the high plains, where the wind doesn't have any trees to block \nit. We have tried some wind experiments there. They built a generator, \nonly to have the wind velocity blow the rotors off. I asked the \nenvironmentalists, what about wind energy, what is the potential for \nthat? It only makes up one-third of 1 percent of our country's energy \nuse at the present time. Their response was that it will kill the bald \neagles; the eagles will fly into the generators and get chopped up. Not \na good solution. I asked about water. Well, water changes the nature of \nthe fish that use it, if we use it for hydraulic power. Nuclear power--\nwe don't even have to talk about nuclear power and the problems \nsupposed to be caused by it and the way that we haven't met our energy \nrequirements for the storage of nuclear waste.\n  The biggest thing that disturbed me about the Kyoto trip was that we \nwent there without the data we requested. Before we went to Kyoto, we \nmade it clear that there was information which we were certain any good \nnegotiators would be gathering to use for their case. We still haven't \ngotten that. When we went over there, we talked about a 1990 date and \nmaintaining the levels that we had in 1990. Our negotiators allowed the \nother countries to relax the criteria they had already agreed to \nwhile we made ours more difficult. Marvelous negotiating. They never \ndid answer the questions about the kind of administration that would be \nnecessary, the kind of bureaucracy that we build internationally, what \nkind of regulations, and to whom the United States would be subject. We \ndidn't talk about the pollution topic, and that is going to be \ninvolved.\n\n  I do remember, from some of the discussion of the Chinese, that they \nhad a solution for penalties. There ought to be penalties for those \ndeveloping nations that could not meet their criteria, and their idea \nwas that the penalties then would be distributed to those developing \nnations on the basis of population. Now, there is negotiation.\n  Numbers. We still don't have numbers. I put in an amendment last year \non the foreign operations spending bill. It asked for the numbers that \nthe administration has been collecting on global warming: How many \nAmerican jobs would be lost with the treaty? How much will it cost the \ntaxpayers to pay for Federal programs? What Federal programs will be \nneeded? We haven't received an answer. Apparently, none of the agencies \ninvolved can say how much they are going to spend on climate change.\n  This lack of accountability is a disgrace. The taxpayers should be \noutraged. Maybe we ought to sic some of those IRS auditors on the \nOffice of Management and Budget until we get the numbers we asked for a \nyear ago. Nobody knows exactly how much will be needed, where it is \ngoing, or what the purpose of it will be. Now, according to the numbers \nI am reading, that ought to be about a $6 billion to $10 billion \nviolation of the Government Performance and Results Act.\n  Yes, we have a law that says that the Government agencies are \nsupposed to tell us what they are doing. Here is the important part. \nThey are supposed to tell us how we can tell if it is getting done. And \nthen it is supposed to be reflected in their budgets so that we can see \nthat what they said they were going to do will get done within the \nconstraints of the money that is there. Somewhere the numbers have to \nbe available for what global warming--no, for what the administration's \nproposal of anti-economic development will cost us.\n  It is time for the administration to tell us exactly how much, how it \nis going to be done, if there will be incentives or just penalties, how \nwill it administer it and give a little bit of credit to those that are \nalready working the problem without the international treaty. Americans \nhave a right to know where their tax dollars are going. This last week, \nthe American people spent their tax dollars, sent their tax dollars, \nwill be audited on their tax dollars. It is time that we audit the \nFederal Government on the use of those tax dollars and hold them to the \n95-0 treaty that protects American jobs, and make sure that if we say \nwe are going to do a job, we are able to do the job. We owe it to the \nAmerican people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, it is great to be back from our recess and \nonce again to convene the Senate in the work of the citizens of this \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, let me, first of all, recognize my colleague from \nNebraska and my colleague from Wyoming and, for the record, praise them \nfor the leadership they have demonstrated on the most critical issue \nthat we address here on the floor this morning. Senator Hagel has \nbecome the Senate's leader, along with Senator Byrd of West Virginia, \non this issue of climate change and trying to convince the \nAdministration, and I think some of our critics, that the course this \nAdministration\n\n[[Page S3244]]\n\npursues is not only unrealistic, it really is unjustified. Both Senator \nHagel and Senator Enzi, as was recognized by the Senator from Wyoming, \nwere in Kyoto to watch as this Administration negotiated and began to \nwork on some form of protocol.\n  I think we three Senators join on the floor this morning proud that \nduring this century our Nation has developed into the strongest \neconomic and military power ever to exist on the face of the Earth. Our \ndemocratic system of government, which ensures unparalleled freedom for \nits citizens, is the envy of the world. All of us in this body are \nentrusted with the responsibility to protect and enhance that very \nstature.\n  Because I feel so strongly about that responsibility, it is with the \nmost chilling concern that I comment today on the President's \ncontemplated signing of the Kyoto Protocol on Global Climate Change. \nDespite grave bipartisan warnings from the Congress since the \nconclusion of the U.N. Global Climate Summit in Kyoto, the President \ninsists on committing our country to an agreement that I believe \nthreatens our way of life; indeed, it threatens the heart of our \nNation's power--and the American economy.\n  I, like many of my Senate colleagues, am confounded as to why the \nPresident is contemplating signing this agreement. I can only hope that \nit is not simply misguided loyalty to the Vice President, who every \nAmerican knows is the main protagonist in this ill-conceived campaign \nto avoid what he calls ``an imminent environmental holocaust'' caused \nby global warming.\n  Let me repeat those words. Catch the flavor and the emotional ring of \n``an imminent environmental holocaust.'' If anybody stood on the street \ncorner of America and spoke with those terms, surely they would catch \nthe attention of some. When the Vice President speaks in those terms, \nhe catches the attention of many. There is only one problem with that \nkind of rhetoric. Few, if any, scientists today believe that the world \nis facing an environmental holocaust from global warming, much less an \nimminent one.\n  In fact, as more and more American scientists review the available \ndata on global warming, it is becoming increasingly clear that the vast \nmajority believe the commitments for reduction of greenhouse gas \nemissions made by the Administration in the Kyoto Protocol is an \nunnecessary response to an exaggerated threat--``to an exaggerated \nthreat'' that the Vice President himself is caught up in making. \nIndeed, just today more than 15,000 scientists, two-thirds with \nadvanced academic degrees, released a petition they signed urging the \nUnited States to reject the Kyoto Protocol. The petition, expressly \nstates that:\n\n       There is no convincing scientific evidence that human \n     release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gases \n     is causing or will cause catastrophic heating of the Earth's \n     atmosphere and disruption of the Earth's climate.\n\n  Mr. President, why must the United States be a party to an agreement \nthat will substantially and negatively affect our economy, change our \nway of life, and potentially weaken our ability to maintain the world's \nmost powerful military without sufficient scientific evidence of \nimpending doom--sufficient scientific evidence of impending doom? I \nsubmit that this Administration has yet to adequately answer that \nquestion. The President of the United States, over anyone else in our \ncountry, must answer that question.\n  Even if we were to ignore the scientific evidence and assume that the \nworld is facing an imminent environmental problem, this agreement does \nnothing to avoid the threat. Bert Bolin, a Swedish meteorologist and \nthe outgoing chairman of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange, recently said that ``[t]he Kyoto conference did not achieve \nmuch with regard to limiting the buildup of greenhouse gases in the \natmosphere.''--The Washington Post, February 13, 1998\n  Therefore, I ask again: Why is the President going to sign this \nagreement, which, if ratified in its current form, will raise the costs \nfor nearly everything in a typical American budget, in both the short \nterm and long term?\n  The Administration has attempted to relieve our economic concerns \nwith a superficial analysis that presents a simplistic view of how \nAmerican industry can adapt to new economic challenges and includes \nassumptions about the success of emission trading proposals that are \nuntested in the international arena. This so-called economic analysis \nis contained in a 20-page paper by Janet Yellen, the Chairman of the \nPresident's Council of Economic Advisers, submitted as testimony to the \nHouse Commerce Committee and the Senate Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  However, in testimony recently given before the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee examining the Kyoto Agreement, Mary Novak, senior vice \npresident of a respected economic forecasting forum --you have heard of \nthem--called Wharton Econometrics Forecasting Associates, well-known \nworldwide for its expertise, stated that the Administration's economic \nanalysis of the impact of the Kyoto Agreement is terribly flawed--not \npossibly flawed, not flawed in limited ways, but terribly flawed. Ms. \nNovak predicted that the total U.S. cost of meeting the Kyoto Agreement \nwould be $250 billion, or a loss of 3.2 percent of gross domestic \nproduct. In addition, Ms. Novak stated that about 2.5 million jobs \nwould be lost, and the annual expense per family would exceed $2,700 a \nyear.\n  If the Senate of the United States were, at this moment, \ncontemplating an income tax increase that would increase the average \nfamily's taxes by $2,700, and if we passed it, very few, if any, of us \nwould withstand the public outcry, let alone the voters at the ballot \nbox in November. Yet, this President, because he thinks he can hide it \nthrough the processes of time and the procedure of international \nagreement, is proposing just that. That is what the WEFA says--an \nannual expense per family to exceed $2,700.\n  Mr. President, if this administration were sincere about reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions, we would have seen in the President's budget \nproposal strong support for an array of reliable electric energy that \nwe all know has a benign impact on the very environment that we all \ncherish and want to protect. Conspicuously absent from the President's \nClimate Change Technology Initiative was any support for nuclear or \nhydroelectric power. In fact, the President and the Vice President are \nhostile to nuclear and hydroelectric power. This very Administration \nhas initiatives that will ultimately grind nuclear energy generation to \na halt and would restrict us from any further development of hydro, let \nalone maintaining the status quo. Yet, both of these sources of power, \nas we know, do not produce one single molecule of greenhouse gas \nemissions into our atmosphere. Indeed, it is hard to imagine a cleaner \nsource of power than falling water, or nuclear fission.\n  What about the sincerity of this Administration's commitment to our \nNation's global competitiveness?\n  I was watching television yesterday catching the news shows and talk \nshows discussing the American economy. Many pundits were concerned \nabout the aggressiveness of the stock market. Well, concerned, yet \nhappy; but will this happiness last? We are surely concerned about the \neconomics of the Pacific rim at this moment; and, nearly every \neconomist on these shows were talking about the power of the current \neconomy of the United States, how it pulls other economies with us, and \nthat we continue to expect growth in the coming year; growth of about \n2.5 percent, growth very similar to the kind we had last year. And, \nwhile we are talking about that, while we recognize that our \ncompetitiveness in the global environment drives the global market, we \nhave an Administration that is tinkering around with the idea of \nrestricting the ability of our country to lead economically and to help \nout all other nations of the world with their own economic problems.\n  Mr. President, our Nation's agricultural industry is one of several \nindustries that will be adversely affected by the requirements of the \nKyoto Agreement. American agriculture has evolved with the rapid \nadoption of new technology; it is both highly capital and energy \nintensive. Energy use in both direct and indirect ways, including the \nfuel and lubricants for machinery and vehicles, the natural gas used to \ndry crops and pump irrigation water, and the electricity used in a wide \nvariety of ways, has caused the American agricultural economy to be the \nmost competitive and the most\n\n[[Page S3245]]\n\nproductive in the world. We use fertilizer and pesticides, all \ncontaining large energy components. For these reasons, our agricultural \nsystem is very sensitive to the kinds of changes the Vice President and \nthe President are proposing. American farmers buy $166 billion worth of \ninputs and services, sell about $212 billion worth of products and \nservices, and receive just about $54 billion in cash income to cover \ncosts and provide incentives for future investment. Moreover, American \nagriculture is deeply integrated into the world economy and depends on \nmore than $60 billion in export sales--the fastest growing market for \nour food and our fiber products.\n\n  That is just one example of an economy in this country that helps set \nthe pace for the world.\n  The Kyoto Agreement would cause fertilizer prices to go up, and while \nthe President says carbon taxes are not a part of his plan to meet the \ntreaty's requirements, the administration intends to pressure fossil \nfuel prices through other ways that would have the impact of burdensome \ntax increases. One of the results of the Administration's approach to \ncompliance will be higher costs for diesel fuel for trucks and \ntractors.\n  It takes no genius to understand what that means: Increased costs for \nfarmers, which translates into increased costs for food and finished \ngoods at the grocery store. In addition, since most products are \ndelivered by diesel-powered trucks, nearly every item in nearly every \nstore in America will cost more. And all of this will be done by an \nAdministration that pursues a policy which it has no strong scientific \nor economic basis or logical reason to pursue.\n  One of the many potential tragedies of this treaty would be the \nhigher cost of food, not just for those who can afford it but for those \nwho cannot. And remember our Judeo-Christian ethic as a country, the \nhundreds of millions of dollars of food we send around the world to \npoor nations, to starving people. Could we afford to send more if it \ncost more? I doubt it. And yet that is exactly what the President \nproposes.\n  According to Data Resources, Inc., another respected economic \nforecasting firm, 37 percent of American households have less than \n$20,000 after-tax income and spend about 21.2 percent to more than 100 \npercent of after-tax income on food. For these families, the impact of \nAmerica's compliance with the Kyoto Agreement would be severe and very \nnegative.\n  Mr. President, I believe this will be the first time in the history \nof our country that a President has allowed foreign interests to \ncontrol and to limit the growth of the American economy.\n  Let me repeat that for the record because I believe, after our \nresearch, that is a pretty profound statement, not just coming from me \nbut coming from the historic records of our country, that this would be \nthe first time in our history that an American President has allowed \nforeign interests to control and limit the growth of the American \neconomy. Never before have we allowed foreign interests to dictate the \namount of energy Americans can use.\n  The Kyoto Agreement requires Americans to cut energy use by the year \n2010 to 7 percent below what it was using in 1990. That was just 8 \nyears ago.\n  This weekend, I was at a special school out in Idaho, a collection of \nbright young kids. They are developing an electric car. They are going \nto race it next week in a race in north Idaho, an electric car. But \nguess what. You have to use nuclear hydrocarbons to generate the \nelectricity that goes in the battery that powers the car that creates \nno pollution.\n  Get the message. No matter where you turn, whether it is fueling the \ncars for the great urban areas of our country that might be powered by \nelectricity in the future, that electricity still has to be generated. \nAnd a lot of bright people are trying to accomplish that, so we can \nreduce that kind of impact on our environment. And yet, Mr. President, \nyou are denying the ability to generate the energy by suggesting that \nwe progressively reduce our ability to consume.\n  Mr. President, to illustrate the emissions requirement of the \nAgreement, Jay Hakes, head of the Energy Information Administration--a \nstatistical arm of the Department of Energy--said in February testimony \nbefore the House Science Committee: ``A 7 percent reduction [below \nbaseline levels under the agreement] for energy-related carbon \nemissions alone would require a reduction of about 550 million metric \ntons of carbon in 2010, or about 31 percent,'' below current \nprojections. According to EIA data, the mark of 550 million metric tons \nis greater than the total carbon emissions produced by electricity \ngeneration in the United States for 1990 or 1996 which were 477 million \nmetric tons and 517 million metric tons, respectively.\n\n  So let me say to all Senators and to the American people, tonight, \nwalk around your house. Think about the light fixture you have just \nturned on, the appliance you have just turned off, the telephone device \nyou might make a call on, or the computer you will sit down to, to \ncommunicate anywhere in the world. Many of these things you have added \nto your home since 1990. Look at the car you drove home from work. And \nto the farmer who is out there on the plains and the farmlands of \nAmerica this very hour, that marvelously efficient diesel tractor that \nis pulling the plow and the drill to plant the crop that creates the \nabundant harvest that feeds not just the people of America but the \npeople of the world. All of those tools are a product of energy. In \nfact, Americans today are consuming more energy as the economy \ncontinues to grow, and we will need to consume more. We will need to \nturn on our lights and our computers. We will need our cars. In the \nfuture, they will be better and they will be cleaner, but they still \nmust consume energy.\n  The Administration knows this protocol is seriously flawed. In a news \nconference held in Kyoto, Japan, on December 8, 1997, Vice President Al \nGore acknowledged: ``We've said from the beginning that, in order to \nsend an agreement to the Senate, we must have meaningful participation \nby key developing countries.'' We now know that developing countries \ndid not sign the agreement. Is it fair to let these countries off the \nhook while we Americans are subject to such stringent requirements?\n  Here's what Stephen L. Miller, President of the Center for Energy and \nEconomic Development had to say about the Kyoto Treaty: ``The proposed \nKyoto treaty is like a card game where the deck is stacked. American \nworkers are being dealt a losing hand through the negotiating process. \nIn the end, there will be no real environmental benefit and America's \nworking families will be forced to pay higher energy and consumer costs \nwhile we export U.S. jobs to countries that are exempted from action \nunder the Treaty.''\n  So let us call once again upon our President to incorporate in this \nagreement developing nations, growth nations like China, Mexico, and \nIndia, that have simply walked away because they cannot be a part of an \nagreement that would cut back on the opportunity they are trying to \noffer their citizens.\n  Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, sign something that is a winning \nagreement for America. Sign something that promotes our economy, that \npromotes the environment of the world. Sign something that all \ncountries of the world can agree with. Please do not turn us away from \nthe kind of economic growth and development that all of our citizens \nexpect and demand. There is simply no compelling reason for our \ngovernment at this time to force Americans to take preventive measures \nof uncertain competence against a problem that may or may not lie in \nthe Earth's future.\n  The Administration carries a heavy burden of persuasion that the \nCO2 compliance measures contained in the Kyoto Agreement are \nworth the sacrifice it will require of the American people. We here in \nthe Senate must, and will, ensure that our nation's global economic \ncompetitiveness, our nation's military readiness, and our way of life, \nare not compromised merely to advance misguided political agendas.\n  It bears repeating--the Kyoto Agreement is flawed. It is based on \npolitic science and not lab science. And it is only through sound lab \nscience that we, working collectively together with our colleagues \naround the world, will produce a better world.\n  Once again, I thank my colleague from Nebraska for recognizing the \nimportance of this special order this morning as we talk about global \nclimate change and its importance to our\n\n[[Page S3246]]\n\ncountry and to our friends and neighbors around the world.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senate is in morning business; is that \nnot correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. And the minority leader has 1 hour under his control?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent to yield myself 15 minutes of the \nhour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/20/senate-section/article/S3240-4", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3240-S3246]\n                       U.N. GLOBAL CLIMATE TREATY\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, last month the U.N. global climate treaty \nbecame available for the formal signatures of those countries who \nreached\n\n[[Page S3241]]\n\nagreement in Kyoto, Japan, in December. President Clinton has not \nsigned the treaty. There is speculation, however, that he may sign the \ntreaty this week.\n  Today we remind the President that the U.N. global climate treaty \ndoes not meet the standards clearly established by the U.S. Senate in \nits 95-0 vote last year on the Byrd-Hagel resolution, Senate Resolution \n98. The President should not sign any treaty until that treaty complies \nwith Senate Resolution 98 in its entirety.\n  The administration completely ignored the strong position of the \nSenate when it agreed to this treaty last December.\n  I led the Senate observer group delegation to Kyoto, Japan, in \nDecember. After Vice President Gore came to Kyoto and instructed our \nnegotiators to show ``increased flexibility,'' the doors were thrown \nopen and the objective became very clear. The objective was: Let us get \na deal at any cost. The clear advice of the U.S. Senate and the \neconomic well-being of the American people were abandoned under \npressure from the U.N. bureaucrats, international environmentalists and \nthe 134 developing countries that were not even included--not even \nincluded--in the treaty. The United States of America was the only \nNation to come out of these negotiations worse than it came in. In \nfact, there was no negotiation in Kyoto; there was only surrender.\n  When the Senate voted last year on the Byrd-Hagel resolution, it was \nvery clear as to what the resolution said.\n  First, it directed the President not to sign any treaty that placed \nlegally binding obligations on the United States to limit or reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions unless--unless--and I quote directly from S. \nRes. 98 passed last year by this body 95-0--\n\n       . . . unless the protocol or agreement also mandates new \n     specific scheduled commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse \n     gas emissions [for all nations] for Developing Country \n     Parties within the same compliance period.\n\n  Meaning simply that if this was a global problem, it required a \nglobal solution. All nations had to be bound by legally binding \nmandates, not just the United States and the other developed nations. \nThe message was simple. There was no ambiguity. This was not the \nadministration's nebulous definition of ``meaningful participation'' \nfor developing countries. This word of the Senate was quite clear.\n  The Kyoto Protocol does not include a single developing nation. The \nKyoto Protocol agreed to by the United States in December does not \ninclude a single developing country; 134 developing nations, including \nChina, Mexico, India, Brazil, and South Korea, many of whom compete \nfiercely--fiercely--with the United States for trade opportunities, are \ncompletely exempt from any obligations or responsibilities for reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions.\n  During a recent hearing in the Foreign Relations Committee, \nUndersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat, the lead U.S. negotiator in \nKyoto, admitted the administration failed on this account. Secretary \nEizenstat said--and I quote the Undersecretary--``You're absolutely \nright; we did not get binding commitments [from any] developing \ncountries.''\n\n  The second requirement of the Byrd-Hagel resolution speaks directly \nto the impact this treaty would have on the American people. And it, \ntoo--it too--fell victim in Kyoto. Senate Resolution 98 stated that the \nPresident should not sign any treaty which ``. . . would result in \nserious harm to the economy of the United States.''\n  The Kyoto Protocol would legally bind the United States to reduce our \ngreenhouse gas emissions to 7 percent below 1990 levels by the years \n2008 to 2012. It even goes much further than the President's own bottom \nline that he personally announced last October when President Clinton \npledged he would not accept a baseline below 1990 levels in greenhouse \ngas emissions, and he said there must be ``meaningful participation'' \nfrom all developing countries.\n  Numerous independent economic studies predicted serious economic harm \neven if the administration had held to its position that it enunciated \nlast October. These studies found job losses in the range of over 2 \nmillion, large increases in energy costs, a 50-cent increase in gas \nprices per gallon, a drop in economic growth rates of more than 1 \npercent a year, and major American industries being driven out of \nbusiness or driven out of the United States--industries like steel, \naluminum, petroleum refining, chemicals, iron, paper products, and \ncement.\n  That is why American agriculture, American labor, American business \nand industry and many consumer groups have all united in opposition--in \nopposition--to this treaty. Yet, our negotiators in Kyoto--the ones who \nwere supposed to be looking out for the American people--agreed to a \ntreaty that would have had an even more devastating impact on the U.S. \neconomy and on the lives of the American people.\n  The administration's recent anemic attempt to develop an economic \nanalysis showing ``minimal'' harm to the U.S. economy is laughable. It \nis truly laughable. No models, no numbers, no percentages, no \neconomics. It is laughable. It is based on fabrication and vapor, on a \nwildly optimistic assumption--as an example, China, India and Mexico \nagreeing to the binding commitments in this treaty. That is nonsense, \nMr. President. These very nations blocked language in Kyoto, Japan, \nlast year that would have allowed developing countries to even \nvoluntarily--voluntarily--undertake the obligations of this treaty. \nThey will never agree to binding commitments, and have so stated.\n  Even from an environmental standpoint, the Kyoto Protocol is a \nfailure. This Wednesday is Earth Day, and some will undoubtedly attempt \nto hold up this treaty as an example of a significant accomplishment to \nhelp our environment. The truth is, this treaty is so flawed that it \nwill do virtually nothing to slow the growth of manmade greenhouse \ngasses in the atmosphere. Even if one accepts the validity of the \nscience on global warming, which is still uncertain and at best \ncontradictory, this treaty would do nothing to stop any of these \nemissions. The Kyoto Protocol excludes the very developing nations who \nwill be responsible for more than 60 percent of the world's manmade \ngreenhouse gas emissions early in the next century.\n  China will be the world's largest emitter of manmade greenhouse \ngasses by the year 2015. On February 13 of this year, the Washington \nPost reported, ``But even if the accord is ratified and fully \nimplemented, it would barely dent the world's output of manmade \ngreenhouse gasses * * * .'' This treaty makes no sense. It is folly, \ncomplete folly.\n  Yet, the administration has made it clear that President Clinton \nintends to sign this treaty at some point during the period it is open \nfor signature between now and next March. The administration has also \nmade it very clear that it understands the treaty has no chance of \nratification in the Senate and that it intends to withhold this treaty \nfrom Senate consideration. The President claims that the treaty is, in \nhis words, ``a work in progress.'' This leaves people with the mistaken \nimpression that the treaty remains under negotiation and that \nobjectionable parts of the treaty can be negotiated away before it is \nsubmitted to the Senate. Mr. President, this is not the case. This is \nnot the case. Why would anyone sign a legally binding treaty they \nconsider a work in progress? That is complete nonsense.\n  This treaty cannot be amended until it goes into force, and even \nthen, only by a three-quarters vote of all countries that have become \nparty to the protocol. The 134 developing countries that would not even \nvoluntarily sign on to this, which are not bound by any emissions \nlimits, make up more than the three-quarters of the world's nations. \nHence, they control any amendment to this treaty. The countries that \nhave no obligations in this treaty are the very nations that dictate \nand enforce its terms. This is outrageous.\n  My coauthor of S. Res. 98, Senator Byrd of West Virginia, said \nrecently on the floor of the Senate that the Kyoto Protocol did not \nmeet either of the Senate standards laid out in the Byrd-Hagel \nresolution. Senator Byrd said, ``I hope that the President will not \nsign his name to the protocol at this point * * * I am concerned that \nif the President signs this protocol at this point, it will compromise \nhis flexibility in dealing with the developing countries over the next \nyear.''\n\n[[Page S3242]]\n\n  Senator Byrd is absolutely correct. It makes no sense to sign a \nflawed treaty, thereby giving away our leverage and our negotiating \nstrength. If the President believes this treaty is good enough to sign, \nit should be good enough, Mr. President, to submit to the Senate for an \nhonest and open debate. The American people have a right to know \nexactly what obligations the United States would have under this \ntreaty.\n  Members of the Senate and the House will remain actively engaged in \nthis issue. Oversight hearings will continue. We will continue to hold \nhearings this year to ensure that the administration does not attempt \nto implement this treaty or any part of this treaty prior to Senate \nratification through Executive order, budget fiat, or regulatory \naction.\n  During the Foreign Relations Committee hearing in February, I asked \nSecretary Eizenstat about any attempts to implement this treaty prior \nto Senate ratification. He replied, ``We have no intention through the \nback door or anything else, without Senate confirmation, of trying to \nimpose or take any steps to impose what would be binding restrictions \non our companies, on our industry, on our business, on our agriculture, \non our commerce, or on our country until and unless the Senate of the \nUnited States says so.'' That is Secretary Eizenstat.\n  Mr. President, we will hold the Clinton administration to its word. \nRecent news reports, however, have brought to light a very dishonest \nattempt by the EPA to impose carbon emissions caps through the \nderegulation of the electric industry. I was glad to see that the \nadministration dropped this nonsense from its final electric \nderegulation proposal. There will be no implementation of this treaty \nbefore ratification by the Senate of the United States.\n  The Senate's bottom line, as represented in the unanimous 95-0 vote \non S. Res. 98, remains unchanged. The U.S. Senate will not support the \nratification of the Kyoto treaty because it does not include binding \ncommitments by the developing nations and does serious harm to the U.S. \neconomy.\n  This has become an economic treaty, not an environmental treaty, and \nit is a bad treaty for America. So bad that it will not be ratified by \nthis body.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, Wednesday is Earth Day--a good time to \nreflect on our responsibilities to preserve and protect the environment \nthat we will pass on to our children and grandchildren.\n  I have six children, and, at last count, eleven grandchildren. I \nobviously care about the environment they will grow up in.\n  I am encouraged by the fact that the air we breathe and the water \nthat flows though America's rivers are far cleaner today than they were \non the first Earth Day in 1970. You might not know that is the case if \nyou listen exclusively to the gloom and doom pronouncements of many \ninstitutional environmental groups.\n  Sometimes, these groups place my name on a list or issue a ``report \ncard'' on my voting record that might lead one to believe that I do not \ncare about the environment. This is, of course, nonsense. You cannot \nhave eleven grand kids at the center of your life while working to \nshortchange the environment.\n  Having said that, I must join my colleagues in reporting to the \nSenate that Vice President Gore returned from Kyoto with a climate \ntreaty so fatally flawed that it will never be ratified by the Senate \nor enter into force. Nor should it.\n  While the climate issue must be taken seriously, the Senate would be \nshirking its constitutional responsibilities if it were to ratify a \ntreaty that is so blatantly unfair, economically burdensome, and of no \nbenefit to the environment.\n  The unfairness of the treaty lies mainly in its exclusion of \n``developing'' nations such as China, India, South Korea and Mexico. \nEmissions from these nations will exceed ours in about 15 years, and \ntheir exclusion will only encourage the shift of manufacturing (and \nresulting emissions) from the nations subject to controls to the \nnations that are not. Thus, global emissions would not decrease. Since \ndeveloping nations are less energy-efficient than we are, emissions \nmight even increase. Under the treaty there would be no global \nenvironmental gain--but America would suffer economic pain.\n  According to the respected economic firm Wharton Econometrics, the \nKyoto Treaty would reduce Gross Domestic Product by more than $2,000 \nper household in 2010--and $30,000 per household between 2001-2020. \nMoreover, 2.5 million Americans would lose their jobs. Since the \nclimate change problem will one day be addressed through technological \ninnovation fostered in a healthy economic environment, the last thing \nwe want to do is adopt a treaty that would create a national economic \ndecline reminiscent of the oil shocks of the 1970s.\n  If we are truly concerned about carbon emissions, we will revitalize \nnuclear energy and hydropower--our only large-scale, base-load sources \nof carbon free electricity. Nuclear energy generates 22% of our \nelectricity, and hydropower adds an additional 11%. Solar and wind \nenergy, in comparison, fill one-tenth of one percent of our total \nenergy needs. Although solar and wind energy will grow, the immutable \nlaws of physics limit that growth to just a few percent. Presidential \ninitiatives to place solar panels on a million roofs around the country \nmay have symbolic value, but what is the administration doing to \npromote nuclear and hydropower--the carbon-free emission sources that \ncan really make a difference?\n  Unfortunately, the President opposes the nuclear waste bill that has \npassed the Senate twice by a wide, bipartisan margin. Any failure to \naddress the nuclear waste issue will result in the premature closure of \nnuclear power plants, whose capacity will be replaced with carbon-\nemitting, fossil-fuel plants.\n  Bruce Babbitt aspires to be the first Interior Secretary to tear down \nhydropower dams. Additionally, other dams around the country are \nendangered by a cumbersome regulatory process that can make it cheaper \nto tear down the dam and purchase fossil-fuel generated power rather \nthan endure the ordeal of relicensing before the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission.\n  On the international energy front, administration policy is in \nopposition to China's Three Gorges hydroelectric project--the \nalternative to which is thirty six new carbon-belching 500 megawatt \ncoal plants. Is this part of a consistent carbon reduction strategy? In \nan intellectual contortion that defies common sense, Administration \nenergy policy is anti-nuclear and anti-hydropower while professing to \nbe anti-carbon. To appreciate that, one only needs to read the \nPresident's Climate Initiative unveiled last October. Nuclear energy \nisn't even mentioned, and hydropower is explicitly discounted in the \ndocument's exclusive discussion of ``non-hydro'' renewable energy.\n  What is the President's answer? The President's strategy is to push \nthe issue off to someone else's watch. The Kyoto Treaty doesn't require \ncarbon reductions until the year 2008.\n  Meanwhile, by agreeing to a fatally flawed treaty in Kyoto, the Vice \nPresident revealed his own Achilles' heel--he can't say no to any \nenvironmental cause, even if it directly harms U.S. interests and jobs \nhere at home. Kyoto has exposed that weakness, and now it is the \nSenate's Constitutional responsibility to ensure that a bad treaty will \nnever be ratified.\n  Ninety-five Senators rarely agree on anything--but they agreed with \npassage of the Byrd-Hagel resolution that any climate treaty must be \nglobally applied, without harm to our economy. In the case of the Kyoto \ntreaty, the President failed to take our advice--so he cannot expect to \nreceive our consent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I have just returned from a very enjoyable time of \ntraveling around Wyoming, attending town meetings, going to school \nclassrooms, pounding a little bit on a Habitat for Humanity house.\n  When I left Wyoming, it was snowing. But the folks in Wyoming \nunderstand that if there hadn't been a little bit of global warming, we \nwould be under about 300 feet of ice. So they may not be as concerned \nas perhaps some other places in the world, but I want to talk today a \nlittle bit about the global warming treaty as well. I went to the \ntreaty conference in Kyoto. I went\n\n[[Page S3243]]\n\nwith Senator Hagel and a couple of other Senators. The purpose of our \ntrip was to convey the importance of the Byrd-Hagel resolution.\n  We went over there to talk about a resolution that passed this Senate \n95-0. That is a pretty clear message, and it was also a very simple \nmessage. The developing nations have to participate in the treaty and \nthe treaty cannot result in serious harm to the U.S. economy. I have to \nsay the treaty fails. It is unfair. The benefits are unclear. The costs \nare unknown, and the administration is unresponsive to our requests for \ninformation.\n  Kyoto was titled ``a global warming'' conference, but I have to say \nit was an economic conference disguised as an environmental conference. \nWhile we were over there, we got to meet with the Chinese delegation. \nThe Chinese, by the year 2010, will be the world's largest polluter, \nunquestionably. We wanted to know what they intended to do about that. \nThey said nothing, they are a developing nation. We asked them what \ntheir definition was of a ``developing nation'' so that we would know \nwhen they would no longer be a developing nation. They said, ``We will \nalways be a developing nation.'' We asked them if they would do \nvoluntary restraints on their pollution. They said no. We asked, How \nabout voluntary restraints at some future unspecified date? I don't \nknow how you can make any negotiation looser than that. Their answer \nwas no.\n\n  We also got to hear from some of the island nations that are refusing \nto be a part of any voluntary restraints. Island nations. We are \ntalking about nations that, if global warming is true, the polar icecap \nwill melt and their island will be inundated with water; they will \ndisappear as a country. They said they would not be a part of it, that \nthey were a developing nation and they didn't need to do it. To me, \nthat is the best evidence that there isn't global warming.\n  There is no consensus on global warming. Some scientists argue that \nthe carbon dioxide in global warming is even good. The important thing \nis that we are already doing more than others. We are doing more \nwithout recognition. We are doing more without penalties. We are doing \nmore because it is the right thing to do. But this was an economic \nconference disguised as an environmental conference. It was a \nconference where we lose.\n  I remember an incident in the Northwest, near my home up in \nWashington, where we got concerned about the spotted owl, that it was \nheaded for certain extinction. We halted the Northwest logging \nindustry. We put an entire industry and its employees out of work. Our \nnational forests were left unmanaged, and they are now a big tinderbox; \nthey burn whenever lightning strikes. It is not very good stewardship \nwhen we are wasting what we have. After all this, we have discovered \nthat this timid little bird has been building nests in billboards by \nthe highways and they are undisturbed by the passing cars and trucks.\n  A part of our economy moved to other countries where they don't have \nthe environmental laws. Logging moved to Siberia. Russian loggers are \ntearing down 10 million acres of forest each year. In our effort to \nsave the spotted owl, we have wiped out the Siberian tiger. We have to \nbe careful with the consequences of what we are promoting.\n  The Vice President believes we can get rid of coal and use clean \nenergy, like wind. I have to tell you, there are few places that are \nwindier than the little belt that goes across southern Wyoming. It is \nup in the high plains, where the wind doesn't have any trees to block \nit. We have tried some wind experiments there. They built a generator, \nonly to have the wind velocity blow the rotors off. I asked the \nenvironmentalists, what about wind energy, what is the potential for \nthat? It only makes up one-third of 1 percent of our country's energy \nuse at the present time. Their response was that it will kill the bald \neagles; the eagles will fly into the generators and get chopped up. Not \na good solution. I asked about water. Well, water changes the nature of \nthe fish that use it, if we use it for hydraulic power. Nuclear power--\nwe don't even have to talk about nuclear power and the problems \nsupposed to be caused by it and the way that we haven't met our energy \nrequirements for the storage of nuclear waste.\n  The biggest thing that disturbed me about the Kyoto trip was that we \nwent there without the data we requested. Before we went to Kyoto, we \nmade it clear that there was information which we were certain any good \nnegotiators would be gathering to use for their case. We still haven't \ngotten that. When we went over there, we talked about a 1990 date and \nmaintaining the levels that we had in 1990. Our negotiators allowed the \nother countries to relax the criteria they had already agreed to \nwhile we made ours more difficult. Marvelous negotiating. They never \ndid answer the questions about the kind of administration that would be \nnecessary, the kind of bureaucracy that we build internationally, what \nkind of regulations, and to whom the United States would be subject. We \ndidn't talk about the pollution topic, and that is going to be \ninvolved.\n\n  I do remember, from some of the discussion of the Chinese, that they \nhad a solution for penalties. There ought to be penalties for those \ndeveloping nations that could not meet their criteria, and their idea \nwas that the penalties then would be distributed to those developing \nnations on the basis of population. Now, there is negotiation.\n  Numbers. We still don't have numbers. I put in an amendment last year \non the foreign operations spending bill. It asked for the numbers that \nthe administration has been collecting on global warming: How many \nAmerican jobs would be lost with the treaty? How much will it cost the \ntaxpayers to pay for Federal programs? What Federal programs will be \nneeded? We haven't received an answer. Apparently, none of the agencies \ninvolved can say how much they are going to spend on climate change.\n  This lack of accountability is a disgrace. The taxpayers should be \noutraged. Maybe we ought to sic some of those IRS auditors on the \nOffice of Management and Budget until we get the numbers we asked for a \nyear ago. Nobody knows exactly how much will be needed, where it is \ngoing, or what the purpose of it will be. Now, according to the numbers \nI am reading, that ought to be about a $6 billion to $10 billion \nviolation of the Government Performance and Results Act.\n  Yes, we have a law that says that the Government agencies are \nsupposed to tell us what they are doing. Here is the important part. \nThey are supposed to tell us how we can tell if it is getting done. And \nthen it is supposed to be reflected in their budgets so that we can see \nthat what they said they were going to do will get done within the \nconstraints of the money that is there. Somewhere the numbers have to \nbe available for what global warming--no, for what the administration's \nproposal of anti-economic development will cost us.\n  It is time for the administration to tell us exactly how much, how it \nis going to be done, if there will be incentives or just penalties, how \nwill it administer it and give a little bit of credit to those that are \nalready working the problem without the international treaty. Americans \nhave a right to know where their tax dollars are going. This last week, \nthe American people spent their tax dollars, sent their tax dollars, \nwill be audited on their tax dollars. It is time that we audit the \nFederal Government on the use of those tax dollars and hold them to the \n95-0 treaty that protects American jobs, and make sure that if we say \nwe are going to do a job, we are able to do the job. We owe it to the \nAmerican people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, it is great to be back from our recess and \nonce again to convene the Senate in the work of the citizens of this \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, let me, first of all, recognize my colleague from \nNebraska and my colleague from Wyoming and, for the record, praise them \nfor the leadership they have demonstrated on the most critical issue \nthat we address here on the floor this morning. Senator Hagel has \nbecome the Senate's leader, along with Senator Byrd of West Virginia, \non this issue of climate change and trying to convince the \nAdministration, and I think some of our critics, that the course this \nAdministration\n\n[[Page S3244]]\n\npursues is not only unrealistic, it really is unjustified. Both Senator \nHagel and Senator Enzi, as was recognized by the Senator from Wyoming, \nwere in Kyoto to watch as this Administration negotiated and began to \nwork on some form of protocol.\n  I think we three Senators join on the floor this morning proud that \nduring this century our Nation has developed into the strongest \neconomic and military power ever to exist on the face of the Earth. Our \ndemocratic system of government, which ensures unparalleled freedom for \nits citizens, is the envy of the world. All of us in this body are \nentrusted with the responsibility to protect and enhance that very \nstature.\n  Because I feel so strongly about that responsibility, it is with the \nmost chilling concern that I comment today on the President's \ncontemplated signing of the Kyoto Protocol on Global Climate Change. \nDespite grave bipartisan warnings from the Congress since the \nconclusion of the U.N. Global Climate Summit in Kyoto, the President \ninsists on committing our country to an agreement that I believe \nthreatens our way of life; indeed, it threatens the heart of our \nNation's power--and the American economy.\n  I, like many of my Senate colleagues, am confounded as to why the \nPresident is contemplating signing this agreement. I can only hope that \nit is not simply misguided loyalty to the Vice President, who every \nAmerican knows is the main protagonist in this ill-conceived campaign \nto avoid what he calls ``an imminent environmental holocaust'' caused \nby global warming.\n  Let me repeat those words. Catch the flavor and the emotional ring of \n``an imminent environmental holocaust.'' If anybody stood on the street \ncorner of America and spoke with those terms, surely they would catch \nthe attention of some. When the Vice President speaks in those terms, \nhe catches the attention of many. There is only one problem with that \nkind of rhetoric. Few, if any, scientists today believe that the world \nis facing an environmental holocaust from global warming, much less an \nimminent one.\n  In fact, as more and more American scientists review the available \ndata on global warming, it is becoming increasingly clear that the vast \nmajority believe the commitments for reduction of greenhouse gas \nemissions made by the Administration in the Kyoto Protocol is an \nunnecessary response to an exaggerated threat--``to an exaggerated \nthreat'' that the Vice President himself is caught up in making. \nIndeed, just today more than 15,000 scientists, two-thirds with \nadvanced academic degrees, released a petition they signed urging the \nUnited States to reject the Kyoto Protocol. The petition, expressly \nstates that:\n\n       There is no convincing scientific evidence that human \n     release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gases \n     is causing or will cause catastrophic heating of the Earth's \n     atmosphere and disruption of the Earth's climate.\n\n  Mr. President, why must the United States be a party to an agreement \nthat will substantially and negatively affect our economy, change our \nway of life, and potentially weaken our ability to maintain the world's \nmost powerful military without sufficient scientific evidence of \nimpending doom--sufficient scientific evidence of impending doom? I \nsubmit that this Administration has yet to adequately answer that \nquestion. The President of the United States, over anyone else in our \ncountry, must answer that question.\n  Even if we were to ignore the scientific evidence and assume that the \nworld is facing an imminent environmental problem, this agreement does \nnothing to avoid the threat. Bert Bolin, a Swedish meteorologist and \nthe outgoing chairman of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange, recently said that ``[t]he Kyoto conference did not achieve \nmuch with regard to limiting the buildup of greenhouse gases in the \natmosphere.''--The Washington Post, February 13, 1998\n  Therefore, I ask again: Why is the President going to sign this \nagreement, which, if ratified in its current form, will raise the costs \nfor nearly everything in a typical American budget, in both the short \nterm and long term?\n  The Administration has attempted to relieve our economic concerns \nwith a superficial analysis that presents a simplistic view of how \nAmerican industry can adapt to new economic challenges and includes \nassumptions about the success of emission trading proposals that are \nuntested in the international arena. This so-called economic analysis \nis contained in a 20-page paper by Janet Yellen, the Chairman of the \nPresident's Council of Economic Advisers, submitted as testimony to the \nHouse Commerce Committee and the Senate Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  However, in testimony recently given before the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee examining the Kyoto Agreement, Mary Novak, senior vice \npresident of a respected economic forecasting forum --you have heard of \nthem--called Wharton Econometrics Forecasting Associates, well-known \nworldwide for its expertise, stated that the Administration's economic \nanalysis of the impact of the Kyoto Agreement is terribly flawed--not \npossibly flawed, not flawed in limited ways, but terribly flawed. Ms. \nNovak predicted that the total U.S. cost of meeting the Kyoto Agreement \nwould be $250 billion, or a loss of 3.2 percent of gross domestic \nproduct. In addition, Ms. Novak stated that about 2.5 million jobs \nwould be lost, and the annual expense per family would exceed $2,700 a \nyear.\n  If the Senate of the United States were, at this moment, \ncontemplating an income tax increase that would increase the average \nfamily's taxes by $2,700, and if we passed it, very few, if any, of us \nwould withstand the public outcry, let alone the voters at the ballot \nbox in November. Yet, this President, because he thinks he can hide it \nthrough the processes of time and the procedure of international \nagreement, is proposing just that. That is what the WEFA says--an \nannual expense per family to exceed $2,700.\n  Mr. President, if this administration were sincere about reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions, we would have seen in the President's budget \nproposal strong support for an array of reliable electric energy that \nwe all know has a benign impact on the very environment that we all \ncherish and want to protect. Conspicuously absent from the President's \nClimate Change Technology Initiative was any support for nuclear or \nhydroelectric power. In fact, the President and the Vice President are \nhostile to nuclear and hydroelectric power. This very Administration \nhas initiatives that will ultimately grind nuclear energy generation to \na halt and would restrict us from any further development of hydro, let \nalone maintaining the status quo. Yet, both of these sources of power, \nas we know, do not produce one single molecule of greenhouse gas \nemissions into our atmosphere. Indeed, it is hard to imagine a cleaner \nsource of power than falling water, or nuclear fission.\n  What about the sincerity of this Administration's commitment to our \nNation's global competitiveness?\n  I was watching television yesterday catching the news shows and talk \nshows discussing the American economy. Many pundits were concerned \nabout the aggressiveness of the stock market. Well, concerned, yet \nhappy; but will this happiness last? We are surely concerned about the \neconomics of the Pacific rim at this moment; and, nearly every \neconomist on these shows were talking about the power of the current \neconomy of the United States, how it pulls other economies with us, and \nthat we continue to expect growth in the coming year; growth of about \n2.5 percent, growth very similar to the kind we had last year. And, \nwhile we are talking about that, while we recognize that our \ncompetitiveness in the global environment drives the global market, we \nhave an Administration that is tinkering around with the idea of \nrestricting the ability of our country to lead economically and to help \nout all other nations of the world with their own economic problems.\n  Mr. President, our Nation's agricultural industry is one of several \nindustries that will be adversely affected by the requirements of the \nKyoto Agreement. American agriculture has evolved with the rapid \nadoption of new technology; it is both highly capital and energy \nintensive. Energy use in both direct and indirect ways, including the \nfuel and lubricants for machinery and vehicles, the natural gas used to \ndry crops and pump irrigation water, and the electricity used in a wide \nvariety of ways, has caused the American agricultural economy to be the \nmost competitive and the most\n\n[[Page S3245]]\n\nproductive in the world. We use fertilizer and pesticides, all \ncontaining large energy components. For these reasons, our agricultural \nsystem is very sensitive to the kinds of changes the Vice President and \nthe President are proposing. American farmers buy $166 billion worth of \ninputs and services, sell about $212 billion worth of products and \nservices, and receive just about $54 billion in cash income to cover \ncosts and provide incentives for future investment. Moreover, American \nagriculture is deeply integrated into the world economy and depends on \nmore than $60 billion in export sales--the fastest growing market for \nour food and our fiber products.\n\n  That is just one example of an economy in this country that helps set \nthe pace for the world.\n  The Kyoto Agreement would cause fertilizer prices to go up, and while \nthe President says carbon taxes are not a part of his plan to meet the \ntreaty's requirements, the administration intends to pressure fossil \nfuel prices through other ways that would have the impact of burdensome \ntax increases. One of the results of the Administration's approach to \ncompliance will be higher costs for diesel fuel for trucks and \ntractors.\n  It takes no genius to understand what that means: Increased costs for \nfarmers, which translates into increased costs for food and finished \ngoods at the grocery store. In addition, since most products are \ndelivered by diesel-powered trucks, nearly every item in nearly every \nstore in America will cost more. And all of this will be done by an \nAdministration that pursues a policy which it has no strong scientific \nor economic basis or logical reason to pursue.\n  One of the many potential tragedies of this treaty would be the \nhigher cost of food, not just for those who can afford it but for those \nwho cannot. And remember our Judeo-Christian ethic as a country, the \nhundreds of millions of dollars of food we send around the world to \npoor nations, to starving people. Could we afford to send more if it \ncost more? I doubt it. And yet that is exactly what the President \nproposes.\n  According to Data Resources, Inc., another respected economic \nforecasting firm, 37 percent of American households have less than \n$20,000 after-tax income and spend about 21.2 percent to more than 100 \npercent of after-tax income on food. For these families, the impact of \nAmerica's compliance with the Kyoto Agreement would be severe and very \nnegative.\n  Mr. President, I believe this will be the first time in the history \nof our country that a President has allowed foreign interests to \ncontrol and to limit the growth of the American economy.\n  Let me repeat that for the record because I believe, after our \nresearch, that is a pretty profound statement, not just coming from me \nbut coming from the historic records of our country, that this would be \nthe first time in our history that an American President has allowed \nforeign interests to control and limit the growth of the American \neconomy. Never before have we allowed foreign interests to dictate the \namount of energy Americans can use.\n  The Kyoto Agreement requires Americans to cut energy use by the year \n2010 to 7 percent below what it was using in 1990. That was just 8 \nyears ago.\n  This weekend, I was at a special school out in Idaho, a collection of \nbright young kids. They are developing an electric car. They are going \nto race it next week in a race in north Idaho, an electric car. But \nguess what. You have to use nuclear hydrocarbons to generate the \nelectricity that goes in the battery that powers the car that creates \nno pollution.\n  Get the message. No matter where you turn, whether it is fueling the \ncars for the great urban areas of our country that might be powered by \nelectricity in the future, that electricity still has to be generated. \nAnd a lot of bright people are trying to accomplish that, so we can \nreduce that kind of impact on our environment. And yet, Mr. President, \nyou are denying the ability to generate the energy by suggesting that \nwe progressively reduce our ability to consume.\n  Mr. President, to illustrate the emissions requirement of the \nAgreement, Jay Hakes, head of the Energy Information Administration--a \nstatistical arm of the Department of Energy--said in February testimony \nbefore the House Science Committee: ``A 7 percent reduction [below \nbaseline levels under the agreement] for energy-related carbon \nemissions alone would require a reduction of about 550 million metric \ntons of carbon in 2010, or about 31 percent,'' below current \nprojections. According to EIA data, the mark of 550 million metric tons \nis greater than the total carbon emissions produced by electricity \ngeneration in the United States for 1990 or 1996 which were 477 million \nmetric tons and 517 million metric tons, respectively.\n\n  So let me say to all Senators and to the American people, tonight, \nwalk around your house. Think about the light fixture you have just \nturned on, the appliance you have just turned off, the telephone device \nyou might make a call on, or the computer you will sit down to, to \ncommunicate anywhere in the world. Many of these things you have added \nto your home since 1990. Look at the car you drove home from work. And \nto the farmer who is out there on the plains and the farmlands of \nAmerica this very hour, that marvelously efficient diesel tractor that \nis pulling the plow and the drill to plant the crop that creates the \nabundant harvest that feeds not just the people of America but the \npeople of the world. All of those tools are a product of energy. In \nfact, Americans today are consuming more energy as the economy \ncontinues to grow, and we will need to consume more. We will need to \nturn on our lights and our computers. We will need our cars. In the \nfuture, they will be better and they will be cleaner, but they still \nmust consume energy.\n  The Administration knows this protocol is seriously flawed. In a news \nconference held in Kyoto, Japan, on December 8, 1997, Vice President Al \nGore acknowledged: ``We've said from the beginning that, in order to \nsend an agreement to the Senate, we must have meaningful participation \nby key developing countries.'' We now know that developing countries \ndid not sign the agreement. Is it fair to let these countries off the \nhook while we Americans are subject to such stringent requirements?\n  Here's what Stephen L. Miller, President of the Center for Energy and \nEconomic Development had to say about the Kyoto Treaty: ``The proposed \nKyoto treaty is like a card game where the deck is stacked. American \nworkers are being dealt a losing hand through the negotiating process. \nIn the end, there will be no real environmental benefit and America's \nworking families will be forced to pay higher energy and consumer costs \nwhile we export U.S. jobs to countries that are exempted from action \nunder the Treaty.''\n  So let us call once again upon our President to incorporate in this \nagreement developing nations, growth nations like China, Mexico, and \nIndia, that have simply walked away because they cannot be a part of an \nagreement that would cut back on the opportunity they are trying to \noffer their citizens.\n  Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, sign something that is a winning \nagreement for America. Sign something that promotes our economy, that \npromotes the environment of the world. Sign something that all \ncountries of the world can agree with. Please do not turn us away from \nthe kind of economic growth and development that all of our citizens \nexpect and demand. There is simply no compelling reason for our \ngovernment at this time to force Americans to take preventive measures \nof uncertain competence against a problem that may or may not lie in \nthe Earth's future.\n  The Administration carries a heavy burden of persuasion that the \nCO2 compliance measures contained in the Kyoto Agreement are \nworth the sacrifice it will require of the American people. We here in \nthe Senate must, and will, ensure that our nation's global economic \ncompetitiveness, our nation's military readiness, and our way of life, \nare not compromised merely to advance misguided political agendas.\n  It bears repeating--the Kyoto Agreement is flawed. It is based on \npolitic science and not lab science. And it is only through sound lab \nscience that we, working collectively together with our colleagues \naround the world, will produce a better world.\n  Once again, I thank my colleague from Nebraska for recognizing the \nimportance of this special order this morning as we talk about global \nclimate change and its importance to our\n\n[[Page S3246]]\n\ncountry and to our friends and neighbors around the world.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senate is in morning business; is that \nnot correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. And the minority leader has 1 hour under his control?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent to yield myself 15 minutes of the \nhour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wanted to mention a couple of subjects \non the floor of the Senate today. The first deals with the proposed \nmarriages occurring in the banking industry. In recent weeks, we have \nseen proposals of marriage by a number of our biggest banks, totaling \nsome $160 billion. Three of the largest merger proposals include \nCiticorp with Travelers--actually a very large bank with an insurance \ncompany, NationsBank and BankAmerica, and Banc One with First Chicago. \nI didn't even know there was any romancing going on, and then I open \nthe papers and see that all these banks want to gather up and get \nmarried and be one.\n  I think the fundamental question for this country is whether these \nmega mergers serve our economy and our country's best interests? Is \nthis good for our country? Will this better serve customers, or will it \nresult in bigger profits, perhaps, for the banks that merge and higher \nfees for their customers?\n  It is clear to me that the kinds of mergers we are once again seeing \nin this country mean that when two large corporations become one and an \neven larger corporation, there is less competition in our economy. When \nthere is less competition and, therefore, more concentration, it seems \nto me it clearly injures the market system which relies on competition \nas a regulator and, by definition, is therefore not good for consumers. \nWithout knowing the specific details, I admit, about the individual \nproposals in these mergers, I hope very much that the regulators, the \nFederal Reserve Board and the Comptroller of the Currency as well as \nthe Justice Department, will review all of these mergers with a fine-\ntooth comb and determine whether this will result in less competition \nthat is harmful to consumers, whether it will result in ever higher \nbanking fees for their customers, whether it will result in something \nthat takes us a step backward rather than a step forward in improving \nour market system in this country.\n  As I indicated, I don't know much about the specifics of any of the \nmerger proposals I have just described. It is not my intent to come and \ndescribe the deals or to pass judgment upon them. But I will say this: \nThe judgment I have with respect to many of the largest mergers in our \ncountry, especially in this industry, is that we are left with less \ncompetition if the merger is approved.\n  With respect to this industry, there is one peculiar and defining \ncharacteristic. The Federal Reserve Board determines by policy that \nthere are certain banks in this country that are so-called ``too big to \nfail.'' That is, they are so large in scope that their failure would \ncause such an economic calamity for the country that the Fed will not \nallow them to fail.\n  The Fed actually has a list of banks: ``These banks are too big to \nfail.'' All the other banks, the smaller banks, can fail and lose all \ntheir money. The deposits are insured so the depositors won't lose \nmoney, but the bank owners, the stockholders, can loose their money. \nThe ``too big to fail'' banks cannot fail. They are on the list at the \nFederal Reserve Board as ``too big to fail.''\n  I asked the question, if you have a list of ``too big to fail'' banks \nand the big banks merge into even bigger banks, does it not mean then \nthe American taxpayer will pay the cost of bad merger judgments if the \nmerger goes sour?\n  My friend James Glassman, who writes op-ed pieces for the Washington \nPost, a rather interesting guy, I think, and pretty good thinker--I \ndisagree with him on a fair number of issues from time to time--but he \nwrote a piece last week about this. He said that most of this is pretty \ngood news really. Some call all these mergers the ``elephant mating \nsystem''--the best thing to do is stand back at a safe distance and \nwatch.\n  But Glassman says, well, this is really fine. He says at the end of \nhis long piece, though, after talking about the virtues of these \nmergers, ``Yes, there are some dangers. The mergers make institutions \ntoo big to fail. Knowing that regulators won't close them down in a \ncrisis, bank managers could get reckless.''\n  That ought not be the last paragraph, I say to my friend Mr. \nGlassman; that ought to be the first paragraph.\n  The question of public policy on this issue of bank mergers, it seems \nto me, ought to be posed now to the Federal Reserve Board and \nComptroller of the Currency and to the Justice Department. I asked \nthem, do not any longer just be spectators on the question of mergers--\nsuit up, be involved, get active and make judgments with respect to the \nquestion of what is best for the market system of this country, what is \nbest for the American citizen, not what is best for the newly married \ntwo corporations that have become bigger and perhaps whose misjudgments \nwill now be borne by the American taxpayer under a doctrine of ``too \nbig to fail.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/20/senate-section/article/S3246-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             DRUNK DRIVING\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, last week, tragically an 11-year-old boy \nwas killed in an automobile accident in the Washington, DC, area. This \nyoung boy was killed by a man who was driving a vehicle apparently \nvery, very drunk and hit four cars. In the last car was a small van \nthat was driving down the road with this young 11-year-old boy \nlistening to his favorite basketball star. He was listening to a \nChicago Bulls' game, listening to Michael Jordan play basketball while \nseated in this family van driving down the road, when he was hit by a \ndrunk driver and tragically killed.\n  I have mentioned before that my family has been visited by this \ntragedy on a couple of occasions, and I have a special kind of anger in \nthese circumstances when I understand that the person who commits this \nkind of murder is not just the man who got drunk that day and killed an \n11-year-old boy. This happens every 30 minutes in America--every half \nhour someone else is killed by a drunk driver.\n  So often, you will discover, as is the case in this particular \ninstance, the driver has been drunk before. The first time he was \ndrunk, about 6 or 8 months ago, he was fined $50. On March 23, which is \njust a few weeks ago when that young 11-year-old boy was still full of \nlife, this driver was again picked up drunk with twice the legal limit, \nover .20. But then someone gave him a special license. Oh, yes, he is \npicked up drunk again but he got a special license to drive back and \nforth to work. I ask the judges who preside over these issues, where is \nthe judgment? Where is the judgment that allows a driver like this to \nbe on the road again with a temporary license to kill an 11-year-old \nboy?\n  I tried to get the judge's name so that I could show my colleagues \nand all those listening who has this kind of judgment. I have done that \nbefore, and I will again. But where is the judgment to understand that \nwhen people commit acts of drunk driving, they ought to have their \nprivileges of using America's roadways removed?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/20/senate-section/article/S3246-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3246-S3247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AMERICA'S TRADE DEFICIT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to make a point that since \nthe Congress took a brief recess, once again, America's trade deficit \nhas increased. It is now, as I predicted in previous discussions with \nthe Senate, headed towards another record high.\n  Everyone talks about the tremendous progress in this Chamber and in \nthis\n\n[[Page S3247]]\n\nGovernment at wrestling the budget deficit to the ground, and we have \nmade great progress in doing that. But the trade deficit is at a record \nhigh and is continuing to set records, like a merchandise trade deficit \nof $199 billion last year. Now it is estimated to go to $224 billion \nthis year. It is estimated by Standard & Poor's and by many others, \nincidentally, who gauge these things, that we will continue to have \nrecord trade deficits--record trade deficits.\n  President Clinton was in South America recently, in Chile. The South \nAmerican countries were concerned because the Congress did not pass \nwhat is called fast-track trade authority. It is interesting, when you \ntalk about this hemisphere's trading, this country is not just the \nbiggest kid on the block; it is the better part of the block.\n  Eighty-two percent of this country's trading of $10 trillion is the \nUnited States of America. And to have some other country suggest to us \nthat ``Gee, we've got a problem because you didn't pass fast track \ntrade authority''--what on Earth are they thinking about? The fact is, \nwe have constant, abiding and difficult trade problems. I would say to \nPresident Clinton--who I think has done a remarkable job with this \ncountry's economy and has policies that I support in many areas--we \nmust begin to deal with this trade deficit. We cannot ignore it.\n  The Asian financial crisis will make that deficit worse. We cannot \ncontinue to ignore the deficit. Our trade deficit is ratcheting up with \nChina. It continues to increase with China and Japan. We also have a \nsignificant trade deficit with Mexico, and a significant trade deficit \nwith Canada. The issue is: Why?\n  Let me show you a statement, just last Thursday, talking about our \ntrade with China. We have a nearly $50 billion trade deficit with \nChina. We are a cash currency cow for China for their hard currency \nneeds. It makes no sense for this country to say to China, ``Yeah, \nthat's all right; you can ratchet up a $50 billion trade deficit with \nthe United States.'' It hurts this country.\n  Here is what is happening in China. According to a Washington Post \narticle, ``Chinese sweatshops labor for U.S. retailers. In fact, the \nNational Labor Committee, a private New York-based whistle-blowing \ngroup, conducted an investigation into 21 garment factories, and found \nworkers paid pennies an hour, working excessive overtime, confined to \ncrowded dormitories, fed a thin rice gruel and denied any benefits.\n  Let me just add a few details. In China's southern coastal provinces, \nwages and benefits are being slashed to as low as 13 cents an hour, \nwhich is added to excessive overtime hours of up to 96 hours a week. \nShifts of 14 hours, 7 days a week, are being imposed. They live \ncrammed, 10 to a room, in guarded dormitories on the factory's \npremises, under constant surveillance.\n  Is this fair trade? Is this, when you talk about trade competition, \nwhat we ought to be competing with? Is this the race to the bottom that \nwe are talking about: Produce the shoes and handbags, and pay somebody \n13 cents an hour? Get a 15-year-old and put them in a plant, and work \nthem 90 hours a week, and ship their handbag to a store in Dayton, Los \nAngeles or Tulsa and sell it to the consumer? Does that mean lower \nprices for the consumer or fatter profits for the corporation? And is \nit fair trade? The answer is no. Absolutely not.\n  This ought not to be what we compete against. So we compete against \n13 cents an hour, and our trade deficit goes up--way up. That is fair \ntrade? I do not think so. I would ask the President and others to \nunderstand that this Congress is not going to provide fast track trade \nauthority for a President.\n  I know that the President went to South America and said, ``Well, \nfast track trade authority will happen.'' It will not happen. Fast \ntrack trade authority is dead, and will remain dead until this country \ndecides it is going to begin to solve the nettlesome, vexing trade \nproblems we have, country by country and free trade agreement by free \ntrade agreement.\n  We have had NAFTA, we have had GATT, we have had a number of trade \nagreements, all of which have turned out to be sour. I can, but I will \nnot, cite chapter and verse this morning about the avalanche of \nCanadian grain that is leaking across that border down into this \ncountry, undercutting our farmers' income right now, in violation, in \nmy judgment, of all fair trade standards. But nothing is done about it. \nI talk about 13 cents-an-hour wages which we are expected to compete \nagainst, but nothing is done about it either.\n  My point is, fast track is dead, and it will remain dead until and \nunless the U.S. Government decides these trade problems demand a \nsolution on behalf of our country. It ought not be embarrassing for our \ncountry to say we do have a national interest and we are going to \ninsist on that interest in our trade relationships with other \ncountries.\n  There are plenty of issues that will consume our time in this \nCongress between now and the middle of October when we likely will \nadjourn. I do hope between now and then, at some point someone will \ndecide that this trade issue is of consequence to this country's long-\nterm economic future.\n  We are blessed, truly blessed, as a country to have a strong, growing \neconomy. I have talked before on the floor of the Senate about the fact \nthat things are going well. There is no question about that. Much of \nthat relates to decisions that this President has made and this \nCongress has made--some very tough decisions, some by a one-vote \nmargin. The result is we have a growing economy while some other \ncountries are not so fortunate.\n  We have a Federal budget deficit that has largely been wrestled to \nthe ground. The unemployment numbers in this country are down, way \ndown. The crime rate is down. The welfare rolls are down. A lot of good \nthings are happening in this country. But it is not an excuse to ignore \nthe other challenges we have. One of those challenges represents this \nabiding trade deficit that is getting worse, not better. We must, it \nseems to me, find a way to respond it to and deal with it.\n  I again say that we must take a look at the Asian currency collapse, \nat the failure of the Japanese to deal with the devaluation of its \ncurrency, with the forced-labor problems in China, and the intellectual \npiracy that goes on. One of the reasons for what is happening with \nrespect to that piracy is, when we try to send a video game or a \ncompact disc from this country into China, guess what the tariff is: 50 \npercent.\n  Here is a country that has a $50 billion trade surplus with the \nU.S.--in other words, they are selling us far more than they are buying \nfrom us--and when we want to ship some intellectual property over \nthere, they impose a 50 percent tariff on us.\n  I was in China. I talked with the President of China. I said, ``You \ncan't do this. You can't shut off China to the U.S. pork market and \nstop pork shipments. You can't shut off China to wheat shipments from \nour country. You can't continue to produce, on a pirated basis, the \nkind of production that we see coming from China in compact discs and \nin other areas.'' It is not something that ever ought to be \ncountenanced, and yet we have agreements to try to shut it down, and it \ndoes not get shut down.\n  My only point is this: This problem is getting worse. This shows the \nhemorrhage of red ink on international trade with this country. It is \ngetting worse, not better, and I ask not just this administration but \nthis Congress to decide that this challenge is something we have a \nresponsibility to meet.\n  Mr. President, this afternoon we turn to an education issue, and I \nintend to come back and visit a bit this afternoon on the Coverdell \namendment and a range of amendments that will be offered to it dealing \nwith the subject of education. In the meantime, I yield the floor and \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/20/senate-section/article/S3246-3", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3247-S3248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         GLOBAL CLIMATE TREATY\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words this \nafternoon about the U.N. global climate treaty that the Clinton \nadministration agreed to in Kyoto, Japan, this past December, and which \nyou, as the Presiding Officer, have taken a real lead in helping your\n\n[[Page S3248]]\n\ncolleagues here in the Senate to understand. In fact, I know that you \nhelped to lead a delegation to those proceedings in Kyoto. This treaty \nwill require the United States to drastically reduce its greenhouse-gas \nemissions, presumably by rationing our energy consumption and assessing \ntaxes on energy use and production.\n\n  The reduction of pollutants, of course, is a laudable goal. I \nwholeheartedly support efforts that will produce a cleaner environment. \nBut what the administration fails to adequately appreciate is that \nprotecting the environment is a global issue, one all nations must \nactively take part in if global environmental protection is truly to be \nattained. The administration would like the American people to believe \nthat this debate is about who is for or against the environment; but, \nthat is not the case. This debate is about whether or not this \nparticular treaty is in the best interests of the American people and \nthe global environment.\n  The underlying hypothesis used by proponents of the treaty is that \ngreenhouse gases, which trap the sun's infrared rays and heat the \nearth's atmosphere, have become so abundant in the atmosphere that a \n``global warming'' effect has commenced, and that the cause of this \nphenomenon is manmade. On the basis of this as-yet unproven connection \nbetween human activity and the climate, delegates at the climate change \nconference in Kyoto reached an agreement to curb greenhouse-gas \nemissions. The treaty, if ratified, would legally bind the U.S. to cut \nits overall emissions of six gases by seven percent below 1990 levels \nby 2012. However, 130 developing countries, such as Mexico, China, \nKorea, and India, would not be held liable to these same standards.\n  The evidence of global warming is inconclusive, at best. For the past \n20 years, precisely the same 20 years during which carbon dioxide \nlevels have increased the most, the earth has actually cooled. This \ncooling flies in the face of the theory that man-made emissions are \ncausing a global warming effect. Models cannot accurately predict what \nthe weather will be like next week, let alone what temperatures will \nprevail on Earth in the next century. The only consensus that has been \nreached within the scientific community--that future effects of fossil-\nfuel use are most likely to be gradual over many decades to come--gives \ngood reason for the U.S. government not to rush to judgement.\n  Committing the U.S. to these targets will have severe economic \neffects on American families and workers. According to the Heritage \nFoundation, holding emissions to 1990 levels will raise energy prices \nbetween 50 and 200 percent; average households would pay $1,620 in \nadditional taxes a year; and the economy would contract by a total of \n$3.3 trillion, all by the year 2020. I note that these figures are \nbased on reducing greenhouse-gas emissions to 1990 levels only; going \nseven percent below these levels, as agreed to by the Clinton \nadministration, will result in more serious hardships for the American \npeople. Furthermore, the AFL-CIO estimates that reducing emissions to \n1990 levels will result in the loss of 1.25 to 1.5 million American \njobs. And these jobs will not simply disappear; rather, industry will \nmove overseas and reestablish itself in those countries that are not \nlegally bound to gas-emissions targets. These combined effects would \nplace the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage, while failing to address \nthe global problem of soaring amounts of pollution produced by the \ndeveloping nations of the world.\n  Meanwhile, the developing countries are projected to continue \naccelerating their use of fossil fuels during the next century. By \n2015, China will surpass the U.S. in total carbon emissions. Without \nthe full participation of the developing countries in any treaty of \nthis kind, unilateral attempts by the developed nations to reduce \ngreenhouse-gas emissions will not significantly slow the steady \nincrease of carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere.\n  In sum, the United States should not be party to a global climate \ntreaty that is not supported by a scientific consensus, that puts an \nunfair burden on American workers and consumers, and that asks us to \nturn back the clock on economic growth and our standard of living. More \nimportantly, this treaty fails to effectively address the issue because \nit ignores the developing countries of the world. It simply does not \nmake sense, either environmentally or economically, to focus on the \nnations that are already spending billions on pollution control and \nmaking substantial progress, while ignoring developing nations--\ncountries where emissions could be curbed by employing the same basic \ntechnologies the United States has used so successfully to reduce its \nlevels of pollution. U.S. companies, using the best available \ntechnology, are able to eliminate the bulk of pollution from their \nemissions. To achieve an additional increment of pollution reduction, \ndeveloped nations like the U.S. would be required to expend inordinate \nsums of money in pursuit of only marginal improvements. The costs \nassociated with attempting to squeeze out the last increments of \npollution will heavily outweigh any benefits in the developed nations. \nHowever, in countries where pollution-control technology is not as \nadvanced or widespread as it is here, a dollar spent on equipment will \nprovide far greater reductions in overall pollution. Thus, the cost/\nbenefit ratio favors pressing developing nations to catch up with us. \nThe Global Climate Treaty does not do this.\n  Faced with certain defeat on this issue, the administration has \nresorted to a level of fear mongering which I think has been unmatched \nsince the 1970s, when some of the same scientists who are promoting \nglobal warming warned at that time that we were about to enter upon the \nnext ice age. I find it hard to believe that in a mere 20 years, our \nclimate has moved from one extreme to the other. In a December Wall \nStreet Journal article, Arthur Robinson and Zachary Robinson of the \nOregon Institute of Science and Medicine point out that ``there is not \na shred of persuasive evidence that humans are responsible for \nincreasing global temperatures.'' But the administration, in an effort \nto rally support, issues apocalyptic warnings that, if global warming \nis not headed off, we will experience floods, droughts, rising sea \nlevels, and the spread of infectious diseases. The global warming \nhypothesis should not be taken as fact; Americans should not be scared \ninto accepting unsubstantiated scenarios as the truth.\n  The Senate fulfilled the first half of its ``advise and consent'' \nrole this summer by passing the Byrd-Hagel resolution 95 to 0. That \nbipartisan advice instructed the administration not to sign a treaty \nthat did not include the developing countries of the world in the same \nemission-control requirements, or a treaty that would cause great \neconomic harm to America. The treaty to which the administration has \nagreed meets neither of these guidelines. Therefore, because the \nadministration was unwilling to consider the Senate's advice, I do not \nbelieve the Senate will give its consent--nor should it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/20/senate-section/article/S3247-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3248-S3249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE HONORABLE TERRY SANFORD\n\n\n                     August 20, 1917-April 18, 1998\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I was regrettably late in learning about \nthe inevitable death of former U.S. Senator Terry Sanford this past \nSaturday, April 18. I say inevitable because it was. All of us, \nespecially Terry himself, knew what was coming when last December the \nfatal inoperable cancer was discovered.\n  Terry faced up to the reality of it all with his typical courage. He \ntold reporters at the time that he would continue to be active as long \nas he could, and take every day as it came. Then he plunged into a \nwhirlwind fund-raising schedule on behalf of a project near and dear to \nhis heart.\n  It was impossible not to like and admire Terry Sanford. He was never \none of my supporters, nor was I ever one of his. But we were friends \nand there was never a hint of discord during his six years in the \nSenate--or before, for that matter, or since.\n  As Senators who were here during Senator Sanford's six years will \ntestify, Terry was a respected colleague. For my part, I always had the \nfeeling that he had been vastly more comfortable being Governor. He \ncould push a button then and things happened. Not so with the Senate. \nWe sort of canceled each other's vote in the Senate much of the time he \nwas here but there never was an instance when we didn't work together \nfor the betterment of North\n\n[[Page S3249]]\n\nCarolina. And there was never the slightest hostility.\n  In short, Mr. President, I liked Terry Sanford. He has undeniably \nleft his mark upon the destiny of the state he loved--and certainly \nupon Duke University which was the multi-million dollar beneficiary of \nhis skillful fund-raising ability.\n  He lived life to the fullest; he was a man who loved his family and \nhis country. If he ever wasted a moment, I am not aware of it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that The Washington Post \nreport of Senator Sanford's death, published April 19, 1998, be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 19, 1998]\n\n         Terry Sanford, Ex-U.S. Senator and N.C. Governor, Dies\n\n                            (By Martin Weil)\n\n       Terry Sanford, 80, a former governor of North Carolina and \n     president of Duke University, whose career as a widely \n     admired and respected Democratic political leader culminated \n     with a term in the U.S. Senate, died of cancer yesterday at \n     his home in Durham, N.C.\n       An amiable man, loyal to his party but known also for \n     independent thinking, Gov. Sanford became known early in his \n     career for an ability--based on both personality and \n     principle--to achieve substantial political success in a \n     political environment often thought uncongenial to the \n     moderate or progressive views he espoused.\n       This, and his high profile leadership at Duke, attracted \n     the interest and support of many Democrats both inside and \n     outside his native North Carolina, who saw him as \n     representing their party's possibilities of survival in the \n     South, at a time when a Republican tide was sweeping through \n     what had once been a solidly Democratic region. Ranked in a \n     Harvard University study as one of the 20th-century's most \n     creative governors because of his achievements in the \n     statehouse from 1961 to 1965, Gov. Sanford made forays onto \n     the national stage in the 1970s; in 1972 and in 1976, he \n     sought unsuccessfully his party's presidential nomination.\n       Gov. Sanford's inoperable cancer was diagnosed in December. \n     He underwent a second round of chemotherapy last week before \n     being discharged on Wednesday from the Duke University \n     Medical Center.\n       Heart valve surgery during his campaign for reelection to \n     the Senate made his health a campaign issue at that time, and \n     was believed to have contributed to his defeat. Indeed, his \n     election to the Senate in 1986 was seen as a kind of last \n     hurrah for a 69-year-old whose electoral career had seemed to \n     peak years before.\n       In the Senate, he had made a mark for the forcefulness of \n     his opposition to the Supreme Court nomination of Robert H. \n     Bork. He was also remembered for taking a strong stand in \n     opposition to the nation's embarking on the Persian Gulf War.\n       It was Gov. Sanford's reputation as a moderate among his \n     fellow Senate Democrats that led them to choose him in 1988 \n     to respond to a speech by President Reagan attacking the \n     campaign against the Bork nomination.\n       ``We are tired of having our integrity impugned,'' Gov. \n     Sanford said in what was viewed as an eloquent defense of the \n     Senate's right to withhold its consent from presidential \n     nominations. ``We are tired of having our sincerity \n     questioned. We are tired of having our intelligence \n     insulted.''\n       The speech, coming from a man who could not be readily \n     characterized as an extremist, was viewed as a landmark in \n     the campaign that led to the rejection of the nomination.\n       Even after his 1992 defeat at the hands of Republican Lauch \n     Faircloth, Gov. Sanford, a paratrooper in World War II, had \n     continued a life of vigorous activity.\n       He had been president of Duke from 1969 to 1985, a tenure \n     of unusual duration in one of the most turbulent periods for \n     American higher education. After his defeat, he taught \n     classes there in government and public policy, wrote books, \n     held the rank of senior partner in a law firm, and served as \n     a director of charitable, legal and educational \n     organizations.\n       Gov. Sanford was born Aug. 20, 1917, in Laurinburg, N.C. \n     where his father was a merchant and his mother taught in the \n     public schools. Dishwashing helped him pay his way through \n     the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, from which \n     he graduated in 1939. He served in 1941-42 as an FBI agent.\n       Shortly after the United States entered World War II, he \n     went into the Army; he became a paratrooper, and was involved \n     in five major campaigns in Europe, including the Battle of \n     the Bulge, rising from private to first lieutenant. He held \n     the Combat Infantryman's Badge, the Bronze Star and the \n     Purple Heart. A back injury that plagued him for the rest of \n     his life stemmed from his paratrooper service.\n       After the war, he graduated from law school at Chapel Hill, \n     served as assistant director of the university's Institute of \n     Government and began the private practice of law in \n     Fayetteville. He served in the state senate in 1953 to 1955.\n       During his years as governor, he focused on improving \n     public education. He advocated legislation to raise teacher \n     salaries and create a community college system and was known \n     then as one of the nation's ``education governors.''\n       He financed many of his improvements with a sales tax on \n     food that he justified in a speech as a ``small measure of \n     sacrifice . . . that would swing open the doors to our \n     children . . . and provide the opportunities that will put \n     this state in the front ranks of our community of \n     states.''\n       He was credited with starting an antiproverty program, with \n     helping to defuse tensions over race by setting up Good \n     Neighbor Councils and with calling for employment without \n     regard to race, creed of color. It was Gov. Sanford who was \n     credited with launching North Carolina's State Board of \n     Science and Technology to help convert scientific advances \n     into new techniques for the state's industries.\n       North Carolina Gov. James B. Hunt Jr. said Gov. Sanford's \n     optimism and commitment to excellence in public education \n     ``have changed us forever.''\n       Hunt said that in 1960 he ``plugged into the campaign to \n     elect him governor and to me he was the best one ever.''\n       In his first month as Duke president, he showed the \n     flexibility that enabled him to survive and harness the \n     currents of protest that unseated many of his colleagues.\n       Students blocked traffic in a protest of the shootings of \n     students at Kent State University in Ohio during a Vietnam \n     War protest. Gov. Sanford seized a bullhorn, endorsed the \n     students' anger, but advised: ``Don't fight us. Let us all \n     fight Washington together.''\n       Later, the students threatened to take over the school's \n     main administration building. ``Great,'' he said. ``Take me \n     with you . . . I've been trying to occupy it for a month.''\n       After stepping down in 1985 from the presidency at Duke, \n     Gov. Sanford was elected to the U.S. Senate.\n       Survivors include Sanford's wife of 52 years, Margaret; his \n     son, Terry Sanford Jr.; his daughter, Betsee; two \n     grandchildren; and two sisters.\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 2646, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2646) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 to allow tax-free expenditures from education individual \n     retirement accounts for elementary and secondary school \n     expenses, to increase the maximum annual amount of \n     contributions to such accounts, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Delaware, Mr. \nRoth, is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that we have entered into a unanimous \nconsent agreement with respect to H.R. 2646, the Parent and Student \nSavings Account Plus Act. It is good to see us moving at last toward \npassage of this significant bill. The importance of giving American \nfamilies the resources and means they need to educate their children \nmust be above politics.\n  As I have said before, this bill empowers families--not the federal \nbureaucracy. It gives resources to the children, not to a monolithic \nestablishment that has grown overbearing and antiquated on a diet of \ngovernment subsidies.\n  This bill is a much needed change in the way Washington looks at the \neducation of children. It returns parental involvement to where it \nshould be--at the very foundation of their children's education. It \nlets them use their money to educate their children, allowing them to \nput their own money into their own Parent and Student Savings \nAccounts.''\n  This bill acknowledges that the best thing taxpayers can do with \ntheir hard-earned money is to earmark it for the education of their \nchildren.\n  It allows them to increase their contributions from $500 per year to \n$2,000 per year. It allows for withdrawals to be used for elementary \nand secondary education expenses. And it covers public and private \nschools.\n\n[[Page S3250]]\n\n  The bill also makes state-sponsored prepaid tuition programs tax-\nfree, not tax-deferred, meaning that students will be able to withdraw \non a tax-free basis the savings that accumulate in their pre-paid \ntuition accounts. Parents will have the incentive to put money away \ntoday and their children will have the full benefit of that money tax \nfree tomorrow.\n  Toward promoting these important objectives, the federal government \nmust lead, follow, or get out of the way. Our states and communities--\nour families--are embracing innovative educational programs. They \nrealize the old way isn't working. Already, forty-four states have pre-\npaid tuition plans in effect, and the other six have legislation to \ncreate a state plan, or they have implemented a feasibility study.\n  Many cities and states are offering families the power of choice when \nit comes to selecting what school their children will attend. Others \nare embracing programs that make private schools more accessible.\n  These measures are having a positive impact, but there is much more \nto be done, and the federal government must demonstrate its leadership. \nLet's be bold, Mr. President. The National Center for Education \nStatistics states that in our children's pre-school years, parents are \nactive in preparing them for school. Almost three-quarters of all \nparents read to their children regularly. A full 60 percent are active \nin teaching them to recognize letters and numbers.\n  Interestingly enough, this active parental involvement begins to fall \noff once the child has entered school. Perhaps this is because \ngovernment has put itself in the position over the years where it has \ncome to assume parental responsibility, and even frustrated parental \nparticipation. ``Give us your money,'' government has said. ``We'll \neducate your children. We'll make decisions concerning how your \nprecious resources are spent, concerning what will be emphasized--how \nit will be taught, and by whom.''\n  This has led to a condition where--according to one of the most \nextensive studies ever conducted on the forces that affect youth and \ntheir performance in school--nearly one in three parents in America is \nseriously disengaged from his or her adolescent's education. How can it \nbe that while three-quarters of all parents are active in preparing \ntheir pre-school children for their educations, only one-third remain \nactive when their child enters adolescence?\n  The answer is simple: parents have become disenfranchised. They have \nbeen robbed of the resources they need to make the kinds of decisions \nthat will keep them active in the educational attainments of their \nchildren.\n  According to Lawrence Steinberg, the educator who conducted the \nextensive study of more than 20,000 teenagers and their families in \nnine very different American communities, ``The failure of our \neducational policies is due to our obsession with reforming schools and \nclassrooms, and our general disregard of the contributing forces that, \nwhile outside the boundaries of the school, are probably more \ninfluential.''\n  These influential forces, Mr. President, include the family. They \ninclude the educational resources families are given to provide their \nchildren with an environment for learning. They include the flexibility \nparents have to decide where their children will attend school and how \nit will be paid for.\n  Our policies must offer Dad and Mom the resources they need to \nactively re-engage in Junior's education. The Coverdell bill does this. \nIt is a very important step in the right direction, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it. It's time for innovation. It's time to \nempower parents. It's time to prepare for the future. This is what the \nCoverdell bill is all about.\n  I will take a few minutes to walk through the various provisions of \nthe bill. But before I get into the specifics, let me remind my \ncolleagues that with the exception of several school construction bond \nprovisions--which were newly added this year--all of the concepts in \nthis bill should be very familiar.\n  Mr. President, these concepts should be familiar because we have \nalready endorsed them. The base provisions in the bill--which include \nthe increase in the maximum allowable contribution to an education IRA, \nthe use of the IRA for elementary and secondary school expenses for \npublic and private schools, the tax-free treatment of state sponsored \nprepaid tuition plans, and the extension of tax-free treatment for \nemployer provided educational assistance--all received overwhelming \nbipartisan support in the Senate as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act of \n1997.\n  Despite this Senate support, these provisions were dropped from the \nbill during conference negotiations. Because of opposition from the \nAdministration, these particular elements failed to be included in the \nfinal version of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.\n  We are here today to show our commitment to these provisions--and to \nenact what this body has already determined makes good sense for \nAmerican families.\n  Mr. President, it is important to note that this tax bill is not \ndesigned to answer all of the education-related issues that face this \ncountry. Those issues are too varied and complicated to be addressed by \nthe federal government.\n  They need to be solved at the state and local level--by schools, \nteachers, and parents working together.\n  Instead, this bill is designed to build on the innovative concepts \nthat have been introduced in the last few years. Our goal is to alter \nthe tax code so that it provides the necessary incentives to help \nAmerican families help their children. These are much needed tools.\n  Over the past 15 years, tuition at a four year college has increased \nby 234%. The average student loan has increased by 367%. In contrast \nmedian household income rose only 82% during this period and the \nconsumer price index rose only 74%.\n  Our students--our families--need these resources to help them meet \nthe costs and realize the opportunities of a quality education. The \nSenate recognized the importance of these provisions less than one year \nago, voting in favor of them. I hope that my colleagues continue to \nrecognize just how important they remain. The American people are \ncounting on us.\n  Now let me take a few minutes to describe the various provisions of \nthis bill--to provide an overview and to highlight some reasons why \nthese measures are so important.\n  As I have already mentioned, the bill increases the maximum education \nIRA contribution from $500 to $2,000. That increase is important on two \nlevels. First, with the well-documented increase in education costs, it \nis essential that we provide American families with the resources \nneeded to meet those costs.\n  I have long argued that it is essential to change the savings habits \nof the American people, and there are few things more important than \nthe education of our children. Not only will saving in this way \nincrease our investment capital, it will increase American's education \ncapital as well. Anything that thwarts either of these objectives is \nshort-sighted.\n  By using the tax code to encourage individual responsibility for \npaying for educational expenses, we all benefit. The expansion of the \neducation IRA will result in greater opportunities for individuals to \nsave for their children's education.\n  Besides being too low to give parents the necessary resources to pay \nfor the costs of education, the current $500 limit fails from another \npractical perspective.\n  As we all know, any broker or bank that provides an IRA account faces \nassorted administrative costs for each account. To ensure that they can \nadequately cover their administrative costs, most brokers or banks \nimpose a minimum account balance. In many cases, the minimum balance \nhas been set well higher than $500. That reality of the marketplace has \nthe effect of limiting the availability of the education IRA to \nAmerican families.\n\n  Another reality is that confronted by a $500 limit, many mutual fund \ncompanies find that it is not worth their while to spend money on \nmarketing the education IRA. It is a fact of life that regardless of \nwhat we say and do in Congress, many families will only know about the \nbenefits of an education IRA through the marketing efforts of their \nlocal mutual fund companies and banks. These businesses have been very \nsuccessful in marketing IRAs with a higher contribution limit. If we \nwant to maximize the involvement of American families in education \nIRAs,\n\n[[Page S3251]]\n\nMr. President, we need to ensure that the accounts make economic sense \nfrom the perspective of the companies offering them.\n  Mr. President, the next major change that this bill makes to \neducation IRAs is that it allows withdrawals for education expenses for \nelementary and secondary schools and for both private and public \nschools.\n  As we recognized last year, it is a fundamental principle that a \nparent should have the right and the ability to make decisions about \nhis or her child's education--to decide basic questions such as how the \nchild should be educated and where the child should attend school.\n  Last year, for example, when Congress passed a variety of provisions \ntargeted to higher education, we made no distinction between private \nand public schools.\n  We did not say, for instance, that an education IRA or a Hope \nscholarship would only be available if a student attended public \nschool. We did not say that a student who attended the University of \nMaryland would receive a tax benefit and a student who attended George \nWashington University would receive nothing.\n  This bill recognizes that just as with secondary schools, we should \nnot establish a priority system where some elementary and secondary \nschools are favored over others. We should not forget that it is the \ntaxpayer who funds the education IRA--that it is the parent who puts \nhis or her hard-earned money into the education IRA.\n  Mr. President, it seems a matter of common sense, therefore, that the \nparent should be able to choose how to spend that money.\n  Moreover, parents with students in elementary and secondary schools \nneed our help to cope with the costs. It is simply not true that only \nrich kids attend private elementary or secondary schools. For instance, \naccording to the National Catholic Education Association, almost 70% of \nthe families with children in Catholic schools have incomes below \n$35,000 and almost 90% of those families have incomes below $50,000.\n  Another provision in this bill makes state-sponsored prepaid tuition \nplans tax-free, not simply tax-deferred. This is a significant \ndistinction, because it allows students to withdraw the savings that \naccumulate in their pre-paid tuition accounts without paying any tax at \nall. It means that parents have the incentive to put money away today \nand their children have the full benefit of that money, without any \ntax, tomorrow.\n  As I have already mentioned, forty-four states have pre-paid tuition \nplans in effect, and the other six are in the process of implementing \nsuch plans. This means that every member of the Senate has parents and \nstudents back home who either benefit from this plan right now, or will \nbenefit from this plan soon.\n  Mr. President, the Coverdell bill also extends tax-free treatment of \nemployer provided educational assistance for graduates and \nundergraduates through the year 2002.\n  This particular program is a time-tested and widely used benefit for \nworking students. Over one million workers across America receive tax-\nfree employer provided education. This allows them to stay on the \ncutting edge of their careers. It benefits not only them, individually, \nbut their employers and the economy as a whole. With the constant \ninnovations and advancing technology of our society, it is vitally \nimportant that we continue this program.\n  The various provisions that I have just described have already been \nembraced by members of this body, and they were approved last year. \nThey made sense then. They certainly continue to make sense today.\n  Mr. President, the Coverdell bill does even more than address the \ncosts of attending school. In response to concerns from Members on both \nsides of the aisle, the Finance Committee agreed on some measures to \nprovide targeted relief in the area of school construction.\n  The first provision is directed at high growth school districts. It \nexpands the tax-exempt bond rules for public/private partnerships set \nup for the construction, renovation, or restoration of public school \nfacilities in these districts.\n  In general, it allows states to issue tax-exempt bonds equal to $10 \nper state resident. Each state would be guaranteed a minimum allocation \nof at least $5 million of these tax-exempt bonds. In total, up to $600 \nmillion per year in new tax exempt bonds would be issued for these \ninnovative school construction projects.\n  This provision is important because it retains state and local \nflexibility. It does not impose a new bureaucracy on the states and it \ndoes not force the federal government to micro-manage school \nconstruction.\n  The provision also is important because it promotes the use of \npublic/private partnerships. Many high-growth school districts may be \ntoo poor or too overwhelmed to take on a school construction project \nthemselves. With these bonds, those districts can partner with a \nprivate entity--and still enjoy the benefits of tax-exempt financing.\n  Mr. President, it is worth noting that there already is a significant \nfederal subsidy for school construction. Under current law, states and \nlocalities can issue debt that is exempt from federal taxation. This \nbenefit allows them to finance school construction by issuing long term \nbonds at a lower cost than they otherwise could.\n  Moreover, the evidence shows that states and localities are taking \nadvantage of this benefit. In the first six months of 1996, voters \napproved $13.3 billion in school bonds, an increase of more than $4 \nbillion over the first six months of 1995. The bottom line is that many \nstates and localities are doing their homework, passing bonds, building \nand renovating schools, and enjoying favorable treatment under the \nexisting tax code. They are doing all this without significant federal \ninvolvement.\n  I do not have to remind my colleagues that school construction has \nalways been the province of state and local governments. President \nClinton himself stated in 1994 that ``the construction and renovation \nof school facilities has traditionally been the responsibility of state \nand local governments financed primarily by local taxpayers.'' In that \nrespect, I agree with the President.\n  Mr. President, there is a second bond provision in this bill. That \nprovision is designed to simplify the issuance of bonds for school \nconstruction. Under current law, arbitrage profits earned on \ninvestments unrelated to the purpose of the borrowing must be rebated \nto the Federal government. However, there is an exception--generally \nreferred to as the small issuer exception--which allows governments to \nissue up to $5 million of bonds without being subject to the arbitrage \nrebate requirement. We recently increased this limit to $10 million for \ngovernments that issue at least $5 million of public school bonds \nduring the year.\n  The provision in the Coverdell bill increases the small issuer \nexception to $15 million, provided that at least $10 million of the \nbonds are issued to finance public schools. This measure will assist \nlocalities in meeting school construction needs by simplifying their \nuse of tax-exempt financing. At the same time, it will not create \nincentives to issue such debt earlier or in larger amounts than is \nnecessary. It is a type of targeted provision that makes sense.\n  It is clear, Mr. President, that the Coverdell bill contains many \nimportant provisions for the American family. As I have said already, \nmany of these measures have already been passed by the Senate.\n  Anyone--students or parents--who is on the front line dealing with \nthe costs of a quality education, must have been disappointed last year \nwhen we failed to give them all the tools that they needed. American \nfamilies understand just how important these measures are. They have \nnow been waiting for a year. Let's not disappoint them any further. \nLet's not keep them waiting any longer. Let's move forward. Let's pass \nthe Coverdell bill now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I congratulate Chairman Roth for his \nstatement and for once again bringing a Finance Committee bill to the \nfloor that includes ideas supported by members on both sides. And I \nthank the Chairman for insisting that the appropriate place for initial \nconsideration of the Coverdell education savings account legislation \nwas in the Finance\n\n[[Page S3252]]\n\nCommittee, not on the floor. This legislation was reported by the \nCommittee on February 10, 1998, by a vote of 11-8.\n  This is one of those infrequent occasions in which the Chairman and I \ndisagree on a policy matter. The good intentions of the proponents of \nexpanding the availability of education individual retirement accounts \nare clear. However, in our view the proposed changes to the education \nIRA provisions, passed just last July and effective on January 1st of \nthis year, are fraught with serious policy and technical defects. \nSecretaries Rubin and Riley have expressed strong opposition to the \neducation IRA provisions in this bill, and have indicated that they \nwill recommend that the President veto a bill that contains such \nprovisions. In a letter to Members of the Finance Committee dated \nFebruary 9, 1998, the Secretaries of the Treasury and Education stated \nthat the education IRA provisions in this bill would disproportionately \nbenefit the most affluent families and provide little or no benefit to \nlower and middle-income families. In addition, they indicated that the \nprovisions ``would create significant compliance problems.''\n  Treasury Department analyses conclude that 70 percent of the tax \nbenefits from this provision would go to the top twenty percent of all \nincome earners. In a memorandum of March 2, 1998, the staff of the \nJoint Committee on Taxation estimates that 52 percent of the tax \nbenefits of the enhanced education IRA provision would go to seven \npercent of taxpayers: those with dependents already enrolled in private \nprimary or secondary schools. The Joint Committee memorandum indicates \nthat the per tax return benefit for taxpayers with children in private \nschools will be five times greater than the benefit to taxpayers with \nchildren in public schools.\n  This bill will not result in greater opportunity for middle and lower \nincome families to send children to private schools, as supporters \ncontend. Instead, it will merely provide new tax breaks to families \nalready able to afford private schools for their children. If the \nproponents are truly concerned about the middle class, the tax benefits \nshould be targeted there. In order to accomplish this, the income \nlimits would have to be lowered, and the ability to circumvent those \nlimits would have to be prevented.\n  Nor will this legislation result in an increase in national savings. \nThe expansion of the education IRA will provide further incentives for \ntaxpayers to shift money to tax-favored accounts, and to spend funds \nthat would otherwise be used for retirement.\n  Further, the additional complexity these changes would add to the \nInternal Revenue Code is of real concern. Taxpayers are just beginning \nto become aware of the hundreds of changes made in the 1997 tax bill. \nAnd now we are considering additional changes to a provision that \nbecame effective on January 1, 1998. More confusion for taxpayers; a \nboon for H Block.\n  Even as we hear ever louder calls to simplify and even terminate the \nCode, we have before us a bill that would create a maze of rules in \nattempting to define what constitutes a ``qualified elementary and \nsecondary education expense.'' For example, the bill defines such \nexpenses to include computers and related software and services, but \nhow is the IRS to monitor whether a computer, or the use of the \nInternet, is used by a child for educational purposes or for \nentertainment, or by the child's parents for unrelated purposes?\n\n  Under this bill, the ability to contribute up to $2,000 per year in \nan account for elementary and secondary education expenses would sunset \nafter 2002. However, money contributed through 2002 could still be used \nfor such expenses. There will be different rules depending on whether \ncontributions were made in 1998, 1999 to 2002, or post-2002. It will be \nup to the taxpayer to track--and the IRS to examine--when funds were \ncontributed, the earnings on those funds, and whether they can be used \nfor only higher education, or both elementary and secondary education \nand higher education. Who will understand these rules?\n  Mr. President, we are already spending enough on IRAs and other tax-\nadvantaged savings vehicles. At a cost of $40 billion over 10 years, \nthe Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 created the Education IRA and the Roth \nIRA, and significantly expanded existing IRAs and the tax benefits of \nState-sponsored prepaid college tuition plans.\n  Having said all of that, I must express thanks to the Chairman, who \ngave priority in this package to the income exclusion for employer-\nprovided educational assistance, which is Section 127 of the Internal \nRevenue Code. It is one of the most successful Federal education \npolicies we have. A million persons per year are provided tax-free \nhigher education by their employers; about a quarter of those are \nstudents enrolled in graduate-level education courses.\n  In a world of continuing education, Section 127 permits an employer \nto send an employee to school to learn something new, get a degree, and \nbring the skills back into the workplace. The employee gets more \nincome, and the Federal treasury gets more tax revenue. This is a \nprogram that works, and it administers itself.\n  Last year, the Senate version of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 \nwould have made this absolutely easy; it made Section 127 permanent for \nboth undergraduate and graduate study. For reasons I will never \nunderstand, the Senate language was dropped in conference. Members of \nthe House have already indicated that in a conference on this measure \nthey will move to strip the Section 127 provisions, particularly the \npiece for graduate students.\n  Finally, I appreciate the Chairman's good faith efforts in working \nwith members on both sides to try and come up with measures designed to \naddress the issue of school infrastructure. Last year, Senators Carol \nMoseley-Braun and Bob Graham brought the issue of crumbling schools to \nour attention, and they continue to be the leaders in the effort to \naddress this serious problem. Most of us would prefer not to address \nthis issue via the Tax Code, but previous attempts at more direct \nsolutions have been opposed. I am afraid that such opposition has \nresulted in the nominal tax provisions we find in this bill to address \na problem that is estimated to cost at least $112 billion--a figure \nthat does not include the cost of building new schools.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, in about half an hour or 45 minutes I \nwill have the pleasure of being able to offer an amendment to the \npending bill, along with my friend and colleague, Senator Mack of \nFlorida, that will, I believe, help reform education. I believe the \nmost important battle that America faces is to provide an opportunity \nfor our youngsters to get a decent education, to get the best education \npossible.\n  Reform of our education system is one of America's priorities. \nIndeed, our amendment will reform the evaluation of public school \nteachers in America and, most importantly, will reward the best \nteachers with additional salary.\n  Reforming our education system is the most important issue facing our \nNation. This is a fight for America's children. When we look at \nreforming our public schools, one thing must always be kept foremost in \nour efforts: We must put our children first--not anyone's interest, but \nthe interest of our children. Our children are the best and the \nbrightest. They are our most precious resource. That is what our \nlegislative proposal will be about.\n  This amendment is about promoting excellence in teaching, for the \nbenefit of our children. Before I get into the details of the \namendment, I want to speak a little bit about excellent teachers and \nhow they help our children learn.\n  When my dad entered elementary school quite a few years ago, he \ndidn't speak a word of English. Indeed, very few spoke English in the \npoor, immigrant community in which he grew up. But he had teachers who \nwere dedicated to giving the best education to those children who came \nfrom all kinds of diverse backgrounds. After many years of hard work, \nsummer schools included, my dad graduated. He went on\n\n[[Page S3253]]\n\nto a State teachers' college where he majored, of all things, in \nEnglish. My dad was able to achieve this amazing progress because he \nwas inspired by his public school teachers who created magic in the \nclassroom.\n  That same inspiration takes place today in many classrooms throughout \nAmerica. Public school teachers still make a difference for millions of \nour children. Truly outstanding teachers are the unsung heroes of our \ncommunities.\n  Unfortunately, however, this magic does not take place for every \nchild in every classroom, and that is a tragedy.\n  Today, in most of our Nation's public schools, there is no financial \nincentive for those truly outstanding teachers. We should change that. \nOutstanding teachers who help our children achieve educational success \nshould be rewarded with merit pay. That is just good common sense. It \nworks in business. It works in other areas. And it should be part of \nour educational system.\n  Another commonsense measure is teacher competence testing. Again, \nmost teachers are very dedicated, and most teachers are up to the job. \nBut some are not. In some cases, you have teachers who are competent in \ntheir area of specialty who are teaching other subjects in which they \nlack competence. When that happens, our children are the ones who \nsuffer. We need to know that those who teach our children are competent \nin the subjects they teach. We need competency testing for all \nteachers. Our children deserve nothing less than the best.\n  Our legislation will provide incentives for States and localities to \nadopt both of these vital measures: merit pay and competency testing. \nThe amendment is called ``Measures to Encourage Results in Teaching.'' \nIt is the MERIT Act.\n  Incentives are provided through the Eisenhower Professional \nDevelopment Program. The amendment sets aside 50 percent of the funds \nappropriated over fiscal year 1999 levels and then distributes it to \nStates that have established teacher testing and merit pay plans.\n  Last year, fiscal year 1998, Congress appropriated $335 million for \nthis program to subsidize training for teachers, an increase of $25 \nmillion from the year before. I support this effort to train teachers. \nBut I also believe that we have to be able to ensure that teachers are \nactually improving their teaching skills and children are benefiting. \nTeacher testing will accomplish this goal. I also want to reward \nteachers whose training creates magic in the classroom. Merit pay will \naccomplish this goal.\n  Under this amendment, as the Eisenhower Professional Development \nProgram funding increases, so will each State and local Government's \nshare. However, 50 percent of the increase will be reserved for those \nStates that put in place merit pay and teacher testing.\n  Mr. President, it is time to meet the challenges of massive, \nfundamental reform in education. Congress has repeatedly tried to \naddress the inadequacies in our schools by providing funding. I support \nmore funding for education. But we also have to recognize that funding \nalone will not make American schools competitive in the global economy. \nThere needs to be significant reforms--and merit pay and teacher \ntesting should be part of those reforms.\n  The fight to reform our public education system is a fight for \nAmerica's future. Our children are depending on us.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure, to guarantee that all \nstudents have the right to be taught by educated, confidence and \nqualified teachers--and to reward the truly outstanding teachers with \nmerit pay, those teachers who do create magic in the classroom.\n  Let's not let the status quo diminish the dream of our parents and \ngrandparents. The American people know the importance of this fight. \nThe fight to reform our public schools is a fight for America's future. \nOur children are depending on us. And I know that if we once again give \nour children the best teachers and the best schools, there is no limit \nto what they can achieve.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the A+ accounts \nbill, and I want to commend its chief Senate sponsor, Senator Paul \nCoverdell, for his leadership in bringing this bill to the floor.\n  Mr. President, this legislation does several things. It would allow \nmore people to save for education in tax-preferred education savings \naccounts. The savings could be used for higher education, as well as \neducation at the elementary and secondary levels. The bill would extend \nthe existing tax exclusion for employer-provided educational assistance \nthrough the year 2002, and it would make savings in qualified state \ntuition plans tax-free. It would also create a new category of tax-\nexempt facility bonds to assist with school construction in high-growth \nareas.\n  Mr. President, perhaps the most important part of the bill is also \nthe most controversial: the provisions that expand the allowable uses \nof education savings accounts to include elementary and secondary \neducation. These provisions would put additional resources under the \ncontrol of the people who know and understand the needs of children \nbest--their families.\n  Here is how it works. Families earning less than $95,000--$150,000 on \na joint tax return--could put up to $2,000 in after-tax dollars into \nspecial interest-bearing accounts for each child. The funds would \naccumulate tax free, and could be withdrawn for any educational \nexpense--from books and transportation to special programs and private-\nschool tuition.\n  A family saving just $10 per week could accumulate about $4,000 by \nthe time a newborn enters the first grade. Over the course of the \nchild's education, the money could be spent on a school uniform, \nspecial tutoring, a home computer, tuition at a private or parohial \nschool, an SAT preparation course, or any other educational expense. \nThis is one of the rare occasions in Washington when we are talking \nabout empowering parents--rather than government bureaucrats--to decide \nhow best to satisfy their children's educational needs. An estimated 14 \nmillion families are expected to take advantage of these new tax-\npreferred savings accounts.\n  Defenders of the status quo will throw up a series of arguments about \nwhy parents should not be trusted with more control over their \nchildren's education. Some will suggest that this will divert resources \nfrom public schools into private schools. Let me make two points about \nthat.\n  First, I think it is important to recall that we are not talking \nabout a new subsidy for private or parochial schools. To the contrary, \nwe are talking about allowing families to keep more of what they earn--\nafter all, it is their money--to send their children to the elementary \nor secondary school of their choice.\n  We already go far beyond what would be allowed by this bill when we \nprovide federal financial assistance to students at the college level, \nincluding students who attend private or religious institutions. No one \nargues that such choice harms public colleges or universities. In fact, \nit is choice and competition that has made our Nation's colleges and \nuniversities the best in the world. So I am perplexed why anyone would \nfear giving parents more choice and control at the elementary and \nsecondary levels, as well. That is where the real crisis in education \nexists today, and it is where choice and competition will do the most \ngood.\n  Second, providing families with tax incentives for education savings \nwill not decrease federal or state funding for public schools by a \nsingle dime. The fact is, Congress is likely to approve increases in \nfunding for education in addition to the incentives that would come \nwith the Coverdell bill. The budget resolution that we approved two \nweeks ago does exactly that, adhering to the spending levels set out in \nthe budget agreement negotiated between Congress and the President just \nlast year.\n  Here is what President Clinton said about the education-spending \nlevels in that agreement last July. These are his words:\n\n       * * * at the heart of this balanced budget [agreement] is \n     the historic investment in\n\n[[Page S3254]]\n\n     education--the most significant increase in education funding \n     in more than 30 years.\n\n  The most significant increase in education spending in a generation--\nthat is the level of funding that is provided under the budget we just \npassed, and it is in addition to the assistance provided under the \nCoverdell bill.\n  Another point: The people who stand to gain the most from this \nlegislation are those of more modest means who might not have the same \nchoice or opportunity without the help that the Coverdell bill would \nprovide. Of the people currently opting for Catholic schools, for \nexample, 68 percent have annual incomes of $35,000 or less. Wealthier \npeople obviously have the means to send their children to the school of \ntheir choice whether they receive a tax break or not. And in any event, \nwealthier taxpayers will not even qualify for the relief in this bill, \ngive the income thresholds that are set out in it.\n  It seems to me, Mr. President, that all of the agruments against the \nbill are based upon the flawed premise that public schools cannot \ncompete successfully with other institutions. They are wrong. Many \npublic schools have very well-regarded programs--programs that meet or \nexceed what is offered to students elsewhere--and it is likely that \nthese schools would not only retain their current student body, but add \nto it with barriers to choice removed. And with additional enrollment \nwould come additional funds for their budgets.\n  It is true that failing schools would be forced to improve or face \ndeclining enrollment. But is it really our goal to force students with \nfew financial resources to remain in a failing environment? Should they \nnot have the same options that others have to find a school that better \nmeets their needs?\n  In Senate hearings earlier this year, low-income parents questioned \nwhy the schoolhouse door is often closed to their children--why they \nare kept from moving their children to schools that can better meet \ntheir children's needs. Why, these parents wanted to know, are their \nkids denied the chance to attend safer schools? They are right to ask \nquestions. They deserve--their children deserve--access to a quality \neducation.\n  In my opinion, the single best thing we could do to improve the \nquality of education in this country is give parents more choice and \ncontrol over where they send their children. It is an idea with broad \nsupport among the American people. A 1997 poll conducted by the Center \nfor Education Reform found support for school choice among the general \npublic at 82 percent. The Joint Center for Political and Economic \nStudies reported support among African Americans at more than 70 \npercent. It is an idea whose time has come.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in support of the A+ bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2288\n\n(Purpose: To provide incentives for States to establish and administer \n periodic teacher testing and merit pay programs for elementary school \n                     and secondary school teachers)\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I have an amendment which I send to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Mack], for himself and Mr. \n     D'Amato, proposes an amendment numbered 2288.\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n          TITLE __--MEASURES TO ENCOURAGE RESULTS IN TEACHING\n\n     SEC. __01. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This title may be cited as the ``Measures \n     to Encourage Results in Teaching Act of 1998''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) All students deserve to be taught by well-educated, \n     competent, and qualified teachers.\n       (2) More than ever before, education has and will continue \n     to become the ticket not only to economic success but to \n     basic survival. Students will not succeed in meeting the \n     demands of a knowledge-based, 21st century society and \n     economy if the students do not encounter more challenging \n     work in school. For future generations to have the \n     opportunities to achieve success the future generations will \n     need to have an education and a teacher workforce second to \n     none.\n       (3) No other intervention can make the difference that a \n     knowledgeable, skillful teacher can make in the learning \n     process. At the same time, nothing can fully compensate for \n     weak teaching that, despite good intentions, can result from \n     a teacher's lack of opportunity to acquire the knowledge and \n     skill needed to help students master the curriculum.\n       (4) The Federal Government established the Dwight D. \n     Eisenhower Professional Development Program in 1985 to ensure \n     that teachers and other educational staff have access to \n     sustained and high-quality professional development. This \n     ongoing development must include the ability to demonstrate \n     and judge the performance of teachers and other instructional \n     staff.\n       (5) States should evaluate their teachers on the basis of \n     demonstrated ability, including tests of subject matter \n     knowledge, teaching knowledge, and teaching skill. States \n     should develop a test for their teachers and other \n     instructional staff with respect to the subjects taught by \n     the teachers and staff, and should administer the test every \n     3 to 5 years.\n       (6) Evaluating and rewarding teachers with a compensation \n     system that supports teachers who become increasingly expert \n     in a subject area, are proficient in meeting the needs of \n     students and schools, and demonstrate high levels of \n     performance measured against professional teaching standards, \n     will encourage teachers to continue to learn needed skills \n     and broaden teachers' expertise, thereby enhancing education \n     for all students.\n       (c) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are as follows:\n       (1) To provide incentives for States to establish and \n     administer periodic teacher testing and merit pay programs \n     for elementary school and secondary school teachers.\n       (2) To encourage States to establish merit pay programs \n     that have a significant impact on teacher salary scales.\n       (3) To encourage programs that recognize and reward the \n     best teachers, and encourage those teachers that need to do \n     better.\n\n     SEC. __02. STATE INCENTIVES FOR TEACHER TESTING AND MERIT \n                   PAY.\n\n       (a) Amendments.--Title II of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6601 et seq.) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating part D as part E;\n       (2) by redesignating sections 2401 and 2402 as sections \n     2501 and 2502, respectively; and\n       (3) by inserting after part C the following:\n\n      ``PART D--STATE INCENTIVES FOR TEACHER TESTING AND MERIT PAY\n\n     ``SEC. 2401.

Mr. President, I understand there are 15 minutes now on \neach side for the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. MACK. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n[[Page S3255]]\n\n  Today, Senator D'Amato and I are offering an amendment that would \nprovide incentives for States to establish teacher testing and merit \npay programs. I have said many times in the discussion about education \nthat our children deserve an education that is second to none. I have \nlistened to educators from my home state of Florida who have talked \nwith educators in other countries. The consensus is that competition \namong nations in the 21st century will not be based on natural \nresources or military power, but on knowledge.\n  I believe that they are correct, and if our children and our \ngrandchildren--and I am proud to state that I have three grandsons, 13, \n11 and 4--if they are going to have an opportunity to compete in the \n21st century, and if they are going to have an opportunity to \nexperience the opportunities that we have had, then they have to have \nan education that is second to none.\n  Good teachers are the backbone to a good education. All students \ndeserve to be taught by well-educated, competent and qualified \nteachers. Teachers make all the difference in the learning process. \nAmerica's classrooms are staffed with many dedicated, knowledgeable and \nhard-working teachers. But we need to reward teachers for their \nefforts.\n  I have traveled all around my State and, for that matter, around our \nNation trying to make myself more knowledgeable about the issues \nrelated to education. I have told the story many times about an \nexperience I had out in Los Angeles where I went to visit a school \ncalled the Marcus Garvey School and met the Administrator/Principal, \nAnyim Palmer. Mr. Palmer assigned a teacher to take my wife and I \naround the school.\n  I was excited, and in some ways almost overwhelmed with what I saw. \nThese youngsters, some of whom were 2 years old, could recite the \nalphabet in three languages. I want to restate that --2 years old, not \nsecond grade; 2 years old. There were 3-year-old children who could do \ncomplicated addition problems and 4-year-old students who could read at \nthe second and third grade level. A 5-year-old student stood up in \nfront of me and was asked by the teacher to recite all the Presidents \nof the United States in their proper chronological order, and the \nlittle fellow did it. I must tell you, the only reason I was sure he \nwas correct was because they gave me a piece of paper that I could \nfollow along with to make sure that he was doing it correctly. But he \nwas 5 years old.\n  I would like to also point out that Anyim Palmer challenged one of \nthe best private schools in the Los Angeles area's sixth grade students \nagainst his third grade students in math and English. And you know who \nwon--Anyim Palmer's Marcus Garvey School students.\n  Every single time I asked him how he accomplished this and what makes \nthis possible, the answer was simple, ``It's the teacher.'' ``It's the \nteacher.'' ``It's the teacher that makes the difference.'' That is why, \nin this education reform proposal, we have placed so much emphasis on \nthe abilities of teachers.\n  Let me give you a couple of statistics: 20 percent of English classes \nwere taught by teachers who did not have at least a minor in English, \nliterature, communications, speech, journalism, English education or \nreading education.\n  Another example: In our public schools today, 25 percent of \nmathematics classes were taught by teachers without at least a minor in \nmathematics or mathematics education; 39 percent of life science or \nbiology classes were taught by teachers without at least a minor in \nbiology or life sciences; 56 percent of physical science classes were \ntaught by teachers without at least a minor in physics, chemistry, \ngeology or Earth sciences. I could go on.\n  One additional point I want to make is that students in schools with \nthe highest minority enrollments have less than a 50-percent chance of \ngetting a science or mathematics teacher who holds a license and a \ndegree in the field he or she teaches.\n  Our amendment, which is referred to as the MERIT Act, rewards States \nthat test teachers on their subject matter knowledge and pays teachers \nbased on merit. Here is how it works:\n  We will make half of any additional funding over the fiscal year 1999 \nlevel for the Eisenhower Program available to States that periodically \ntest elementary and secondary school teachers and reward teachers based \non merit and proven performance.\n  There will be no reduction in current funding to States under this \nprogram based on this amendment. All current money being spent on this \nprogram is unaffected by this amendment. Only additional money will be \nused as an incentive.\n  Finally, this amendment also enables States to use Federal education \nmoney to establish and administer teacher testing and merit pay \nprograms.\n  Mr. President, I now yield to Senator D'Amato.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I want to commend my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Mack, for his work in this area. Indeed, he just did \nnot sit behind a desk and dream up a theory; he went out to see; he \nwent out to see that there are programs that do work. And reforming our \neducation system is the most important issue facing this Nation.\n  I think the parents and grandparents know that the public education \nsystem can do better. This is a fight for our children, and I think \nwhat we should be focusing on is putting the interests of our children \nfirst. That is the question. And we should not let the status quo \ndiminish the dream of our parents and our grandparents. The American \npeople know the importance of this fight.\n  The fight to reform our public schools is a fight for our future. And \nwhy shouldn't we say the best and the brightest teachers--those who \nmake magic in the classroom; those who make a difference--should be \nrewarded with merit pay? There are some who are opposed to this. Well, \nI have to tell you, we cannot pay teachers enough, those great and \ngifted teachers. This is one way to realize and to give them that kind \nof recognition that they are entitled to.\n  Secondly, a provision of this amendment that is most important says \nwe need teacher competency testing. Indeed, we see all too often where \nteachers are moved into areas that they do not have the excellence and \nthe competence to teach. A great English teacher, for example, being \nmoved into an area of science or mathematics may not be up to that \nparticular job. That is why we say--and, by the way, we do not impose \nthis; this is something that States can opt into. We do not believe in \nbig brother Government coming in and saying, ``This is the standard \nthat you have to use for determining a competence.'' That is up to the \nState and the local districts to develop the standards for competency \ntesting.\n  But in all sectors of life there are levels of competence that are \nexpected. Indeed, when it comes to the most important area, that of \neducating our children, should we do any less? I do not think so. In \nall areas of life, in terms of competition, including the business \nworld, there is merit pay. We hear about stock options for the \nsuccessful entrepreneur. In corporate America, we hear of bonuses for \nachieving certain levels.\n  Why should we not do the same? Bring those areas of the private \nsector into public education that work for the benefit of our children. \nAnd if we have truly outstanding and dedicated teachers, then why not \nreward them? Why not merit pay? Indeed, the teachers that make magic in \nour classrooms are sorely needed. It is about time we began to \nrecognize their efforts. They are truly extraordinary.\n  I believe that when we look at many of the educational institutions \ntoday, particularly in our inner cities, we see distress, we see a \nsystem that needs the kinds of reforms that this bill will begin to \nbring into the system. And so while it is not a cure-all, I believe it \nis a powerful step forward to giving our children the opportunity they \ndeserve.\n  I am pleased to cosponsor this amendment and urge my colleagues to be \nopen minded about it. Do not permit the special interest groups to put \nthe kind of pressure that will have them voting against the interests \nof our children. It is about time we put the interests of our children \nfirst.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I did not want to reply to the debate that \nis\n\n[[Page S3256]]\n\ngoing on here, the discussion going on. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Democratic time on the Mack-D'Amato amendment be reserved and that \nI be permitted to offer an amendment of my own.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2017\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to the \nCoverdell educational IRA bill. I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nLandrieu be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GLENN. This amendment will simply delete the K-12 expenses as an \nauthorized deduction for education IRAs. The amendment will keep the \nincrease in the annual allowable contribution from the current $500 to \nthe maximum $2,000 a year.\n  Deleting K-12 and increasing the allowable contribution returns \neducation IRAs to their original purpose of providing incentive savings \nfor higher education expenses. I believe we should be looking at this \nbill for what it is; it is tax support for private school education, \npure and simple.\n  Also, I believe this is bad education policy and it is bad tax \npolicy. And let me tell you why.\n  We go back to the days of our forefathers: our own parents and \ngrandparents and great, great grandparents coming to this country from \nEurope, where many were escaping persecution. One of the big things \nthat they wanted for their children was an education. That's because \neducation was, pure and simple, not for everybody. Education was only \nfor the kids from the castle, or education was for the rich, or \neducation was for the politically connected. And there were two kinds \nof people in those lands in Europe that our forefathers came from: \nwealthy and poor, educated and uneducated.\n  When they landed in this country of ours and started expanding and \nstarted setting up communities, and became a United States of America, \nthey knew that if democracy was to succeed, if they were not to return \nto serfdom, and ruled by a few, that education was not a choice; in a \ndemocracy it was a must or the democracy was doomed.\n  The freedom to be educated spread to States and communities where \npublic schools were established for all. That idea expanded and caught \nfire and took root. It was the beginning of our system of public \neducation in this country. The public, taxpayers, continue to pay for \nthis educational system. And, out of that education of all has come \nresearch, has come commitment, has come economics, has come \nagriculture, has come business, has come industry, has come health, has \ncome standards of living that are the envy of the world; we have had \nlonger life expectancy, all of those things, and more, because of \nuniversal education, the best we can have for our people.\n  At the same time, if people, for religious reasons or beliefs, want \neducation which reflects this or they want a particular kind of \neducation--it used to be all-boys schools, all-girls schools, whatever; \nwe supported that as long as those schools--were not supported with \npublic money. We supported the right of people to have private schools, \nand support private schools as long as they paid for them. But the \nGovernment response was and is to provide not just a satisfactory \neducational system in this country, not just an educational system that \nwill get us by, not just one that is OK, but what we should be shooting \nfor is the best educational system in this world for all of our \ncitizens in this country, through a public educational system.\n\n  Public school systems now are having some problems, that is true. It \nis not much wonder when we look how they are set up. We don't have a \nnational education as such. I am not proposing here today we suddenly \nsay all States and local communities are taken out of the picture here \nand we are going to go to a national school system as other nations \nhave. As a matter of fact, every major industrialized nation in the \nworld has a national school system.\n  But our school system in this country has come under some stress. It \nis no wonder, when we think back in the early days of this country when \nwe had a tax for schools, it was paid for basically by the property \nowners. Back then we didn't have a NASDAQ, a New York stock exchange, \nan American stock exchange and mutual funds all over the place for \npeople to invest in. Most of the people capable of supporting schools \nhad their money in property, in real estate, real property. So it was \nnatural that a property tax was put in place, and those people were the \nones who wound up supporting most of our school systems.\n  As it developed, we had other problems because today no longer is a \nproperty tax indicative of the wealth of this country, because two-\nthirds of our economy is now generated from the service industries in \nour society. So it is no wonder the property tax has become unpopular \nwith an awful lot of people.\n  Plus, we have another problem, too, in this country as far as making \nsure we get a good education for everyone. As Lester Thurow has been \npointing out in his last couple of books, our basic K-through-12 \neducation system in this country is run by 15,000 independent school \nboards all getting elected on the basis of ``We won't raise your \ntaxes.'' That is some system. I think it is amazing that it has worked \nas well as it has up until now.\n  Our K-through-12 education gets a little over 5 percent of their \nfunding from the Federal Government. It is not something where the \nFederal Government tries to run the whole school system. But that is a \nlittle bit of background on what I think is very important: that every \nsingle child in this country should be able to get the finest, the best \neducation of any place in this world. We should not be siphoning money \noff of our public education system to provide vouchers for private \nschools.\n  This is my 24th year as a U.S. Senator representing the people of \nOhio. In that time, I have seen many attempts to divert Federal funds \nfrom public to private schools. The approaches to accomplish this goal \nhave been many--tuition tax credits, vouchers, school choice, and now \neducational IRAs for elementary and secondary education. These \nproposals all allow parents to select which school their children will \nattend and thereby competition, supposedly, with public schools. It is \nthe presumed goal they will improve students' performance as a result \nof competition. There are problems coming up because public and private \nschools don't compete on an even basis. Private schools, unlike public \nschools, can refuse to accept students with disabilities or discipline \nproblems and are not subjected to the same requirements.\n  Each time these proposals come before the Senate, I am proud to say I \nhave cast my vote in opposition because I firmly believe we must have \nthe finest public school system in the world. That is what the \nGovernment should be supporting--not putting money off into other \nexperiments. I want parents to exercise their right and responsibility \nto decide the school their children will attend--public, private, \nparochial. Nothing wrong with choice. However, it is not the \nresponsibility of the Federal Government to pay them to do so.\n  As I see it, the Coverdell IRA is a backdoor voucher that will do \nnothing to improve public schools, which are my main concern, for our \npublic school children. This new IRA tax subsidy provides tax breaks \nfor educational expenses, including tuition and fees at public, \nprivate, and religious schools.\n\n  Also, the bill does not target needy families. In fact, here is one \nof the facts I was very much interested in: Families in the top 20 \npercent of income in this country--the top 20 percent of income in this \ncountry--would receive 70 percent of the benefit. The Joint Committee \non Taxation estimates that more than half the savings would go to \nfamilies whose children would attend private school anyway. So the bill \nsubsidizes the savings and spending patterns that already exist. Let me \nrepeat that: 70 percent of the benefit would go to families already in \nthe top 20 percent of income.\n  In other words, the analogy I made a little while ago regarding the \nland of our forefathers in Europe, where education was for the wealthy, \nfor the privileged, for the kids from the castle, we are now taking a \nstep back in that direction by helping mainly those who are already \nwell enough off to send their children to private or parochial schools.\n\n[[Page S3257]]\n\n  As I stated, qualified educational expense is defined in the bill to \ninclude tuition, fees, tutoring, special needs services, books, \nsupplies and equipment, including computers. The expenses must be \nincurred in connection with the beneficiary's enrollment in a public, \nprivate, or parochial elementary or secondary school, and the funds may \nbe used to pay for expenses such as room and board and uniforms and \ntransportation.\n  Let me give a little bit of personal experience from Ohio. Cleveland, \nOH, has one of only two voucher programs in the country. The other one \nis in Milwaukee. In Ohio, this program permits State funds to be used \nto send low-income children to private schools. It is the only program \nthat allows the children to attend religious schools with taxpayer \nfunds. It is funded at $12.5 million over 2 years. Right now, the \nlegality of the program is being challenged and it is before the Ohio \nState Supreme Court now.\n  Let me say this, the program has been in effect now for 2 years. In \nsurveys made recently of how the academics are going with the children \nin these schools, it is not all that great. So far, they have not been \nable to show any real results where the kids that are going to these \nprivate schools are any better off academically than they would have \nbeen in public school. Some of the proponents of the voucher system in \nOhio and Cleveland say it hasn't had long enough to take effect yet. We \nare close to the end of the second year of this program now and testing \nhas not shown much difference at all.\n  Another problem that was unforeseen--and this may seem like a minor \nproblem and maybe not one that will be a problem nationally, but it \nshows we have some unforeseen consequences sometimes when we start \nsomething like this. That is paying for taxicabs. Paying for cabs to \ncarry children to private schools is one of the reasons the school \nchoice program is in jeopardy in Cleveland. This is no small item. \nStudents' taxi rides account for more than half of the $4.8 million \ndeficit in Cleveland's 2-year-old school voucher program. More than \nhalf of the deficit goes to providing kids taxicab rides basically \nbecause the school officials had no yellow bus transportation available \nfor the voucher students.\n  So sometimes there are unintended consequences. The voucher program \nhad to turn to taxi firms and provide payments to parents in lieu of \ntransportation services. The image of children riding taxicabs to \nprivate schools because the Cleveland public schools could not \naccommodate them on its yellow schoolbuses is one example of the \nstructural deficiencies in the program and one of the main reasons why \nsome Clevelanders are pretty much up in arms over this. I have a couple \nof newspaper articles that I will later have included in the Record.\n  Now, as I mentioned, there is no strong evidence so far that \nparticipation in a voucher program increases student achievement. We \nneed to have a better understanding of what makes a school successful \nbecause we institute a program that benefits comparatively few. Instead \nof looking for incentives for parents to send their children to private \nschools, I believe it is far more important we take steps toward \nstrengthening public education across the board in this country and not \ntrying to find ways to take money off and put it into the private \nschool systems.\n  A strong educational system must be a fundamental part of our effort \nto keep our country strong and keep it competitive. Only by making \nhigh-quality education available to all American children, not just a \nfew, but all American children, will we help develop the skills they \nneed to find meaningful, high-wage jobs while developing a capable and \nproductive work force that is essential to the economic future of this \ncountry.\n  Education reform is one of the top issues in this country. That is \nwhy I continue to oppose attempts to encourage the use of Federal funds \nfor nonpublic education, whether in the form of tuition tax credits, \nvouchers, or school choice. I believe that including K-12 in \neducational IRAs would be the first step toward establishing a \npermanent voucher system, one that bleeds off dollars needed in our \npublic schools.\n  We have a system of public education in this country that is \navailable to all children. We need to make it the best and the finest \nin the world, one that is second to none in this world if our children \nare going to be competitive in the future. This education system is not \nproducing the high level of achievement this Nation now needs, and we \ncannot abandon them and say we are going to bring up a favorite few and \nsend them off to other schools. Rather, we need to find ways to make \nimprovements.\n  That is why I support another amendment that will be proposed, and \nthat is the school construction amendment--an initiative that will help \nreduce classroom size. These will directly benefit all of our Nation's \npublic schools by ensuring all children attend safe, modern public \nschools.\n  I clearly believe that everybody should be saving for their \nchildren's education--for their higher education. The difference \nbetween elementary and secondary education and higher education is \nimportant. Every single child in this country is entitled to a free, \nappropriate, tuition-free education in every State in this Nation. \nHigher education, on the other hand--once you get above the minimums of \nthe high school level--is optional and is tuition-based. It is hard for \nparents to save for college. I believe it is appropriate to provide \nincentives for them to do so. I have supported the prepaid tuition \nplans in the State of Ohio as one of the ways students can be assured a \nquality education at one of Ohio's universities or colleges.\n  This amendment I am offering returns the educational IRAs back to its \noriginal purpose--higher education expenses only. The only change I \nmake is to keep the annual increase in the contribution limit for \neducation IRAs, which goes from $500 to $2,000. This increase in the \ncontribution limit will enable parents to save more per year for higher \neducation.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment. Again, \nI ask my colleagues to look at this bill for what it is--a tax break \nfor private school education. I believe it is bad education policy and \nbad tax policy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two articles--one from \nthe Washington Times and one from the Washington Post--be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Jan. 19, 1998]\n\nStudent Taxi Rides Imperil School Choice in Cleveland--Half of Programs \n                    Deficit Comes From Lack of Buses\n\n                           (By Carol Innerst)\n\n       Paying for taxicabs to carry children to private schools \n     may jeopardize a landmark school-choice policy in Cleveland.\n       Student taxi rides account for more than half of the $4.8 \n     million deficit in Cleveland's 2-year-old school-voucher \n     program. The deficit has sparked political criticism of Ohio \n     Gov. George V. Voinovich, one of the program's biggest \n     supporters.\n       ``At a time when Ohio needs leadership to solve our \n     education crisis, Voinovich has spent millions on a program \n     that does nothing to help our 1.8 million public school \n     children,'' said David J. Leland, chairman of the Ohio \n     Democratic Party.\n       ``The public is pretty upset,'' said Ohio researcher Sam \n     Staley. ``The public is not very happy with this. It is a \n     problem that should have been resolved before this.''\n       At least $2.7 million of the shortfall in the controversial \n     program--one of only two voucher systems in the nation--in \n     attributed to voucher students who ride taxicabs to private \n     schools because the Cleveland Public Schools cannot \n     accommodate then on its yellow school buses.\n       Although the governor's office projected confidence over \n     weathering the political storm, the image of children riding \n     taxis to school is a hard one for the public to digest, \n     according to Mr. Staley, vice president for research of the \n     Buckeye Institute, a market-based Ohio think tank.\n       ``It will give people who opposed the scholarship program \n     an opportunity to kill the program,'' he said. ``They will \n     use this as a way to go after the program even though it goes \n     against the views of their own constituency. The voucher \n     program is most among minority and poor people in \n     Cleveland.''\n       The $4.8 million shortfall left the governor scrambling to \n     find money to preserve the voucher program. The legislature, \n     now in session, signaled that it did not want to encumber \n     the next education budget with the problem.\n       ``We will identify a legislative or financial vehicle to \n     make up for the funding shortfall,'' said Tom Needles, \n     executive assistant to the governor.\n       ``There are structural deficiencies in the program that \n     need to be fixed, but the governor is confident this is a \n     valuable program yielding positive results,'' Mr. Needles \n     said. ``We've begun very intensive discussions\n\n[[Page S3258]]\n\n     with various transportation officials and others to determine \n     our options and what are the best alternatives for remedying \n     this problem.''\n       The Ohio voucher program is one of only two in the nation--\n     the other is in Milwaukee--that permit state funds to be used \n     to send low-income children to private schools. It is the \n     only program that allows them to attend religious schools. It \n     was funded at $12.5 million over two years.\n       Ohio affiliates of the 950,000-member American Federation \n     of Teachers and the 2.3 million-member National Education \n     Association have challenged the legality of the program, and \n     the case is now before the Ohio State Supreme Court, where \n     arguments could be scheduled this spring, according to the \n     Institute for Justice, which is defending the program. Last \n     year the court allowed the program to continue for another \n     academic year while its legal status is being decided.\n       Bert L. Holt, a former administrator for Cleveland Public \n     Schools who was hired by the Ohio State Department of \n     Education to administer the Scholarship and Tutoring Program, \n     said the idea from the inception of the program ``was to try \n     to get as many children on yellow buses as possible.''\n       But Cleveland public schools officials said all they could \n     do was provide payment to parents in lieu of transportation \n     service, she said. When schools opened in 1996, no yellow bus \n     transportation was available for the voucher students. After \n     talking to two private bus companies, the voucher program had \n     to turn to two taxi firms. One bus company was too costly and \n     the other couldn't adjust routes to do the pickups.\n       ``I think Cleveland schools at the time didn't consider it \n     a priority,'' Mrs. Holt said. ``The voucher program was \n     controversial and also maybe it wasn't being taken \n     seriously.''\n       In November, 1996, Cleveland public schools began providing \n     bus service to seven of the private schools and in March 1997 \n     they were able to provide buses for an additional eight \n     schools, she said.\n       This school year, 38 yellow school buses are taking 516 \n     kindergarten through fourth-graders to 18 private schools, \n     she said. Another 1,077 voucher students are riding taxicabs \n     and 1,395 are within walking distance of their schools.\n       There are 55 private schools participating in the voucher \n     program, and only five don't have taxis dropping off \n     students, she said.\n       The program anticipates increasing the number of \n     participants to 4,000 students in the 1998-99 school year, \n     according to Mrs. Holt. The maximum tuition the state will \n     pay is $2,500 a year, with parents paying $250 of that. The \n     average tuition runs less than that--$1,831 in the 1996-97 \n     school year and projected at $1,939 this school year.\n       The Ohio Democratic Party was helping to trumpet the budget \n     deficit in the voucher program.\n       ``George Voinovich is giving his seal of approval on his \n     program that has wasted nearly 5 million taxpayer dollars,'' \n     a press release from party headquarters stated.\n       Voucher defenders say such criticism is unfair.\n       ``The hue and cry is over transportation, busing,'' said \n     Mrs. Holt. ``It's never about education and removing the \n     caste system that has been allowed to occur with our children \n     in urban settings who are socioeconomically deprived. Now \n     they have access to private education and are doing well, and \n     people in various corners have an agenda and don't want to \n     see it happen.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Apr. 8, 1998]\n\n            In Cleveland, Vouchers Fail To Raise Test Scores\n\n                           (By Rene Sanchez)\n\n       A new evaluation of one of the nation's few school voucher \n     programs has found that students using the tuition stipends \n     to pay for private education are not achieving better test \n     scores than similar students who are still in public schools.\n       The two-year-old Cleveland program gives 3,000 needy \n     students publicly funded scholarships worth as much as $2,250 \n     to attend private schools. Advocates have touted the idea, \n     which is one of the most divisive education issues in the \n     country, as a way to give better learning opportunities to \n     children trapped in failing public schools.\n       But in a new report commissioned by the state of Ohio, \n     researchers contend that the promise of Cleveland's voucher \n     experiment so far has not been fulfilled. They found ``no \n     significant differences'' in achievement in either reading, \n     math or science between students using vouchers and a \n     comparable sample from Cleveland's public schools. Both \n     groups of students were assessed near the end of the voucher \n     program's first year.\n       And in a separate measure of the program's performance, a \n     new audit is raising questions about how some of its funds \n     are being spent. Students with vouchers, for example, have \n     spent a total of about $1.4 million in state money to take \n     taxicabs to class, rather than the school buses they would \n     ride if they were part of Cleveland's public school system.\n       Opponents of vouchers said that both findings show how \n     flawed the voucher idea is. ``It's a significant early signal \n     that this is not a magic bullet by any means for educating \n     poor children,'' said Sandra Feldman, president of the \n     American Frederation of Teachers.\n       Only one other city, Milwaukee, allows students to use \n     vouchers, but Republican leaders in Congress have the idea \n     atop their education agenda. Arguing that public schools \n     would benefit from competition and that poor parents deserve \n     more educational choices for their children, they are \n     proposing to use federal money to create similar voucher \n     programs for students in the District and several dozen other \n     cities.\n       President Clinton adamantly opposes that plan. He and other \n     voucher opponents say the idea would drain money and civic \n     support from the public schools that need it most. Critics \n     also contend that letting students use vouchers for religious \n     schools, as both Cleveland and Milwaukee want to do, is \n     unconstitutional.\n       The new report on Cleveland's program focuses only on the \n     question of academic achievement. Those who support vouchers \n     cautioned against drawing too much from its conclusions. They \n     said judging the academic work of students will take more \n     time.\n       ``We're still very confident that over the long term, these \n     students will show more gains in their academic scores,'' \n     said Tom Needle, the education adviser to Ohio Gov. George V. \n     Voinovich (R), who pushed for the voucher plan. ``It's not \n     surprising to see these findings at the very beginning of a \n     program.''\n       Needle also said that a privately funded study of \n     Cleveland's program conducted last year by a Harvard \n     University professor showed that students using vouchers are \n     making more academic strides. It also reported great \n     enthusiasm for the program among their parents.\n       In the latest evaluation, researchers at Indiana University \n     compared the achievement of 94 students using vouchers with \n     494 students still enrolled in Cleveland public schools. Both \n     groups were tested before the voucher program began and near \n     the end of its first year. Their scores in every subject \n     tested were roughly the same. Both groups were third-graders \n     with virtually the same backgrounds: Nearly all of them were \n     African American or Hispanic children living in poverty and \n     with only one parent at home.\n       As has been the case in every attempt to assess Milwaukee's \n     voucher program, the methodology that researchers have used \n     in Cleveland is provoking disputes.\n       But the audit, which suggested that oversight of some \n     voucher funds has been lax, already is prompting changes. The \n     number of taxicabs that students are using, Needle said, has \n     been cut by more than two-thirds. Also, the next group of \n     students who receive vouchers and lack private means of \n     transportation will have to select private schools in walking \n     distance from their homes, or ones that are near city bus \n     routes.\n       ``Their choice of schools will have to be limited \n     somewhat,'' he said.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2017\n\n   (Purpose: To delete education IRA expenditures for elementary and \n                       secondary school expenses)\n\n  Mr. GLENN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that our side \nbe accorded time similar to that which was just utilized by the Senator \nfrom Ohio so that both sides will have had approximately the same \namount of time for the amendment.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. This \namendment would not permit educational IRAs to be used to pay the \nexpenses of kindergarten up through 12th grade. This proposal to limit \nthe use of educational IRAs would dramatically--I want to emphasize \n``dramatically''--reduce the benefits of an educational IRA for \nAmerican families.\n  I believe that it is a fundamental principle that a parent should \nhave the right and the ability to make decisions about his or her \nchild's education --to decide basic questions, such as how the child \nshould be educated and where the child should attend school. The rich \nshould not be the only ones that too often have this choice--although \nthere are many, many children from middle-class families who attend \nprivate schools at great personal sacrifice of their families.\n  What we seek here is to give a choice to all families as to where \ntheir child will attend school. We should not try to control that \nparental right by providing tax benefits only to those parents who make \nwhat some Members of this body consider to be the correct choice. We \nshould all remember that last year, when the Senate passed a variety of \nprovisions targeted towards helping American families cope with the \ncosts of a quality education, we made no distinction between public and \nprivate schools or between higher education and secondary or elementary \nschools.\n  For example, we did not say that an educational IRA would only be \navailable if a student attended public school or college. We did not \nsay that a student who attended the University of Maryland would \nreceive a tax benefit, but a student who attended George Washington \nUniversity would receive nothing. We did not say that a student who \nattended college would receive a tax benefit, but a student who \nincurred costs in connection with secondary or elementary school would \nreceive nothing.\n  The bottom line was that we treated all schools the same. And the \nreason for that treatment is that we did not consider it our business \nto set up a system where some schools were favored over others.\n  Mr. President, we should also not forget that it is the taxpayer who \nfunds the education IRA. It is the parents--the parent who put his or \nher hard-earned money into the education IRA. And it seems a matter of \ncommon sense, therefore, that the parents should be able to choose how \nto spend that money.\n  To fully receive the benefits of an education IRA, parents should try \nto establish accounts for their schoolchildren as early as possible. If \nthe parent can afford to make contributions early in a child's life, \nthe benefits of the education IRA will increase dramatically through \nthe magic of tax-free compounding within the IRA. At this early stage \nin a child's life, parents may not know whether they will send their \nchildren to a private or public school. Parents also may not know \nwhether they will need the benefits of an education IRA for elementary \nand secondary school or for higher education.\n  There are many, many factors that go into these important decisions. \nThe needs of the child may change. The family may move into a different \nschool district. The quality of the neighborhood schools may rise or \nfall. It is simply unfair to make the parent look into a crystal ball \nand predict what type of school their child may attend or how much that \nschool may cost. This places too great of an unnecessary burden on the \nparent.\n  The side effect of that burden of making parents look into the future \nis that parents may be reluctant to fully utilize the education IRA. \nThe parents may not contribute the maximum amount of money that they \ncan to these accounts. That, Mr. President, would be most unfortunate \nbecause it would defeat the whole purpose of the education IRA concept.\n  Moreover, Mr. President, the existing provisions of the bill do not \nfavor the wealthy, as some here have argued.\n  First of all, there is an adjusted gross income phaseout. In other \nwords, only parents with incomes below a certain threshold can take \nadvantage of the tax savings in the education IRA.\n  Second, it simply is not true that only rich kids attend private \nschools. As I said earlier, many, many children from middle-class \nfamilies attend private schools at great personal sacrifice on the part \nof their parents. For instance, according to the National Catholic \nEducation Association, of the families with children in Catholic \nschools, almost 70 percent of those families have incomes below \n$35,000; almost 90 percent of those families have incomes below \n$50,000.\n  If we adopt this amendment, all of those families will be shut out \nfrom receiving the tax benefits in the education IRA, as would all of \nthe roughly 38 million families who have children in either public or \nprivate elementary and secondary schools.\n  Mr. President, limiting the education IRA is not good policy, and it \ndoes not make sense for American families. Accordingly, I oppose this \namendment, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n\n[[Page S3260]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's side has 26 minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, will the Chair notify this Senator when \n15 minutes remain?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Very well.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Senator from \nDelaware, the chairman of the Finance Committee, and his message with \nregard to the amendment that has just been offered by the Senator from \nOhio.\n  I would like to just reiterate several key points.\n  The Senator from Ohio infers that the education savings account \ndirects public money to a private school. This is not correct. All of \nthe money in the education savings accounts is after-tax dollars saved \nby families, whether their children are in public schools, or private, \nor home schools. These are not public dollars, they are private \ndollars, No. 1.\n  No. 2, the suggestion, to me, is egregious that if, for whatever \nreason, a family had chosen that their child would go to a private \nschool, they would be disallowed from creating a savings account, as a \nfamily would that has made the decision to send their child to a public \nschool. It is important to note that according to the Joint Tax \nCommittee, 70 percent of the families who use these savings accounts \nwould have children in public schools, 30 percent would have children \nin private schools.\n  Mr. President, the education savings account that we are debating \nhere today is identical to the education savings account that the \nPresident and the Senate and House confirmed and put into law last \nyear. It is identical. That savings account that was celebrated on the \nWhite House Lawn allowed a family to save $500 a year, and whatever \ninterest was earned would be tax free if it was used for higher \neducation--higher education at the University of Georgia, or higher \neducation at Georgetown just down the street, or higher education at \nthe University of Texas, or higher education at Southern Methodist \nUniversity. All we are proposing is that the account be allowed to be \nlarger so it would be meaningful to save up to $2,000 and have the same \ncriteria, which means that most of these benefits and most of these \nsavings will flow to people who make less than $75,000 a year.\n  But, again, I want to reiterate, the very criterion, the very \ninstrument, which the House and Senate passed, the President signed, \nand we all celebrated, is identical to this savings account except that \nthis savings account could be larger, more meaningful, and this savings \naccount would apply to kindergarten through high school, not just \ncollege. It is the only difference.\n  So I find it interesting that the Senator from Ohio would want to \ndeny a family who has a child in kindergarten through high school from \ngoing to a private school but it is OK if they go to a private college, \nor to be worried about the income of the family that is going to take \nadvantage of it when he wasn't worried about it when we were talking \nabout a family that might send their children to college. Why are we \nsuddenly setting a different set of criteria for families with children \nat kindergarten through high school? It is just perplexing.\n  I want to reiterate that this savings account, on which the chairman \nis so knowledgeable on the concept of IRAs, is identical in who can use \nit, who can't, how it can be used, and how it can't be used as the \nHouse and Senate passed last year, signed by the President, and \ncelebrated by everybody. The only thing we have done is to represent \nthat it allow people to save more and allow them to use it not just for \ncollege but for kindergarten through high school. They can use it for \ncollege, too, if they want. They can use it, if they have a disabled \nstudent, after college. But it is the same as the one that was adopted. \nSo these arguments are suspicious. It sounds to me as if this amendment \nis designed to defend the status quo.\n\n  Now, the Senator from Ohio said, in effect, that we have some \nproblems in kindergarten through high school, that some of the data, a \nlot of the data, are suggesting that we have people coming out of these \nschools who have trouble reading and writing and adding and \nsubtracting. And so giving families tools that might help them deal \nwith that, whether the child is in a public or private school, whether \nthe child needs a tutor or a home computer, there is no American child \nwhose family has made a decision about where they can best get that \neducation, that we should strap or put an anvil around their leg over \nsome philosophic exercise up here in defense of the National Education \nAssociation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand that the amendment of the \nSenator from Ohio is pending. Am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As I also understand, having been recognized, I can also \nspeak on the bill itself. Am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would take unanimous consent to speak on \nthe bill. We are now on the amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As I understand, I can temporarily set aside the pending \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent to temporarily set it aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I object.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nthat the time be divided equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask that the amendment that is pending \nbe temporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2289\n\n (Purpose: To provide an additional 100,000, well-qualified elementary \n  and secondary school teachers annually to the national pool of such \n teachers during the 10-year period beginning with 1999 through a new \n                   student loan forgiveness program)\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2289.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike section 101, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 101. LOAN FORGIVENESS FOR TEACHERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Our Nation is witnessing a 10-year rise in the \n     elementary and secondary school age population. Between the \n     fall of 1996 and the fall of 2006, total elementary and \n     secondary school enrollment will rise from a record \n     51,700,000 to 54,600,000, a rise of approximately 3,000,000 \n     children. Elementary school enrollment is projected to grow \n     by 2 percent, from 37,300,000 to 38,100,000, while secondary \n     school enrollment is expected to rise by 15 percent, from \n     14,400,000 to 16,500,000.\n       (2) In addition to the enrollment increases, many of the \n     Nation's elementary and secondary school teachers working in \n     1998 will begin to reach retirement age. According to the \n     National Center for Education Statistics data, between one-\n     third and one-half of all elementary and secondary school \n     teachers are 45 years old or older. Qualified, experienced \n     elementary and secondary school teachers will be leaving the \n     profession at a time when the demand for the teachers is at \n     the highest level in our Nation's history.\n       (3) There is a lack of qualified elementary and secondary \n     school teachers in specific geographic and content areas. \n     More than one-\n\n[[Page S3261]]\n\n     half, 56 percent, of secondary school students taking \n     physical science courses are taught by teachers who have no \n     background in physical science. Twenty-seven percent of \n     secondary school students taking any level mathematics course \n     are taught by teachers with no mathematics background. \n     Students in inner-city schools have only a 50 percent chance \n     of being taught by a qualified mathematics or science \n     teacher. States that have large percentages of classes taught \n     by teachers without a background in a particular subject \n     area, such as Tennessee (26.5 percent), Florida (26.4 \n     percent), Louisiana (26.2 percent), and Maryland (25.6 \n     percent), demonstrate the need for increased numbers of \n     elementary and secondary school teachers with the necessary \n     qualifications.\n       (4) Our Nation must address the need described in paragraph \n     (3) to ensure a qualified elementary and secondary school \n     teacher for every child in every elementary and secondary \n     school course.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to create a \n     Federal student loan forgiveness program to attract \n     individuals to careers as elementary and secondary school \n     teachers.\n       (c) Loan Forgiveness for Teachers.--Part B of title IV of \n     the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1071 et seq.) is \n     amended by inserting after section 428J (20 U.S.C. 1078-10) \n     the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 428K.

Mr. President, as I understand it, now there is 15 \nminutes for the proponents of the amendment; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n\n                         privilege of the floor\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 10 minutes. I ask unanimous consent \nConnie Garner, a legislative fellow in my office, be granted floor \nprivileges during debate on the Coverdell tax bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the amendment, which hopefully we will \nhave more of an opportunity to debate later this week, deals with \nmeeting the demand for qualified teachers in this country. We are \nseeing an expansion of the number of students in our elementary-\nsecondary education. This amendment would provide for an increase of \n100,000 schoolteachers a year for the next 10 years. It would \neffectively meet half of the Nation's requirements to do so.\n  There are very compelling reasons to support this amendment if we are \ngoing to be serious about ensuring the adequacy of the academic \nachievement and accomplishment for those students who are attending our \npublic schools. We have devised a way of doing this through a loan \nforgiveness program that is taking the concept, for example, of the \nNational Health Service Corps--which is a resounding success. Doctors \nserve in underserved areas and see a diminution of their debt with the \nyears of service in the Health Service Corps. Given the need that we \nhave for teachers to serve in our schools, this would provide an \nincentive for those who have indebtedness and would like to work as \nschoolteachers but are unable to do so because they are required to go \nto other jobs that may have more financial reward although they would \nprefer to work in the schools. This provides the means for them to do \nso. I plan to speak of that at greater length tomorrow or the next day \nand will take the opportunity to do so at that time, when the \nleadership works out the scheduling of the particular amendments.\n  Mr. President, given the shortage of time, I just want to come back \nto some rather fundamental and basic issues that are involved in this \ndebate. When all is said and done and when all the explanations are \nmade, I think it is appropriate that we find out who are going to be \nthe winners and who are going to be the losers. It is always \ninteresting to listen to our colleagues explain what they hope might be \nachieved by the amendment, and then also examine what, in fact, will be \nachieved by this amendment and who will benefit from this particular \namendment.\n  As we had seen during our earlier debate and discussion on the \nCoverdell amendment, there are some very important winners and \nimportant losers. But the fact remains that, according to the Joint Tax \nCommittee--which is neither a Republican committee nor a Democratic \ncommittee, but serves to provide technical information on the impact of \na tax proposal to the membership, that the bill gives the benefit to \nthose going to the private schools. At the present time, nationwide, 93 \npercent of American families send their children to the public schools, \n7 percent to the private schools. We certainly know the important role \nprivate schools have in our society. But with scarce resources we have \nto ask the question whether we want to use scarce resources to add to \nthe private schools or to the public schools. I do not believe we \nshould abandon the public school system in this country. I think we \nhave a responsibility to the public schools. If we have scarce \nresources, we ought to find ways of targeting scarce resources in ways \nthat can be academically important and enhance the ability of our \nchildren to make progress in the public schools.\n\n  So, with the analysis that was done by the Joint Tax Committee, they \nindicated where the money would go. Mr. President, 48 percent of the \ntax benefit would go to families that send their children to the public \nschools and 52 percent would go to families that send them to the \nprivate schools. Then, if you see that only 7 percent of Americans go \nto private schools, you see that a majority of the benefit of this \nproposal will go to a relatively small number of families who are \nsending their children to the private schools.\n  That is not what the Senator from Massachusetts is saying; that is \nwhat the Joint Tax Committee tells us. We have a certain amount of \nresources that will be collected through the tax system. When they are \ncollected, they will be disposed of--at least according to the Joint \nTax Committee estimate--in this way. There are better ways to spend \npublic tax dollars. An after-school program, could benefit the 5 \nmillion children who left school just about a half-hour ago, and will \ngo home without any supervision. Maybe we should have the kinds of \nprograms that we have seen that are effective, which provide some \nopportunity for those children to go to after-school programs, where \nthey are able to work with their homework and get that\n\n[[Page S3262]]\n\nhomework done so when they finally go back home to their parents, one \nor two of whom may be working, that they can have quality time with \ntheir parents rather than having the parents telling them you better go \nupstairs and get your homework done.\n  This is really a basic, fundamental issue, whether we have sufficient \nfunds that are available to the Congress where we want to try to \nprovide this kind of benefit to a relatively small group of parents. I \ndo not think that we do.\n  I have heard a lot from our colleagues on the other side talking \nabout entitlements. There was a great debate about entitlements here on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate over the last 3 or 4 years. This basically \nis a new entitlement. This is a new entitlement by our Republican \nfriends. We heard the criticisms of so many entitlements over the past. \nNow we have the creation of a new entitlement. Once this is passed and \ngoes into the Internal Revenue Code, it will be out there available to \nanyone who would be able to develop this kind of an IRA. That \neffectively is an entitlement. But it is an entitlement that is going \nto benefit a relatively small group of families who are going to be \nusing those resources primarily in the private schools.\n\n  There may be those who feel that is the way we ought to go. But I \nthink you will find here on our side, on the Democratic side, a range \nof different proposals that say we will not abandon our public schools \nin this country. We think they need modernization, they need some help \nand assistance in the construction program. We are very creative. An \nimportant, significant amendment will be offered by the Senator from \nIllinois, Carol Moseley-Braun. There will be programs that will say we \nought to have smaller class sizes. That has been demonstrated to \nimprove academics for children. That amendment will be offered by \nSenator Murray. We ought to support public schools.\n  The benefit of those programs go to all of those parents whose \nchildren are going to the public schools. That is a very important, \nbasic difference. It is targeted programs that can really make a \ndifference in enhancing academic achievement and accomplishment.\n  We will have an opportunity, as well, to debate concepts such as that \nproposed by the Senator from the State of Washington, Senator Gorton, \nthat block grants education programs, undermining targeting of scarce \nresources, and undermining accountability. We will have a chance to \ndebate those.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 10 minutes have elapsed.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 1 more minute. We will have a chance as \nwell to debate whether we will uphold the civil right of children with \ndisabilities. That is going to be a very important debate.\n  But I hope, as we are starting off on this Monday, and as we are \ngoing through this debate over the period of the next 4 or 5 days, to \nunderstand what is really the issue. With the amount of funds that are \ngoing to be made available under this program, which is effectively a \nnew entitlement program, $1.6 billion, are we going to say we should \nuse that in such a way that it is going to benefit a small number of \nfamilies who are going to primarily use these funds for private \nschools? Or are we going to say, with scarce resources, we ought to use \nthat money in order to benefit the large number of children who are \ngoing to the public school systems and we ought to use that in an \neffective and creative way, to make sure that children who are going to \nour public school systems are going to get a good education in safe, \nmodern schools?\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on the other \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 3 minutes \n45 seconds.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, again, I am puzzled by the vociferous \nopposition of the Senator from Massachusetts to an education savings \naccount. I repeat what I said a moment ago when I was responding to the \nSenator from Ohio.\n  The education savings account that we are proposing and talking about \ntoday is nothing more than an expansion of the savings account that has \nalready been adopted by the Senate and House and signed by the \nPresident last year. Last year, we created an education savings account \nthat allowed a family to save $500 a year, and the interest that was \nearned would not be taxed if the account was used for the cost of \nhigher education.\n  We have taken the same account--it applies to the same earning level, \nwho can use it and who can't; it is directed to the middle class--the \nsame criteria. There is no change whatsoever. Identical. That savings \naccount can be used by a family to go to Georgetown down the street \nhere or to the University of Georgia.\n  We have said to those same families in America that we all celebrated \nbecause they have this $500 savings account for higher education, we \nare going to say instead of $500, let's allow a family to save up to \n$2,000 so they can really build up the kitty. We said, why limit it to \ncollege when there is so much trouble in kindergarten through high \nschool? Let's let the family use it whenever they need it. They may \nneed it when the child is in sixth grade because of dyslexia or a \nlearning disability. They may need it in freshman high school because \nof a math deficiency. They may need it because the child cannot compete \nbecause of not having a home computer.\n  We have taken the very instrument that was so celebrated on the White \nHouse lawn, a $500 savings account, and said let's let it be up to \n$2,000, and instead of just limiting it to college, although it could \nbe used for college, let's let them use it whenever they need it--\nkindergarten through high school or college. No change. Same group of \nfamilies. Same criteria. Use it in the same way. It is just bigger if \nthey want to make it bigger, and it covers all the school years, not \njust some of them.\n  Whatever all these concerns are that the Senator just alluded to \nwould have applied to what we did last year. It would have had the same \ndiscrimination; it would have favored the same kind of families as his \nchart alludes to in that account.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Doesn't the Senator draw a distinction between the \nmandatory requirements that we have for the public school system for \nour 55 million children and those who are going to higher education, \nwhich is basically not a mandated requirement? That is an optional \nrequirement and, therefore, historically higher education has always \nbeen treated differently.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Let me respond to the Senator. I recognize there is a \ndistinction with the public-private issue, but the Senator spent a good \nbit of his time trying to suggest that certain kinds of families would \nbenefit; that the dollars are skewed, there was some formula here that \nwas working against the public interest.\n  My point to the Senator from Massachusetts is, it is identical to the \nformula that was used when we created the higher education savings \naccount. Identical. It is just that folks can save more now for \nkindergarten through high school or they can save it for college. They \nhave a chance to save more, and they have a chance to use it more \nfrequently.\n  The Joint Tax Committee has said that in this education savings \naccount, 14 million families will probably use it; 20 million kids, \nthat is half the school population almost.\n\n  Here is the point that I would like to make to the Senator: What is \namazing to me about this education savings account is that it takes \nsuch a little incentive to make Americans do huge things. The tax \nrelief to these 14 million families over the next 5 years is just a \npittance over $500 million--over 5 years. What do the 14 million \nfamilies do because of that? They save over $5 billion--$5 billion. \nThat puts 5 billion volunteer dollars--these are not tax dollars; no \nschool board has to levy a new property tax; no State government has to \nraise their income tax; the Federal Government doesn't have to raise \ntaxes--the people on their own, because of the nature of the savings \naccount, save $5 billion. Seventy percent of\n\n[[Page S3263]]\n\nthose families will have children in public schools, and 30 percent \nwill have children in private schools. About half the money will end up \nhelping children in public schools, and about half the money will help \nchildren in private schools.\n  Everybody is a winner here. There are no losers. A lot of times we do \nthings in Washington and somebody gains and somebody loses. But in this \ncase, everybody wins. The public school system wins; the private school \nsystem wins. People with kids in public schools can use the savings \naccount; people with kids in private schools can use the savings \naccount.\n  I see I have just been joined by the distinguished Senator from \nIndiana, so I am going to yield to him.\n  But everybody wins. These are not public dollars. These are volunteer \ndollars to help children wherever they are going to school.\n  Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Indiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment that \nis currently before us. Although Senator Kennedy may be using the \nopportunity to talk about the broader bill, it is the amendment that we \nwill have to vote on unless that amendment is withdrawn. I want to \nbriefly state reasons why I think Members should vote against that \nparticular amendment.\n  A primary reason is that it is unnecessary. The Labor Committee on \nwhich both the Senator from Massachusetts and I serve has, as part of \nthe Higher Education Act, just unanimously voted out of the committee a \nloan forgiveness program for teachers, which I believe is far more \neffective than what is being offered by the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  That teacher loan forgiveness program provides loan forgiveness to \nteachers who have loans that are eligible for the interest subsidy, \nensuring that those who qualify would be most in need of help of \nrepaying the loans.\n  The second condition is that the teacher be employed for 3 years; \nthird, that they teach in a public or private school whose school \ndistrict has 30 percent or more of its students eligible for title I \nassistance; that they have an academic major in the subject area in \nwhich they teach if they are a high school teacher, and have \ndemonstrated knowledge and teaching skills in reading, writing, and \nmathematics if they are elementary schoolteachers.\n  The reason these conditions were imposed and, by the way, again, \nunanimously accepted by the Labor Committee, is because we wanted to \ntarget loan forgiveness to the most qualified teachers. We did not want \na broad, all-encompassing loan forgiveness program, which I believe the \namendment of the Senator from Massachusetts covers about 90 percent of \nthe teachers in this country--all those employed within the title I \nschools, which equals about 90 percent. The issue is not just more \nteachers; the issue is better qualified teachers.\n  Statistics show, and studies show, that the real shortage is not the \nnumber of teachers--I could go into some detail on that, but I do not \nhave time to do it--but the issue and the need is for qualified \nteachers. So we have structured this loan forgiveness program to \nsupport and emphasize teachers who meet these particular \nqualifications.\n  The second reason I believe Members should not support this \nparticular amendment is that the average debt for teachers is \nconsiderably more than what the Senator's amendment offers in terms of \nforgiveness. Ours allows provisions for up to $10,000 of loan \nforgiveness, which more closely meets the debt problems that teachers \ncurrently face, rather than the $8,000 which the Senator's amendment \nprovides.\n  Finally, the amendment is directed toward schools in general, the \nloan forgiveness program, whereas the Labor Committee amendment is \nbasically directed toward the poorest schools, teachers that meet the \nqualifications as outlined in the Labor Committee's language, which is \ndesigned specifically for the purpose of trying to address the most \ncritical need in this country, and that is getting qualified teachers \nwho have the credentials to teach and are teaching in the Nation's \npoorest schools. I outlined those criteria earlier.\n  But that was the basis for the Labor Committee's drafting of the \nlanguage to address the most critical need, and that is where we ought \nto be putting our resources. It is not the schools in some of the more \naffluent suburbs that are having problems attracting teachers, \nparticularly qualified teachers; it is the schools in the poorest \ndistricts, the schools in the low-income districts, the schools in the \nminority districts, that are having trouble attracting qualified \nteachers to teach their students. Those are the teachers that we want \nto encourage through this loan forgiveness program.\n  So for those reasons, I urge our colleagues to oppose the amendment \nbeing offered by the Senator from Massachusetts, primarily because it \nis not needed, it has been addressed, it has been supported unanimously \nby the Labor Committee. It is directed toward the areas that need it \nthe most; it is directed towards supporting qualified teachers. For \nthose reasons, I urge a no vote on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 5 minutes have expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself a minute just in response \nto the Senator from Indiana.\n  This is a basic substitute to the Coverdell amendment. We have an \nopportunity to say it is more beneficial to the children that are going \nto our public schools to support our amendment that is going to \nincrease the number of qualified teachers than to support the Coverdell \namendment which is primarily going to benefit the parents who are \nsending their children to private schools, No. 1.\n  Secondly, I hope that my friend and colleague would read my amendment \nmore carefully, because it does target the teachers into the \nunderserved areas, and also it targets teachers into the areas where \nthe State finds that there are critical shortages in terms of the type \nof specialty needs--for example, in subject matters, for example, in \nmath and science, and others, and does it, I think, more creatively \nthan we have done in the higher ed bill.\n  I yield myself another minute.\n  It is clearly responding to what our Human Resources Committee has \nhad hours of hearings on, and that is the importance of having high-\nquality teachers for our expanded school-age population. I am a strong \nsupporter of what we have done in the higher ed bill, but it is not \ngoing to be enough to be able to meet the needs of the Nation. And \nevery study we have done has pointed this out. If you want to try and \nbenefit public schools and teachers, my amendment is the way to do it. \nIf you want to abandon public schools and move towards the support of \nfamilies that are sending their children to private schools, then the \nCoverdell bill is the way to do it.\n\n  I withhold the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, the Labor Committee, of which the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts is the ranking member--the Senator joined his \ncolleagues on the Democrat side and joined all Republicans in passing \nout of the Labor Committee language unanimously. He did not offer his \namendment there, so I just wonder what has changed. Obviously, what has \nchanged is that the amendment is designed to gut the underlying \nCoverdell bill.\n  Secondly, the language of the Senator's amendment is not targeted. It \nsays title I eligibility. Title I covers 96 percent of all schools. \nThat is not targeted. Targeted is designed to address a specific \nproblem. A specific problem is the minority students, poor students, \nstudents in poor districts who are not getting the qualified teachers \nand the education they need.\n  This Labor Committee product targets it towards those teachers. The \nSenator's language does not target; it says, where there is a shortage \nof qualified elementary and secondary school teachers under the title I \nprograms. That is 96 percent. I do not call that being targeted.\n  So for those reasons, I believe we should oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I move to table the pending amendment \nof the Senator from Massachusetts and ask for the yeas and nays on the \nmotion.\n\n[[Page S3264]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to table is premature until the \ntime has expired for the proponents. And they have 1 minute 43 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask the Senator to reread the \namendment. If he looks at the loan forgiveness for the teachers, on \nline 8 it talks about the title I programs which are targeted to the \npoorest schools. At paragraph (2), line 12, it makes reference to \nteachers who teach math, science, foreign languages, and that the State \neducational agency determines it.\n  So I do realize that we have supported a good program that is coming \nout of our Human Resources Committee. But the Budget Committee put \nhands down, thumbs down, on a very similar program that was advanced by \nthe President of the United States. We have real money here on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate. And this is an opportunity that if you want \nto do something about increasing the number of qualified teachers, our \namendment does it. If you do not want to do that, and you want to \nbenefit the private schools, you will vote against this.\n  I urge the Senate to oppose the anti-education Republican tax bill. \nImproving education can and must be a top priority for Congress and the \nnation. But this Republican bill flunks the test. They call it their \n``A+'' bill. But, it's anti-education, and it deserves an ``F.'' This \nRepublican bill and its proposed Republican amendments are bad tax \npolicy, bad education policy, and bad disability policy, and it clearly \ndeserves the veto that President Clinton has pledged to give it.\n  It is the nation's public schools that need help. So what do our \nRepublican friends to? They proposed legislation that aid private \nschools. That makes no sense at all. Our goal is to strengthen public \nschools, not abandon them. Our goal is to help all children get a good \neduction--not just the ones with wealthy parents.\n  It is clear that our Republican friends are no friends of public \nschools. They have an anti-education agenda. They want tax breaks for \nthe wealthy who send their children to private schools. They want to \ncut the budget for public schools. They want to dismantle the federal \nrole in education. They want to eliminate civil rights protections for \nchildren with disabilities. The Republicans have put the cards on the \ntable--and it's a losing hand for education.\n  Over the course of the limited debate on this bill, we will discuss \ngood ideas that will help improve public schools such as rebuilding the \nnation's schools, reducing class size, forgiving student loans for \ncollege graduates who teach in high-need areas, and increasing funding \nfor children with disabilities. I urge my colleagues to support these \nvery important Democratic amendments. I also urge my colleagues to \noppose Republican amendments to that undermine public education, and \nmake a bad bill worse.\n  I understand that we will be voting on a new version of a block grant \nfor education, sponsored by Senator Gorton. It is clear that this \namendment will undermine the federal commitment to improve the nation's \nschools. There have been no hearings on this proposal and no committee \nreview of the proposal. It would be irresponsible for the Senate to \nsupport this proposal to revamp the federal role in education after a \ntotal of only 30 minutes of debate.\n  The proposed Gorton amendment hurts students and goes against the \nnation's commitment to helping poor and educationally disadvantaged \nstudents who need our strong support. It also undermines the \npartnerships that have been created by federal, state, and local \neducation agencies to improve all schools for all children.\n  We all agree that education is a local responsibility. But the states \nand the federal government are important partners in helping to improve \neducation for all children. We all need to work together to improve the \nnation's public schools.\n  This amendment rejects that basic principle. It destroys carefully \ncrafted and widely supported federal programs. And it undermines \naccountability for improving the achievement of all students.\n  Currently, federal funds are offering a helping hand to local school \ndistricts in meeting high priority responsibilities important to the \nnation as a whole. The funds help schools and school districts improve \nreading and math skills of disadvantaged students, help teachers get \nthe extra skills they need to teach all children to higher standards, \nhelp communities create safe and drug-free schools, and help \ncommunities modernize their schools.\n  This amendment creates a ``General Education Block Grant'' by \ncombining funds from 20 targeted programs. Then it limits the use of \nthose funds to only 8 activities. It denies local communities the funds \nto make schools safe and drug-free. It denies local communities the \nfunds to improve skills of math and science teachers. It denies local \ncommunities the funds to continue their efforts to set high academic \nstandards for all children.\n  In addition, in response to growing needs of schools in communities \nacross the country to address problems such as low student performance, \nrising enrollments, and lack of adequate modern technology, the \namendment would cap spending at 2.3 percent per year for the next five \nyears. These limits are far below the necessary increases we made over \nthe last two years of 15 percent and 12 percent. It would be \nirresponsible for Congress to do so little to help communities address \ntheir growing and pressing educational needs.\n  Contrary to arguments made by proponents of the amendment, federal \neducation laws are more flexible and school-friendly than ever before. \nStates and local education agencies are working in closer and more \neffective cooperation. The result is that schools are doing a better \njob of helping all children meet higher standards of achievement.\n  The federal-state-local partnership in education isn't broken, and \nthis amendment can't fix it. Congress should be doing all it can to \nstrengthen that partnership, not destroy it.\n  As a nation, we have made a commitment to help all students have the \nopportunity to get a good education. We have a responsibility to make \nsure that public tax dollars are well spent. This amendment provides no \naccountability for how these dollars are spent. Reforming the federal \nrole in education does not mean abdicating that role.\n\n  This amendment is the wrong direction for the nation's children and \nthe wrong direction for education. It is not an attempt to offer a \nhelping hand to local schools. It is simply a thinly-veiled attempt to \ndismantle the federal role in education.\n  We should support efforts to improve education for all students, not \nundermine them. I urge my colleagues to oppose the Gorton block grant \namendment.\n  Another problematic amendment that I understand will be introduced \nlater in the debate is the Gregg amendment to allow states and school \ndistricts to strip civil rights protections for students with \ndisabilities.\n  The proposed Gregg amendment would repeal the critical civil rights \nprotections included in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \nthat ensures that children with disabilities are not denied educational \nservices. Prior to the enactment of IDEA, over half the children with \ndisabilities in this country were receiving an inadequate education or \nno education at all. Under the proposal, children with disabilities \ncould be unilaterally thrown out of school, even if the child was being \n``disciplined'' for a behavior caused by the child's disability.\n  This proposal is not in the interest of children with disabilities \nand it is not in the interest of the nation. In fact, a similar \namendment was rejected on the Senate floor last year during \nconsideration of the reauthorization of IDEA. The Senate did not \nsupport the proposed policy last year, and we should not support it \nnow.\n  Proponents of the bill claim that under current law, schools cannot \ndiscipline children with disabilities when they break the rules. That \nis simply not true.\n  IDEA allows school officials to discipline a child with a disability \nwhen discipline is warranted. IDEA already allows immediate action \nagainst a child with a disability who brings a weapon to school, who \nknowingly possesses, uses, or sells illegal drugs or controlled \nsubstances, or whose behavior is substantially likely to result in \ninjury to the child or others. In addition, if the behavior resulting \nin the disciplinary action is not the result of\n\n[[Page S3265]]\n\na child's disability, IDEA allows the school to apply any relevant \ndisciplinary procedures that they would apply to a child without a \ndisability.\n  Police, prosecutors, and groups representing school officials and \nchildren with disabilities all support pursuing policies that ensure \nthat our schools are safe and conducive to learning, and to help all \nchildren, including children with disabilities, learn personal \nresponsibility. But, discipline should never be used as an excuse to \nexclude, segregate, or deny services to children with disabilities.\n  The goal of public education is to give all children the opportunity \nto pursue their dreams. We must be committed to every child--even the \nones who aren't so easy to teach. This amendment would undermine that \ngoal and put children with disabilities on the street. It's bad policy \nand we should overwhelmingly reject it.\n  These amendments simply make the bad underlying bill even worse. The \nunderlying bill uses tax breaks to subsidize parents who send their \nchildren to private schools, and it is a serious mistake. It diverts \nscarce resources away from public schools that have the greatest need.\n  The regressive Republican tax bill does nothing to improve public \nschools.\n  It does nothing to address the serious need of public schools to \nbuild new facilities and repair their crumbling existing facilities.\n  It does nothing to reduce class sizes in schools.\n  It does nothing to provide qualified teachers in more classrooms \nacross the nation.\n  It does nothing to help children reach high academic standards.\n  It does nothing to provide after-school activities to keep kids off \nthe street, away from drugs, and out of trouble.\n  It does nothing to improve the quality of education for children in \npublic schools. Tax breaks for private schools are not the answer to \nthe serious problems facing the nation's public schools.\n  This bill would spend $1.5 billion of public tax dollars over the \nnext 10 years on subsidies to help wealthy people pay private school \ntuition and other private school expenses.\n  According to the Joint Tax Committee, the bill will cost $1.5 billion \nover the next 10 years, and half the benefits will go to the 7 percent \nof families that have children in private schools. That's unacceptable, \nwhen public schools are desperate for additional help.\n  The Joint Tax Committee also estimates that while 83 percent of \nprivate school families will use this tax break, only 30 percent of \npublic school families will use it.\n  The bill disproportionately benefits private school families, and it \ndisproportionately benefits the wealthy. The majority of the tax \nbenefits will go to families in the highest income brackets, who can \nalready afford to send their children to private school.\n\n  Working families do not have enough assets and savings to participate \nin this scheme. This regressive bill does not help families struggling \nto pay day-to-day expenses during their children's school years.\n  This so-called education bill does nothing for education. It simply \nprovides a tax shelter for the rich.\n  Congress should be building new schools--not building new tax \nshelters for the wealthy.\n  Congress should be reducing class size--not reducing aid to public \nschools.\n  We know what it takes to achieve genuine education reform. The place \nto start is by resoundingly rejecting this defective bill, and then \namending it in ways that will genuinely help the nation's schools.\n  The challenge is clear. We must do all we can to improve teaching and \nlearning for all students across the nation.\n  We must continue to support efforts to raise academic standards.\n  We must test students early, so that we know where they need help in \ntime to make that help effective.\n  We must provide better training for current and new teachers, so that \nthey are well-prepared to teach to high standards.\n  We must reduce class size, to help students obtain the individual \nattention they need.\n  We must provide after-school programs to make constructive \nalternatives available to students.\n  We must provide greater resources to modernize and expand the \nnation's school buildings to meet the urgent needs of schools for up-\nto-date facilities.\n  We cannot stand by and let this regressive tax policy pass to help \nprivate schools at the expense of public schools.\n  Parents across the country want real solutions--not token gestures in \nthe name of education. We should not waste $1.5 billion of public tax \ndollars on a do-nothing tax break program.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me today in opposing this bill. \nWe should be doing all we can to help public schools--not abandon them.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, if I might ask the Senator from \nMassachusetts, it would be my intent to ask unanimous consent that this \nvote occur tomorrow at a time selected by the majority and minority \nleaders and 2 minutes be afforded each side at the time of the vote. If \nthat is agreeable, I am going to proceed with a motion to table and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As described by the Senator?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. With that understanding, I yield back all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back. The Senator \nmay proceed.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the vote which \nI will make in a moment on the motion to table this amendment occur on \nTuesday at a time to be determined by the majority leader and minority \nleader, and that the time remaining on both sides be reserved \nrespectively.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing none, without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I move to table the pending amendment \nof the Senator from Massachusetts and ask for the yeas and nays on the \nmotion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendments so I might speak for 15 minutes on the legislation \nitself.\n  Mr. ROTH. I say to the distinguished Senator from North Dakota, we \nwould have no objection to your taking 15 minutes. But we do hope it \nwill be the understanding tomorrow that we will proceed from amendment \nto amendment. But with that admonition, we agree to your request.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I'm assuming the Senator would not object if this \nside, in keeping the balance, if we ask unanimous consent, even though \nwe are on pending amendments, for 15 minutes to respond.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I might respond to the Senator from Georgia, I \ncertainly would have no objection to some parity in time. My \nunderstanding is that more time has been consumed on that side during \nthis day. I assume you would also want parity. My expectation is we \nhave a unanimous consent request by which we will dispose of this bill.\n  My intent and my hope was to be able to speak for 15 minutes inasmuch \nas this amendment was disposed of and another amendment is not now \noffered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from North Dakota \nasked for unanimous consent for 15 minutes on the bill.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I have listened with interest not only to this debate but \nto much debate prior to this on this legislation.\n  Since the year 1647, when the colonists in Massachusetts created tax-\nsupported public education, we have had a long and proud tradition in \nthis country of public schools. By far, the majority--in fact, well \nover 90 percent--of the students who attend elementary and secondary \nschools in our country will attend public schools as part of our public \neducation system.\n\n[[Page S3266]]\n\n  We have substantial tax incentives that already exist in this country \nin our Tax Code to support education. I am holding a list of 16 such \ntax incentives. They provide over $78 billion in tax reductions over a \n5-year period for various kinds of expenditures and activities dealing \nwith education. One of them, $19.6 billion, is the deduction for \ncharitable contributions to educational institutions. That is a method \nby which some make contributions to private schools and get tax \ndeductions for that.\n  All of these provisions dealing with tax incentives are important. \nThis Congress has generally supported them and increased them \nsubstantially last year with HOPE and lifetime learning credits, \ndeductibility for interest on student loans and various other devices.\n  The question now is on a proposal offered by the Senator from \nGeorgia. I have indicated to him previously that I am not attempting to \ntrash the proposal itself. I think this kind of discussion begs the \nquestion, what is the priority of need? What are the rankings of need \nthat exist with respect to education in our country?\n  The Senator from Georgia comes up with a proposal that says the need \nis that we should provide other tax incentives that allow people to put \naway savings to be used for public and private elementary and secondary \neducation.\n  The Secretaries of Treasury and Education, in a letter dated February \n9, says that this proposal, the way it is constructed, \n``disproportionately benefits the most affluent families.'' This is the \nSecretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Education. This proposal \n``disproportionately benefits the most affluent families.'' Further, \nthey say, this will not generate much additional savings in any event.\n  If one were going to do this, it seems to me one would want to do it \nthe right way. The question that I come to the floor to ask is, what is \nthe ranking of need that exists in education? What are the priorities? \nWhat represents the approach that is most in need of public investment? \nI want to take this down to the specifics. I know some will say this is \njust anecdotal and doesn't matter.\n\n  Education is one child at a time in this country. It is not some \ntheory. It is one child at a time. I want to tell you about a young \nwoman that I met last Wednesday morning named Rosie Two Bears. Rosie is \na little second grader, bright-eyed. She has a wonderful little smile, \nand she goes to school in Cannon Ball, ND, a school that I visited last \nWednesday, among many other schools. The Cannon Ball, ND, school is on \nthe Standing Rock Indian Reservation, but it is a public school in a \npublic school district with very little tax base.\n  I want to tell you about the school, because Rosie Two Bears, when I \nentered her second grade class, asked me, ``Senator, will you buy us a \nnew school?'' Well, I didn't have the answer for Rosie last Wednesday, \nbut I want to tell you why Rosie Two Bears asks if we can buy her a new \nschool. And I tell you this by virtue of saying this represents the \nneed, the priority of need, not just in Cannon Ball, ND, but all across \nthis country.\n  This school is, in its oldest part, some 90 years old. It sits in a \ndesperately poor school district. It has been condemned with respect to \nthe older part of the school as a fire hazard, among other things. It \nhas 145 students and 40 other staff and maintenance workers. For the \n145 students in K through 6th grade there are two bathrooms and one \nwater fountain. Let me say that again: 145 kids, two bathrooms and one \nwater fountain.\n  Now, one of the classes is held in what is called the choir room. It \nused to be the janitor closet. But they can't always hold class there \nbecause sewer gas comes backing up and you can't have a classroom when \nsewer gas creates such a stench that little kids will be made sick if \nthey sit in that room. So what do they do when the sewer gas backs up \nand fills that old janitor's closet, which is now used as a room in \nwhich they sing and practice choir? They move those kids out of that \nroom to some other hallway in the school.\n  There is a little gymnasium, very old, but there are no locker rooms, \nso the fourth and fifth grade basketball players must change in the \nbathrooms--two bathrooms in the entire school. But there is not enough \nroom in the bathrooms, so little fourth graders are changing out in the \nhallway. You wonder what is it like for a fourth grade basketball \nplayer to change into his basketball clothes in the hallway because \nthere are no locker rooms and the toilets are full, with people trying \nto change for the same basketball game.\n  You might say, what does this mean? It means, in our country, right \nin this country, we have schools that are in desperate condition, and \nwe have bright-eyed, wonderful little children walking through the \nschool door, going into a classroom where the desks are not a half inch \napart--the desks are touching in every circumstance because the \nclassroom is 8 feet by 12 feet and they have so many kids in there \nthere is no room for even an inch between the desks. Next year, twice \nas many kids are supposed to be in that classroom, but they can't do \nthat so they will break up the class. When they break up the class, one \nteacher handles two classes and spends 15 minutes talking to this group \nand then says, ``All right, now I will be talking to this class for 15 \nminutes,'' in the same room and will go back 15 minutes later, in a \ncrowded room with two classes because that represents the overflow from \nother classes.\n  I ask the question, how many of us would like our kids to walk \nthrough that school door and would say to our second grader, say to \nRosie's classmate, ``Yes this is a good education. Our country is proud \nof the education it gives to you.'' We cannot afford to put another \nbathroom in that school, we cannot afford to add classrooms that are of \nadequate size. We cannot afford to fix a school that has sewer gas \nseeping up through the choir room. We can't afford it. We don't have \nthe money.\n  That is why I ask this question today about need. We see today a \nproposal coming to the Senate that says let's spend $1.6 billion on \neducation in a manner that the Secretary of the Treasury says will \n``disproportionately benefit the most affluent families.'' I ask the \nquestion, is that expenditure something that was determined to be more \nimportant than the Cannon Ball school? Because the Cannon Ball school \nis not about theory. The Cannon Ball school, on Wednesday when I \nvisited, was about real needs for real little kids that are in the \npublic school system hoping to catch up and keep up with every other \nkid that enters a classroom door in this country.\n  What is the ranking of need? What do we decide is important? It is \nunfair for me to talk just about Cannon Ball. Down the road 40 miles, I \nmet with a school board there on Wednesday, the Standing Rock High \nSchool, run by the BIA--in effect, this Congress. It is a wonderful \nschool. Those boys just won the State class B basketball championship. \nThat Indian school on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation is \nenormously proud of those young boys. Against all odds, no one expected \nthem to win the State high school basketball championship, but they \ndid.\n  You know what is wrong with their school? They have classrooms in the \ngymnasium for 2 months. Their school has lighting fixtures that are \nleaking PCBs. It would be funny to see the national press go down and \ntake a look at PCBs leaking from lighting fixtures or visit Rosie Two \nBears in Cannon Ball. But somehow that is not sexy. Those kids aren't \nin classrooms, because the lights are leaking a carcinogen, so we have \nto clear the building out.\n  Is that a priority? It is our responsibility. That school belongs to \nthe BIA. The funds for that come from this Congress. Is that a \npriority? Is it less of a priority than providing a tax break, the bulk \nof which will disproportionately benefit the most affluent families. \nThat is the question I ask.\n  I am not suggesting this is wholly unworthy, or that it is an idea \nthat has no merit. That is not what I come to suggest. I say if the \nU.S. Senate is prepared to say we have $1.6 billion with which to \ninvest in the education of young Americans, then I say the Cannon Ball \nschool ought to have some claim to that. Rosie Two Bears and her \nsecond-grade class, sitting in a building where sewer gas forces them \nout of their choir room, ought to have some claim to part of that at \nleast. We at least ought to have the opportunity to have that debate \nhere on the floor of the Senate.\n\n[[Page S3267]]\n\n  When you have unlimited wants, virtually unlimited wants and limited \nresources, then there is a responsibility, I think, to prioritize them. \nWhat represents our most important investment? We have a range of \namendments that will be offered. There is an amendment, for example, \nthat talks about exactly what I am discussing--school construction, the \nneed to respond to crumbling schools, the need to be fair to Rosie Two \nBears and her classmates in that second grade class. School \nconstruction. Can we help repair crumbling schools? That amendment is \ngoing to have 15 minutes of debate on each side. What an awful, awful \nthing for us to have done.\n\n  I hope that however we dispose of these issues, that some day, some \nway, on the floor of this Senate we will truly have the capability of \ndeciding what represents our priorities in education. This may \nrepresent the priority of the Senator from Georgia; it is not mine. My \npriority is to decide that we have enormous challenges in public \neducation in this country.\n  I am proud of our public education system. We have not come to this \npoint in our history by accident. I mentioned when I started that, in \n1647, the colonists in this country decided to begin a tax-supported \nsystem of public education. What an enormously important element in our \ncountry's future and our country's history, to have decided that every \nyoung American can become everything that his or her natural talents \nwill allow, because we are going to create a public education system \nthat allows every single one of them that opportunity. That has been \nour tradition and must be our future.\n  When we talk about $1.6 billion, the question is, if that $1.6 \nbillion is available, what do we use it for? What do we use it for? Do \nwe use it to fix those schools that are falling down on these kids? Or \ndo we add a teacher to a class that is twice the size it ought to be? \nOr do we provide another tax credit in which over half of the benefit \nwill go to 7 percent of the students in private schools?\n  I say to the Senator from Georgia, I have great respect for him as a \nlegislator; I just disagree with the priority. Based on a ranking of \nneeds, there is no question as to what the answer is. The answer is \nthat we ought to, as a country, decide that our investment in the \npublic education of this country is paramount. And when we have \nproblems that local school districts can't correct, where they don't \nhave the tax base and the resources to make investments on behalf of \nthose kids, then we are going to try to help them some way or another. \nIf $1.6 billion is what we have today, then I say that is the way we \nought to use that money. That is the debate we must have.\n  We have a good number of amendments pending or to be offered of \nlegislation. I know that the Senator from Georgia has always maintained \nthere has been a filibuster on this legislation. In fact, I maintain \nthat there has been a lockout and has always been a lockout. The reason \npeople have had a problem getting this to the floor is, they wanted to \nbring it to the floor by saying: This is our idea, and if you have \nanother one, we may allow you to debate it, but only minimally. We are \nnot going to allow the Senate to do its regular order, because we are \nnot going to allow an amendment and allow you to debate the amendment \nfor 3 or 4 hours.\n  We were involved in that for a long while. Now we are back on the \nissue and we are stuck in a situation where, I guess, in order to have \nthis bill considered and to have our amendments in order, we had to \nagree to 15 minutes of debate on each side on an amendment that \naddresses the central issue I have been talking about--investment in \nschool construction.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. If the Senator will yield for 10 seconds. The \namendment to which the Senator spoke for most of his remarks has an \nhour for debate.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, that makes my point. That is 30 minutes on each \nside to talk about the central issue in education, about the need for \ninvestment in infrastructure in education. You just can't expect these \nlittle kids to walk through a school door and say, ``By the way, we \nknow this school is in disrepair, falling down around you.'' The Cannon \nBall school I mentioned, they have a heater, but they don't have an \nautomatic switch for it. And this school can't hook-up to the Internet \nbecause the wiring is so old. But back to the heater, they turn the \nheater on by climbing up a scaffold to the ceiling of the gymnasium and \nturning a manual switch.\n  My point is that a half hour on each side is not enough. That is \ntwice as much as I suggested, because that amendment gets a little more \nthan others. But a half hour on each side is not nearly enough to \ndebate the central problems of how much we should invest and how we \ninvest in the needs of public education. That is my problem with the \nlegislation the Senator from Georgia has offered. There are better \namendments. I hope one will be approved as we move along, and I hope we \nwill have a longer period of debate on education sometime later in this \nCongress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2288\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I call for the regular order regarding \nthe Mack amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment of the Senator from Florida, \nSenator Mack, is now pending.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may use in \nopposition to the amendment.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, it is my understanding that, by \nunanimous consent, their side has 15 minutes on this amendment. I \nassume that is what the Senator is using.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The Senator is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for up to 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Coverdell \nbill. Let me start by saying that I served on the school board of \nCharleston, AR, population 1,200, for 12 years before I ran for \nGovernor of my State. I have often said--not entirely facetiously--that \nI ran for Governor to get off the school board because that is the \nworst job I ever had. It was a poor school district. When we asked the \npeople of that district, though, for millage increases to build new \nfacilities, not one single time, in my memory--not just the 12 years I \nserved on the school board--did the people ever defeat a millage \nincrease to improve the plight of our students. That situation still \nexists. The reason it was so difficult is because salaries were \npitifully low.\n  When I got out of law school, I didn't know what I was going to do, \nbut I knew I wasn't going to make very much money practicing law. Betty \nwent to work teaching third grade in the Charleston Elementary School \nat the princely sum of $125 a month. That is what we lived on. Things \nwere very tough. In a relative sense, things are not all that much \nbetter right now. Incidentally, Charleston was the first school in the \nSouth to integrate schools after the Brown decision in 1954. Yes, my \nlittle hometown was the first school south of the Mason-Dixon Line to \nintegrate its schools following the Brown decision. We are proud of \nthat.\n  I am a great champion, as a result of my experience on that school \nboard, of public education. I have nothing against private schools. \nWhen I was elected Governor, because I was apprehensive about the \nsafety of a couple of my children, I sent them to private schools. I \nwas concerned about their safety not because of the schools, but \nbecause their father was Governor. The second reason I sent them, of \ncourse, is that I had the money to do it.\n  Under the Coverdell bill, if we are going to spend $1.6 billion over \n10 years, that equates to the princely sum of $160 million a year. Do \nyou know what that does for education in this country? Nothing. That is \nnot a drop in the bucket compared to the educational needs of this \nNation.\n  Senator Moseley-Braun has an amendment to rebuild the crumbling \ninfrastructure of the school buildings in this country. I think it is \n$5 billion over a 5-year period. That doesn't even begin to address the \nproblem when you consider the fact that 93 percent of the money under \nthis bill goes to the wealthiest people in America, goes to\n\n[[Page S3268]]\n\nthose people who go to private schools, and 7 percent goes to the other \n85 percent of the people in America who go to public schools. I \nrepeat--this is a Treasury Department figure--93 percent of the dollars \nthat would go for education under this bill goes to the families who \nsend their children to private schools. That is 12 percent. Seven \npercent of the money goes to the other 85 percent. That tells you all \nyou need to know about what this bill is all about. It doesn't address \nthe problems of education in the country. It simply extends those IRAs \nto the first 12 grades. That in itself is nonsense.\n  If all of this money is going for private schools, then there is not \nvery much of it--$37 a year--for a family who sends their children to a \nprivate school. Who is going to send their kid to a private school for \n$37 a year? But more importantly, the people who send their children to \npublic schools get the princely sum of $7 a year.\n  So you have to ask, what is going on here? What do we think we are \ngoing to do for somebody for $7 a year, or even the wealthy people for \n$37 a year?\n  Mr. President, that tells you one thing. The reason I am so \nstridently opposed to this bill is that it is a nose under the tent of \ncrooks to aid private schools, even though it be very small and it is a \ndiminution of public education. I can tell you where you are headed. \nYou are headed toward the abandonment of public education in this \ncountry, and you are headed for one of the biggest disasters of the \nNation when you go to vouchers. I am adamantly, and always have been, \nopposed to vouchers. But I can tell you that will ultimately be the end \nresult of this bill.\n  Our educational system is not perfect--never has been, never will be. \nBut the reason we had a tough time in Charleston, the reason we have a \ntough time in America in public education is we are not committing the \nresources to it. We have a $50-billion surplus this year. Think about \nit. Six years ago we were looking at a $300-billion deficit. Today, we \nare looking at a $50-billion surplus.\n  I am not voting for tax cuts. I am not going to vote to spend that \n$50 billion for tax cuts when we have 40 million people with no health \ninsurance. We have an educational system that is 13th among 17 \ndeveloped nations of the world. We have environmental problems that are \ngoing to cost billions and billions to solve.\n  I will tell you what I would like to do if I were king. I can tell \nyou Bill Clinton agrees with this. I would start a GI bill to make sure \nthat every child in America got a college education. They would get a \nPell grant--not loans. They would get grants. Every kid in America--86 \npercent of the people in this country--would go to college if they had \nthe money. If it had not been for the GI bill waiting for me when I got \nout of the Marine Corps in 1946, I wouldn't be standing here. There are \nabout seven other Members of the Senate who would not be here either if \nit had not been for the GI bill. If you want to spend that $50-billion \nsurplus, give the children of America a college education and make sure \nthey get it.\n  Mr. President, I will close by saying, if I had my way, in addition \nto giving every child a college education, I would also reeducate the \nteachers of America. I can remember when the Carnegie Foundation \nstarted the program to allow teachers of this country--a limited number \nof them--to improve their skills by going to summer seminars about 10 \nor 12 years ago. The first one was at the University of Texas which had \na summer seminar dealing with Virgil's Aeneas and Homer's Ulysses, \ncomparing them, and 4,400 schoolteachers applied for 250 spots. That \nshows teachers want to improve their education if they had the money.\n  Since that time we have done a little bit in the National Endowment \nfor the Humanities. If I had my way about it, every schoolteacher in \nthis country would be making a minimum of $50,000. How do you expect \nteachers to spend all of this time going to college and then standing \nout there and getting killed, as one in my State did 3 weeks ago in \nJonesboro, AR? And we pay them $25,000 or $30,000 a year. They can go \nto law school and start at $75,000 to $100,000 a year. Why would \nanybody want to teach school when it is a dangerous profession among \nother things? The pay is miserable. Those are the reasons our \neducational system is lacking.\n  Mr. President, I will not belabor it any longer but to simply say \nthis is precisely the wrong thing to be doing if you are trying to \nimprove education in this country. Improve the teacher quality, improve \nthe buildings they go to school in, improve the safety of the teachers, \nand improve the discipline in the classroom. This is a nose-under-the-\ntent approach.\n  I cannot state it strongly enough. I thank God Bill Clinton is in the \nWhite House. He will veto this thing the minute it hits his desk. I \nwill praise him for it.\n  I yield such time as may be remaining in opposition to the Mack \namendment.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 10 seconds.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, there is no time remaining on the other \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, let me just quickly say that the \nSenator from Arkansas was speaking to the Mack-D'Amato amendment, and \nhe implored the Senate to be conscious of the fact that we should be \nvery concerned about the condition and quality of teachers. The purpose \nof the amendment to which he was speaking, and I read, is ``to provide \nincentives for States to establish and administer periodic teacher \ntesting and merit pay programs for elementary school and secondary \nschoolteachers.''\n  When Senators Mack and D'Amato were here speaking for the amendment, \nthey characterized what is important in a classroom in America is a \nteacher, is a teacher, is a teacher, which is the purpose of the \namendment to which the Senator from Arkansas rose in opposition.\n  I yield back our remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2290 to Amendment No. 2288\n\n(Purpose: To provide incentives for States to establish and administer \n periodic teacher testing and merit pay programs for elementary school \n                     and secondary school teachers)\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of Senator D'Amato.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Coverdell], for Mr. D'Amato \n     and Mr. Mack, proposes an amendment numbered 2290 to \n     amendment No. 2288.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the first word, and insert the following:\n\n     __. STATE INCENTIVES FOR TEACHER TESTING AND MERIT PAY.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Measures to Encourage Results in Teaching Act of 1998''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) All students deserve to be taught by well-educated, \n     competent, and qualified teachers.\n       (2) More than ever before, education has and will continue \n     to become the ticket not only to economic success but to \n     basic survival. Students will not succeed in meeting the \n     demands of a knowledge-based, 21st century society and \n     economy if the students do not encounter more challenging \n     work in school. For future generations to have the \n     opportunities to achieve success the future generations will \n     need to have an education and a teacher workforce second to \n     none.\n       (3) No other intervention can make the difference that a \n     knowledgeable, skillful teacher can make in the learning \n     process. At the same time, nothing can fully compensate for \n     weak teaching that, despite good intentions, can result from \n     a teacher's lack of opportunity to acquire the knowledge and \n     skill needed to help students master the curriculum.\n       (4) The Federal Government established the Dwight D. \n     Eisenhower Professional Development Program in 1985 to ensure \n     that\n\n[[Page S3269]]\n\n     teachers and other educational staff have access to sustained \n     and high-quality professional development. This ongoing \n     development must include the ability to demonstrate and judge \n     the performance of teachers and other instructional staff.\n       (5) States should evaluate their teachers on the basis of \n     demonstrated ability, including tests of subject matter \n     knowledge, teaching knowledge, and teaching skill. States \n     should develop a test for their teachers and other \n     instructional staff with respect to the subjects taught by \n     the teachers and staff, and should administer the test every \n     3 to 5 years.\n       (6) Evaluating and rewarding teachers with a compensation \n     system that supports teachers who become increasingly expert \n     in a subject area, are proficient in meeting the needs of \n     students and schools, and demonstrate high levels of \n     performance measured against professional teaching standards, \n     will encourage teachers to continue to learn needed skills \n     and broaden teachers' expertise, thereby enhancing education \n     for all students.\n       (c) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are as follows:\n       (1) To provide incentives for States to establish and \n     administer periodic teacher testing and merit pay programs \n     for elementary school and secondary school teachers.\n       (2) To encourage States to establish merit pay programs \n     that have a significant impact on teacher salary scales.\n       (3) To encourage programs that recognize and reward the \n     best teachers, and encourage those teachers that need to do \n     better.\n       (d) State Incentives for Teacher Testing and Merit Pay.--\n       (1) Amendments.--Title II of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6601 et seq.) is amended--\n       (A) by redesignating part D as part E;\n       (B) by redesignating sections 2401 and 2402 as sections \n     2501 and 2502, respectively; and\n       (C) by inserting after part C the following:\n\n      ``PART D--STATE INCENTIVES FOR TEACHER TESTING AND MERIT PAY\n\n     ``SEC. 2401.

Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Kay Bailey \nHutchison, of Texas, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Coverdell], for Mrs. \n     Hutchison, proposes an amendment numbered 2291.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

EQUAL EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY.\n\n       Subsection (b) of section 6301 of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7351) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (7), by striking ``and'' after the \n     semicolon;\n       (2) in paragraph (8), by striking the period and inserting \n     ``; and''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(9) education reform projects that provide same gender \n     schools and classrooms, as long as comparable educational \n     opportunities are offered for students of both sexes.''.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all \namendments be laid aside and that I be given up to 15 minutes, as we \ndiscussed earlier, to respond to the remarks of the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. First, I want to come back, as I probably will have to \ndo all week long, to respond to the characterization of the nature of \nthe education savings account that is a title--one piece--of the bill \nthat is before the Senate. The Senator from Massachusetts, the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, and the Senator from Arkansas have characterized the \ndistribution of these moneys. I do not know where they are getting \ntheir figures. I think the Senator from Arkansas indicated that some 90 \npercent of the proceeds of the education savings account would end up \nin support of students in private schools. That is just absolutely and \ntotally incorrect.\n  Let me run it down one more time.\n  This education savings account is identical, the same--I underline \n``the same''--as the education savings account embraced by the \nPresident, that he was applauding, passed with a majority of their \nvotes, Senate and House, and signed on the White House lawn in a huge \ncelebration. We were celebrating the fact that we had created an \neducation savings account that would help middle-income people pay for \nthe cost of higher education. That savings account that we celebrated, \nthat the President signed and took pride in authorship, although there \nwere a lot of authors, allowed a family, a middle-class family, to save \n$500 a year and the interest buildup would not be taxed if they used it \nfor the cost of higher education.\n  That is what we passed, that is what he signed, and that is what we \ncelebrated.\n  This education savings account is identical and for the same people \nwho are middle class just like the others. The only differences are \nthese. We have said you should be able to save more than $500. Let's \nlet people save up to $2,000. If we are going to help people pay \ncollege bills, we better make it substantive enough that they will \nreally do it. The second change is that we said, if you need it before \nthen, you can use it. If you need it for kindergarten or first grade or \nthird or fourth or fifth or sixth or middle school or junior high or \nhigh school, if the problem occurs there, you can use it, or you can \nkeep it for college, or, if the student is disabled, even up to age 30. \nSo we just took the idea for middle-income taxpayers and said we are \ngoing to make it bigger so it can be used in different ways.\n  That is the only difference. And yet we have a parade of people down \nhere saying this account is for rich people. It is the same people, \nidentical, that they designated. It is for college. It is for 1st grade \nthrough 12th. Then they say, well, this is all going to go to a family \nthat is sending their child to a private school.\n  The first thing to remember is that it is the family's money. This is \nnot tax money or public money. This is money that they reached in their \npocket to put in the savings account. So it sort of stands to reason \nthey maybe ought to have some say about where it goes since it is \ntheirs. But if we are concerned about the distribution of public and \nprivate, it is important to note that 70 percent of the families who \nuse the savings accounts will have children in public schools and 30 \npercent will have children in private schools--70 in public schools, 30 \nin private. The amount of money is equally divided, not 90 percent to \nprivate schools but equally divided. It is about 50-50.\n\n[[Page S3270]]\n\n  You could ask yourself, well, if 70 percent of the families have \nchildren in public schools, why doesn't 70 percent of the money go \nthere? It is because the families with children in private schools know \nthey have a higher hurdle to get over and they are going to tend to \nsave more. They are going to spend more. But it is still about 50-50.\n  They talk about the expenditure. This one is a little unique. But \nthey seem to feel that if you leave a person's money they earned in \ntheir checking account and do not tax it, you have done them a \nfavor. That argues that the Government owns all the money and decides \nwhat little pieces to give back to you. This is the people's money. The \ntax that will be saved by 14 million American families is $520-some-odd \nmillion for 5 years in a $1.6 trillion operation. We would leave $500 \nmillion over 5 years in their savings accounts.\n\n  What is stunning to me is what it makes those American families do. \nThey go out and save $5 billion. This is $5 billion that no school, no \nstudent will be able to take advantage of if we do not do this. It will \nnever appear. So, by using this modest tax incentive, Americans do huge \nthings. They save big dollars and every school system in America will \nbenefit. Run down the litany--14 million families, over 20 million \nchildren, over $5 billion being volunteered to come in to back up \neducation needs, without any local school district having to raise a \ndime of taxes; volunteer dollars, families stepping forward trying to \nhelp their children.\n  You heard this is not a priority, just forget the 14 million \nfamilies. They try to make the juxtaposition that this is either/or, it \nis a savings account or school construction. The other side needs to \nreview and be mindful of several things. First of all, this is a \nbipartisan effort. The principal cosponsor of this bill sits right over \nthere. His name is Senator Torricelli, from New Jersey. Another key one \nis right up here, and that is Senator Lieberman, from Connecticut. And \nright over there is Senator Breaux from Louisiana. Midway over there is \nSenator Graham of Florida. These are authors of this proposal too.\n  It is not just an Education Savings Account we are debating. We have \nheard a lot about school construction here. They need to review the \nproposal as offered by their side, Senator Graham of Florida, which \nexpands the ability of local school districts to finance school \nconstruction. That is right here. If school construction is important, \nit is part of the proposal. We have education savings accounts. We \nencourage States for early prepaid tuition. This encourages employers \nto pay for continuing education costs for their employees. One million \nemployees will be positively affected by this.\n  As I said, school construction will be a part of the proposal, and \nhelping the National Health Corps scholarships. All of these are what \nthe bill is. Education savings accounts, I think, are a very important \npiece, but they are just a piece. And, I might add, in terms of the--\nthey call it costs--in terms of leaving the amount of money in the \nindividual checking accounts, it is a minor cost as compared to the \ntotal. It is about 15 percent of this total proposal that is involved \nin the education savings account. So, once again, it helps families \ncreate savings accounts to help kids, a lot of them--20 million. It \nhelps States create prepaid tuition. We heard a lot here about, ``Let's \nget people into college,'' from the Senator from Arkansas. That is \nexactly what this bill does. It also helps employers continue to \neducate people. It helps build schools. All of this is in this \nproposal.\n  Having said that, since we have heard the Senator from North Dakota \ntalk about the quality of a school--we want quality buildings. That is \nprincipally a State responsibility. We want to be careful we do not \nreward people who have not been getting the job done. There have been a \nlot of States building a lot of schools. If some haven't seen to that, \nit is not our job. You want to make sure everybody is being treated \nfairly here.\n  The last thing I say on that is, my dad was educated in a one-room \nschoolhouse. They had all the grades in one room. He learned how to \nread; he learned how to write; he learned how to add and subtract. In \nthat one room, they gave him the tools he needed to be a full-fledged \nAmerican citizen. And that is the problem here. We have hundreds of \nthousands of children coming out of grades K-12 who cannot read right, \nand they can't add, and they can't write. And the numbers are \nastounding. In city schools, only 4 in 10 can pass a basic exam; put \nall the schools together, only 6. An uneducated mind is denied full \ncitizenship and the privileges and opportunities of that citizenship in \nthe United States, and we have too many kids coming out where we are \nstunting their citizenship, their participation. We have to stop it.\n  There needs to be change. These are not all the ideas; they are some \nof them. Just to sit and defend the status quo is unconscionable.\n  Mr. President, I yield whatever of the 15 minutes was left, and I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to discuss briefly \na Senate resolution relating to the Pulitzer Prize just won by a major \nnewspaper in my State.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Senator Dorgan and I have prepared a \nresolution recognizing the remarkable work of the Grand Forks Herald in \ncovering the disasters that beset that city last year.\n  The Chair will recall that we faced a circumstance of the worst \nwinter in our history, followed by the most powerful winter storm in 50 \nyears, followed by the worst flooding in 500 years, then followed by \nfires that destroyed much of downtown Grand Forks. The Grand Forks \nHerald, through it all, kept putting out the daily newspaper. It didn't \nmatter that their own building was flooded or burned out. They kept \nproducing that newspaper day after day after day.\n  More than producing a newspaper, they produced a remarkable document \nthat told the story. They have been recognized broadly for their \nremarkable performance. I can tell you, Mr. President, in the community \nthat newspaper is revered, because they were there at a time of maximum \ndanger and threat to the community and they helped hold that community \ntogether.\n  Today I will be offering a resolution on behalf of myself and Senator \nDorgan in recognition of the Pulitzer Prize that has now been extended \nto that newspaper for their remarkable public service. We are \nincredibly proud that the Grand Forks Herald has been so recognized. \nThey are richly deserving. I hope my colleagues today on both sides \nwill clear this resolution so that we can have the respect extended to \nthat newspaper that they so richly deserve.\n  I thank the Chair. I especially thank my colleague, the leader, from \nSouth Dakota for his indulgence in permitting me to discuss this \nresolution. We, again, are seeking support on both sides so that this \nresolution can be adopted today and entered into the Record. I also \nthank my colleague from Georgia, Senator Coverdell, for permitting me \nto talk about this resolution, albeit briefly.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak today about the honor \nbestowed upon the Grand Forks Herald last week. That newspaper received \nthe Pulitzer Prize for Public Service news coverage, for its heroic \nefforts throughout the flood and fire that ravaged Grand Forks, North \nDakota in April 1997.\n  The actions of the Grand Forks Herald during the flood set a new \nstandard for performance under pressure. Let me make clear that while \nthe award they have deservedly won is a journalism award, their service \nto the community goes far beyond the borders of journalism. The fact of \nthe matter is that while this community was being inundated by water \nand fire, the Grand Forks Herald helped to hold it together by \nproviding information that reassured and reunited families. The Herald\n\n[[Page S3271]]\n\ngave people the information they needed to assess the situation and \nmake decisions based on facts and not rumors. I can't tell you how \nimportant it is to have facts at a time like this, when your world is \nbeing turned upside down, and anything, regardless of how outrageous it \nmay sound, could be true.\n  When the history books are written about the Grand Forks fire and \nflood of 1997, there will be many heroes. This was, in fact, a season \nof heroes in North Dakota; from the individuals who acted heroically to \nsave lives and property, to all the men and women of the media who \nfaced and passed similar tests.\n  Of all the heroes, however, none will shine brighter than the Grand \nForks Herald, which never missed an edition during the disaster. From \nthe parent company right on through to the local management, \nadministrative staff, news, production and delivery staff; all played a \nkey role in holding the community together. All worked, despite \nenormous odds and tremendous obstacles, to be sure that as their world \nturned on its head, one thing would not change: North Dakotans could \nstill pick up the Grand Forks Herald every morning and read the facts.\n  The Grand Forks Herald has been honored with the most prestigious \naward in journalism and it is a well-deserved honor. I am immensely \nproud of what they did and as a North Dakotan, I am also grateful for \nthe service they provided to Grand Forks and our state at their most \ntrying hour.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator from North \nDakota will yield for just a moment, I would like to be added as a \ncosponsor. I commend both Senators from North Dakota for the resolution \nand will certainly want to work with them to see that it will be \nadopted unanimously.\n  As he has noted, the Grand Forks journalistic community stood proud. \nGrand Forks, I think, perhaps more than anybody else, felt the full \nforce of the natural disasters last year. For this paper to be so \nrecognized, for it to have the opportunity to receive international \nrecognition as a result of their effort is certainly appropriate and \nought to be applauded. While many other newspapers did not win the \nPulitzer Prize, I think it goes without saying that there are other \nnewspaper efforts that were made last year that also deserve \nrecognition for the tremendous work they did under very, very difficult \ncircumstances.\n  Again, I commend the Senator from North Dakota for his effort. I hope \nwe adopt the resolution. I certainly congratulate the newspaper.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from North Dakota if \nhe will add my name as a cosponsor. I am a journalism graduate. I was \nfascinated with this Pulitzer award. I am pleased he is recognizing \nthem in this manner.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Daschle and \nSenator Coverdell as original cosponsors of the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair also requests that the junior \nSenator from Nebraska be added to that august list.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent to add the junior Senator from \nNebraska as well, Senator Hagel, as an original cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We will leave it open for other Senators that might also \nwish to cosponsor it.\n  Let me just say that the publisher, Mike Maidenberg, and the editor, \nMike Jacobs, did truly a remarkable job in having this newspaper \nproduced every single day even though their building was destroyed by \nflood and fire, and to produce a remarkable product that has won this \nprestigious Pulitzer Prize. We are very, very proud of what they have \ndone, of what they have done to help hold that community together, and \nwe are especially proud that it bring home this remarkable honor that I \nthink all of us would say is absolutely justified.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate minority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/20/senate-section/article/S3270-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3271-S3274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          EDUCATION SAVINGS ACT FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendments be \nset aside and I be permitted to speak on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I look forward to the opportunity that \nwe now have today and tomorrow to debate one of the most important \nissues facing our country. I applaud all of those involved, Senator \nCoverdell, and others on our side, who have dedicated themselves to \nfinding solutions.\n  I must say that while we offer solutions and while we mutually \nrecognize the importance of the issue, I do not really know of an issue \nthat probably divides us more philosophically at this point than does \neducation.\n  Our Republican colleagues, in large measure, believe there is not a \nrole at the Federal level for educational priorities, that it really is \nan issue that ought to be left to the local level, to public school \ndistricts, and to others.\n  Democrats, on the other hand, believe that there ought to be a role \nfor every level of government, that the people of the United States \nhave an interest and a need to ensure that our educational priorities \nand our educational challenges are met with every tool available to us \nin order to be able to compete effectively in the information age.\n  So that difference in philosophical approach brings us to the point \nwhere we are today, with two very different proposals on how we might \nbest address education. One provides what I would describe as a minimal \ntax reduction--$7 per tax return if your children are in public school \nand about $37 if your children are in private school--to the parents of \nchildren attending school today, a $1.6 billion plan that does not go \nvery far when you simply spread it out over the many, many families in \nAmerica who have children in public and private elementary and \nsecondary school today. The other is our approach which allows a more \ntargeted investment in some of the very specific needs that we have in \neducation today.\n  I do not think there is much difference of opinion with regard to the \nrecognition that a strong public education system is key to America's \nfuture. I would even argue that most of our Republican colleagues would \nshare that view even though they are more likely to be more supportive, \nit appears, of private educational approaches than public.\n  Economic prosperity, our position as a world leader, our very \ndemocracy all depend on providing educational opportunity to children. \nWe know that. We also know that in a new global information economy, \nknowledge and work force skills have become an extremely important \nfactor in economic growth.\n  So at the dawn of the global information economy, it is appropriate \nto give opportunities to communities facing conflicting pressures from \nrising enrollments and aging infrastructure and demands by taxpayers \nfor State and local relief. It is appropriate to find ways in which to \nprovide communities with new tools to manage these conflicting \npressures. We recognize that managing these pressures better would be \ngood for society, good for the economy, and good for national security.\n\n  We have heard a lot about what is wrong with public education. For \nexample, our 12th graders are behind the rest of the world in math and \nscience. We all agree that is unacceptable. But there are some signs of \nprogress. Our fourth graders are well above the average in mathematics \nand near the top in science.\n  Innovative programs are being implemented around the country today. \nChicago has implemented a broad, districtwide reform program that ends \nsocial promotions, that raises standards, and that provides extra help \nthrough weekend and summer school programs. Parents and other \nindividuals and communities all over the country are more involved in \nmany aspects of schools than they have ever been before. So there are \nsome good signs. Schools in low-income neighborhoods in New York\n\n[[Page S3272]]\n\nand other places are implementing programs like Success for All and are \ngetting some dramatic results.\n  The bottom line is that, with all of the effort underway at the local \nlevel, do we abandon our public schools? Do we abandon the partnership \nthat the people of the United States have had in ensuring, from a \nnational perspective, that our public schools have the opportunities to \nmeet the challenges of the information age? Do we all agree that it \nshould be a fundamental right that all children have the opportunity to \ndevelop their God-given talents, that our country's future depends on \nit? I hope we can.\n  We all know the reality. The reality is that student enrollment is at \na record level and expected to grow dramatically over the next decade. \nThe second reality is that the teacher core is aging; we may not be \nable to keep up in recruiting what needs there will be in every \nclassroom in the country--a qualified teacher--to keep student-teacher \nratios somewhere close to where they are today. The reality is that \nschools will need to hire more than 2 million new teachers over the \nnext decade.\n  The reality is that school buildings are aging. The reality is that \nthe General Accounting Office has now reported to the U.S. Senate and \nto the American people that there is a $112 billion backlog in \nconstruction funding needed to address deteriorating buildings--$112 \nbillion. And this does not include funds to provide additional \nclassrooms for enrollment growth, reduce class sizes, or put more \ntechnology in classrooms. This just says, given where we are right now, \ngiven the current enrollment--let us not talk about increases in \nenrollment, let us not talk about what it is going to take to put \ntechnology in classes--given current enrollment, we have a $112 billion \nbacklog in construction.\n  We talk about infrastructure backlogs. We talk about the deficits we \nhave--our trade deficit, our infrastructure deficit in highways and \nbridges and roads, the deficit that we have had for so long with regard \nto our budget--now fortunately resolved, at least for now--but could \nthere be a more important deficit for which this country needs to be \nconcerned than the deficit we have in our schools and in the \neducational system that directly affects the quality of education our \nstudents get?\n  Addressing these problems demands a cooperative and concerted effort \nat every level of government. I have too many communities in rural \nSouth Dakota that recognize everything I have said. But they say to me \ndirectly, ``We simply can't acquire the resources necessary to meet the \nchallenges that we know are out there. And, frankly, we don't know what \nwe're going to do.'' They tell us that this is a national concern and \nought to be addressed as a national issue. If it is addressed as a \nnational issue, the people of the United States have to be concerted in \ntheir effort to find ways to deal with these problems more effectively.\n  The American people want action. You name the poll, conservative or \nliberal--the polls will tell us that education is one of the highest \npriorities in our country today. Only 1 percent of the Federal budget \nis spent on primary and secondary education, and that includes special \neducation--1 percent.\n  So, Madam President, it isn't that we are breaking the budget with \nwhat we spend. It isn't that we simply have taken money away from other \nthings to put in education. When you have a $112 billion deficit on \njust infrastructure for education, and are only spending 1 percent of \nthe budget, the question is, what should we do? What opportunities can \nbe afforded to address this in a more balanced and more prudent way?\n\n  As we contended with that question over some period of time and with \nvirtual unanimity, Democratic Senators have introduced S. 1708, the \nbill we call the RESULTS Act, to show what we think should be done to \nimprove public education. Our bill does a number of things, and I want \nto outline them very briefly.\n  First, it reduces the class size in the early grades and helps \ncommunities hire 100,000 qualified teachers. We have already seen what \nhiring more cops does in neighborhoods. I was just in South Dakota for \nvirtually 2 weeks, and I was amazed at the reports that I am getting, \nat the tremendous effect community police have had. We have added new \ncommunity police to the work force in so many communities in my State. \nIf it is so good for preventing crime and dealing with crime in \nneighborhoods, what could be better than to say we have also got to do \nit in education? We have to find a way to ensure that this dramatic \nshortage we are going to have with teachers all over the country can be \naddressed in an effective way.\n  Let's hire 100,000 qualified teachers over the next couple of years. \nOnce we have hired those teachers, the second thing we do is to say \nlet's build and modernize 5,000 public schools. We have a series of \ncharts, that I will get to in a minute, that help us address these \nthings. But let's modernize some schools, 5,000 of them; set that as \nour goal.\n  Let's provide after-school care for half a million children. Let's \nprovide more computers for classrooms across the country and training \nfor teachers who were just hired. Let's establish an educational \nopportunity grant program for high poverty urban and rural areas that \nare serious about bringing about real reform.\n  I was never so pleased as when I saw this morning in the Washington \nPost where a school in Fairfax County has decided to use the \nmultimillion-dollar investment they have, 12 months a year, to improve \neducation in ways they are not doing today. The article went on to say \nthat there are about 2,700 schools around the country that are doing \nthe same thing. I say it is about time.\n  Unfortunately, our Republican colleagues have chosen not to address \nthose issues. They don't deal with these problems. The Republican \nbudget resolution states explicitly that no funding for any of the \nPresident's education initiatives shall be authorized--that s \nexplicitly in the budget. It provides $2 billion less than what the \nPresident has proposed for education and training in next year's \nbudget. It actually denies help to reduce class sizes and hire the \n100,000 teachers I mentioned a moment ago. It actually denies help to \ncommunities to build or modernize public schools. It denies additional \nafter-school care to help children learn more and reduce juvenile \ncrime. It denies the incentive to help high poverty communities adopt \nserious comprehensive reform.\n  Instead, unfortunately, my colleagues continue to insist that \nvouchers to private schools and block grant proposals that absolutely \nremove any opportunity for the entire country to be engaged in a \nnational investment in education be provided. In short, they do \nvirtually nothing, to improve public education today.\n  I reiterate, you can make the case that all this ought to be done at \nthe local level. You can make the case that somehow Rochford and \nIpswich and Rosholt and Warner and Buffalo and Faith and Wall, SD, \ndon't need any help from the people of the United States as they try to \nfigure out ways in which to address the incredible array of problems \nthat they have. But we are not willing to admit that. We believe \nstrongly that we have to have a comprehensive agenda in education. We \nhave to address this terrible problem we have in infrastructure. We \nhave to recognize that this teacher shortage is real. We have to find \nways with which to acknowledge the information age and access better \ntechnical innovation. We can do that. We can pass the RESULTS Act. I \nhope we will do that.\n  Of all the things I hope we can talk about in some detail, I want to \nfocus on one of those today, with the hope that maybe we can come back \nand address some of the others at another time. I want to talk briefly \nabout this matter of infrastructure, because I do believe that when it \ncomes to the array of priorities we have, perhaps the biggest concern I \nhave right now, as we look at the challenges we face, is \ninfrastructure.\n  We are proposing in our legislation--and we will offer an amendment \ntomorrow--to provide interest-free school modernization bonds to \nimprove public education across the country. It is a new, cost-\neffective financing option for communities. And I emphasize ``option.'' \nThere are no mandates. Schools don't have to use this. But as they \ncontemplate whether or not they can afford a new school, a new \nfacility, modernization, they will now have the\n\n[[Page S3273]]\n\nknowledge, if this legislation passes, that we will assist them, we \nwill reduce their tax load, we will reduce the amount of exposure they \nhave as they make their commitments. We will do that with them. So this \nis really a tax reduction effort of a different kind.\n  The way we do it is pretty simple. We simply say, if you make a \ncommitment to new infrastructure, we are going to help you make it more \ncost effective. We will make it more cost efficient, more palatable \nfrom a cost point of view, by paying the interest. You pay the \nprincipal; we will pay the interest. The interest is sometimes up to \nhalf of the overall cost.\n  The overall bonding authority is about $22 billion. To take a typical \nscenario where you have conventional bond financing, a $15 million \nproject would require an additional $7.5 million of interest. In this \ntypical project, we would be paying $7.5 million, or about one-third, \nas a national commitment and the local communities would pay $15 \nmillion. So the interest-free school modernization effort would have a \nprofound effect on a local decision.\n  Now, as most people know, local decisions involving bond issues \nsometimes require a 60 percent vote, and in many cases even a 67 \npercent vote, or two-thirds, is required. I can't tell you how many \ntimes bond issues in South Dakota have failed on the basis of 1 percent \nor 2 percent. An overwhelming majority have passed them, but they have \nfallen short of the 60 or 67 percent required in order to meet the \nlocal legal requirements. I am convinced this would put us over the top \nin many of those cases.\n  Why do we even worry about it? Why should we be concerned about \nwhether the bond issues go over the top? This chart lays it out fairly \nwell: 74 percent of the Nation's public schools today are more than 25 \nyears old; nearly a third are more than 50 years old.\n  We have modern businesses, modern Senate office buildings, and we \nhave schools in which our children are expected to learn that are today \nmore than 50 years old. Now, they don't have the resources we have in \nthe U.S. Capitol, a building that is 200 years old. If they did, I \nwould not be concerned. It isn't the age of the buildings, if they are \nwell built, but what kind of buildings are they? Well, this second line \nanswers that question:\n  Fourteen million kids today are in schools needing major renovation \nor replacement--14 million; 12 million children are in schools with \nleaking roofs and/or ineffective or defective plumbing; 10 million kids \nare in schools with inadequate lighting; 7 million kids are in schools \nwith safety code violations, such as the presence of asbestos, lead \npaint, and an array of other environmental problems.\n  We want our kids to learn and we say that education is a priority. We \nsay we are willing to make the investment. We say that there can't be \nanything more important than our children. But then we tell our \nchildren that we want you to learn in a building that is out of date, \nthat needs renovation, that may have toxic chemicals in the classroom, \nthat has poor lighting and, God forbid, poor plumbing. But we want you \nto learn because you are important to us.\n  The real problem is that, in the future, this is going to be \nexacerbated dramatically. Public school enrollment will increase by 13 \npercent in the next 10 years. And 6,000 new schools are going to need \nto be built at an estimated cost of $73 billion just to maintain \ncurrent class size, just to say that if we are going to keep the 25-to-\n1 student-teacher ratio, we have to build 6,000 new schools. The \nquestion comes, if we need a 60 or 67 percent vote at a local level and \nwe say it is all your responsibility, we don't care whether you have \nthe resources or not, this just isn't going to happen, Madam President. \nForty-five percent of the school districts are already using 3,621 \ntrailers and makeshift classrooms. If you have not been in one of those \nclassrooms when it is 85 degrees outside, I invite you to participate. \nIt is as dramatic a lesson in the extraordinary problems our teachers \nand students are facing as they try to learn as anything I have seen.\n  The enrollment here is pretty clear. All of the blue we see on this \nmap shows where we see dramatic increases in enrollment. It doesn't \ntake a rocket scientist to figure out that in every one of those States \nwe have some very serious educational infrastructure problems that we \nhave to address.\n  Madam President, it really comes down to this. State and local taxes \nas a share of income have already risen 10 percent in the past two \ndecades. The estimated $112 billion backlog and the $73 billion cost of \nnew schools will place an increasing burden on State and local \ntaxpayers, even though these taxes have gone up. By dramatically \ncutting the cost of school repairs and construction to communities, \ninterest-free bonds will provide badly needed property and sales tax \nrelief to working families.\n  This isn't just an education proposal, this is a tax relief proposal. \nIf you think property taxes are too high, if you think local taxes are \ntoo high, then you are going to want to support this amendment because \nthis is a way to reduce local property taxes, local taxes to fund the \neducational demands that we are going to have in virtually every State \nin the country.\n  The State courts are already mandating new infrastructure. They are \nrequiring that we remedy the financing inequities. Courts in 11 States \nhave ruled that the school financing systems are unconstitutional. In \nnearly every case, States have complied by raising property or sales \ntaxes to finance school improvements.\n  What does that tell you if the courts are already mandating what we \nare trying to do voluntarily? They are saying that you have to find a \nbetter way to finance schools because what you have is not working. \nLitigation is pending in 16 other States already.\n  Madam President, it is pretty simple. Americans have looked at this \nproposal. Three-fourths of the voters in this country--75 percent--\nfavor Federal aid to communities for school repair and modernization. \nFifty percent of the voters consider overcrowded schools a major \nproblem. Almost 80 percent believe public school renovation and \nmodernization is a higher Federal priority than highway construction. I \nsupported the highway bill, and I continue to do so. I think it was a \ngood piece of legislation. But if we are going to make a commitment to \nhighway infrastructure and transportation infrastructure in this \ncountry, where is the same enthusiasm for ensuring that we have the \neducational infrastructure?\n\n  Madam President, 73 percent of Republicans and 65 percent of \nindependents strongly support a Federal commitment, a commitment by the \npeople of the United States, to education and infrastructure \nmodernization. We will have an opportunity to have more debate and \nfurther discussion and consideration of these Democratic proposals. I \ndo hope that, as these votes are presented to our body tomorrow, we \nwill see the wisdom of making these investments, and that we will put \nour money where our mouth is when we make the commitment and tell our \nchildren that we are going to help you be educated, that you are our \nhighest priority, that you truly deserve to have the kind of \nopportunities to learn in an environment that is conducive to learning. \nThat is what this is about. I just hope our colleagues will weigh it \ncarefully and support these Democratic amendments as they are offered \nduring this debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, it is my understanding that there are \nno more amendments that are ready for offering this evening. So, very \nshortly, we will move to closure.\n  I did want to take a minute or two to reiterate that the proposal \ncurrently before the body that is authored by myself on this side of \nthe aisle, and Senator Torricelli on their side of the aisle, is a \nbipartisan effort to bring about substantial change in education.\n  The minority leader and I have a different view on the data coming \nout of our elementary schools. He suggested that we are doing pretty \nwell in math among fourth graders, and near the top in science. I just \nhaven't seen any data that suggests that. The data I am seeing suggests \nthat only 4 out of 10 students in our big city schools are able to pass \na basic exam. If you lump them all together, it only gets up to 6 out \nof 10, which is hardly something that America can count on to get ready \nfor the new century.\n\n[[Page S3274]]\n\n  The Senator from South Dakota spent considerable time talking about \nthe school construction proposal. I want to point out that there is a \nschool construction proposal offered by Senator Graham of Florida that \nis in the proposal that is on the floor. It loosens, or makes more \neasy, the opportunity to finance school construction. It is not nearly \nas expensive as the proposal being talked about here.\n  Just to take a moment or two, the proposal that was just outlined by \nthe minority leader does raise some questions. I know in my State--I \ndon't know about the State of the chair--billions of dollars are \nalready being spent to build schools, to modernize schools, and that is \nbecause it is a State responsibility.\n  As I was listening to the presentation, it was sort of running \nthrough my mind, well, are we headed toward a situation where those \nStates that accepted their responsibility and built their schools and \nkept them modern are now going to have to subsidize States that have \nnot? It is a curious question. As we have time to debate their \nproposal, I am sure it will clarify itself somewhat. But it certainly \nraises a question in my mind. I would not want a situation to occur \nwhere Georgia had fulfilled its responsibilities and some other State \ndidn't, so now we are going to step in with a new proposal to make \nright something that perhaps is not.\n  I think you have to remember that construction has traditionally been \na State responsibility. However, Senator Graham's proposal does broaden \nthe ability and make it more accessible for States to construct in this \ncase immediately some 500 schools across the Nation.\n  Madam President, I want to clarify one statement just before we yield \nfor the unanimous consent requests.\n  The minority leader said that our side of the aisle did nothing for \npublic education. That is a pretty far-reaching statement considering \nthat the proposal in front of us would help 14 million families finance \neducation, 10 million of which are in public education, that would \naccumulate in the first 5 years $5 billion of new resources, $2.5 \nbillion of which would go to support public schools. It would help 21 \nStates plus 17 additional States that are considering prepaid tuition. \nIt would help employers in the continuing education of 1 million \nemployees. It would help 250,000 graduate students and would provide up \nto $3 billion in school construction over the next 5 years--public \nschool construction.\n  I not only consider that something; I consider that a lot, an \nenormous beginning in making the Federal Government a good partner in \nterms of improving education in our country--public, private, home, \nwherever it is occurring.\n  Tomorrow we will have an opportunity to debate an amendment offered \nby the Senator from Washington that removes the Federal constriction, \nor constraints, or oversight on about $15 billion, that would allow \nlocal school districts to hire teachers, build schools, provide buses, \nor whatever the Governors of those States and local communities thought \nnecessary. It wouldn't have the Federal mantra over it that says you \nonly get these benefits if you do these things the way we say. That \nwill be an interesting debate that we will get into tomorrow.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2290\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL.

Madam President, recently, the National Transportation \nSafety Board (NTSB) held a public meeting in Washington, D.C. to \ndiscuss the findings of a comprehensive study it conducted to assess \nthe safety initiatives undertaken by industry and government and \nprivate organizations to prevent excavation damage to underground \npipelines. As a result of the study, the NTSB adopted twenty-seven \nsafety recommendations to reduce the risks posed by excavation damage. \nI want to take this opportunity to commend the NTSB for its proactive \nstance on this important safety issue.\n  Excavation damage poses serious safety risks to our Nation's critical \ninfrastructure. This infrastructure, among other things, transports \nnatural gas, petroleum, and other chemical products through pipelines \nand enables telephone and Internet access through a vast network of \nfiber optic cables and communication lines. Damage to this \ninfrastructure not only exposes people and the environment to safety \nrisks, but impedes economic development.\n  The NTSB agrees. In a press release issued on the study, the NTSB \nstates ``a single pipeline accident has the potential to cause a \ncatastrophic disaster that can injure hundreds of persons, affect \nthousands more, and cost millions of dollars in terms of property \ndamage, loss of work opportunity, community disruption, ecological \ndamage, and insurance liability. Excavation and construction activities \nare the largest single cause of accidents to pipelines.'' The Safety \nBoard goes on to say that in ``addition to being expensive and \ninconvenient, disruption of the telecommunications network can have \nsignificant safety implication, such as impact on traffic control \nsystems, health services, and emergency response activities.''\n  The NTSB further found that ``damage from outside force is the \nleading cause of leaks and ruptures to pipeline systems, accounting for \nmore than 40 percent of the reported failures.'' Excavation damage, the \nNTSB determined, ``is also the single largest cause of interruptions to \nfiber cable service.''\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I would like to stand with the \nMajority Leader not only in affirming the importance of pipelines to \nour national transportation infrastructure, but also as a personal \nwitness to the damage that a pipeline accident can have on victims of \npipeline eruptions, and particularly to the community.\n  Four years ago, around midnight, on March 24, 1994, a major natural \ngas pipeline ruptured in Edison, New Jersey, a densely populated, urban \nenvironment. This rupture caused a deafening boom, awakening residents \nof the Durham Woods apartment complex. Seconds later, a plume of fire \nand gas shot hundreds of feet above the ground. Thankfully, the more \nthan one thousand residents fled their homes, all leaving before the \nexplosion leveled the Durham Woods apartment complex. I visited the \nsite after the blast. I saw how the explosion incinerated cars, \nplayground equipment and trees. Over one hundred people suffered \ninjuries from the fire. One woman died from a heart attack. It was a \nmiracle that nobody else died from that disaster. Four years later, the \nvictims still suffer emotionally and physically. Some are\n\n[[Page S3275]]\n\nstill awaiting settlements. They escaped with their lives but their \nlives are not the same. A state grand jury determined that the disaster \nprobably was tied to damage caused earlier by unauthorized excavation \nwhich weakened the pipe, causing it to explode.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I remember that disaster to which the \nSenator from New Jersey refers. That, along with other devastating \nexcavation damage acts, such as those in Puerto Rico and Minnesota, led \nto the NTSB's decision to issue new strong safety recommendations to \nthe Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), the Federal \nHighway Administration (FHWA), states, and other industry groups \nincluding trade associations.\n  But today, I want to focus on two recommendations in particular. As a \nresult of the study I mentioned above, the Safety Board issued a \nrecommendation strongly urging states to adopt comprehensive one-call \nstatewide excavation programs. They believe that one-call programs are \nproven to prevent damage due to excavation, thereby reducing the \nlikelihood of pipeline disasters.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, the Safety Board is right. Following \nthe disaster, the State of New Jersey adopted a comprehensive one-call \nprogram that mandates participation throughout the state. It has been a \nresounding success. Every year since its adoption, accidental hits have \ndecreased. In 1995 --the first year of the program, there were 4,624 \nhits of underground lines in 1.7 million excavations. In 1996, there \nwere 3,974 hits in 2.1 million excavations. And last year, there were \n3,796 hits in 2.5 million excavations--a success rate of 98.8 percent.\n  One call programs work. We in New Jersey have seen the devastation \ncaused by pipeline eruptions. We in New Jersey have seen what a one-\ncall program can do.\n  Mr. LOTT. The Safety Board issued another recommendation. It also \ndetermined, as a result of the study, that our nation's railroads \nshould involve themselves in statewide excavation damage prevention \nprograms. The recommendations state that the associations should urge \ntheir members ``to fully participate in statewide excavation damage \nprevention programs, including one-call notification centers.'' The \nrecommendations were issued to the Association of American Railroads \n(AAR) and the American Short Line Railroad Association.\n  Why has the Safety Board taken such a position? Perhaps it is because \nsome railroads apparently oppose participating in excavation damage \nprevention programs, including one-call notification centers. Some one-\ncall notification center participants indicate that the railroads are \noften no-shows when it comes to underground damage prevention.\n  Currently, railroads are required to participate in state one-call \nnotification systems in ten states. I want to repeat that again, only \nten states. Yet AAR opposed the Lott-Daschle one-call notification bill \nwhich passed by the Senate by unanimous consent last year because we \nwould not include provisions preempting state laws and exempting \nrailroads from participation in state one-call notification systems in \nthe remaining forty states.\n  I understand the railroad industry is taking the same position in the \nHouse. I am told AAR is vigorously opposing the Lott-Daschle one-call \nnotification legislation unless the House mandates that railroads are \nexempt from state's one-call notification systems. So much for industry \nopposition to Federal mandates.\n  Instead of advancing the cause of safety and underground damage \nprevention, AAR is trying to use my bill to reduce safety through a \nfederal exemption in the states where one-call participation is \nrequired. This stance is exactly opposite from the position being urged \nby the Safety Board.\n\n  Do the railroads pose a safety risk to underground facilities? Yes, \nthey do. Ameritech recently released a survey of major \ntelecommunication facility outages which found that 17 percent of the \nmajor outages in the United States were caused by railroads. This \nsurvey, as well as the NTSB study, demonstrates that there is a clear \nbenefit to the public if railroads participate in one-call notification \nsystems.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I cannot agree more. States need the \nfull participation of every stakeholder in order for a one-call program \nto be successful. A comprehensive national one-call initiative is far \nfrom comprehensive, far from national, if a major industry that has a \nsignificant role in the location of pipelines along their rights of way \nchooses to take a walk on an initiative that is important in protecting \nour communities and the environment against the damage incurred by \npipeline accidents.\n  As the Majority Leader noted, the Senate adopted the Lott-Daschle \none-call bill as part of ISTEA reauthorization. This is not without \nprecedent. The Administration included a one-call provision in its \nNEXTEA bill. A one-call bill, sponsored by my colleague from New \nJersey, Congressman Frank Pallone, and Congressman Richard Baker of \nLouisiana, is moving through the House of Representatives. The support \nlies in the Senate, in the Administration, and in key areas in the \nHouse. All we need is to break that logjam and sign a comprehensive \none-call bill into law. All that is standing in its way is that the \nrailroads' adamant opposition to the bill--opposition that is \npreventing the bill from moving ahead. It would be a shame if we missed \nout on this opportunity to pass this safety initiative only because of \nthe railroad industry.\n  Mr. LOTT. The Safety Board has long been our Nation's premier safety \nagency and the Congress has turned to it on many occasions for its \nadvice on ways to improve transportation safety. Moreover, Safety Board \nrecommendations have served as the foundation for many transportation \nsafety bills and laws.\n  Rather than launch a campaign for exemptions, the railroad industry \nmight better serve transportation safety if it works with Congress to \nimplement the reasonable recommendations of the National Transportation \nSafety Board.\n  Let me stress to my fellow Senators that I remain a big supporter of \nthe nation's railroads. Railroads are, as they like to say, ``the \nengine that drives America.'' I agree railroads are a huge engine, an \nimportant engine in America's economy.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I too support our nation's railroads. Railroads play \na critical role in my state in particular. Ships arrive in the \nintermodal hub that is the Port of New York and New Jersey, unload \ncontainers directly onto railroad cars, and send them into the \nheartland of the United States. Railroad lines exist throughout the \nstate. That is exactly why I care about this issue and urge the \nrailroads to join us in this effort to enact a comprensive bill into \nlaw.\n  Madam President, I want to commend the Majority Leader for his \ninvolvement and diligence on this issue. Safety must be paramount. And \nthat is what this issue is all about.\n  Mr. LOTT. I hope the railroad industry rethinks its position on one-\ncall notification legislation. I urge them to join us on the side of \nsafety.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/20/senate-section/article/S3274-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3275-S3276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BOB CRANDALL\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, last week an American giant announced \nhis plans to retire. Obviously, that description has more than one \nconnotation. Bob Crandall is a giant in his industry and a remarkable \npioneer. Few, if any, leaders in aviation can match his impressive \nrecord of achievement.\n  The American airlines he joined is vastly different than the one he \nwill soon leave. In a time of great economic turbulence in aviation \nindustry, Mr. Crandall navigated his company and the industry itself to \nnew heights and vastly new horizons. As a result, we are all \nbeneficiaries.\n  We know this man as an innovator. A person who understood that \ncompetition was not only good, it was essential. As a frequent flyer, I \nand millions of other Americans have benefited from the program he \nconceived to bring down costs and encourage loyal customers.\n  We know him, too, as a financial manager of incomparable depth. \nAmerican has been a consistent leader in profits and fiscal management. \nHis stockholders have benefited from an array of innovations including \ncode-sharing and the hub and spoke system in routing that has now been \nadopted\n\n[[Page S3276]]\n\nby virtually every airline in the business.\n  My wife, Linda, and I have known Bob for some time now. We have no \ndoubt that this man of many interests and so much energy is far from \nretiring. There will be new challenges and most likely, more \npioneering.\n  Whatever future he may now be planning, we wish him well. We \ncongratulate and thank him for what he has been and how much he has \ndone.\n  Bob Crandall is an American original.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an editorial from the New York Times of \nApril 16th regarding Mr. Crandall's retirement be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 16, 1998]\n\n                     An Aviation Innovator Departs\n\n       Robert Crandall of American Airlines, who is expected to \n     retire next month, always believed he knew exactly what was \n     right for the airline industry and never hesitated to \n     challenge anyone who disagreed. But he also recognized, to \n     the great benefit of his shareholders, when to junk nostrums \n     that circumstances proved false.\n       Mr. Crandall knew that deregulation would be disastrous for \n     his industry. But after the Carter Administration withdrew \n     the regulatory safety blanket, he brilliantly constructed a \n     complex hub-and-spoke system that brought passengers the \n     steeply lower fares and vastly better flight schedules \n     economists had predicted. Mr. Crandall also knew that \n     sophisticated mathematics could maximize profit by tailoring \n     different prices to different types of passengers. But when \n     that approach grew too complicated, he adopted a simplified \n     system and challenged his competitors to go along with his \n     good idea. When they refused, setting off a destructive price \n     war, he quickly let it drop and returned to a complex fare \n     schedule.\n       Mr. Crandall demonstrated that competition was good for \n     consumers. But when upstart airlines grabbed his customers, \n     he devised frequent-flier miles, an ingenious strategy that \n     tied travelers to large airlines like American even when \n     rivals were offering lower fares. Mr. Crandall knew that code \n     sharing--the practice by which two airlines would sell \n     tickets on each other's connecting flights under the name of \n     a single carrier--was misleading because it fooled customers \n     into believing they had booked a seamless flight. Yet when \n     Mr. Crandall looked around and saw his competitors pairing \n     up, he pounced, proposing a vast code-sharing arrangement \n     with British Airways. If approved, it will lock in American's \n     dominant position at London's coveted Heathrow Airport.\n       With his background in finance, Mr. Crandall taught his \n     colleagues about the vulnerability of an industry saddled \n     with mammoth fixed costs--an unoccupied seat represents \n     unrecoverable revenue but no reduction in costs--to pilot \n     strikes and other business holdups. When he announced his \n     retirement yesterday, his airline also boasted of record high \n     profits and a management team ready to take over that would \n     be the envy of other airlines. It was a precisely timed \n     departure from a smart, combative leader and a nimble learner \n     who left his mark on a turbulent sector of the American \n     economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/20/senate-section/article/S3275-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HONORING LOUISVILLE PIONEER JAMES GUTHRIE\n\n  Mr. FORD. Madam President, on April 22nd, Louisville will honor one \nof its foremost, but often forgotten leaders, James Guthrie. Guthrie, \nwas one of Louisville's most prominent citizens in the 19th Century, \ndescribed as the city's ``first and foremost mover and shaker.''\n  During his distinguished business and political career, he served as \nPresident of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad and the University \nof Louisville. As a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives, he \nsuccessfully ushered through Kentucky's first city charter elevating \nLouisville from a town to a city. He was instrumental in the founding \nof Cave Hill Cemetery, lighting the streets with gas lights, building \nthe first bridge across the Ohio River, and founding what would become \nthe University of Louisville's medical college.\n  Mr. Guthrie left his mark on the national level as well. Under \nPresident Franklin Pierce he served as Secretary to the U.S. Treasury \nand in 1865 he was elected to the U.S. Senate.\n  A 19th Century railroad tycoon, Guthrie was a product of the \nfrontier. Born in Bardstown, Kentucky, he rose from modest means to a \nposition of great prominence, including building a reputation as an \noutstanding lawyer. And while he may have failed in his efforts to see \nLouisville named the state capital, there is little else at which he \ndidn't succeed once setting his mind to it.\n  One of his most noted accomplishments was improving transportation, \nincluding development of railroad transportation from Louisville to \nFrankfort, Nashville, Indianapolis, and Cincinnati, even when it meant \nplaying hardball to reach his goal.\n  Despite his long list of contributions to Louisville, the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky and the nation as a whole, there is relatively \nlittle in the way of historical markers to remind people of his \ntremendous influence. To remedy that situation, an historic marker will \nbe dedicated at the intersection of Fourth and Guthrie Streets.\n  Madam President, it certainly seems fitting that we take time to \nassure someone who contributed so much is remembered by future \ngenerations. And I know I join all Kentuckians in lending my support to \nthe City of Louisville's efforts at memorializing a man so committed to \nKentucky and the nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/20/senate-section/article/S3276-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, last week we passed Tax Day 1998. All \nacross the nation, the IRS reported millions of taxpayers suffered \nconfusion and animosity over filing their 1997 taxes. While no \nconfusion exists--in fact, the financial amount is too clear--every \nman, woman and child should feel animosity at the more than $20,000 \nbill issued them to pay off the federal debt.\n  In the same vein, Mr. President, May 10th will be Tax Freedom Day \n1998. While the name speaks for itself, Tax Freedom Day was not always \nsuch a landmark day because the federal debt was neither so monstrous \nnor so cumbersome. Tax Freedom Day comes one day later than last year.\n  It is fortunate that so many reminders that the federal debt will \ncontinue to escalate unless and until Congress restrains its desire to \nspend, spend, spend. Hopefully one day Congress will wake up.\n  Madam President, with this in mind, let's begin where we left off:\n  At the close of business Friday, April 17, 1998, the federal debt \nstood at $5,512,826,076,386.32 (Five trillion, five hundred twelve \nbillion, eight hundred twenty-six million, seventy-six thousand, three \nhundred eighty-six dollars and thirty-two cents).\n  One year ago, April 17, 1997, the federal debt stood at \n$5,350,647,000,000 (Five trillion, three hundred fifty billion, six \nhundred forty-seven million).\n  Twenty-five years ago, April 17, 1973, the federal debt stood at \n$455,209,000,000 (Four hundred fifty-five billion, two hundred nine \nmillion) which reflects a debt increase of more than $5 trillion--\n$5,057,617,076,386.32 (Five trillion, fifty-seven billion, six hundred \nseventeen million, seventy-six thousand, three hundred eighty-six \ndollars and thirty-two cents) during the past 25 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/20/senate-section/article/S3276-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3276-S3277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      14th ANNUAL TUFTONIA'S WEEK CELEBRATION AT TUFTS UNIVERSITY\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, this week marks the fourteenth annual \nobservance of ``Tuftonia's Week'' in Massachusetts. During this \nremarkable week, Tufts University alumni from around the world return \nto Medford to honor their alma mater and call attention to the \nleadership of so many Tufts graduates in contributing to public service \nin their own communities.\n  In fact, the theme of Tuftonia's Week is community service. The \nuniversity will honor the large number of Tufts graduates across the \ncountry who are volunteering in their communities and helping to \nimprove the lives of others in their neighborhoods through the \nTuftServe program. Since 1995, Tufts alumni have contributed over \n300,000 volunteer hours to make their communities better places.\n  78,000 students have graduated from Tufts since the college was \nfounded in 1852. Today, the university enrolls 8,500 students from all \n50 states and 90 foreign countries.\n  Tufts deserves great credit for its leadership among the nation's \nuniversities in emphasizing service-learning and in providing \nopportunities for students to combine community service with their \nacademic curriculum. Every American should have the opportunity\n\n[[Page S3277]]\n\nto participate in projects that help others and improve their \ncommunity, and I congratulate Tufts for giving its students such an \nopportunity. I commend Tufts' President, John DiBiaggio, and the rest \nof the Tufts community for their impressive leadership in both \neducation and community service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/20/senate-section/article/S3276-3", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        HONORING THE GILLMINGS ON THEIR 50TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, families are the cornerstone of \nAmerica. The data are undeniable: Individuals from strong families \ncontribute to the society. In an era when nearly half of all couples \nmarried today will see their union dissolve into divorce, I believe it \nis both instructive and important to honor those who have taken the \ncommitment of ``till death us do part'' seriously, demonstrating \nsuccessfully the timeless principles of love, honor, and fidelity. \nThese characteristics make our country strong.\n  Pastor and Mrs. Gillming's dedication to one another has spilled over \ninto the lives of many. For forty years, they have served together at \nthe Cherry Street Baptist Church in Springfield, Missouri.

And that therefore to compensate veterans \n     for diseases whose sole connection to service is a veteran's \n     own tobacco use should not rest with the Government.''.\n       (2) Sense of the senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the function totals and assumptions underlying this \n     resolution assume the following:\n       (A) The support of the President's proposal to not allow \n     post-service smoking related illnesses to be eligible for VA.\n       (B) The study and report required by subparagraph (C) will \n     be completed.\n       (C) The Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, \n     the Office of Management and Budget, and the General \n     Accounting Office are jointly required to--\n       (i) jointly study (referred to in this section as the \n     ``study'') the VA General Counsel's determination and the \n     resulting actions to change the compensation rules to include \n     disability and death benefits for conditions related to the \n     use of tobacco products during service; and\n       (ii) deliver an opinion as to whether illnesses resulting \n     from post-service smoking should be considered as a \n     compensable disability.\n       (D) The study should include--\n       (i) the estimated numbers of those filing such claims, the \n     cost resulting from such benefits, the time necessary to \n     review such claims, and how such a number of claims will \n     affect the VA's ability to review its current claim load;\n       (ii) an examination of how the proposed change corresponds \n     to prior VA policy relating to post-service actions taken by \n     an individual; and\n       (iii) what Federal benefits, both VA and non-VA, former \n     service members having smoking-related illnesses are eligible \n     to receive.\n       (E) The study shall be completed no later than July 1, \n     1999.\n       (F) The Department of Veterans Affairs and the Office of \n     Management and Budget shall report their finding to the \n     Majority and Minority Leaders of the Senate and the chairmen \n     and ranking minority members of the Senate Budget and \n     Veterans' Affairs Committees.\n\n     SEC. 205. ADJUSTMENTS FOR LINE ITEM VETO LITIGATION.\n\n       If the Supreme Court rules that the Line Item Veto Act is \n     unconstitutional, the Chairman of the Committee on the Budget \n     may make appropriate adjustments to the allocations and \n     aggregates in this resolution to reflect the effects of the \n     President's cancellations becoming null and void.\n\n     SEC. 206. EXTENSION OF VIOLENT CRIME REDUCTION TRUST FUND.\n\n       (a) Discretionary Limits.--In the Senate, in this section \n     and for the purposes of allocations made for the \n     discretionary category pursuant to section 302(a) of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the term ``discretionary \n     spending limit'' means--\n       (1) with respect to fiscal year 1999--\n       (A) for the defense category: $271,570,000,000 in new \n     budget authority and $266,635,000,000 in outlays;\n       (B) for the nondefense category: $255,450,000,000 in new \n     budget authority and $289,547,000,000 in outlays; and\n       (C) for the violent crime reduction category: \n     $5,800,000,000 in new budget authority and $4,953,000,000 in \n     outlays;\n       (2) with respect to fiscal year 2000--\n       (A) for the discretionary category: $532,693,000,000 in new \n     budget authority and $558,711,000,000 in outlays; and\n       (B) for the violent crime reduction category: \n     $4,500,000,000 in new budget authority and $5,554,000,000 in \n     outlays;\n       (3) with respect to fiscal year 2001--\n       (A) for the discretionary category: $537,632,000,000 in new \n     budget authority and $558,415,000,000 in outlays; and\n\n[[Page S3281]]\n\n       (B) for the violent crime reduction category: \n     $4,400,000,000 in new budget authority and $5,981,000,000 in \n     outlays; and\n       (4) with respect to fiscal year 2002--\n       (A) for the discretionary category: $546,574,000,000 in new \n     budget authority and $556,269,000,000 in outlays; and\n       (B) for the violent crime reduction category: \n     $4,500,000,000 in new budget authority and $4,530,000,000 in \n     outlays;\n\n     as adjusted in strict conformance with subsection (b) of \n     section 251 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \n     Control Act of 1985 and section 314 of the Congressional \n     Budget Act.\n       (b) Point of Order in the Senate.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), it \n     shall not be in order in the Senate to consider--\n       (A) a revision of this resolution or any concurrent \n     resolution on the budget for fiscal years 1999, 2000, 2001, \n     or 2002 (or amendment, motion, or conference report on such a \n     resolution) that provides discretionary spending in excess of \n     the discretionary spending limit or limits for such fiscal \n     year; or\n       (B) any bill or resolution (or amendment, motion, or \n     conference report on such bill or resolution) for fiscal year \n     1999, 2000, 2001, or 2002 that would cause any of the limits \n     in this section (or suballocations of the discretionary \n     limits made pursuant to section 302(b) of the Congressional \n     Budget Act of 1974) to be exceeded.\n       (2) Exception.--This section shall not apply if a \n     declaration of war by the Congress is in effect or if a joint \n     resolution pursuant to section 258 of the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 has been enacted.\n       (c) Waiver.--This section may be waived or suspended in the \n     Senate only by the affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members, duly chosen and sworn.\n       (d) Appeals.--Appeals in the Senate from the decisions of \n     the Chair relating to any provision of this section shall be \n     limited to 1 hour, to be equally divided between, and \n     controlled by, the appellant and the manager of the \n     concurrent resolution, bill, or joint resolution, as the case \n     may be.

EXERCISE OF RULEMAKING POWERS.\n\n       Congress adopts the provisions of this title--\n       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and the House of Representatives, respectively, and as such \n     they shall be considered as part of the rules of each House, \n     or of that House to which they specifically apply, and such \n     rules shall supersede other rules only to the extent that \n     they are inconsistent therewith; and\n       (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     either House to change those rules (so far as they relate to \n     that House) at any time, in the same manner, and to the same \n     extent as in the case of any other rule of that House.\n              TITLE III--SENSE OF CONGRESS AND THE SENATE\n\n     SEC. 301. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING PASSAGE OF THE SENATE \n                   FINANCE COMMITTEE'S IRS RESTRUCTURING BILL.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the House of Representatives passed H.R. 2676 on \n     November 5, 1997;\n       (2) the Finance Committee of the Senate has held several \n     days of hearings this year on Internal Revenue Service \n     restructuring proposals;\n       (3) the hearings demonstrated many areas in which the \n     House-passed bill could be improved;\n       (4) on March 31, 1998, the Senate Finance Committee voted \n     20-0 to report an Internal Revenue Service restructuring \n     package that contains more oversight over the Internal \n     Revenue Service, more accountability for employees, and a new \n     arsenal of taxpayer protections; and\n       (5) the Senate Finance package includes the following items \n     which were not included in the House bill--\n       (A) removal of the statutory impediments to the \n     Commissioner of Internal Revenue's efforts to reorganize the \n     agency to create a more streamlined, taxpayer-friendly \n     organization,\n       (B) the providing of real oversight authority for the \n     Internal Revenue Service Oversight Board to help prevent \n     taxpayer abuse,\n       (C) the creation of a new Treasury Inspector General for \n     Tax Administration to ensure independence and accountability,\n       (D) real, meaningful relief for innocent spouses,\n       (E) provisions which abate penalties and interest after 1 \n     year so that the Internal Revenue Service does not profit \n     from its own delay,\n       (F) provisions which ensure due process of law to taxpayers \n     by granting them a right to a hearing before the Internal \n     Revenue Service can pursue a lien, levy, or seizure,\n       (G) provisions which forbid the Internal Revenue Service \n     from coercing taxpayers to extend the 10-year statute of \n     limitations for collection,\n       (H) provisions which require the Internal Revenue Service \n     to terminate employees who abuse taxpayers or other Internal \n     Revenue Service employees,\n       (I) provisions which make the Taxpayer Advocate more \n     independent, and\n       (J) provisions enabling the Commissioner of Internal \n     Revenue to manage employees more effectively.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     budget resolution assume that the Senate shall, as \n     expeditiously as possible, consider and pass an Internal \n     Revenue Service restructuring bill which provides the most \n     taxpayer protections, the greatest degree of Internal Revenue \n     Service employee accountability, and enhanced oversight.\n\n     SEC. 302. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE SUNSET OF THE \n                   INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that a simple and fair \n     Federal tax system is one that--\n       (1) applies a low tax rate, through easily understood laws, \n     to all Americans;\n       (2) provides tax relief for working Americans;\n       (3) protects the rights of taxpayers and reduces tax \n     collection abuses;\n       (4) eliminates the bias against savings and investment;\n       (5) promotes economic growth and job creation;\n       (6) does not penalize marriage or families; and\n       (7) provides for a taxpayer-friendly collections process to \n     replace the Internal Revenue Service.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the provisions of this resolution assume that all taxes \n     imposed under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall sunset \n     for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2001 (or in \n     the case of any tax not imposed on the basis of a taxable \n     year, on any taxable event or for any period after December \n     31, 2001) and that a new Federal tax system will be enacted \n     that is both simple and fair as described in subsection (a) \n     and that provides only those resources for the Federal \n     Government that are needed to meet its responsibilities to \n     the American people.\n\n     SEC. 303. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE TAX TREATMENT OF HOME \n                   MORTGAGE INTEREST AND CHARITABLE GIVING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) current Federal income tax laws embrace a number of \n     fundamental tax policies including longstanding encouragement \n     for home ownership and charitable giving, expanded health and \n     retirement benefits;\n       (2) the mortgage interest deduction is among the most \n     important incentives in the income tax code and promotes the \n     American Dream of home ownership--the single largest \n     investment for most families, and preserving it is critical \n     for the more than 20,000,000 families claiming it now and for \n     millions more in the future;\n       (3) favorable tax treatment to encourage gifts to charities \n     is a longstanding principle that helps charities raise funds \n     needed to provide services to poor families and others when \n     government is simply unable or unwilling to do so, and \n     maintaining this tax incentive will help charities raise \n     money to meet the challenges of their charitable missions in \n     the decades ahead;\n       (4) legislation has been proposed to repeal the entire \n     income tax code at the end of the year 2001 without providing \n     a specific replacement; and\n       (5) sunsetting the entire income tax code without \n     describing a replacement threatens our Nation's future \n     economic growth and unwisely eliminates existing tax \n     incentives that are crucial for taxpayers who are often \n     making the most important financial decisions of their lives.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the levels in this resolution assume that Congress supports \n     the continued tax deductibility of home mortgage interest and \n     charitable contributions and that a sunset of the tax code \n     that does not provide a replacement tax system that preserves \n     this deductibility could damage the American dream of home \n     ownership and could threaten the viability of nonprofit \n     institutions.\n\n     SEC. 304. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON PRESERVATION OF SOCIAL \n                   SECURITY FOR THE FUTURE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Social Security is one of the Nation's most important \n     income security programs;\n       (2) the preservation of Social Security both for those now \n     retired and for future generations of working Americans is a \n     vital national priority;\n       (3) the Trustees of the Federal Old Age and Survivors \n     Insurance and Disability Insurance Trust Funds have reported \n     to Congress that--\n       (A) the retirement of the baby boom generation will cause \n     Social Security expenditures to accelerate rapidly beginning \n     around 2010;\n       (B) Social Security expenditures will exceed Social \n     Security revenues after 2012 and the trust funds will be \n     depleted of reserves in 2029; and\n       (C) after 2029, tax revenues will be sufficient to cover \n     only three-fourths of the benefits promised under current \n     law, and, by the end of the 75 year projection period, the \n     annual deficit in the trust funds will reach 2.1 percent of \n     the GDP;\n\n[[Page S3282]]\n\n       (4) Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, \n     has testified before Congress that Social Security's unfunded \n     liability stands at around $3,000,000,000,000 and advised \n     Congress to move expeditiously to reform the program so that \n     current workers will have sufficient time to adjust to any \n     changes in the program;\n       (5) the $124,000,000,000 in new domestic spending programs \n     in the President's budget undermines Social Security by \n     diverting resources from budget surpluses to a bigger \n     government and more spending; and\n       (6) the Medicare Hospital Insurance program is projected to \n     become insolvent in 2010 and a study by the National Center \n     on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University \n     estimated that 14 percent of Medicare spending in 1995 was \n     for tobacco-related illnesses.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that--\n       (1) Congress should use unified budget surpluses to reform \n     Social Security for future generations; and\n       (2) Congress should reserve the Federal proceeds from any \n     tobacco settlement for saving Medicare until legislation is \n     enacted to make Medicare actuarially sound.\n\n     SEC. 305. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON ANNUAL STATEMENT OF ACCRUED \n                   LIABILITY OF SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the provisions of this \n     resolution assume that--\n       (1) the concurrent resolution on the budget should include \n     a statement of the current accrued liability of the Federal \n     Government for future payments under the Social Security and \n     Medicare programs; and\n       (2) the President's budget should include for fiscal years \n     beginning with 1999 a statement of the current accrued \n     liability of the Federal Government for future payments under \n     the Social Security and Medicare programs.\n\n     SEC. 306. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON FULL FUNDING FOR IDEA.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the budgetary levels in \n     this resolution assume that part B of the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Act (20 U.S.C. 1411 et seq.) should be fully \n     funded at the originally promised level before any funds are \n     appropriated for new education programs.\n\n     SEC. 307. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON SOCIAL SECURITY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Social Security program, created in 1935 to provide \n     old-age survivors, and disability insurance benefits, has \n     been one of the most successful government programs ever;\n       (2) in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, \n     Congress created section 13301 of the Congressional Budget \n     Act, which removed Social Security spending and revenues from \n     all Federal budget calculations;\n       (3) under current budget law, the Federal budget is still \n     in deficit; and\n       (4) in his State of the Union message on January 27, 1998, \n     President Clinton called on Congress to ``save Social \n     Security first'' and to ``reserve one hundred percent of the \n     surplus, that is any penny of the surplus, until we have \n     taken all the necessary measures to strengthen the Social \n     Security system for the twenty-first century''.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals \n     included in this resolution assume--\n       (1) Congress and the President should continue to rid our \n     country of debt and work to balance the budget without \n     counting Social Security trust fund surpluses; and\n       (2) Congress and the President should work in a bipartisan \n     way on specific legislation to reform the Social Security \n     system, to ensure that it is financially sound over the long \n     term and will be available for all future generations.\n\n     SEC. 308. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON SCHOOL-TO-WORK PROGRAMS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the budget totals and \n     levels in this resolution assume the President's policy with \n     respect to the School-to-Work program under the Education \n     Reform Account and any such savings as a result should be \n     applied to local initiatives focusing on early childhood \n     development.\n\n     SEC. 309. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING TAXPAYER RIGHTS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that of revenues designated \n     under section 201 for tax relief, a portion be set aside \n     for--\n       (1) improvement of taxpayer rights, including protections \n     for taxpayers in cases involving seizure of property by the \n     Internal Revenue Service; and\n       (2) reform of the penalty rules under the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986.\n\n     SEC. 310. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON NATIONAL GUARD FUNDING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The Army National Guard represents 34 percent of total \n     Army forces, including 55 percent of combat divisions and \n     brigades, 46 percent of combat support, and 25 percent of \n     combat service support.\n       (2) The Army National Guard receives just 9.5 percent of \n     Army funds.\n       (3) A recent military study estimates the average cost to \n     train and equip an active duty soldier is $73,000 per year, \n     while the average cost to train and equip a National Guard \n     soldier is just $17,000 per year.\n       (4) The Constitution of the United States provides for a \n     specific role for the National Guard in our national defense.\n       (5) The National Guard will play an increasing role in a \n     variety of ongoing worldwide operations by relieving active \n     units and reducing the operational and personnel burdens of \n     the Army's frequent and lengthy deployments.\n       (6) The home land defense is a mission of growing \n     importance for our military forces and the National Guard \n     forces will play an increasingly key role in that mission.\n       (7) Congress created the National Defense Panel to \n     recommend ways in which to transform United States defense \n     and national security policy for the 21st century and it \n     reached the following recommendations:\n       (A) Some portion of the Army National Guard's divisional \n     combat units (including combat support) should become part of \n     active divisions and brigades.\n       (B) The National Guard's enhanced brigades should report to \n     an active Army command.\n       (C) The Guard should develop selected early-deploying units \n     that would join the active component.\n       (D) Some additional reserve or Guard units may be needed to \n     reduce pressure on the active Army.\n       (E) The Guard should assume the entire U.S. Army South \n     (USARSO) mission, the Army component of the United States \n     Southern Command (Southcom) based in Panama.\n       (F) The National Guard should continue to provide general \n     purpose forces to give prompt military support to civil \n     authorities.\n       (G) The National Guard should provide forces organized and \n     equipped for training of civil agencies and the immediate \n     reinforcement of first-response efforts in domestic \n     emergencies.\n       (H) New homeland defense missions develop (e.g., National \n     Missile Defense and information warfare), the Guard should be \n     used in lieu of active forces wherever possible.\n       (8) The National Guard estimates it was underfunded by \n     $743,000,000 in fiscal year 1998 and by $634,000,000 in \n     fiscal year 1999.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals in the budget resolution assume \n     that the Department of Defense will give the highest priority \n     to moving toward fully funding the National Guard.\n\n     SEC. 311. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON MEDICARE PAYMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) one of the goals of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 was \n     to expand options for Medicare beneficiaries under the new \n     Medicare+Choice program; and\n       (2) the new Medicare payment formula in the Balanced Budget \n     Act of 1997 was intended to make these choices available to \n     all Americans, but because of the low update and specific \n     budget neutrality provisions of the Balanced Budget Act of \n     1997, the blending of rates to create greater equity for \n     rural and other lower payment areas was not implemented in \n     1998 or 1999.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals underlying this concurrent \n     resolution on the budget assume that funding the blending of \n     local and national payment rates pursuant to the Balanced \n     Budget Act of 1997 should be a priority for the Senate \n     Finance Committee this year within the budget as established \n     by this Committee.\n\n     SEC. 312. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON LONG-TERM CARE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) our Nation is not financially prepared to meet the \n     long-term care needs of its rapidly aging population and that \n     long-term care needs threaten the financial security of \n     American families; and\n       (2) many people are unaware that most long-term care costs \n     are not covered by Medicare and that Medicaid covers long-\n     term care only after the person's assets have been exhausted.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) this concurrent resolution on the budget assumes that \n     the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare \n     should, as part of its deliberations, describe long-term care \n     needs and make all appropriate recommendations including \n     private sector options that reflect the need for a continuum \n     of care that spans from acute to long-term care. This is not \n     a specific recommendation that any new program be added to \n     Medicare;\n       (2) the Federal Government should take all appropriate \n     steps to inform the public about the financial risks posed by \n     long-term care costs and about the need for families to plan \n     for their long-term care needs;\n       (3) the Federal Government should take all appropriate \n     steps to inform the public that Medicare does not cover most \n     long-term care costs and that Medicaid covers long-term care \n     costs only when the beneficiary has exhausted his or her \n     assets;\n       (4) the appropriate committees of the Senate, together with \n     the Department of Health and Human Services and other \n     appropriate Executive Branch agencies, should develop \n     specific ideas for encouraging Americans to plan for their \n     own long-term care needs; and\n       (5) the upcoming National Summit on Retirement Income \n     Savings should ensure that planning for long-term care is an \n     integral part of any discussion of retirement security.\n\n[[Page S3283]]\n\n     SEC. 313. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH AND \n                   OTHER FUNDING.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the assumptions \n     underlying the functional totals in this resolution assume \n     the following:\n       (1) To the extent that funding is made available through \n     grants or other Federal expenditures to reduce emissions of \n     carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases or to increase \n     sequestration of carbon to offset such emissions, such \n     funding shall be made available through competitive, merit-\n     based awards designed to select cost-effective methods for \n     reducing, sequestering, or mitigating such emissions. Such \n     awards shall consider all technologies, methods, and research \n     for reducing, sequestering, or mitigating emissions, \n     including sustainable agricultural practices and forest \n     management and conservation strategies. Funding criteria \n     shall be comprehensive in scope, not limited to specific \n     technologies or industries, awarded on a nondiscriminatory \n     basis, and target cost-effectiveness in reducing, \n     sequestering, or mitigating carbon dioxide and other \n     greenhouse gases through natural resource management programs \n     or products. In considering the cost-effectiveness of various \n     reduction, sequestration, or mitigation technologies, other \n     environmental benefits should be considered.\n       (2) To the extent any tax credits or other tax incentives \n     are created to stimulate the adoption of technologies or \n     practices that reduce, sequester, or mitigate emissions of \n     carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (``emissions tax \n     incentives''), such emission tax incentives shall also be \n     available to any person that employs an alternative \n     technology or practice that reduces, sequesters, or mitigates \n     emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases as \n     effectively as those technologies or practices for which a \n     tax credit or other incentive is provided. Only payments for \n     technologies or in support of practices not legally required \n     when payment is made shall qualify for tax incentives.\n\n     SEC. 314. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON INCREASED FUNDING FOR THE \n                   CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) 54 percent of women in the labor force have children \n     under 13 and are either single parents or have husbands who \n     earn less than $30,000 per year;\n       (2) in 1995, 62 percent of women with children younger than \n     age 6, and 77 percent of women with children ages 6-17 were \n     in the labor force, and 59 percent of women with children \n     younger than 3 were in the labor force;\n       (3) a 1997 General Accounting Office study found that the \n     increased work participation requirements of the welfare \n     reform law will cause the need for child care to exceed the \n     known supply;\n       (4) a 1995 study by the Urban Institute of child care \n     prices in 6 cities found that the average cost of care for a \n     2-year-old in a child care center ranged from $3,100 to \n     $8,100;\n       (5) for an entry-level worker, the family's child care \n     costs at the average price of care for an infant in a child \n     care center would be at least 50 percent of family income in \n     5 of the 6 cities examined;\n       (6) 40 percent of children under the age of 5 are taken \n     care of at home by 1 parent;\n       (7) a large number of low- and middle-income families \n     sacrifice a second full-time income so that a parent may be \n     at home with the child;\n       (8) the average income of 2-parent families with a single \n     income is $20,000 less than the average income of 2-parent \n     families with 2 incomes;\n       (9) the recent National Institute for Child Health and \n     Development study found that the greatest factor in the \n     development of a young child is ``what is happening at home \n     and in families''; and\n       (10) increased tax relief directed at making child care \n     more affordable, and increased funding for the Child Care and \n     Development Block Grant, would take significant steps toward \n     bringing quality child care within the reach of many parents, \n     and would increase the options available to parents in \n     deciding how best to care for their children.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the levels in this resolution and legislation enacted \n     pursuant to this resolution assume--\n       (1) that tax relief should be directed at parents who are \n     struggling to afford quality child care, including those who \n     wish to stay at home to care for a child, and should be \n     included in any tax cut package; and\n       (2) doubling funding for the Child Care and Development \n     Block Grant will significantly increase the States' ability \n     to deliver quality child care to low-income working families.\n\n     SEC. 315. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE FORMULA CHANGE FOR \n                   FEDERAL FAMILY EDUCATION LOAN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Postsecondary students receive critical access to a \n     higher education through student loans made available by \n     lenders in the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program.\n       (2) Guaranteed student loan borrowers currently pay an \n     interest rate on their FFEL loans equal to the 91-day \n     Treasury bill rate plus 2.5 percent while the borrower \n     attends school, and the 91-day Treasury bill rate plus 3.1 \n     percent during repayment. In addition, the maximum FFEL \n     student loan rate is capped at 8.25 percent.\n       (3) As a result of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of \n     1993, the new formula for FFEL student loans, effective July \n     1, 1998, will be equal to the 10-year Treasury bond rate plus \n     1 percent. In addition, the same 8.25 percent rate cap would \n     apply to these new loans.\n       (4) Lenders in the FFEL program have alerted Congress that \n     the scheduled formula change will make these loans \n     unprofitable. As a result, lenders may withdraw from the FFEL \n     program or significantly reduce their participation in the \n     program after July 1, 1998.\n       (5) A July 25, 1997 report by the Congressional Research \n     Service stated that the scheduled formula change ``can result \n     in a greater likelihood that the program will become \n     unprofitable at certain points in the business cycle,'' and \n     ``the result could be a shutdown of the guaranteed delivery \n     system.''.\n       (6) In a report by the Treasury Department on February 26, \n     1998, the Clinton Administration concluded that the new \n     formula will provide a rate of return on student loans that \n     is below the target rate of return of for-profit bank lenders \n     in the guaranteed student loan program. Furthermore, the \n     Administration concluded that there are inefficiencies \n     associated with the proposed formula, and joint benefits \n     could be realized to students and lenders from moving back to \n     a short-term index.\n       (7) At the time that the proposed formula change was \n     adopted in 1993, the rate of return to lenders would have \n     been higher under the proposed formula than under the \n     existing formula.\n       (8) The withdrawal of lenders from the FFEL program, who \n     now account for approximately 70 percent of all student \n     loans, would be devastating to students because, as the \n     Administration has acknowledged, the Federal direct loan \n     program would be unable to absorb the demand for student \n     loans that would arise from the absence of guaranteed \n     lenders.\n       (9) A variety of proposals have been put forward to resolve \n     this pending crisis in the FFEL program by modifying the \n     scheduled formula change.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the levels in this resolution and legislation enacted \n     pursuant to this resolution assume that the documented \n     problems that will rise from the scheduled formula change for \n     the Federal Family Education Loan program should be resolved \n     in a manner that ensures that students are not harmed by the \n     withdrawal of lenders from this program.\n\n     SEC. 316. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF \n                   HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS OF THE SELF-EMPLOYED.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) under current law, the self-employed do not enjoy \n     parity with their corporate competitors with respect to the \n     deductibility of their health insurance premiums;\n       (2) at present, the self-employed can deduct only 45 \n     percent of their health insurance premiums;\n       (3) scheduled changes in the deductible amount of health \n     insurance premiums will rise slowly, to only 60 percent by \n     2002;\n       (4) only by 2007 will the self-employed enjoy equitable \n     treatment with their corporate competitors with respect to \n     the deductibility of their health insurance premiums;\n       (5) the limited deductibility available to the self-\n     employed greatly reduces the affordability of their health \n     insurance;\n       (6) these disadvantages faced by the self-employed are \n     exacerbated by the fact that the self-employed generally pay \n     higher premium rates because they do not have access to group \n     insurance plans;\n       (7) these disadvantages are reflected in the higher rate of \n     lack of insurance among self-employed individuals that stands \n     at 23.6 percent compared with 17.4 percent for all other wage \n     and salaried workers, for self-employed living at or below \n     the poverty level the rate of uninsured is over 57 percent, \n     for self-employed living at 100-150 percent poverty the rate \n     of uninsured is 47 percent, and for self-employed living at \n     150-199 percent the rate of uninsured is 40 percent;\n       (8) for some self-employed, such as farmers who face \n     significant occupational safety hazards, this lack of health \n     insurance affordability has even greater ramifications; and\n       (9) this lack of full deductibility is adversely affecting \n     the growing number of women who own small businesses.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     resolution assume that legislation implementing this \n     concurrent resolution on the budget should include \n     accelerated movement toward parity between the self-employed \n     and corporations with respect to the tax treatment of health \n     insurance premiums, while maintaining deficit neutrality.\n\n     SEC. 317. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON OBJECTION TO KYOTO PROTOCOL \n                   IMPLEMENTATION PRIOR TO SENATE RATIFICATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The agreement reached by the Administration in Kyoto, \n     Japan, regarding legally binding commitments on greenhouse \n     gas reductions is inconsistent with the provisions of S. Res. \n     98, The Byrd-Hagel Resolution, that passed the United States \n     Senate unanimously.\n\n[[Page S3284]]\n\n       (2) The Administration has pledged to Congress that it \n     would not implement any portion of the Kyoto Protocol prior \n     to its ratification in the Senate.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     funds should not be provided to put in effect the Kyoto \n     Protocol prior to the Senate ratification in compliance with \n     the requirements of the Byrd-Hagel Resolution and consistent \n     with Administration assurances to Congress.\n\n     SEC. 318. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON PRICE INCREASE ON TOBACCO \n                   PRODUCTS OF $1.50 PER PACK.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) smoking rates among children and teenagers have reached \n     epidemic proportions;\n       (2) of the 3,000 children and teenagers who begin smoking \n     every day, 1,000 will eventually die of smoking-related \n     disease; and\n       (3) public health experts and economists agree that the \n     most effective and efficient way to achieve major reduction \n     in youth smoking rates is to raise the price of tobacco \n     products by at least $1.50 per pack.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that comprehensive tobacco legislation should increase the \n     price of each pack of cigarettes sold by at least $1.50 \n     through a per-pack fee or other mechanism that will guarantee \n     a price increase of $1.50 per pack within 3 years, not \n     including existing scheduled Federal, State, and local tax \n     increases, with equivalent price increases on other tobacco \n     products, and should index these price increases by an \n     appropriate measure of inflation.\n\n     SEC. 319. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Congress finds that--\n       (1) studies have found that quality child care, \n     particularly for infants and young children, requires a \n     sensitive, interactive, loving, and consistent caregiver;\n       (2) as most parents meet and exceed the criteria described \n     in paragraph (1), circumstances allowing, parental care is \n     the best form of child care;\n       (3) a recent National Institute for Child Health and \n     Development study found that the greatest factor in the \n     development of a young child is ``what is happening at home \n     and in families'';\n       (4) as a child's interaction with his or her parents has \n     the most significant impact on the development of the child, \n     any Federal child care policy should enable and encourage \n     parents to spend more time with their children;\n       (5) nearly \\1/2\\ of preschool children have at-home mothers \n     and only \\1/3\\ of preschool children have mothers who are \n     employed full time;\n       (6) a large number of low- and middle-income families \n     sacrifice a second full-time income so that a mother may be \n     at home with her child;\n       (7) the average income of 2-parent families with a single \n     income is $20,000 less than the average income of 2-parent \n     families with 2 incomes;\n       (8) only 30 percent of preschool children are in families \n     with paid child care and the remaining 70 percent of \n     preschool children are in families that do not pay for child \n     care, many of which are low- to middle-income families \n     struggling to provide child care at home;\n       (9) child care proposals should not provide financial \n     assistance solely to the 30 percent of families that pay for \n     child care and should not discriminate against families in \n     which children are cared for by an at-home parent; and\n       (10) any congressional proposal that increases child care \n     funding should provide financial relief to families that \n     sacrifice an entire income in order that a mother or father \n     may be at home for a young child.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the functional totals in this concurrent resolution on the \n     budget assume that--\n       (1) many families in the United States make enormous \n     sacrifices to forego a second income in order to have a \n     parent care for a child at home;\n       (2) there should be no bias against at-home parents;\n       (3) parents choose many different forms of child care to \n     meet the needs of their families, such as child care provided \n     by an at-home parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle, neighbor, \n     nanny, preschool, or child care center;\n       (4) any quality child care proposal should include, as a \n     key component, financial relief for those families where \n     there is an at-home parent; and\n       (5) mothers and fathers who have chosen and continue to \n     choose to be at home should be applauded for their efforts.\n\n     SEC. 320. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING IMMUNITY.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the levels in this \n     resolution assume that no immunity will be provided to any \n     tobacco product manufacturer with respect to any health-\n     related civil action commenced by a State or local \n     governmental entity or an individual or class of individuals \n     prior to or after the date of the adoption of this \n     resolution.\n\n     SEC. 321. SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING AGRICULTURAL TRADE \n                   PROGRAMS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the functional totals in \n     this concurrent resolution assume the Secretary of \n     Agriculture will use agricultural trade programs established \n     by law to promote, to the maximum extent practicable, the \n     export of United States agricultural commodities and \n     products.\n\n     SEC. 322. SENSE OF THE SENATE SUPPORTING LONG-TERM \n                   ENTITLEMENT REFORMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that the resolution assumes \n     the following--\n       (1) entitlement spending has risen dramatically over the \n     last thirty-five years;\n       (2) in 1963, mandatory spending (i.e. entitlement spending \n     and interest on the debt) made up 30 percent of the budget, \n     this figure rose to 45 percent by 1973, to 56 percent by 1983 \n     and to 61 percent by 1993;\n       (3) mandatory spending is expected to make up 68 percent of \n     the Federal budget in 1998;\n       (4) absent changes, that spending is expected to take up \n     over 70 percent of the Federal budget shortly after the year \n     2000 and 74 percent of the budget by the year 2008;\n       (5) if no action is taken, mandatory spending will consume \n     100 percent of the budget by the year 2030;\n       (6) this mandatory spending will continue to crowd out \n     spending for the traditional ``discretionary'' functions of \n     Government like clean air and water, a strong National \n     defense, parks and recreation, education, our transportation \n     system, law enforcement, research and development and other \n     infrastructure spending;\n       (7) taking significant steps sooner rather than later to \n     reform entitlement spending will not only boost economic \n     growth in this country, it will also prevent the need for \n     drastic tax and spending decisions in the next century.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this budget resolution assume that \n     Congress and the President should work to enact structural \n     reforms in entitlement spending in 1998 and beyond which \n     sufficiently restrain the growth of mandatory spending in \n     order to keep the budget in balance over the long term, \n     extend the solvency of the Social Security and Medicare Trust \n     Funds, avoid crowding out funding for basic Government \n     functions and that every effort should be made to hold \n     mandatory spending to no more than seventy percent of the \n     budget.\n\n     SEC. 323. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING FREEDOM OF HEALTH CARE \n                   CHOICE FOR MEDICARE SENIORS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Medicare beneficiaries should have the same right to \n     obtain health care from the physician or provider of their \n     choice as do Members of Congress and virtually all other \n     Americans.\n       (2) Most seniors are denied this right by current \n     restrictions on their health care choices.\n       (3) Affording seniors this option would create greater \n     health-care choices and result in fewer claims being paid out \n     of the near-bankrupt Medicare trust funds.\n       (4) Legislation to uphold this right of health care choice \n     for seniors must protect beneficiaries and Medicare from \n     fraud and abuse. Such legislation must include provisions \n     that--\n       (A) require that such contracts providing this right be in \n     writing, be signed by the Medicare beneficiary, and provide \n     that no claim be submitted to the Health Care Financing \n     Administration;\n       (B) preclude such contracts when the beneficiary is \n     experiencing a medical emergency;\n       (C) allow for the Medicare beneficiary to modify or \n     terminate the contract prospectively at any time and to \n     return to Medicare; and\n       (D) are subject to stringent fraud and abuse law, including \n     the Medicare anti-fraud provisions in the Health Insurance \n     Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     seniors have the right to see the physician or health care \n     provider of their choice, and not be limited in such right by \n     the imposition of unreasonable conditions on providers who \n     are willing to treat seniors on a private basis, and that the \n     assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     resolution assume that legislation will be enacted to ensure \n     this right.\n\n     SEC. 324. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING REPAIR AND \n                   CONSTRUCTION NEEDS OF INDIAN SCHOOLS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) many of our Nation's tribal schools are in a state of \n     serious disrepair. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) \n     operates 187 school facilities nationwide. Enrollment in \n     these schools, which presently numbers 47,214 students, has \n     been growing rapidly. A recent General Accounting Office \n     report indicates that the repair backlog in these schools \n     totals $754,000,000, and that the BIA schools are in \n     generally worse condition than all schools nationally;\n       (2) approximately 60 of these schools are in need of \n     complete replacement or serious renovation. Many of the \n     renovations include basic structural repair for the safety of \n     children, new heating components to keep students warm, and \n     roofing replacement to keep the snow and rain out of the \n     classroom. In addition to failing to provide adequate \n     learning environments for Indian children, these repair and \n     replacement needs pose a serious liability issue for the \n     Federal Government;\n       (3) sixty-three percent of the BIA schools are over 30 \n     years old, and 26 percent are over 50 years old. \n     Approximately 40 percent of all\n\n[[Page S3285]]\n\n     students in BIA schools are in portable classrooms. \n     Originally intended as temporary facilities while tribes \n     awaited new construction funds, these ``portables'' have a \n     maximum 10 year life-span. Because of the construction \n     backlog, children have been shuffling between classrooms in \n     the harsh climates of the Northern plains and Western States \n     for 10 to 15 years;\n       (4) annual appropriations for BIA education facilities \n     replacement and repair combined have averaged $20,000,000 to \n     $30,000,000 annually, meeting only 4 percent of total need. \n     At the present rate, one deteriorating BIA school can be \n     replaced each year, with estimates of completion of nine \n     schools in the next seven years. Since the new construction \n     and repair backlog is so great and growing, the current focus \n     at BIA construction must remain on emergency and safety needs \n     only, without prioritizing program needs such as increasing \n     enrollment or technology in the classroom; and\n       (5) unlike most schools, the BIA schools are a \n     responsibility of the Federal Government. Unfortunately, the \n     failure of the Federal Government to live up to this \n     responsibility has come at the expense of quality education \n     for some of this Nation's poorest children with the fewest \n     existing opportunities to better themselves.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     budget resolution assume that the repair and construction \n     backlog affecting Bureau of Indian Affairs school facilities \n     should be eliminated over a period of no more than 5 years \n     beginning with fiscal year 1999, and that the President \n     should submit to Congress a plan for the orderly elimination \n     of this backlog.\n\n     SEC. 325. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON SOCIAL SECURITY PERSONAL \n                   RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS AND THE BUDGET SURPLUS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Social Security program is the foundation of \n     retirement income for most Americans, and solving the \n     financial problems of the Social Security program is a vital \n     national priority and essential for the retirement security \n     of today's working Americans and their families.\n       (2) There is a growing bipartisan consensus that personal \n     retirement accounts should be an important feature of Social \n     Security reform.\n       (3) Personal retirement accounts can provide a substantial \n     retirement nest egg and real personal wealth. For an \n     individual 28 years old on the date of the adoption of this \n     resolution, earning an average wage, and retiring at age 65 \n     in 2035, just 1 percent of that individual's wages deposited \n     each year in a personal retirement account and invested in \n     securities consisting of the Standard & Poors 500 would grow \n     to $132,000, and be worth approximately 20 percent of the \n     benefits that would be provided to the individual under the \n     current provisions of the Social Security program.\n       (4) Personal retirement accounts would give the majority of \n     Americans who do not own any investment assets a new stake in \n     the economic growth of America.\n       (5) Personal retirement accounts would demonstrate the \n     value of savings and the magic of compound interest to all \n     Americans. Today, Americans save less than people in almost \n     every other country.\n       (6) Personal retirement accounts would help Americans to \n     better prepare for retirement generally. According to the \n     Congressional Research Service, 60 percent of Americans are \n     not actively participating in a retirement plan other than \n     Social Security, although Social Security was never intended \n     to be the sole source of retirement income.\n       (7) Personal retirement accounts would allow partial \n     prefunding of retirement benefits, thereby providing for \n     Social Security's future financial stability.\n       (8) The Federal budget will register a surplus of \n     $671,000,000,000 over the next 10 years, offering a unique \n     opportunity to begin a permanent solution to Social \n     Security's financing.\n       (9) Using the Federal budget surplus to fund personal \n     retirement accounts would be an important first step in \n     comprehensive Social Security reform and ensuring the \n     delivery of promised retirement benefits.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that this resolution assumes that the Committee on Finance \n     shall consider and report a legislative proposal this year \n     that would dedicate the Federal budget surplus to the \n     establishment of a program of personal retirement accounts \n     for working Americans and reduce the unfunded liabilities of \n     the Social Security program.\n\n     SEC. 326. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE ELIMINATION OF \n                   THE MARRIAGE PENALTY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that:\n       (1) Marriage is the foundation of the American society and \n     the key institution preserving our values.\n       (2) The tax code should not penalize those who choose to \n     marry.\n       (3) However, the Congressional Budget Office found that 42 \n     percent of married couples face a marriage penalty under the \n     current tax system.\n       (4) The Congressional Budget Office found that the average \n     penalty amounts to $1,380 a year.\n       (5) This penalty is one of the factors behind the decline \n     of marriage.\n       (6) In 1970, just 0.5 percent of the couples in the United \n     States were unmarried. By 1996, this percentage had risen to \n     7.2 percent.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions in this budget resolution assume that the \n     Congress shall begin to phase out the marriage penalty this \n     year.\n\n     SEC. 327. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING \n                   AFFORDABLE, HIGH-QUALITY HEALTH CARE FOR \n                   SENIORS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Seniors deserve affordable, high quality health care.\n       (2) The Medicare program under title XVIII of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) has made health care \n     affordable for millions of seniors.\n       (3) Beneficiaries under the Medicare program deserve to \n     know that such program will cover the benefits that they are \n     currently entitled to.\n       (4) Beneficiaries under the Medicare program can pay out-\n     of-pocket for health care services whenever they--\n       (A) do not want a claim for reimbursement for such services \n     submitted to such program; or\n       (B) want or need to obtain health care services that such \n     program does not cover.\n       (5) Beneficiaries under the Medicare program can use \n     doctors who do not receive any reimbursement under such \n     program.\n       (6) Close to 75 percent of seniors have annual incomes \n     below $25,000, including 4 percent who have annual incomes \n     below $5,000, making any additional out-of-pocket costs for \n     health care services extremely burdensome.\n       (7) Very few beneficiaries under the Medicare program \n     report having difficulty obtaining access to a physician who \n     accepts reimbursement under such program.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     resolution assume that seniors have the right to affordable, \n     high-quality health care, that they have the right to choose \n     their physicians, and that no change should be made to the \n     Medicare program that could--\n       (1) impose unreasonable and unpredictable out-of-pocket \n     costs for seniors or erode the benefits that the 38,000,000 \n     beneficiaries under the Medicare program are entitled to;\n       (2) compromise the efforts of the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services to screen inappropriate or fraudulent claims \n     for reimbursement under such program; and\n       (3) allow unscrupulous providers under such program to bill \n     twice for the same services.\n\n     SEC. 328. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING PERMANENT EXTENSION OF \n                   INCOME AVERAGING FOR FARMERS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the provisions of this \n     resolution assume that if the revenue levels are reduced \n     pursuant to section 201 of this resolution for tax \n     legislation, such amount as is necessary shall be used to \n     permanently extend income averaging for farmers for purposes \n     of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n\n     SEC. 329. SENSE OF THE SENATE TO MAINTAIN FULL FUNDING FOR \n                   THE SECTION 202 ELDERLY HOUSING PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The Section 202 Elderly Housing program is the most \n     important housing program for elderly, low-income Americans, \n     providing both affordable low-income housing and supportive \n     services designed to meet the special needs of the elderly.\n       (2) Since 1959, the Section 202 Elderly Housing program has \n     funded some 5,400 elderly housing projects with over 330,000 \n     housing units, with the current average tenant in Section 202 \n     housing being a frail, older woman in her seventies, living \n     alone with an income of less than $10,000 per year.\n       (3) The combination of affordable housing and supportive \n     services under the Section 202 Elderly Housing program is \n     critical to promoting independent living, self-sufficiency, \n     and dignity for the elderly while delaying more costly \n     institutional care.\n       (4) There are over 1.4 million elderly Americans currently \n     identified as having ``worst case housing needs'' and in need \n     of affordable housing.\n       (5) There are 33 million Americans aged 65 and over, some \n     13 percent of all Americans. The number of elderly Americans \n     is anticipated to grow to over 69 million by the year 2030, \n     which would be some 20 percent of all Americans, and continue \n     to increase to almost 80 million by 2050.\n       (6) The President's Budget Request for fiscal year 1999 \n     proposes reducing funding for the Section 202 Elderly Housing \n     program from the fiscal year 1998 level of $645,000,000 to \n     $109,000,000 in fiscal year 1999. This represents a reduction \n     of over 83 percent in funding, which will result in reducing \n     the construction of Section 202 housing units from some 6,000 \n     units in fiscal year 1998 to only 1,500 units in fiscal year \n     1999.\n       (7) The full funding of the Section 202 Elderly Housing \n     program as an independent Federal housing program is an \n     investment in our elderly citizens as well as our Nation.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that the Section \n     202 Elderly Housing program, as provided under section 202 of \n     the Housing Act of 1959, as amended, shall be funded in \n     fiscal years 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003 at not less \n     than the fiscal year 1998 funding level of $645,000,000.\n\n[[Page S3286]]\n\n     SEC. 330. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING OUTLAY ESTIMATES OF \n                   THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE BUDGET.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 created a new era for \n     Federal spending and forced the Department of Defense to plan \n     on limited spending over the five-year period from fiscal \n     year 1998 through 2002.\n       (2) The agreements forged under the Balanced Budget Act of \n     1997 specifically defined the available amounts of budget \n     authority and outlays, requiring the Department of Defense to \n     properly plan its future activities in the new, constrained \n     budget environment.\n       (3) The Department of Defense worked with the Office of \n     Management and Budget to develop a fiscal year 1999 budget \n     which complies with the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n       (4) Based on Department of Defense program plans and policy \n     changes, the Office of Management and Budget and the \n     Department of Defense made detailed estimates of fiscal year \n     1999 Department of Defense outlay rates to ensure that the \n     budget submitted would comply with the Balanced Budget Act of \n     1997.\n       (5) The Congressional Budget Office outlay estimate of the \n     fiscal year 1999 Department of Defense budget request exceeds \n     both the outlay limit imposed by the Balanced Budget Act of \n     1997 and the Office of Management and Budget's outlay \n     estimate, a disagreement which would force a total \n     restructuring of the Department of Defense's fiscal year 1999 \n     budget.\n       (6) The restructuring imposed on the Department of Defense \n     would have a devastating impact on readiness, troop morale, \n     military quality of life, and ongoing procurement and \n     development programs.\n       (7) The restructuring of the budget would be driven solely \n     by differing statistical estimates made by capable parties.\n       (8) In a letter currently under review, the Director of the \n     Office of Management and Budget will identify multiple \n     differences between the Office of Management and Budget's \n     estimated outlay rates and the Congressional Budget Office's \n     estimated outlay rates.\n       (9) New information on Department of Defense policy changes \n     and program execution plans now permit the Office of \n     Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office to \n     reevaluate their initial projections of fiscal year 1999 \n     outlay rates.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the totals underlying this concurrent resolution on the \n     budget assume that not later than April 22, 1998, the \n     Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the \n     Secretary of Defense, and the Director of the Congressional \n     Budget Office shall complete discussions and develop a common \n     estimate of the projected fiscal year 1999 outlay rates for \n     Department of Defense accounts.\n\n     SEC. 331. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING OUTLAY ESTIMATES FOR \n                   THE BUDGETS OF FEDERAL AGENCIES OTHER THAN THE \n                   DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Federal civilian workforce in non-Defense \n     Department agencies shrank by 125,000 employees, or 10 \n     percent, between 1992 and 1997.\n       (2) The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 assumed over \n     $60,000,000,000 in reductions in nondefense discretionary \n     spending over the period 1998-2002.\n       (3) These reductions were agreed to notwithstanding ever-\n     increasing responsibilities in agencies engaged in fighting \n     crime, combating the drug war, countering terrorist threats, \n     cleaning the environment, enforcing the law, improving \n     education, conducting health research, conducting energy \n     research and development, enhancing the Nation's physical \n     infrastructure, and providing veterans programs.\n       (4) All Federal agencies have worked closely with the \n     Office of Management and Budget to balance much-needed \n     programmatic needs with fiscal prudence and to submit budget \n     requests for fiscal year 1999 that comply with the Balanced \n     Budget Act of 1997.\n       (5) Reductions in the President's requests, as estimated by \n     the Office of Management and Budget, to comply with the \n     Congressional Budget Office's estimates could seriously \n     jeopardize priority domestic discretionary programs.\n       (6) There is no mechanism through which the Congressional \n     Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget \n     identify their differences in outlay rates for nondefense \n     agencies.\n       (7) Such consultation would lead to greater understanding \n     between the two agencies and potentially fewer and/or smaller \n     differences in the future.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the totals underlying this concurrent resolution on the \n     budget assume that not later than April 22, 1998, the \n     Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the \n     Director of the Congressional Budget Office, in consultation \n     with the Secretaries of the affected nondefense agencies, \n     shall complete discussions and develop a common estimate of \n     the projected fiscal year 1999 outlay rates for accounts in \n     nondefense agencies.\n\n     SEC. 332. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING AN EVALUATION OF THE \n                   OUTCOME OF WELFARE REFORM.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the budgetary levels in \n     this resolution assume that--\n       (1) the Secretary of Health and Human Services will, as \n     part of the annual report to Congress under section 411 of \n     the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 611), include data \n     regarding the rate of employment, job retention, and earnings \n     characteristics of former recipients of assistance under the \n     State programs funded under part A of title IV of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.) for each such State \n     program; and\n       (2) for purposes of the annual report for fiscal year 1997, \n     the information described in paragraph (1) will be \n     transmitted to Congress not later than September 1, 1998.\n\n     SEC. 333. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF \n                   A NATIONAL BACKGROUND CHECK SYSTEM FOR LONG-\n                   TERM CARE WORKERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The impending retirement of the baby boom generation \n     will greatly increase the demand and need for quality long-\n     term care and it is incumbent on Congress and the President \n     to ensure that Medicare and Medicaid patients are protected \n     from abuse, neglect, and mistreatment.\n       (2) Although the majority of long-term care facilities do \n     an excellent job in caring for elderly and disabled patients, \n     incidents of abuse and neglect and mistreatment do occur at \n     an unacceptable rate and are not limited to nursing homes \n     alone.\n       (3) Current Federal and State safeguards are inadequate \n     because there is little or no information sharing between \n     States about known abusers and no common State procedures for \n     tracking abusers from State to State and facility to \n     facility.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     concurrent resolution on the budget assume that a national \n     registry of abusive long-term care workers should be \n     established by building upon existing infrastructures at the \n     Federal and State levels that would enable long-term care \n     providers who participate in the Medicare and Medicaid \n     programs (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.; 1396 et seq.) to conduct \n     background checks on prospective employees.\n\n     SEC. 334. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON EXPANDING MEDICARE BENEFITS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) In the 1997 Balanced Budget Agreement, changes were \n     made to Medicare that extended the solvency of the Trust Fund \n     for 10 years.\n       (2) The Medicare Commission, also established in the \n     Balanced Budget Agreement, has just started the task of \n     examining the Medicare program in an effort to make sound \n     policy recommendations to Congress and the Administration \n     about what needs to be done to ensure that Medicare is \n     financially prepared to handle the added burden when the baby \n     boomers begin retiring.\n       (3) The problems facing Medicare are not about more \n     revenues. The program needs to do more to improve the health \n     care status of retirees and give them more choices and better \n     information to make wise consumer decisions when purchasing \n     health care services.\n       (4) Improving the health care status of senior citizens \n     would ensure additional savings for Medicare. Helping seniors \n     stay healthier should be a priority of any legislation aimed \n     at protecting Medicare.\n       (5) In order to keep seniors healthier, Medicare has to \n     become more prevention based. Currently, Medicare offers \n     prevention benefits, and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 made \n     a substantial investment in prevention benefits, providing \n     $8,500,000,000 over 10 years.\n       (6) Preventing illnesses or long hospital stays or repeated \n     hospital stays will save Medicare dollars.\n       (7) Medicare cannot be saved without structural changes and \n     reforms.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals underlying this resolution assume \n     that the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 directed the National \n     Bipartisan Commission on the future of Medicare to examine \n     Medicare's benefit structure, including prevention benefits, \n     and make recommendations to the Congress on such benefits in \n     the context of an overall plan to extend the solvency of the \n     program.\n\n     SEC. 335. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON BATTLEFIELD PRESERVATION.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the budget levels in \n     this resolution assume that--\n       (1) preserving Revolutionary War, War of 1812, and Civil \n     War battlefields is an integral part of preserving our \n     Nation's history;\n       (2) the Secretary of the Interior should give special \n     priority to the preservation of Revolutionary War and War of \n     1812 battlefields, by making funds available for the conduct \n     of the Revolutionary War and War of 1812 Historic \n     Preservation Study as authorized by section 603 of Public Law \n     104-333 (16 U.S.C. 1a-5 note); and\n       (3) the Secretary of the Interior should give special \n     priority to the preservation of Revolutionary War, War of \n     1812, and Civil War battlefields by allocating funds in the \n     Land and Water Conservation Fund for the purchase of \n     battlefield sites the integrity of which is threatened by \n     urban or suburban development.\n\n     SEC. 336. A RESOLUTION REGARDING THE SENATE'S SUPPORT FOR \n                   FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) our Federal, State and local law enforcement officers \n     provide essential services that preserve and protect our \n     freedom and\n\n[[Page S3287]]\n\n     safety, and with the support of Federal assistance, State and \n     local law enforcement officers have succeeded in reducing the \n     national scourge of violent crime, illustrated by a murder \n     rate in 1996 which is projected to be the lowest since 1971 \n     and a violent crime total in 1996 which is the lowest since \n     1990;\n       (2) through a comprehensive effort to attack violence \n     against women mounted by State and local law enforcement, and \n     dedicated volunteers and professionals who provide victim \n     services, shelter, counseling and advocacy to battered women \n     and their children, important strides have been made against \n     the national scourge of violence against women, illustrated \n     by the decline in the murder rate for wives, ex-wives and \n     girlfriends at the hands of their ``intimates'' fell to a 19-\n     year low in 1995;\n       (3) recent gains by Federal, State and local law \n     enforcement in the fight against violent crime and violence \n     against women are fragile, and continued financial commitment \n     from the Federal Government for funding and financial \n     assistance is required to sustain and build upon these gains; \n     and\n       (4) the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund as adopted by \n     the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 \n     funds the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of \n     1994, the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, and the \n     Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 without \n     adding to the Federal budget deficit.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions and the functional totals underlying this \n     resolution assume the Federal Government's commitment to fund \n     Federal law enforcement programs and programs to assist State \n     and local efforts to combat violent crime, including violence \n     against women, shall be maintained and funding for the \n     Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund shall continue to at least \n     fiscal year 2003.\n\n     SEC. 337. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON ANALYSIS OF CIVILIAN SCIENCE \n                   AND TECHNOLOGY PROGRAMS IN THE FEDERAL BUDGET.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of \n     Engineering, and Institute of Medicine have recommended, in \n     their 1995 report, entitled ``Allocating Federal Funds for \n     Science and Technology'', that the Federal science and \n     technology budget ``be presented as a comprehensive whole in \n     the President's budget and similarly considered as a whole at \n     the beginning of the congressional budget process before the \n     total Federal budget is disaggregated and sent to the \n     appropriations committees and subcommittees''.\n       (2) Civilian Federal agencies are supporting more than \n     $35,000,000,000 of research and development in fiscal year \n     1998, but it is difficult for the Congress and the public to \n     track or understand this support because it is dispersed \n     among 12 different budget functions.\n       (3) A meaningful examination of the overall Federal budget \n     for science and technology, consistent with the \n     recommendation of the National Academies, as well as an \n     examination of science and technology budgets in individual \n     civilian agencies, would be facilitated if the President's \n     budget request clearly displayed the amounts requested for \n     science and technology programs across all civilian agencies \n     and classified these amounts in Budget Function 250.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the congressional budget for the United States for \n     fiscal years 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004 should \n     consolidate the spending for all Federal civilian science and \n     technology programs in Budget Function 250, and that the \n     President should accordingly transmit to the Congress a \n     budget request for fiscal year 2000 that classifies these \n     programs, across all Federal civilian departments and \n     agencies, in Budget Function 250.\n\n     SEC. 338. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON CIVILIAN SCIENCE AND \n                   TECHNOLOGY PROGRAMS IN THE FEDERAL BUDGET.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the assumptions \n     underlying the function totals in this budget resolution \n     assume that expenditures for civilian science and technology \n     programs in the Federal budget will double over the period \n     from fiscal year 1998 to fiscal year 2008.\n\n     SEC. 339. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON LONG-TERM BUDGETING AND \n                   REPAYMENT OF THE PUBLIC DEBT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) today, there are 34,000,000 Americans over the age of \n     65, and by the year 2030, that number will grow to nearly \n     70,000,000;\n       (2) in 1963, mandatory spending represented 30 percent of \n     the Federal budget, while discretionary spending made up 70 \n     percent, and by 1998, those proportions have almost \n     completely reversed, in that mandatory spending now accounts \n     for 68 percent of the Federal budget, while discretionary \n     spending represents 32 percent;\n       (3) according to the 1997 Annual Report of the Board of \n     Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and \n     Disability Insurance (OASDI) Trust Fund--\n       (A) the difference between the income and benefits for the \n     OASDI program is a deficit of 2.23 percent of taxable \n     payroll;\n       (B) the assets in the Trust Fund are expected to be \n     depleted under present law in the year 2029;\n       (C) by the time the assets in the Trust Fund are depleted, \n     annual tax revenues will be sufficient to cover only three-\n     fourths of the annual expenditures;\n       (D) intermediate estimates are that OASDI will absorb \n     nearly 17.5 percent of national payroll by the year 2030; and\n       (E) the cost of the OASDI program is estimated to rise from \n     its current level of 4.7 percent of Gross Domestic Product to \n     6.7 percent by the end of the 75-year projection period;\n       (4) according to reports by the Congressional Budget \n     Office, the Economic and Budget Outlook: Fiscal Years 1999-\n     2008 (January 1998) and Reducing the Deficit: Spending and \n     Revenue Options (March 1997)--\n       (A) the Medicare Part A Trust Fund will be exhausted early \n     in fiscal year 2010;\n       (B) enrollment in Medicare will increase dramatically as \n     the baby boomers reach age 65;\n       (C) between the years 2010 and 2030, enrollment in Medicare \n     is projected to grow by 2.4 percent per year, up from the 1.4 \n     percent average annual growth projected through 2007;\n       (D) by the year 2030, Medicare enrollment will have \n     doubled, to 75,000,000 people; and\n       (E) the increase in Medicare enrollment caused by the aging \n     of the population will be accompanied by a tapering of the \n     growth rate of the working age population, and the number of \n     workers will drop from 3.8 for every Medicare beneficiary in \n     1997 to 2.02 per beneficiary by 2030;\n       (5) the demographic shift that is currently taking place, \n     and will continue for the next 30 years, will put a \n     tremendous burden on workers as the cost of programs such as \n     Social Security and Medicare are borne by proportionately \n     fewer workers;\n       (6) the current Budget Resolution, which projects revenues \n     and spending only for the next 10 years, does not give \n     Congress a clear picture of the budget problems that confront \n     the United States shortly after the turn of the century;\n       (7) currently, 14 percent of the Federal budget is spent on \n     interest payments on the national debt; and\n       (8) if projected surpluses are used entirely for debt \n     reduction and current tax and spending policies remain \n     unchanged, the share of Federal income needed to pay interest \n     would drop below 5 percent within 12 years, and in 1997, that \n     10 percentage-point reduction would have amounted to \n     $158,000,000,000 available for other priorities.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals in this concurrent resolution \n     assume that future budget resolutions and future budgets \n     submitted by the President should include--\n       (1) an analysis for the period of 30 fiscal years beginning \n     with such fiscal year, of the estimated levels of total \n     budget outlays and total new budget authority, the estimated \n     revenues to be received, the estimated surplus or deficit, if \n     any, for each major Federal entitlement program for each \n     fiscal year in such period; and\n       (2) a specific accounting of payments, if any, made to \n     reduce the public debt, or unfunded liabilities associated \n     with each major Federal entitlement program.\n\n     SEC. 340. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING PRESIDENT'S BUDGET.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the budgetary levels in \n     this resolution assume that the President should submit, as \n     part of the budget request of the President that is submitted \n     to Congress, a study of the impact of the provisions of the \n     budget on each generation of Americans and its long-term \n     effects on each generation.\n\n     SEC. 341. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE VALUE OF THE \n                   SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM FOR FUTURE RETIREES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Social Security system has allowed a generation of \n     Americans to retire with dignity. Today, 13 percent of the \n     population is 65 or older and by 2030, 20 percent of the \n     population will be 65 or older. More than \\1/2\\ of the \n     elderly do not receive private pensions and more than \\1/3\\ \n     have no income from assets.\n       (2) For 60 percent of all senior citizens, Social Security \n     benefits provide almost 80 percent of their retirement \n     income. For 80 percent of all senior citizens, Social \n     Security benefits provide over 50 percent of their retirement \n     income.\n       (3) Poverty rates among the elderly are at the lowest level \n     since the United States began to keep poverty statistics, due \n     in large part to the Social Security system.\n       (4) 78 percent of Americans pay more in payroll taxes than \n     they do in income taxes.\n       (5) According to the 1997 report of the Managing Trustee \n     for the Social Security trust funds, the accumulated balance \n     in the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund is \n     estimated to fall to zero by 2029, and the estimated payroll \n     tax at that time will be sufficient to cover only 75 percent \n     of the benefits owed to retirees at that time.\n       (6) The average American retiring in the year 2015 will pay \n     $250,000 in payroll taxes over the course of a working \n     career.\n       (7) Future generations of Americans must be guaranteed the \n     same value from the Social Security system as past covered \n     recipients.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the budgetary levels in this resolution assume that no \n     change in the Social Security system should be made that \n     would reduce the value of the Social Security system for \n     future generations of retirees.\n\n[[Page S3288]]\n\n     SEC. 342. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE LAND AND WATER \n                   CONSERVATION FUND.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the budget levels in \n     this resolution assume that programs funded from the Land and \n     Water Conservation Fund should be funded in the full amount \n     authorized by law.\n\n     SEC. 343. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON EDUCATION GOALS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the functional totals \n     underlying this resolution assume that the Federal Government \n     should work hand-in-hand with States, school districts, and \n     local leaders--\n       (1) to accomplish the following goals by the year 2005:\n       (A) establish achievement levels and assessments in every \n     grade for the core academic curriculum; measure each regular \n     student's performance; and prohibit the practice of social \n     promotion of students (promoting students routinely from one \n     grade to the next without regard to their academic \n     achievement);\n       (B) provide remedial programs for students whose \n     achievement levels indicate they should not be promoted to \n     the next grade;\n       (C) create smaller schools to enable students to have \n     closer interaction with teachers;\n       (D) require at least 180 days per year of instruction in \n     core curriculum subjects;\n       (E) recruit new teachers who are adequately trained and \n     credentialed in the subject or subjects they teach and \n     encourage excellent, experienced teachers to remain in the \n     classroom by providing adequate salaries; require all \n     teachers to be credentialed and limit emergency or temporary \n     teaching credentials to a limited period of time; hold \n     teachers and principals accountable to high educational \n     standards; and\n       (F) require all regular students to pass an examination in \n     basic core curriculum subjects in order to receive a high \n     school diploma; and\n       (2) to reaffirm the importance of public schooling and \n     commit to guaranteeing excellence and accountability in the \n     public schools of this Nation.\n\n     SEC. 344. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) while it is important to study the effects of class \n     size on learning and study the need to hire more teachers, \n     each type of study must be carried out in conjunction with an \n     effort to ensure that there will be quality teachers in every \n     classroom;\n       (2) all children deserve well-educated teachers;\n       (3) there is a teacher quality crisis in the United States;\n       (4) individuals entering a classroom as teachers should \n     have a sound grasp on the subject the individuals intend to \n     teach, and the individuals should know how to teach;\n       (5) less than 40 percent of the individuals teaching core \n     subjects (consisting of English, mathematics, science, social \n     studies, and foreign languages) majored or minored in the \n     core subjects;\n       (6) the quality of teachers impacts student achievement;\n       (7) the measure of a good teacher is how much and how well \n     the teacher's students learn;\n       (8) teachers should have the opportunity to learn new \n     technology and teaching methods through the establishment of \n     teacher training facilities so that teachers can share their \n     new knowledge and experiences with children in the classroom;\n       (9) school officials should have the flexibility the \n     officials need to have teachers in their schools adequately \n     trained to meet strenuous teacher standards;\n       (10) knowledgeable and eager individuals of sound character \n     and various professional backgrounds should be encouraged to \n     enter kindergarten through grade 12 classrooms as teachers; \n     and\n       (11) States should have maximum flexibility and incentives \n     to create alternative teacher certification and licensure \n     programs in order to recruit well-educated people into the \n     teaching profession.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals in this concurrent resolution on \n     the budget assume--\n       (1) the enactment of legislation to provide assistance for \n     programs that--\n       (A) focus on teacher training delivered through local \n     partnerships, with private and public partners, to ensure \n     that current and future teachers possess necessary teaching \n     skills and knowledge of subject areas; and\n       (B) focus on alternative certification to recruit \n     knowledgeable and eager individuals of sound character to \n     enter kindergarten through grade 12 classrooms as teachers;\n       (2) that the quality of teachers can be strengthened by \n     improving the academic knowledge of teachers in the subject \n     areas in which the teachers teach;\n       (3) that institutions of higher education should be held \n     accountable to prepare teachers who are highly competent in \n     the subject areas in which the teachers teach, including \n     preparing teachers by providing training in the effective \n     uses of technologies in classrooms; and\n       (4) that there should be recruitment into teaching of high \n     quality individuals, including individuals from other \n     occupations.\n\n     SEC. 345. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON INS CIRCUIT RIDERS IN THE \n                   FORMER SOVIET UNION.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the provisions of this \n     resolution assume that included in the funding for the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) is $2,000,000 \n     for the establishment of INS circuit riders in the former \n     Soviet Union for the purpose of processing refugees and \n     conducting medical examinations of refugees who will enter \n     the United States under the Refugee Act of 1980.\n\n     SEC. 346. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING FUNDING FOR THE \n                   AIRPORT IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the congressional budget \n     for the United States Government as provided for in this \n     resolution should assure that--\n       (1) the contract authority level for the Airport \n     Improvement Program (provided for in part B of subtitle VII \n     of title 49, United States Code) not be reduced below the \n     current level of $2,347,000,000; and\n       (2) the critical infrastructure development, maintenance, \n     and repair of airports not be jeopardized.\n\n     SEC. 347. SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE ONE HUNDRED FIFTH \n                   CONGRESS, SECOND SESSION SHOULD REAUTHORIZE \n                   FUNDS FOR THE FARMLAND PROTECTION PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings--\n       (1) eighteen States and dozens of localities have spent \n     nearly $1,000,000,000 to protect over 600,000 acres of \n     important farmland;\n       (2) the Farmland Protection Program has provided cost-\n     sharing for 18 States and dozens of localities to protect \n     over 82,000 acres on 230 farms since 1996;\n       (3) the Farmland Protection Program has generated new \n     interest in saving farmland in communities around the \n     country;\n       (4) the Farmland Protection Program represents an \n     innovative and voluntary partnership, rewards local \n     ingenuity, and supports local priorities;\n       (5) current funds authorized for the Farmland Protection \n     Program will be exhausted in the next six months;\n       (6) the United States is losing two acres of our best \n     farmland to development every minute of every day;\n       (7) these lands produce three quarters of the fruits and \n     vegetables and over one half of the dairy in the United \n     States.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals contained in this resolution \n     assume that the One Hundred Fifth Congress, Second Session \n     will reauthorize funds for the Farmland Protection Program.\n\n     SEC. 348. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON HEALTH CARE QUALITY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings--\n       (1) out of a total 549 plans under the Federal Employees \n     Health Benefits Program, which includes fee-for-service, \n     point of service, and Health Maintenance Organizations, only \n     186 were fully accredited;\n       (2) out of a total 549 plans under the Federal Employees \n     Health Benefits Program, which includes fee-for-service, \n     point of service, and Health Maintenance Organizations, 7 \n     were denied accreditation.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying this resolution provide for \n     the enactment of legislation requiring all health plans \n     participating in the Federal Employees Health Benefits \n     Program to be accredited by a nationally recognized \n     accreditation organization representative of a spectrum of \n     health care interests including purchasers, consumers, \n     providers and health plans.\n\n     SEC. 349. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING WASTEFUL SPENDING IN \n                   DEFENSE DEPARTMENT ACQUISITION PRACTICES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) according to the Defense Department's Inspector \n     General, despite efforts to streamline Government purchases, \n     the military, in some cases, paid more than ``fair value'' \n     for many items;\n       (2) efficient purchasing policies, in the context of \n     decreasing defense budgets, are more important than ever to \n     ensure Defense Department spending contributes to military \n     readiness.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that the \n     Defense Department should continue efforts to eliminate \n     wasteful spending such that defense spending allocated in the \n     fiscal year 1999 budget, and all subsequent budgets, is spent \n     in the manner most efficient to maintain and promote military \n     readiness for United States Armed Forces around the globe.\n\n     SEC. 350. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE UNITED STATES \n                   RESPONSE TO THE CHANGING NATURE OF TERRORISM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the threat of terrorism to American citizens and \n     interests remains high, with Americans suffering one-third of \n     the total terrorist attacks in the world in 1997;\n       (2) the terrorist threat is changing--while past acts were \n     generally limited to the use of conventional explosives and \n     weapons, terrorists today are exploiting technological \n     advances and increasingly lethal tools and strategies to \n     pursue their agenda;\n       (3) on a worldwide basis, terrorists are focusing on \n     afflicting mass casualties on civilian targets through the \n     acquisition of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons of \n     mass destruction;\n       (4) chemical and biological weapons in the hands of \n     terrorists or rogue nations constitute a threat to the United \n     States;\n       (5) the multifaceted nature of the terrorist threat \n     encompasses not only foreign terrorists targeting American \n     citizens and interests abroad, but foreign terrorists \n     operating\n\n[[Page S3289]]\n\n     within the United States itself, as well as domestic \n     terrorists;\n       (6) terrorists groups are becoming increasingly \n     multinational, more associated with criminal activity, and \n     less responsive to external influences;\n       (7) terrorists exploit America's free and open society to \n     illegally enter the country, raise funds, recruit new \n     members, spread propaganda, and plan future activities;\n       (8) terrorists are also making use of computer technology \n     to communicate, solicit money and support, and store \n     information essential to their operations;\n       (9) State sponsors of terrorism and other foreign countries \n     are known to be developing computer intrusion and \n     manipulation capabilities which could pose a threat to \n     essential public and private information systems in the \n     United States;\n       (10) the infrastructures deemed critical to the United \n     States are the telecommunications networks, the electric \n     power grid, oil and gas distribution, water distribution \n     facilities, transportation systems, financial networks, \n     emergency services, and the continuity of Government \n     services, the disruption of which could result in significant \n     losses to the United States economic well-being, public \n     welfare, or national security;\n       (11) a national strategy of infrastructure protection, as \n     required by the Defense Appropriations Act of 1996, and \n     subsequent amendments, has yet to be issued; and\n       (12) we as a Nation remain fundamentally unprepared to \n     respond in a coordinated and effective manner to these \n     growing terrorist threats.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that--\n       (1) the Federal Government must take the lead in \n     establishing effective coordination between intelligence-\n     gathering and law enforcement agencies, among Federal, State, \n     and local levels of Government, and with the private sector, \n     for the purpose of assessing, warning, and protecting against \n     terrorist attacks;\n       (2) technical preparedness for the detection and analysis \n     of chemical and biological weapons, and for swift and \n     adequate emergency response to their use by terrorists, must \n     be a near-term continuing priority;\n       (3) the United States must seek full international \n     cooperation in securing the capture and conviction of \n     terrorists who attack or pose a threat to American citizens \n     and interests;\n       (4) the United States should fully enforce its laws \n     intended to deny foreign terrorist organizations the ability \n     to raise money in the United States, prevent the evasion of \n     our immigration laws and furthering of criminal activities, \n     and curtail the use of our country as a base of operations; \n     and\n       (5) a national strategy, adequate to addressing the \n     complexity of protecting our critical infrastructures, and as \n     required by the Defense Appropriations Act of 1996 and \n     subsequent amendments, must be completed and implemented \n     immediately.\n\n     SEC. 351. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON ECONOMIC GROWTH, SOCIAL \n                   SECURITY, AND GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the functional totals \n     underlying this resolution assume that--\n       (1) the elimination of a discretionary spending program may \n     be used for either tax cuts or to reform the Social Security \n     system;\n       (2) the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Balanced \n     Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, and other \n     appropriate budget rules and laws should be amended to \n     implement the policy stated in paragraph (1).\n\n     SEC. 352. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING A SUPERMAJORITY \n                   REQUIREMENT FOR RAISING TAXES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Nation's current tax system is indefensible, being \n     overly complex, burdensome, and severely limiting to economic \n     opportunity for all Americans;\n       (2) fundamental tax reform should be undertaken as soon as \n     practicable to produce a tax system that--\n       (A) applies a low tax rate, through easily understood laws, \n     to all Americans;\n       (B) provides tax relief for working Americans;\n       (C) protects the rights of taxpayers and reduces tax \n     collection abuses;\n       (D) eliminates the bias against savings and investment;\n       (E) promotes economic growth and job creation;\n       (F) does not penalize marriage or families; and\n       (G) provides for a taxpayer-friendly collections process to \n     replace the Internal Revenue Service; and\n       (3) the stability and longevity of any new tax system \n     designed to achieve these goals should be guaranteed with a \n     supermajority vote requirement so that Congress cannot easily \n     raise tax rates, impose new taxes, or otherwise increase the \n     amount of a taxpayer's income that is subject to tax.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of Senate that the \n     assumptions underlying the functional totals of this \n     resolution assume fundamental tax reform that is accompanied \n     by a proposal to amend the Constitution of the United States \n     to require a supermajority vote in each House of Congress to \n     approve tax increases.\n\n     SEC. 353. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON HEALTH CARE QUALITY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Rapid changes in the health care marketplace have \n     compromised confidence in the our Nation's health system.\n       (2) American consumers want more convenience, fewer \n     hassles, more choices, and better service from their health \n     insurance plans.\n       (3) All Americans deserve quality-driven health care \n     supported by sound science and evidence-based medicine.\n       (4) The Federal Government, through the National Institutes \n     of Health, supports research that improves the quality of \n     medical care that Americans receive.\n       (5) This resolution assumes increased funding for the \n     National Institutes of Health for 1999 of $15,100,000,000, an \n     11-percent increase over current funding levels, which are 7 \n     percent higher than in 1997.\n       (6) As the largest purchaser of health care services, the \n     Federal Government has a responsibility to utilize its \n     purchasing power to demand high quality health plans and \n     providers for its health programs and to protect its \n     beneficiaries from inferior medical care.\n       (7) The Federal Government must adopt the posture of \n     private sector purchasers and insist on high quality care for \n     the 67,000,000 Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries and the \n     9,000,000 Federal employees, retirees, and their dependents.\n       (8) The private sector has proven to be more capable of \n     keeping pace with the rapid changes in health care delivery \n     and medical practice that affect quality of care \n     considerations than the Federal Government.\n       (9) As Congress considers health care legislation, it must \n     first commit to ``do no harm'' to health care quality, \n     consumers, and the evolving market place. Rushing to \n     legislate or regulate based on anecdotal information and \n     micro-managing health plans on politically popular issues \n     will not solve the problems of consumer confidence and the \n     quality of our health care system.\n       (10) When health insurance premiums rise, Americans lose \n     health coverage. Studies indicate that a 1 percent increase \n     in private health insurance premiums will be associated with \n     an increase in the number of persons without insurance of \n     about 400,000 persons.\n       (11) Health care costs have begun to rise significantly in \n     the past year. The Congressional Budget Office (referred to \n     as ``CBO'') projects that the growth in health premiums will \n     be 5.5 percent in 1998 up from 3.8 percent in 1997. CBO \n     continues to project that premiums will grow about 1 \n     percentage point faster than the Gross Domestic Product in \n     the longer run. CBO also warns that new Federal mandates on \n     health insurance could exacerbate this increase in premiums.\n       (12) The President's Advisory Commission on Consumer \n     Protection and Quality in the Health Care Industry developed \n     the Consumer Bill of Rights and Responsibilities. This \n     includes information disclosure, confidentiality of health \n     information, and choice of providers.\n       (13) The President's Commission further determined that \n     private sector organizations have the capacity to act in a \n     timely manner needed to keep pace with the swiftly evolving \n     health system.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying this resolution assume that \n     the Senate will not pass any health care legislation that \n     will--\n       (1) make health insurance unaffordable for working families \n     and increase the number of uninsured Americans;\n       (2) divert limited health care resources away from serving \n     patients to paying lawyers and hiring new bureaucrats; or\n       (3) impose political considerations on clinical decisions, \n     instead of allowing such decisions to be made on the basis of \n     sound science and the best interests of patients.\n\n     SEC. 354. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE USE OF BUDGET SURPLUS \n                   FOR TAX RELIEF OR DEBT REDUCTION.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that this resolution assumes \n     that any budget surplus should be dedicated to debt reduction \n     or direct tax relief for hard-working American families.\n\n     SEC. 355. USE OF BUDGET SURPLUS TO REFORM SOCIAL SECURITY.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the assumptions \n     underlying the functional totals included in the resolution \n     assume:\n       (1) The Congress and the President should use any budget \n     surplus to reduce the Social Security payroll tax and to \n     establish personal retirement accounts with the tax reduction \n     for hard-working Americans.\n       (2) The Congress and the President should not use the \n     Social Security surplus to finance general Government \n     programs and other spending, should begin to build real \n     assets for the trust funds, and work to reform the Social \n     Security system.\n\n     SEC. 356. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON COLOMBIAN DRUG WAR \n                   HELICOPTERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Colombia is the leading illicit drug producing country \n     in the Western Hemisphere;\n       (2) 80 percent of the world's cocaine originates in \n     Colombia;\n       (3) based on the most recent data of the Drug Enforcement \n     Administration (DEA), more than 60 percent of the heroin \n     seized in the United States originates in Colombia;\n       (4) in the last 10 years more than 4,000 officers of the \n     Colombian National Police have died fighting the scourge of \n     drugs;\n       (5) in one recent year alone, according to data of the \n     United States Government, the\n\n[[Page S3290]]\n\n     United States had 141,000 new heroin users and the United \n     States faces historic levels of heroin use among teenagers \n     between the ages of 12 and 17;\n       (6) once Colombian heroin is in the stream of commerce it \n     is nearly impossible to interdict because it is concealed and \n     trafficked in very small quantities;\n       (7) the best and most cost efficient method of preventing \n     Colombian heroin from entering the United States is to \n     destroy the opium poppies in the high Andes mountains where \n     Colombian heroin is produced;\n       (8) the elite anti-narcotics unit of the Colombian National \n     Police has the responsibility to eradicate both coca and \n     opium in Colombia, including the reduction and elimination of \n     cocaine and heroin production, and they have done a \n     remarkably effective job with the limited and outdated \n     equipment at their disposal;\n       (9) more than 40 percent of the anti-narcotics operations \n     of the Colombian National Police involve hostile ground fire \n     from narco-terrorists and 90 percent of such operations \n     involve the use of helicopters;\n       (10) the need for better high performance helicopters by \n     the Colombian National Police, especially for use in the high \n     Andes mountains, is essential for more effective eradication \n     of opium in Colombia;\n       (11) on December 23, 1997, one of the antiquated Vietnam-\n     era UH-1H Huey helicopters used by the Colombian National \n     Police in an opium eradication mission crashed in the high \n     Andes mountains due to high winds and because it was flying \n     above the safety level recommended by the original \n     manufacturer;\n       (12) in the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and \n     Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1998 (Public Law 105-\n     118), amounts were appropriated for the procurement by the \n     United States for the Colombian National Police of three UH-\n     60L Blackhawk utility helicopters that can operate safely and \n     more effectively at the high altitudes of the Andes mountains \n     where Colombian opium grows at altitudes as high as 12,000 \n     feet;\n       (13) the Blackhawk helicopter is a high performance utility \n     helicopter, with greater lift capacity, that can perform at \n     the high altitudes of the Andes mountains, as well as survive \n     crashes and sustain ground fire, much better than any other \n     utility helicopter now available to the Colombian National \n     Police in the war on drugs;\n       (14) because the Vietnam-era Huey helicopters that the \n     United States has provided the Colombian National Police are \n     outdated and have been developing numerous stress cracks, a \n     sufficient number should be upgraded to Huey II's and the \n     remainder should be phased-out as soon as possible;\n       (15) these Huey helicopters are much older than most of the \n     pilots who fly them, do not have the range due to limited \n     fuel capacity to reach many of the expanding locations of the \n     coca fields or cocaine labs in southern Colombia, nor do they \n     have the lift capacity to carry enough armed officers to \n     reach and secure the opium fields in the high Andes mountains \n     prior to eradication;\n       (16) the elite anti-narcotics unit of the Colombian \n     National Police has a stellar record in respecting for human \n     rights and has received the commendation of a leading \n     international human rights group in their operations to \n     reduce and eradicate illicit drugs in Colombia;\n       (17) the narco-terrorists of Colombia have announced that \n     they will now target United States citizens, particularly \n     those United States citizens working with their Colombian \n     counterparts in the fight against illicit drugs in Colombia;\n       (18) a leading commander of the Revolutionary Armed Forces \n     of Colombia (``FARC'') announced recently that the objective \n     of these narco-terrorists, in light of recent successes, will \n     be ``to defeat the Americans'';\n       (19) United States Government personnel in Colombia who fly \n     in these helicopters accompanying the Colombian National \n     Police on missions are now at even greater risk from these \n     narco-terrorists and their drug trafficking allies;\n       (20) in the last six months four anti-narcotics helicopters \n     of the Colombian National Police have been downed in \n     operations;\n       (21) Congress intends to provide the necessary support and \n     assistance to wage an effective war on illicit drugs in \n     Colombia and provide the equipment and assistance needed to \n     protect all of the men and women of the Colombian National \n     Police as well as those Americans who work side by side with \n     the Colombian National Police in this common struggle against \n     illicit drugs;\n       (22) the new Government of Bolivia has made a commitment to \n     eradicate coca and cocaine production in that country within \n     5 years;\n       (23) the United States should support any country that is \n     interested in removing the scourge of drugs from its \n     citizens; and\n       (24) Bolivia has succeeded, in large measure due to United \n     States assistance, in reducing acreage used to produce coca, \n     which is the basis for cocaine production.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals underlying this resolution assume \n     that--\n       (1) the President should, with funds made available under \n     Public Law 105-118, expeditiously procure and provide to the \n     Colombian National Police three UH-60L Blackhawk utility \n     helicopters solely for the purpose of assisting the Colombian \n     National Police to perform their responsibilities to reduce \n     and eliminate the production of illicit drugs in Colombia and \n     the trafficking of such illicit drugs, including the \n     trafficking of drugs such as heroin and cocaine to the United \n     States;\n       (2) if the President determines that the procurement and \n     transfer to the Colombian National Police of three UH-60L \n     Blackhawk utility helicopters is not an adequate number of \n     such helicopters to maintain operational feasibility and \n     effectiveness of the Colombian National Police, then the \n     President should promptly inform Congress as to the \n     appropriate number of additional UH-60L Blackhawk utility \n     helicopters for the Colombian National Police so that amounts \n     can be authorized for the procurement and transfer of such \n     additional helicopters; and\n       (3) assistance for Bolivia should be maintained at least at \n     the level assumed in the fiscal year 1998 budget submission \n     of the President and the Administration should act \n     accordingly.\n\n     SEC. 357. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON FUNDING FOR MEDICAL CARE FOR \n                   VETERANS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the functional totals \n     underlying this resolution assume that $40,274,000 in \n     additional amounts above the President's budget levels will \n     be made available for veterans health care for fiscal year \n     1999.\n\n     SEC. 358. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON OBJECTION TO THE USE OF THE \n                   SALE OF PUBLIC LANDS TO FUND CERTAIN PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that the Budget Committee \n     Report accompanying this resolution assumes that the \n     landowner incentive program of the Endangered Species \n     Recovery Act would be funded ``from the gross receipts \n     realized in the sales of excess BLM land: Provided, That BLM \n     has sufficient administrative funds to conduct such sales''.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals underlying this resolution assume \n     that--\n       (1) the landowner incentive program included in the \n     Endangered Species Recovery Act should be financed from a \n     dedicated source of funding; and\n       (2) public lands should not be sold to fund the landowner \n     incentive program of the Endangered Species Recovery Act \n     through their proceeds alone, if subsequent legislation \n     provides an alternative or mixed, dedicated source of \n     mandatory funding.\n\n     SEC. 359. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING A MULTINATIONAL \n                   ALLIANCE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the traffic in illegal drugs greatly threatens \n     democracy, security and stability in the Western Hemisphere \n     due to the violence and corruption associated with drug \n     trafficking organizations;\n       (2) drug trafficking organizations operate without respect \n     for borders or national sovereignty;\n       (3) the production, transport, sale, and use of illicit \n     drugs endangers the people and legitimate institutions of all \n     countries in the hemisphere;\n       (4) no single country can successfully confront and defeat \n     this common enemy;\n       (5) full bilateral cooperation with the United States to \n     reduce the flow of drugs is in the national interests of our \n     neighbors in the hemisphere;\n       (6) in addition, victory in the hemispheric battle against \n     drug traffickers requires expanded multilateral cooperation \n     among the nations of the region.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that in \n     addition to existing bilateral cooperative efforts, the \n     Administration should promote at the Summit of the Americas \n     and in other fora the concept of a multinational hemispheric \n     ``war alliance'' bringing together the United States and key \n     illicit drug producing and transiting countries in the \n     Western Hemisphere for the purpose of implementing a \n     coordinated plan of action against illegal drug trafficking \n     and promoting full cooperation against this common menace.\n\n     SEC. 360. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING LEGISLATION THAT \n                   INCREASES COMPLEXITY OF TAX RETURNS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) As part of the consideration by the Senate of tax cuts \n     for the families of America, the Senate should also examine \n     the condition of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n       (2) According to the Congressional Research Service, the \n     Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1997 added 1,000,000 words and \n     315 pages to the Internal Revenue Code.\n       (3) The Internal Revenue Code continues to grow more \n     complex and difficult for the average taxpayer to understand, \n     and the average tax return has become more time-consuming to \n     prepare.\n       (4) The average taxpayer will spend 9 hours and 54 minutes \n     preparing Form 1040 for the 1997 tax year.\n       (5) The average taxpayer spends between 21 and 28 hours \n     each year on tax matters.\n       (6) In 1995, 58,965,000 of the 118,218,327 tax returns that \n     were filed, almost 50 percent, were filed by taxpayers who \n     utilized the help of a paid tax preparer.\n       (7) The average taxpayer spends $72 each year for tax \n     preparation.\n       (8) The total burden on all taxpayers of maintaining \n     records, and preparing and filing tax returns is estimated to \n     be in excess of 1,600,000 hours per year.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the budgetary levels in this resolution assume that the \n     Senate should give priority to tax proposals that simplify \n     the tax code and reject proposals\n\n[[Page S3291]]\n\n     that add greater complexity in the tax code and increased \n     compliance costs for the taxpayer.\n\n     SEC. 361. GENERAL PROHIBITION ON THE USE OF MARIJUANA FOR \n                   MEDICINAL PURPOSES.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the provisions of this \n     resolution assume that no funds appropriated by Congress \n     should be used to provide, procure, furnish, fund or support, \n     or to compel any individual, institution or government entity \n     to provide, procure, furnish, fund or support, any item, \n     good, benefit, program or service, for the purpose of the use \n     of marijuana for medicinal purposes.\n\n     SEC. 362. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING AMTRAK FUNDING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) on November 13, 1997 the Senate unanimously passed the \n     Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997, Public Law 105-\n     134, authorizing appropriations of $1,058,000,000 for fiscal \n     year 1999; $1,023,000,000 for fiscal year 2000; $989,000,000 \n     for fiscal year 2001; and $955,000,000 for fiscal year 2002, \n     totaling $4,025,000,000 for fiscal years 1999-2002;\n       (2) in Public Law 105-134 the Congress declared that \n     ``intercity rail passenger service is an essential component \n     of a national intermodal passenger transportation system'';\n       (3) section 201 of the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act \n     of 1997 has now statutorily formalized prior Congressional \n     directives to Amtrak to reach operating self-sufficiency by \n     fiscal year 2002;\n       (4) the Congress and the President, through enactment of \n     this legislation, have effectively agreed that Congress will \n     provide adequate funding to permit Amtrak to achieve the goal \n     of operating self-sufficiency;\n       (5) capital investment is critical to reducing operating \n     costs and increasing the quality of Amtrak service;\n       (6) capital investment is essential to improving Amtrak's \n     long-term financial health;\n       (7) the $2,200,000,000 provided to Amtrak through the \n     Taxpayer Relief Act is for the sole purpose of capital \n     expenditures and other qualified expenses and is intended to \n     supplement, not supplant, annual appropriations.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     budget resolution assume that Congress and the Administration \n     will fulfill the intent of the Amtrak Reform and \n     Accountability Act of 1997 and appropriate sufficient funds \n     in each of the next 5 fiscal years for Amtrak to implement \n     its fiscal years 1998-2003 Strategic Business Plan, while \n     preserving the integrity of the $2,200,000,000 provided under \n     the Taxpayer Relief Act for the statutory purpose of capital \n     investment.\n\n     SEC. 363. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING MARKET ACCESS \n                   PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The Market Access Program (MAP) continues to be a vital \n     and important part of United States trade policy aimed at \n     maintaining and expanding United States agricultural exports, \n     countering subsidized foreign competition, strengthening farm \n     income and protecting American jobs. Further, the Senate \n     finds that:\n       (A) The Market Access Program is specifically targeted \n     towards small business, farmer cooperatives and trade \n     associations.\n       (B) The Market Access Program is administered on a cost-\n     share basis. Participants, including farmers and ranchers, \n     are required to contribute up to 50 percent or more toward \n     the cost of the program.\n       (2) The Market Access Program has been a tremendous success \n     by any measure. Since the program was established, United \n     States agricultural exports have doubled. In fiscal year \n     1997, United States agricultural exports amounted to \n     $57,300,000,000, resulting in a positive agricultural trade \n     surplus of approximately $22,000,000,000, and contributing \n     billions of dollars more in increased economic activity and \n     additional tax revenues.\n       (3) The Market Access Program has also helped maintain and \n     create needed jobs throughout the Nation's economy. More than \n     one million Americans now have jobs that depend on United \n     States agricultural exports. Further, every billion dollars \n     in additional United States agricultural exports helps create \n     as many as 17,000 or more new jobs.\n       (4) United States agriculture, including farm income and \n     related jobs, is more dependent than ever on maintaining and \n     expanding United States agricultural exports as Federal farm \n     programs are gradually reduced under the FAIR Act of 1996.\n       (5) In addition to the Asian economic situation and \n     exchange rate fluctuations, United States agricultural \n     exports continue to be adversely impacted by continued \n     subsidized foreign competition, artificial trade barriers and \n     other unfair foreign trade practices.\n       (6) The European Union (EU) and other foreign competitors \n     continue to heavily outspend the United States by more than \n     10 to 1 with regard to export subsidies.\n       (A) In 1997, the EU budgeted $7,200,000,000 for export \n     subsidies aimed at capturing a larger share of the world \n     market at the expense of United States agriculture.\n       (B) EU and other foreign competitors also spend nearly \n     $500,000,000 on market promotion activities. The EU spends \n     more on wine promotion than the United States currently \n     spends on all commodities and related agricultural products.\n       (C) The EU has announced a major new initiative aimed at \n     increasing their exports to Japan--historically, the largest \n     single market for United States agriculture exports.\n       (7) United States agriculture is the most competitive \n     industry in the world, but it cannot and should not be \n     expected to compete alone against the treasuries of foreign \n     governments.\n       (8) Reducing or eliminating funding for the Market Access \n     Program would adversely affect United States agriculture's \n     ability to remain competitive in today's global marketplace. \n     A reduction in United States agricultural exports would \n     translate into lower farm income, a worsening trade deficit, \n     slower economic growth, fewer export-related jobs, and a \n     declining tax base.\n       (9) United States success in upcoming trade negotiations on \n     agriculture scheduled to begin in 1999 depends on maintaining \n     an aggressive trade strategy and related policies and \n     programs. Reducing or eliminating the Market Access Program \n     would represent a form of unilateral disarmament and weaken \n     the United States negotiating position.\n       (10) The Market Access Program is one of the few programs \n     specifically allowed under the current Uruguay Round \n     Agreement.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that funding for the Market Access Program (MAP) should be \n     fully maintained as authorized and aggressively utilized by \n     the United States Department of Agriculture to encourage \n     United States agricultural exports, strengthen farm income, \n     counter subsidized foreign competition, and protect American \n     jobs.\n\n     SEC. 364. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE NATIONAL \n                   INSTITUTES OF HEALTH.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) heart disease was the leading cause of death for both \n     men and women in every year from 1970 to 1993;\n       (2) mortality rates for individuals suffering from prostate \n     cancer, skin cancer, and kidney cancer continue to rise;\n       (3) the mortality rate for African American women suffering \n     from diabetes is 134 percent higher than the mortality rate \n     of Caucasian women suffering from diabetes;\n       (4) asthma rates for children increased 58 percent from \n     1982 to 1992;\n       (5) nearly half of all American women between the ages of \n     65 and 75 reported having arthritis;\n       (6) AIDS is the leading cause of death for Americans \n     between the ages of 24 and 44;\n       (7) the Institute of Medicine has described United States \n     clinical research to be ``in a state of crisis'' and the \n     National Academy of Sciences concluded in 1994 that ``the \n     present cohort of clinical investigators is not adequate'';\n       (8) biomedical research has been shown to be effective in \n     saving lives and reducing health care expenditures;\n       (9) research sponsored by the National Institutes of Health \n     has contributed significantly to the first overall reduction \n     in cancer death rates since recordkeeping was instituted;\n       (10) research sponsored by the National Institutes of \n     health has resulted in the identification of genetic \n     mutations for osteoporosis; Lou Gehrig's Disease, cystic \n     fibrosis, and Huntington's Disease; breast, skin and prostate \n     cancer; and a variety of other illnesses;\n       (11) research sponsored by the National Institutes of \n     Health has been key to the development of Magnetic Resonance \n     Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanning \n     technologies;\n       (12) research sponsored by the National Institutes of \n     Health has developed effective treatments for Acute \n     Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). Today, 80 percent of children \n     diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia are alive and \n     free of the disease after 5 years; and\n       (13) research sponsored by the National Institutes of \n     Health contributed to the development of a new, cost-saving \n     cure for peptic ulcers.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the function totals in this budget resolution assume \n     that--\n       (1) appropriations for the National Institutes of Health \n     should be increased by 100 percent over the next 5 fiscal \n     years;\n       (2) appropriations for the National Institutes of Health \n     should be increased by $2,000,000,000 in year 1999 over the \n     amount appropriated in fiscal year 1998;\n       (3) the budget resolution takes a major step toward meeting \n     this goal; and\n       (4) at a minimum, appropriations for the National \n     Institutes of Health should match the recommendations \n     provided in the budget resolution.\n\n     SEC. 365. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING DISPLAY OF TEN \n                   COMMANDMENTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Ten Commandments have had a significant impact on \n     the development of the fundamental legal principles of \n     Western Civilization; and\n       (2) the Ten Commandments set forth a code of moral conduct, \n     observance of which is acknowledged to promote respect for \n     our system of laws and the good of society.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals in this concurrent resolution on \n     the budget assume that--\n       (1) the Ten Commandments are a declaration of fundamental \n     principles that are the cornerstones of a fair and just \n     society; and\n       (2) the public display, including display in the Supreme \n     Court, the Capitol building, the White House, and other \n     government offices\n\n[[Page S3292]]\n\n     and courthouses across the nation, of the Ten Commandments \n     should be permitted, as long as it is consistent with the \n     establishment clause of the first amendment of the United \n     States Constitution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/20/senate-section/article/S3277-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a treaty \nand sundry nominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/20/senate-section/article/S3292-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 7, 1997, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on April 15, 1998, during the adjournment \nof the Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that Speaker pro tempore (Mrs. Morella) signed the following \nenrolled bills:\n\n       S. 419.

Res. 210\n\n       Whereas mosquito-borne diseases (including malaria, yellow \n     fever, encephalitis, dengue fever, and dog heartworm) have \n     historically been a source of human and animal suffering, \n     illness, and death in the United States and worldwide;\n       Whereas excess numbers of mosquitoes also diminish \n     enjoyment of the outdoors, public parks and playgrounds, \n     hinder outdoor work, decrease livestock productivity, and \n     reduce property values;\n       Whereas mosquitoes can disperse or be transported long \n     distances from their sources (locally and internationally) \n     and are, therefore, a public nuisance and health risk \n     throughout the United States and the world;\n       Whereas since 1900, mosquito control professionals in the \n     United States have recognized the need to develop and \n     encourage effective and environmentally safe mosquito control \n     activities in order to protect the health and welfare of the \n     public, the environment, and wildlife;\n       Whereas the American Mosquito Control Association (referred \n     to in this resolution as AMCA) was established on June 26, \n     1935, to provide a nationally organized network to help \n     mosquito control professionals pursue these goals;\n       Whereas professional mosquito control based on scientific \n     research has made great advances in reducing mosquito \n     populations and the diseases that they transmit;\n       Whereas the AMCA is an active partner in the Pesticide \n     Environmental Stewardship Program, working closely with the \n     United States Environmental Protection Agency and the United \n     States Department of Health and Human Services to reduce \n     pesticide risk to humans, animals, and the environment while \n     protecting human health from mosquito-borne diseases and \n     nuisance attacks;\n       Whereas public awareness of the health benefits associated \n     with safe, professionally applied mosquito control methods \n     will support the efforts to reduce pesticide risk and protect \n     human health as well as motivate the public to eliminate \n     mosquito breeding sites on their own property;\n       Whereas educational programs are being developed to include \n     school and civic programs in order to meet the need of the \n     public for information about mosquito biology and control;\n       Whereas students are encouraged to pursue an interest in \n     biological and health sciences, to participate in science \n     fairs, and to learn about mosquito biology and contribute to \n     the reduction of mosquito populations; and\n       Whereas ``National Mosquito Control Awareness Week'' would \n     increase public awareness of the activities of the various \n     mosquito research and control agencies within the United \n     States and around the world and highlight the educational \n     programs currently available: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of June 22, 1998 through June 28, \n     1998 as ``National Mosquito Control Awareness Week''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on the people of the United States to observe this \n     week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/20/senate-section/article/S3297-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3297-S3299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        THE EDUCATION SAVINGS ACT FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 MACK (AND D'AMATO) AMENDMENT NO. 2288\n\n  Mr. MACK (for himself and Mr. D'Amato) to the bill (H.R. 2646) to \namend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow tax-free expenditures \nfrom education individual retirement accounts for elementary and \nsecondary school expenses, to increase the maximum annual amount of \ncontributions to such accounts, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n          TITLE __--MEASURES TO ENCOURAGE RESULTS IN TEACHING\n\n     SEC. __01. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This title may be cited as the ``Measures \n     to Encourage Results in Teaching Act of 1998''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) All students deserve to be taught by well-educated, \n     competent, and qualified teachers.\n       (2) More than ever before, education has and will continue \n     to become the ticket not only to economic success but to \n     basic survival. Students will not succeed in meeting the \n     demands of a knowledge-based, 21st century society and \n     economy if the students do not encounter more challenging \n     work in school. For future generations to have the \n     opportunities to achieve success the future generations will \n     need to have an education and a teacher workforce second to \n     none.\n       (3) No other intervention can make the difference that a \n     knowledgeable, skillful teacher can make in the learning \n     process. At the same time, nothing can fully compensate for \n     weak teaching that, despite good intentions, can result from \n     a teacher's lack of opportunity to acquire the knowledge and \n     skill needed to help students master the curriculum.\n       (4) The Federal Government established the Dwight D. \n     Eisenhower Professional Development Program in 1985 to ensure \n     that teachers and other educational staff have access to \n     sustained and high-quality professional development. This \n     ongoing development must include the ability to demonstrate \n     and judge the performance of teachers and other instructional \n     staff.\n       (5) States should evaluate their teachers on the basis of \n     demonstrated ability, including tests of subject matter \n     knowledge, teaching knowledge, and teaching skill. States \n     should develop a test for their teachers and other \n     instructional staff with respect to the subjects taught by \n     the teachers and staff, and should administer the test every \n     3 to 5 years.\n       (6) Evaluating and rewarding teachers with a compensation \n     system that supports teachers who become increasingly expert \n     in a subject area, are proficient in meeting the needs of \n     students and schools, and demonstrate high levels of \n     performance measured against professional teaching standards, \n     will encourage teachers to continue to learn needed skills \n     and broaden teachers' expertise, thereby enhancing education \n     for all students.\n       (c) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are as follows:\n\n[[Page S3298]]\n\n       (1) To provide incentives for States to establish and \n     administer periodic teacher testing and merit pay programs \n     for elementary school and secondary school teachers.\n       (2) To encourage States to establish merit pay programs \n     that have a significant impact on teacher salary scales.\n       (3) To encourage programs that recognize and reward the \n     best teachers, and encourage those teachers that need to do \n     better.\n\n     SEC. __02.

LOAN FORGIVENESS FOR TEACHERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Our Nation is witnessing a 10-year rise in the \n     elementary and secondary school age population. Between the \n     fall of 1996 and the fall of 2006, total elementary and \n     secondary school enrollment will rise from a record \n     51,700,000 to 54,600,000, a rise of approximately 3,000,000 \n     children. Elementary school enrollment is projected to grow \n     by 2 percent, from 37,300,000 to 38,100,000, while secondary \n     school enrollment is expected to rise by 15 percent, from \n     14,400,000 to 16,500,000.\n       (2) In addition to the enrollment increases, many of the \n     Nation's elementary and secondary school teachers working in \n     1998 will begin to reach retirement age. According to the \n     National Center for Education Statistics data, between one-\n     third and one-half of all elementary and secondary school \n     teachers are 45 years old or older. Qualified, experienced \n     elementary and secondary school teachers will be leaving the \n     profession at a time when the demand for the teachers is at \n     the highest level in our Nation's history.\n       (3) There is a lack of qualified elementary and secondary \n     school teachers in specific geographic and content areas. \n     More than one-half, 56 percent, of secondary school students \n     taking physical science courses are taught by teachers who \n     have no background in physical science. Twenty-seven percent \n     of secondary school students taking any level mathematics \n     course are taught by teachers with no mathematics background. \n     Students in inner-city schools have only a 50 percent chance \n     of being taught by a qualified mathematics or science \n     teacher. States that have large percentages of classes taught \n     by teachers without a background in a particular subject \n     area, such as Tennessee (26.5 percent), Florida (26.4 \n     percent), Louisiana (26.2 percent), and Maryland (25.6 \n     percent), demonstrate the need for increased numbers of \n     elementary and secondary school teachers with the necessary \n     qualifications.\n       (4) Our Nation must address the need described in paragraph \n     (3) to ensure a qualified elementary and secondary school \n     teacher for every child in every elementary and secondary \n     school course.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to create a \n     Federal student loan forgiveness program to attract \n     individuals to careers as elementary and secondary school \n     teachers.\n       (c) Loan Forgiveness for Teachers.--Part B of title IV of \n     the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1071 et seq.) is \n     amended by inserting after section 428J (20 U.S.C. 1078-10) \n     the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 428K.

Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate one \nof Maryland's finest state institutions, Frostburg State University, on \nthe occasion of its Centennial Anniversary.\n  Since its founding in 1898, Frostburg State University has been a \nprimary component of the greater Frostburg community. Although small \ntowns are often identified merely as extensions of the school in their \nmidst, it is more the case that Frostburg State is a true extension of \nthe town of Frostburg. In fact, the people of Frostburg themselves \nraised the funds that were used to buy the land on which the \ninstitution is located. This symbiotic relationship is one in which the \nFrostburg community provides the support system for the school and in \nturn, is enriched by the school and its students.\n  This unique relationship dates back to when the University was a \nsmall local teacher training institution named the State Normal School \nat Frostburg. Upon completing their training, students often stayed in \nthe area and taught at regional elementary schools. This tradition of \ncommunity participation continued as the school evolved into a State \nTeachers College in 1935 and finally, a multipurpose institution, \nFrostburg State University, in July of 1987, becoming a member of the \nUniversity of Maryland System the following year.\n  While the commitment to teacher training remains at the core of \nFrostburg State's mission, the University has expanded its curriculum \nsignificantly to include the arts and sciences, professional and pre-\nprofessional programs, and graduate programs including business, \npsychology and biology training. Enrollment has grown from an initial \nclass of 57 to over 5,200, and the University's degree program now \nrequires four years of study.\n\n[[Page S3300]]\n\n  It is important to note, however, that Frostburg State University \noccupies a unique educational niche as the only four-year institution \nwest of the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area. Therefore, it \nserves as the intellectual and cultural center for this westernmost \nregion of my State, and for nearby communities in Pennsylvania and West \nVirginia. Although the student body includes students from various \nstates and foreign countries, it continues to draw primarily from the \nimmediate area, and provides important employment opportunities for the \nresidents of the region. Furthermore, Frostburg State enjoys a \npartnership with the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) from whom \nthey receive federal funds for various projects that enrich the \nschool's resources and provide further economic development to the \narea.\n  It has always been my firm belief that a democracy cannot prosper and \ngrow without an educated populace. As the world becomes increasingly \ncomplex and technically challenging, the quality education of the \nindividual is one of the most important tasks in our society. From its \ninception, Frostburg State University has prioritized education; \nmaintaining a commitment to providing community and educational \nservices to the entire region while, at the same time, succeeding in \nproviding a nationally acclaimed education to its own university \ncommunity.\n  As we celebrate this important milestone, I would like to commend the \ngreater Frostburg State University family for upholding the traditions \nof community cooperation and commitment to excellence that serve to \nexemplify the very best that Maryland has to offer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/20/senate-section/article/S3299-3", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SCHOOR DePALMA\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to salute Schoor \nDePalma Engineers and Design Professional Firm as it completes its \nthirtieth year in business, and to recognize its contributions to the \nState of New Jersey. This engineer and design professional firm has \ncontributed to some of the state's largest engineering and design \nprojects.\n  Schoor DePalma is one of the most widely recognized civil engineering \nfirms in the State of New Jersey. The company's ingenuity brings forth \na superior level of accountability, concern, and quality of work.\n  Schoor DePalma's commitment is easily also recognized through its \nselfless involvement with the community through entities, such as the \nBoard of Professional Planners and the Board of Professional Engineers \nof the State of New Jersey and its participation in highly regarded \nacademic programs such as the Board of Overseers for the New Jersey \nInstitute of Technology, a variety of college foundations throughout \nNew Jersey, and the awarding of scholarships to students in the \nengineering field.\n  One of Schoor DePalma's most recent and profitable contributions to \nthe State of New Jersey was to enhance the economically distressed \ncommunity of East Orange. Schoor DePalma was hired to conduct a \ncomprehensive business analysis of the six main business districts of \nEast Orange by looking at crime statistics, the labor force, the mix of \nbusinesses, infrastructure, and streetscaping needs. Schoor DePalma's \ninnovative blue print for economic growth proved to be successful when \nsome local establishments saw a remarkable 50 percent increase in \nbusiness.\n  I am proud to recognize Schoor DePalma as a model corporate neighbor \nand I look forward to another 30 years of excellence from them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/20/senate-section/article/S3300-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO FLORENCE KIRKNER\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to pay homage to Ms. \nFlorence Kirkner. Today, we focus on Ms. Kirkner's 50 years of \nvolunteering with the National Ski Patrol. The National Ski Patrol was \nformed 60 years ago as a volunteer organization that has been granted a \nCongressional Charter as a charity similar to the Boys and Girls \nScouts. This organization formed an army division that could fight in \nwinter weather conditions during World War II. Additionally, Senator \nBob Dole was affiliated with this division which is known as the Tenth \nMountain Division. This division was the only civilian run division in \nthe Army's history. Today, the Tenth Mountain division is stationed at \nFort Drum, New York.\n  I would also like to take this opportunity to commend Ms. Kirkner's \nparticipation in many other community activities such as the American \nRed Cross, the Girl Scouts and the YMCA.\n  After reviewing Ms. Kirkner's outstanding achievements, I decided an \nacknowledgment of her awards should be presented. Ms. Kirkner received \na Citizen of the Week Award in 1996 and in 1997 she received the \nCitizen of the Year Award. Previously, because of Ms. Kirkner's \nexcellent community service, she received the Merit Award in 1985 and \nthe Volunteer of the year award in 1986. Ms. Kirkner was twice \nnominated for the Clara Barton Award in 1988 and again in 1990. \nAdditionally in 1988, the Volunteer of the Year Award was acclaimed to \nMs. Kirkner. Furthermore, after serving over 15,000 hours of community \nservice, Ms. Kirkner was presented with the Service Award in addition \nto the 50 Year Service Award.\n  Ms. Kirkner has also received awards for the National Appointment \n#84, the Outstanding Service Award for the North Bay Region, the \nPatroller of the Year Award for the Western New York Region, 2 Yellow \nMerit Stars, the Purple Merit Star, the Avalanche Patch #82, the \nEastern Division Certificate of Appreciation, the Red Cross Certificate \nof Merit, the Certificate of Appreciation for the Western New York \nRegion, the Ambassador of the Slopes Award for the Western New York \nRegion, the Mike Reid Outstanding Instructor Award for the Western New \nYork Region, the Canadian Ski Patrol Special Award and the Green Angel \nAward from the Girl Scouts.\n  I would also like to acknowledge Ms. Kirkner for holding numerous \noffices in her lifetime. She has held offices such as Co-Patrol Leader \nfor Donner Ski Ranch; Regional Training Officer for Western New York; \nRegional First Aid Chairman in North Bay, California; Avalanche \nInstructor for National #224; ARC First Aid Instructor and Trainer; ARC \nCPR Instructor and Trainer; ARC Water Safety Instructor and Trainer; \nARC Small Craft Safety Instructor and Shift Leader at Kissing Bridge \nSki Patrol.\n  In addition Ms. Kirkner has managed to conduct training courses and \nworkshops such as the Avalanche Patch Course in Slide Mt., Nevada; Sled \nHandling Seminars in Squaw Valley, California; the Mountain Rescue \nCourse at the Sugar Bowl; Mountaineering at Circle M; Divisional Jr. \nTraining Seminars for 11 years and National Jr. Training Seminars for 4 \nyears. Moreover, Ms. Kirkner led Fall Forums workshops too numerous to \ncount from New York City to Sacramento, from Portland, to Maine and has \nbeen an instructor every year of Patrol CPR since the beginning of Ski \nPatrol, CPR.\n  Ms. Kirkner is truly one of those unique individuals who has given a \nlifetime of community service. Her contributions to society will always \nbe recognized as encouragement and hope to American citizens \neverywhere, and reminds us that the phrase ``it is better to give than \nto receive'' still rings to be true.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/20/senate-section/article/S3300-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3300-S3301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               VIETNAM VETERANS IN HYANNIS, MASSACHUSETTS\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to commend the extraordinary \nachievements of a group of Vietnam Veterans in Hyannis, Massachusetts. \nFive Vietnam Veterans from Cape Cod, Michael Trainor, Ray Pacheco, \nWoody Hoffman, Craig Morrison and Michael Williams, created the Nam \nVets Association in 1983. Their mission, to provide human services to \nand improve the public image of Vietnam Veterans, has been courageously \ncarried on, to this day, by John Eastman, Charlie Brown, John Ahern, \nHank Tucker, Bill SilverRyder, and Randy Ritter. On Vietnam Veterans' \nDay, March 29, 1998, this group of dedicated men celebrated fifteen \nyears of work on behalf of their fellow veterans. No organization \nprovides more services to the veterans of Cape Cod and the Islands than \nthe Nam Vets Association. It provides counseling services, housing \nassistance, a food pantry, employment programs, VA benefit information \nand, perhaps most important of all, a place where veterans and their \nfamilies feel welcome. I know I did.\n  Mr. President, at the recent Vietnam Veterans of America Convention \nin\n\n[[Page S3301]]\n\nKansas City, Missouri, the Nam Vets Association was selected from 700 \nchapters nationwide to be honored as the 1997 Community Service Chapter \nof the Year. This group has made a tremendous impact on the lives of \nmany people in its community. The scholarships, youth activities, \nvolunteer service to community events, and housing programs it \nprovides, and the 55,000 meals it serves annually from its food pantry, \ngive this organization great reason to be very, very proud. On its \nFifteenth Anniversary, I am proud to offer my brother Vietnam Veterans \nin Hyannis my sincere congratulations, my heartfelt gratitude, my best \nwishes for further triumphs, and my promise of continuing support for \ntheir tremendous work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/20/senate-section/article/S3300-3", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO HURVIE E. DAVIS\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \nrecognize the accomplishments of Hurvie E. Davis. It is an honor and a \nprivilege for me to recognize his many outstanding achievements and to \ncommend him for the superb service he has provided our nation and the \nstate of Arizona.\n  Upon his retirement on May 29, 1998, he will have served 42 years in \nboth federal and municipal government. Hurvie's expertise lies \nprimarily in the transportation field, having served the federal \nDepartment of Transportation in Washington, D.C., and regionally in San \nDiego, Portland, Oregon, and most recently in Tucson. Hurvie was the \nDirector of Transportation for the City of Tucson for 15 years before \ngoing into the private sector as a transportation consultant.\n  In 1992, Hurvie became the Town Manager for the Town of Marana. As \nManager, Hurvie has accomplished many difficult tasks, and in doing so, \nhas brought Marana positive recognition throughout the Southern Arizona \nregion of municipal governments. His leadership and commitment to \nexcellence has put Marana in a strong financial position to encourage \nresidential and business development.\n  Mr. President, Hurvie Davis has made many sacrifices during his 42 \nyears of public service, and has contributed significantly to the many \npeople he has worked with. I commend him on behalf of the United States \nSenate and wish him the very best as he begins another journey in \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/20/senate-section/article/S3301-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3301-S3302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      TRIBUTE TO LEO LAKIN, GREEN THUMB CENTENARIAN FROM GARDNER, \n                             MASSACHUSETTS\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, at more than two centuries and \ncounting, America is a nation ever maturing with greater wisdom, \nexperience, morality and humanity. For this we can thank many of our \nmost senior citizens who continue to set proud examples of daily life, \nand who remind us of our rich and proud heritage as a nation of caring \nindividuals. Leo Lakin of Gardner, Massachusetts--who will turn 100 \nyears old on May 26th--is one such American.\n  Millions of our friends and neighbors distinguish themselves every \nday as parents, small business owners, educators, and in every other \npersonal dimension and chosen profession of American life. There are \nthose, however, who stand out as role models for their families and \ntheir communities. Leo wears these titles effortlessly and modestly, \nwhich is one reason why our Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman, our \nSecretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala, and Green Thumb, \nInc. honored Leo as ``an outstanding older worker'' at the first Prime \nTime Awards Dinner on March 12, 1998 in Washington, DC.\n  Praise of Leo has been both modest and inspirational. In her \nnominating letter to Green Thumb, Inc., Marcia Hopper of Gardner's \ndowntown association wrote that ``Mr. Lakin's work ethic of kindness, \ncompassion, generosity, and thoughtfulness to customers has brought him \na loyal following based on both business and friendship. Many of his \ncurrent customers are fourth generation.'' Pete Trudel, another long-\ntime business owner in Gardner, said of Leo, ``He's intelligent and \nknowledgeable. He has always kept up with the latest business trends. \nHe's personable and loves people. He always remains calm. He's just a \nlovely, lovely man.''\n  Leo Lakin was born in Boston on May 26, 1898. The Lakin family moved \nto Southbridge, Massachusetts when Leo was a small child. Leo became \nbilingual as he grew up, as the French American community in \nSouthbridge was large, and speaking French served Leo and his family \nwell. His father, Phillip, was able to develop deep roots into the \ncommunity. Philip Lakin became known for more than owning a dry goods \nstore. He was always helping some less fortunate person with food, \nclothing or a place to stay. That strong sense of community became part \nof Leo's life, just as a strong sense of family had been instilled in \nLeo from a very early age.\n  Leo and his 4 brothers--Celec, Louis, Eddy and Bob--were extremely \nclose to each other. Phillip had been a widower with 5 children when he \nmarried a young widow, Annie, who had a daughter, Sarah. Leo idolized \nhis parents. When he was about 11 years of age, he overheard his \nparents speaking in Yiddish, expressing the hope that some day after \ntheir passing one of their sons would be sufficiently well versed in \nJewish tradition to be able to say the Mourner's Kaddish to honor and \nrespect their memories. Overhearing this conversation had an enormous \nimpact on Leo's life. He promised himself that he would honor his \nparents in this way, and the study of Hebrew and Jewish tradition was a \nvital aspect of Leo's youth. He has spent many, many years helping to \nconduct synagogue services and enjoying the richness of Jewish studies.\n  Leo left high school after his freshman year and went to work for the \nAmerican Optical Company, one of the largest lens manufacturers in the \nworld at that time. His career there began as so many do in America, \nwith a summer job. Leo stayed for several years but eventually he \nlonged for the freedom he could experience as an entrepreneur. In 1922 \nhe and his brother Eddy opened Lakin's Brothers, a men's store located \nin Gardner's Webster Square. In 1933, relatives in Fall River \nintroduced him to Ida Gollis, a personal shopper at the Outlet Company \nin Providence, Rhode Island. They married on June 2, 1935. To this day, \nLeo says, ``She's the best thing that has ever happened to me.''\n  In 1935, children's specialty stores were en vogue. Gardner was a \nvirtual boom town known as ``The Chair City of the World.'' Heywood \nWakefield, Gem Crib and Cradle, Nichols and Stone, Florence Stove, and \nSimplex Time Recorder called Gardner home. Two weeks after their \nmarriage, Leo and Ida opened Lakin's Children's Shop. And just like \nLeo's dad had done, they observed an important ethic of treating their \ncustomers with the respect and kindness, never pressured a purchase, \nand made everyone feel welcome.\n  For the next 51 years, Leo and Ida survived every challenge from the \nGreat Depression to the rise of shopping malls and the demise of many \nsmall downtowns. Only Ida's death in June of 1986 ended that \npartnership on this earth. Leo continued to run the store, and his \ncustomers remained loyal and supportive. The store has remained the \ncornerstone of Leo's vitality, and a force that will not be beaten. In \nMarch of 1993, Leo broke his arm at work and recovered. In February of \n1994, he contracted pneumonia and recovered. That July, he broke his \nhip at work, had a replacement at the age of 96, made a complete \nrecovery, and returned to work 6 days a week.\n  During the 6 months of Leo's recuperation from hip surgery, his \ndaughter Phyllis ran the store for him knowing that Leo needed the \npromise of returning to work in order to recover. She worked full time \nat Harvard Medical School, but with the help of close friends Jean \nJohnson, Beverly Black, and Claudette Jackowski, Phyllis kept the \nspirit of Lakin's alive in mind, body and soul as Leo had always done: \nwith their customers in mind. Phyllis has since decided that the family \nlegacy of her father and grandfather will go on, and that eventually \nshe will carry on the tradition her parents began in 1935. ``As long as \nI'm alive, Lakin's is alive!'' she says.\n  Leo broke his leg on Nov 3, 1997, which was why he could not attend \nthe Prime Time awards in the Capital this March. Leo has been a \ntireless and courageous patient, continually amazes old and new friends \nalike, touches all with his faith, optimism, and kindness, and plans to \nreturn to the work and people he loves so much.\n\n[[Page S3302]]\n\n  Mr. President, we often wonder what America and the world we live in \nwill be like in the 21st Century. We wonder about our children and the \nvalues they are learning today in school, at home, on television, and \nfrom each other. We can only hope that as they navigate so many diverse \nand dynamic forces in their lives that there will also be a Leo Lakin \nor two to give them a sense of history, community, family, and hope for \nthe future as he has most certainly given to all who know and love him \nin Gardner, Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/20/senate-section/article/S3301-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            POLITICAL SCIENCE DEPARTMENT AT KEAN UNIVERSITY\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nPolitical Science Department at Kean University. Over the past twenty \nyears, Kean's Political Science Department has produced an outstanding \nrecord of accomplishment and I am pleased to recognize this model \nprogram.\n  The faculty and administration of Kean's Political Science Department \nhave consistently demonstrated their selfless commitment to furthering \nthe intellectual growth of the University's students. Kean's balanced \neducational program presents students with a unique blend of \nexperiential learning and classroom teaching. It is a model of \nexcellence for all American universities.\n  Kean's Political Science Department has earned just recognition by \noffering challenging participatory programs like the American Israel \nPublic Affairs Conference, the Center for the Study of the Presidency's \nStudent Symposium, the Harvard Model United Nations Program, the Howard \nUniversity Simulation of the Organization of African Unity, the \nSchering-Plough/Kean College Political Science Education Partnership, \nthe Washington Program, and the annual Department Washington DC Student \nWorkshop.\n  In an era of decreasing funding, program costs are met through \ncontributions from outside sources, student groups and alumni. The \nUniversity itself provides enormous scholarship support. As a result of \nthe Political Science Department's dedicated efforts, little cost need \nbe borne by its student participants.\n  I am pleased to join the New Jersey State Legislature in honoring the \nKean University Political Science Department as a model of educational \nvirtuosity. It is my sincere hope that the Department continues its \ntradition of excellence with the vigor and success that has \ncharacterized it for the past twenty years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/20/senate-section/article/S3302-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ILLINOIS STUDENT TECHNOLOGY DAY\n\n Mr. DURGIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize April 29, \n1998, as ``Illinois Student Technology Day''. On that day, some 140 \nIllinois schools will hold school technology demonstrations at the \nseventh annual TECH 2000/AT Students for the Information Age program \nat the Illinois State Capitol Building in Springfield.\n  During this all-day event in the middle of National Science & \nTechnology Week, over 300 Illinois students will demonstrate the \nimportant impact technology, and access to it, has had in their \nclassrooms. The demonstration is sponsored by AT, state and local \nofficials, and TECH 2000, a group of educators working to increase \nsupport for classroom technology and the role it plays in a student's \neducational experience.\n  The advancements that have been made in technology, and the role it \nhas played in the gathering of critical information for students, has \nimproved the learning experience for thousands of our nation's \nstudents. Increased efforts need to made to ensure that more students, \nespecially those in rural and impoverished communities, have access to \nthese technological advancements. I hope that we can look at what will \ntake place in Springfield, Illinois on April 29, 1998, as the beginning \nof a national commitment towards giving our students the best possible \nopportunity to learn and succeed both in the classroom and in their \ncareers that follow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/20/senate-section/article/S3302-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE 83D ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 83rd \nAnniversary of the Armenian Genocide. Each year we remember and honor \nthe victims, and pay respect to the survivors we are blessed to have \nwith us today.\n  April 24, 1915 serves as a marking point for the government-\norchestrated carnage that took place under the Turkish Ottoman Empire. \nOn this date, over 5,000 Armenians were systematically hunted down and \nkilled in Constantinople. This number includes some 600 Armenian \npolitical and intellectual leaders who were taken to the interior of \nTurkey and systematically murdered. During the eight year period from \n1915 to 1923, approximately 1.5 million Armenians were killed and \nhundreds of thousands were driven from their homes. Many of these \ndeaths were among the elderly and very young as they were forced on \ndeath marches with little food and no medical treatment.\n  History records that the world stood by as the Armenians suffered, \nalthough there was ample evidence of what was taking place. Our \nAmbassador to the Ottoman Empire, Henry Morgenthau, stated that, ``When \nthe Turkish authorities gave the orders for these deportations, they \nwere merely giving the death warrant to a whole race; they understood \nthis well, and, in their conversations with me, they made no particular \nattempt to conceal the fact * * * I am confident that the whole history \nof the human race contains no such horrible episode as this.''\n  Not only did the world stand by while atrocities took place, but \nunfortunately it refused to learn the awful lessons that were taught \nduring this period. When Adolf Hitler was planning the Jewish Holocaust \nhe said, ``Who today remembers the extermination of the Armenians?'' \nHowever, most of the world has come to acknowledge the Armenian \nGenocide. In 1929, Winston Churchill wrote the following: ``In 1915, \nthe Turkish Government began and carried out the infamous general \nmassacre and deportation of Armenians in Asia Minor * * * the clearance \nof the race from Asia Minor was about as complete as such an act, on a \nscale so great, could be. There is no reasonable doubt that this crime \nwas planned and executed for political reasons.''\n  Each year we vow that the incalculable horrors suffered by the \nArmenian people will not be in vain. That is surely the highest tribute \nwe can pay to the Armenian victims and a way in which the horror and \nbrutality of their deaths can be given redeeming meaning. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in remembering the Armenian Genocide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/20/senate-section/article/S3302-3", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3302-S3303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      REMOVAL OF INJUNCTION OF SECRECY--TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 105-41\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL.
