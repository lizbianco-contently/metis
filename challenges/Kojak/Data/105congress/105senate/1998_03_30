I will take some time, and I think I will be joined by at \nleast one Member, to talk just a little bit about spending and taxes in \ngeneral.\n  We are coming into a time, of course, this week, and I suspect now \nfor a number of weeks, when the focus of this Congress will be budgets, \non appropriations, on spending, as it should be. I want to talk a \nlittle bit about at least my perception of some of the broader \nobjectives that go into debate that extends beyond mathematics, that \nextends beyond the dollars--actually measures these dollars, about how \nspending really impacts on the philosophy of government, how spending \nimpacts upon the priorities that we have here in the Congress, how \nspending impacts upon our whole philosophy of whether or not we want to \nincreasingly have a larger Federal Government delving into all \nactivities of our lives, or whether, in fact, there is a limited role \nfor the Federal Government as opposed to State and local governments, \nand if so, then what does our decision reflecting spending have to do \nwith that.\n  It does seem to me that one of the real issues that we have is the \nextent and the role of the Federal Government's involvement in all the \nactivities in our country. Many would argue, and I argue, that the \nConstitution clearly defines that there is a limited role for the \nFederal Government. As a matter of fact, I think it says in the 10th \namendment that those things not precisely and clearly described in the \nConstitution are left to the States and to the people. I take that part \nof the Constitution very seriously.\n  As we talk about problems that arise throughout the country, some of \nthem are appropriate to take care of in the Federal Government, some \nare not. We find on almost everything we talk about, not always \nrecognized, not always defined, but I think if you look through the \nthings we talk about, it is the basic first decision that probably \nshould be talked about.\n  We talk a lot about balancing the budget. We balanced the budget last \nyear for the first time in, what, 25 years. That was when income \nreached expenditures for the first time in 25 years. That is an \nexcellent start. I think it is something this Congress ought to be \nparticularly proud of. It is an excellent start.\n  But you can balance the budget at almost any level if you continue to \nincrease revenues, increase taxes, increase the burden of taxes on the \nAmerican people. You can increase revenues and spending can go on and \nstill be balanced, and it gets away from the\n\n[[Page S2732]]\n\nphilosophy of having a smaller Federal Government. So the choices that \nwe make and the choices that we take are very often directed by \nspending.\n  I think we find ourselves in an interesting situation, talking about \nsurpluses. First of all, there is no surplus at this point even though \nthere is an expectation of one. So we find ourselves in great debates \nover spending a surplus that has not yet appeared. Further, almost an \nindication that if there is a surplus, by gosh, we have to find some \nway to spend it. Now, that really doesn't necessarily need to be the \ncase. We could apply it to the debt. We have a little debt, remember--\n$5.7 trillion I believe it is--a debt that we could be paying. When we \ndon't, pages like those sitting here before the Senate will be paying \nfor it. We put it on the credit card and the credit card is maxed out. \nThere are places to do something with surpluses besides spending them.\n\n  The Senator from Massachusetts last Friday arose with four or five \nproblems he talked about: We need school repair. Of course we need \nschool repair. We need more teachers. I suspect we need more teachers. \nNobody would argue with the idea there ought to be improvements in \neducation. There ought to be more money spent in education, but there \nis a philosophy and there is a question as to where that money should \ncome from. Schools have basically been under the control of the States \nand local school districts and local governments. As a matter of fact, \nout of all the billions of dollars we spend in education, only about 7 \npercent is contributed by the Federal Government. That is almost all in \nspecial education. Each time there is a problem defined, it doesn't \nautomatically mean that the best solution is to take Federal money and \nspend it, and spend it along with the Federal regulations that \ninevitably go with it.\n  Mr. President, I think as we go through this next several weeks of \ndebates and discussions about budgets and about appropriations some of \nthe first decisions we make ought to be philosophical decisions as to \nwhat is the role of the Federal Government, what is the role of the \nFederal Government with regard to the taxes?\n\n  I don't know about the rest of you, but I spent at least part of this \nlovely weekend doing some things that weren't that much fun, and that \nwas doing my income taxes. I didn't complete it, by the way. I got to \nthat page with 59 questions on capital gains, and I gave up for the \nweekend. There is some philosophy as to what we do about that, what the \nlevel of taxation ought to be, and we ought to be dealing with that. \nThere are lots of things that we are talking about. We are talking \nabout highway funding. A great debate is going on in the House. We have \ngenerally completed our debate here.\n  We intend to spend more money on highways. Why? Because there is a \nneed, but because there are the Federal taxes where we raise the money \nfor highways. There was quite a large TV story the other night--on ABC, \nI think--about pork-barrel highway spending. They failed to mention \nduring the whole 10 minutes that the dollars that came from there all \ncame from the taxes you and I pay on a gallon of gas--the Federal tax \nthat is raised for highways. There was no mention of that. I was a \nlittle distressed.\n  So I would like to think, Mr. President, that as we go forward here, \nwe give some thought to the appropriateness of programs, whether they \nshould be at the Federal level, whether they should be at the State \nlevel, and how much government we want at the Federal level and \ncentralized government and the things that ought to be there that are \nmore properly done at the local level, more properly done at the State \nlevel. I have a bill that I think is very important which carries out \nthe idea of contracting in the private sector. We have had, almost for \n50 years, a policy of taking those activities within Government that \nare commercial in nature and giving the private sector an opportunity \nto bid and to contract those. We have not done it. There has been a \npolicy, but it has not been implemented. In doing that, we would keep \nmore activities in the private sector, we would have a smaller \ncentralized Government, and, indeed, save money.\n  These are the kinds of philosophical issues that seem to me to be \nimportant as we move forward to try to determine what size of \nGovernment we think we ought to have and is necessary at the central \nlevel--to talk about the level of taxation and the variants of taxation \namong the American people. These are very important issues. Also, we \ntalk about being responsible, in terms of the $5 trillion debt, and \nbeing responsible in terms of balancing the budget, being responsible \nin terms of having Medicare and Social Security that will continue, \nwhich is essentially and fundamentally based on sound economics. These \nare the things we talk about. I know the politics of it is different. \nIncreasingly, our politics and our governance are driven by the media, \nby polling. It has almost become a sideshow of political activities \nrather than really talking about governance, which is what politics is \nall about.\n  Mr. President, I have been joined on the floor by my friend, the \nSenator from Montana, and I would like to yield to him as much time as \nhe might use to talk some about taxation and some of the areas of \ntaxation that are of concern to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank my friend from Wyoming.\n  Mr. President, the 45th parallel up there is the only thing that \nkeeps us apart, and we get arguments over that. Nonetheless, we get \nalong pretty well as neighbors. A lot of what I am going to talk about \ntoday is what we have in common. Our agriculture is similar, and a few \nother things that one might not recognize at first. Montana and Wyoming \nare watershed states, Wyoming is the only State in the country where \nthe water runs from it from all four directions. There may be a reason \nfor that, maybe not.\n  My colleague talked about dealing with a $5 trillion national debt. I \nwould take that another step forward and remind the American people and \nmy colleagues who make decisions based on history that we have almost \ndouble that number in a little fund, an unfunded liability, when we \ntalk about Social Security. So in our dealings with doing something \nabout the national debt, we are in essence dealing with the problem \nthat we have in Social Security.\n  I thank my friend from Wyoming for allowing me to edge in on his time \nhere.\n  Mr. President, I have another subject on which I want to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Burns pertaining to the introduction of S. 1879 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, let me close by saying I hope that, as we \ngo into this all-important time of budgets and spending, we really take \na long look at how it impacts where we are going in the future and how \nit impacts the size and composition of Government. I hope it is not \njust driven by polls. I hope we don't find ourselves trying to get some \npolitical advantage by standing up when there is a problem somewhere \nand declaring that it is the Federal Government's obligation to fix \neverything by spending Federal money. I hope we don't live by sound \nbites indicating that these are the political things that people want, \nbut, rather, talk really about how it impacts our future and our kids' \nfuture and our debt. I hope we don't contribute to the cynicism of \nGovernment by making it show business and sales promotion.\n  Politics is the way we govern ourselves. Politics is how we take to \nour precincts the decisions of what kind of government we are going to \nhave, what our spending matters will be, what our taxes will be, and \nwhat our debts will be. I think this administration has perfected the \nidea of using sales promotion and sound bites. I think polling has \nbecome sort of the direction for the White House and for this \nadministration.\n  Taking all the issues that people care about--of course they care. \nWho doesn't care about child care? Who doesn't care about education? \nWho doesn't care about school buildings? Who doesn't care about \ninsurance for everyone? Social Security? Those are issues that everyone \nembraces. The question is how do you best deal with it?\n  The White House tends to talk about the issue and declare their \ninterest in\n\n[[Page S2733]]\n\nthe issue with no plans to resolve it. It is sort of triangulation. If \nsomebody in the Congress finds some sort of a resolution to it, then \nthe White House claims success. If it fails to happen, then the White \nHouse criticizes Congress but never has a plan of its own. I hope we \nmove away from that. I hope we really address the legitimate question.\n  There are those who support more government, more Federal Government, \na larger Government, and more taxes. It is a belief--and an honest \nbelief, I think sometimes--that that is the best way to govern, that \nthe best way is to take the money from people, bring it here, and then \nspread it out as they see fit. They believe that. I happen not to share \nthat notion. I happen to share the notion that the better government \nand the stronger government is closer to the people who are governed; \nthat in fact a smaller central government and a more efficient central \ngovernment is better and leaves the ability to govern closer to the \npeople.\n  Mr. President, I hope those are some of the issues and some of the \nreally basic fundamental things that we include as we talk about \nbudgets and as we talk about spending.\n  I thank you for the time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/30/senate-section/article/S2731-6", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. Con. Res. 86, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 86) setting forth the \n     congressional budget for the United States Government for \n     fiscal years 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003 and revising \n     the current resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1998.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the concurrent resolution.\n  Pending:\n\n       Murray amendment No. 2165, to establish a deficit-neutral \n     reserve fund to reduce class size by hiring 100,000 teachers.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  For the information of the Senate, we will now, as indicated, begin \nconsideration of the budget resolution. Although there are not any \nvotes scheduled for today, it is certainly the hope of the majority \nleader and of the Budget Committee that we can begin the process of \nhearing from those who wish to bring amendments so they can be fully \ndebated and discussed. I urge any colleagues who might be thinking \nabout offering amendments to join us today. We have heard that a couple \nmay be coming in a little bit. We will welcome them and begin this \nprocess of trying to sort through them in the hours ahead.\n  At this time, it is my understanding that the Senator from North \nDakota has opening comments to make. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, today is a historic day. For the first time in 30 \nyears, the Budget Committee is able to present a budget that is \nbalanced on a unified basis. I think all of us have looked forward to \nthe day when we would be able to say to our colleagues, ``The deficit \nhas been erased.'' That is what we are able to come to the floor and \nsay today.\n  We all understand that there is more to do, because we all understand \nwe are continuing to use the Social Security trust fund surpluses. So \nthat is the next challenge that faces us. But on that front, we are \nmaking progress as well, because in this budget resolution, we are \nsaving the surpluses until Social Security can be strengthened, and we \nare doing it on both sides. The Republican budget resolution and the \nalternative Democratic resolution will both be balanced on a unified \nbasis and also preserve all of the surpluses generated by the 5-year \nspending plan until Social Security is strengthened.\n  I thought it might be useful to recount for our colleagues and those \nwho might be watching how we got to the position we are in today, what \nit took to get here, what is the history, how did it happen, because I \nthink it is an important story.\n  In 1993, President Clinton was inaugurated, came into office and laid \ndown an economic plan to reduce the deficit. It was a controversial \nplan, one that cut spending and also raised income taxes on the \nwealthiest 1.5 percent of the people in this country. Many said that \nplan would not work. In fact, our friends on the other side of the \naisle said it would crater the economy.\n  How well I remember the debate we had on the floor of the Senate. How \nwell I remember the description that came from our colleagues on the \nother side who told us, ``If you pass this plan, it will not reduce the \ndeficit, it will increase the deficit.'' They said it would increase \nunemployment; that it would increase inflation; that it would increase \nthe debt; that it would stifle economic growth. Mr. President, the \nrecord is now clear. Our friends on the other side of the aisle were \nsimply wrong. They were wrong on every single count. The plan that we \npassed in 1993 not only reduced the deficit, it has done it each and \nevery year since the 1993 plan was passed.\n  It has also led to a remarkable economic resurgence. It has led to \nthe lowest unemployment in 24 years, the lowest rate of inflation in 31 \nyears, the strongest business expansion in any of our memories, and put \nthis country on a sound financial footing.\n  But, again, I think we must all recognize the challenge is not over, \nbecause the next step is to stop using the Social Security trust fund \nsurpluses. Again, the budget resolution offered by our friends on the \nother side of the aisle this year and the alternative that will be \noffered by our side recognize the Social Security surpluses should no \nlonger be used in the calculation of the budget deficit and that we \nwill preserve all budget surpluses until the time Social Security is \nstrengthened.\n  Mr. President, this first chart shows that the unified budget is \nbalanced for the first time in 30 years. Here is the record since 1969. \nThirty years ago is the last time we were able to achieve unified \nbalance--30 long years ago. And in between, we saw deficits rising \ninexorably, until in 1992 they reached $290 billion. Then, as I \nindicated, President Clinton came into office and proposed the 1993 \nbudget plan, a 5-year economic blueprint that has made dramatic \nprogress. You can see what has happened since: The deficit has been in \nsteep decline, until this year when we anticipate we also may run a \nsmall unified surplus, but clearly we are on the right track.\n\n  I thought I might also help to put in perspective what has happened \nin the last three Presidencies, what the record has been on the \nquestion of budget deficits, because those budget deficits weighed down \non this economy and prevented the kind of economic growth that we have \nnow enjoyed since progress has finally been made.\n  This chart shows from 1981 through 1999 the budget deficit record. We \ncan see during the Reagan administration, he came in and inherited a \ndeficit of $79 billion. That promptly skyrocketed so that we were \nrunning on almost a consistent basis deficits of $200 billion a year, \nabsolutely unheard of before that time.\n  In the last years of the Reagan administration, some improvement was \nmade. We were still running budget deficits of $150 billion a year.\n  Then we had the 4 years of the Bush administration, and the deficits \ntook off like a scalded cat. Deficits went up, as I indicated before, \nso that at the end of the Bush administration, the deficits were \nrunning $290 billion a year. And with the election of President \nClinton, a Democratic Congress passed a budget plan in 1993 that has \nsucceeded in reducing the deficits every year of that 5-\n\n[[Page S2734]]\n\nyear plan. The deficit went down in 1993 to $255 billion; the next year \nwas down to $203 billion; then $164 billion; then $107 billion; then \ndown to $22 billion and, as you can see, additional progress is being \nmade so that in 1999, we are now anticipating a unified budget surplus.\n  As I indicated, the 1993 plan was controversial: Cut spending, raise \ntaxes, income taxes on the wealthiest 1.5 percent in this country. Some \ntold the American people that all of their income taxes were going up. \nIt was not true. But they were able to confuse an awful lot of people, \nmake an awful lot of people believe that was what was happening.\n  The fact is income taxes went up on the top 1.5 percent, but others \nactually had their taxes cut because of the expansion of the earned \nincome tax credit. In fact, many more people had their taxes cut as a \nresult of the 1993 plan than had their income taxes increased. The news \nmedia never told that story. But that is a fact. Yes, we increased the \nincome taxes on the wealthiest 1.5 percent, but we also reduced taxes \nby expanding the earned income tax credit for more modest wage earners \nin this country, and millions of them received a tax reduction.\n  But this shows what has happened to both the spending and the revenue \nof the Federal Government since 1980. The blue line represents the \nspending of the Federal Government. The red line represents the \nreceipts, and these are all stated as a percentage of our national \nincome or, as sometimes said by the economists, our gross domestic \nproduct, because that is probably the most realistic way to look at the \ntrends in spending and revenue.\n\n  What you can see is that the spending, as a percent of our national \nincome, has come down; the revenue has come up. And it is that \ncombination--reduced spending, increased revenues--that has allowed us \nto achieve unified balance. And it is that unified balance that has \ntaken the pressure off interest rates, that has improved the economic \nclimate in this country, so that we now enjoy very healthy economic \ngrowth, low inflation, low unemployment, and all of the other benefits \nthat flow from a strong national economy.\n  This chart shows how we achieve a balanced unified budget. Looking \nback to 1992, looking at the savings from the 1993 deficit-reduction \npackage that I have previously referenced, and looking at the \nadditional savings that will be achieved as a result of the 1997 \nbipartisan budget deal--I think it is very important that we be direct \nwith everybody.\n  In 1993, the Democrats did the heavy lifting. In 1993, there was not \na single Republican vote for the budget plan that year--a 5-year \neconomic plan to get us back on track. And we understood it was \ncontroversial. We did cut spending. We did raise income taxes on the \nwealthiest 1 percent. And the Republicans all voted no. Again, I think \nthey were simply wrong. They were wrong in their anticipation of what \nit would mean to this economy. But in 1997, we had a bipartisan budget \ndeal. That made further progress at getting our fiscal house in order.\n  Now, I prepared this chart to show the relative size of the two \nplans. The 1993 budget package had $2.5 trillion of savings between \n1992 and 2002, that 10-year timeframe. The 1993 budget package will \naccount for $2.5 trillion of the savings.\n  The 1997 bipartisan budget deal, between 1997 and 2002, will account \nfor $600 billion of budget savings. So there is no question in terms of \nthe 10-year period, part of that is attributed to the bipartisan budget \ndeal of 1997, $600 billion. But most of it can be attributed to the \n1993 package--$2.5 trillion of savings.\n  As I have indicated, Federal spending has been declining under the \nbudget agreement of 1993 and the follow-on bipartisan budget agreement \nin 1997. And if we look at Federal spending as a percentage of gross \ndomestic product for national income, we can see in 1992 the Federal \nGovernment was spending 22.5 percent of our national income. In each \nand every year under the budget plan that was passed by Democrats in \n1993 and the follow-on plan that was a bipartisan plan in 1997, Federal \nspending has been coming down as a percentage of our national income.\n  In 1993, it was down to 21.8 percent; in 1994, 21.4 percent; in 1995, \n21.1 percent; in 1996, down under 21 percent to 20.7 percent; in 1997, \n20.1 percent. In 1998 we are now anticipating Federal spending will be \ndown to 20 percent of our national income--a dramatic improvement under \nthe budget plan first passed in 1993, the 5-year plan passed by the \nDemocrats, and the follow-on bipartisan budget plan passed last year.\n  The result has been a dramatic improvement in the economic health of \nthis country. Economic performance has been sustained, it has been \nstrong, and it has produced the third largest postwar expansion in our \nhistory. You can see from 1961 to 1969, we had 106 months of economic \nexpansion. From 1982 to 1990, we had 92 months of economic expansion. \nFrom 1991 to now, 84 months of economic expansion.\n  The economy has grown at a very healthy rate. This chart shows the \nreal growth of our gross domestic product, and the growth in 1997 was \nthe best in a decade. The central, underlying reason is the budget plan \npassed in 1993 that led to the deficit reduction, that allowed interest \nrates to come down, that made this economy much more competitive, much \nstronger, put us in a position to be the most competitive nation in the \nworld.\n  Mr. President, I think this record is now becoming very clear. \nDeficit reduction, fueled by the 1993 budget plan, has led to reduced \ninterest rates, stronger economic growth, and that has meant many \npositive things for the U.S. economy.\n  The first, perhaps most important, is job growth. We have now seen 15 \nmillion jobs created since the Clinton administration came into office. \nThat is the first 61 months. We compare that to the first 61 months of \nthe Reagan administration. We can see during that period about half as \nmany jobs were created--about 7.7 million. And that is why we see such \nstrong economic performance across the country.\n  Well, it is not just job growth where we have seen dramatic results \nof getting our fiscal house in order. In other areas of the economy, we \nhave also seen a dramatic improvement. This chart shows what has \nhappened to investment in business equipment.\n  One of the real strengths of the national economy, one of the reasons \nthe United States is performing so well in competition with others \naround the world is because our economy is improving its productivity. \nOne of the reasons we are improving our productivity is because of the \ncomputerization of our businesses. One of the key investments they make \nis in business equipment. That has been growing at an 11 percent annual \nrate for 4 years.\n  You can see, going back to 1985, we were going along at between $300 \nand $400 billion, in 1992 dollars, of business equipment investment. \nOnce we got that 1993 budget plan in place, business investment took \noff, and we are now approaching $700 billion a year in business \ninvestment in this economy. It is one of the key reasons this economy \nis performing so well.\n  Again, it is not just business investment that shows the power of the \neconomic plan that was put in place in 1993 and the follow-on \nbipartisan plan of last year. We can see in unemployment--here is what \nhas happened with unemployment, looking back to 1991. Our unemployment \nrate is now the lowest since 1973. In over 24 years, we have the lowest \nlevel of unemployment in this country.\n  In my home State of North Dakota, we now see an unemployment rate of \nunder 2 percent. The economists said that was not possible. The \neconomists said full employment was an unemployment rate of 3 percent \nbecause of people changing jobs in the economy and other structural \nfactors. But in my State of North Dakota, we have now an unemployment \nrate of less than 2 percent, and, of course, nationally, the lowest \nlevel since 1973.\n  There is not only good news on the unemployment front, there is also \ngood news on the inflation front. And generally those two do not go \ntogether. Generally, if you have good news on unemployment, you have \nbad news on inflation. That is not the case with this economy. The \ninflation rate is showing its best sustained performance since 1967--\nthe best rate in over 31 years--and that inflation performance is \nanticipated to continue.\n  So inflation is under control, with low levels of unemployment, high \nlevels of business investment, and the\n\n[[Page S2735]]\n\nbudget deficit eliminated on a unified basis, and moving towards \npreserving the Social Security surpluses by preserving the budget \nsurpluses.\n  We have heard a lot of talk from some: ``Well, but you raised taxes \nin 1993. You raised income taxes on the wealthiest 1.5 percent.'' Yes, \nthat is true, because that was important to balancing the budget, to \ngetting these deficits behind us, to putting this country on a firmer \neconomic footing. We also cut spending. And it is that combination that \nhas made possible the deficit reduction we enjoy today.\n  But it has also translated into tax relief for many of the people in \nthis country because, as I indicated before, while we have raised \nincome taxes on the top 1.5 percent, we also cut income taxes for \nmillions of Americans through expansion of the earned income tax \ncredits. In fact, as this chart shows, the tax burden is declining for \na family of four. When you look at the payroll taxes they pay and the \nincome taxes they pay, if you take those with a family income of \n$27,450 or less, you see they have had their tax burden reduced.\n  In 1984, they were paying over 13 percent of their income in income \ntaxes and payroll taxes. That has been reduced for 1999, under the \nbudget plan we are offering, to 6.5 percent--a 50 percent reduction in \nthe effective tax rate on payroll taxes and income taxes for a family \nof four earning $27,000, in 1999 dollars.\n  Now, some of our friends on the Republican side say, ``Well, the \nDemocrats just want to spend money.'' And there are places that \nDemocrats believe we ought to spend some more money. We have the \nagreement from Republicans that we ought to spend more money on \nhighways in this country. We also think more money ought to be spent on \neducation.\n  We think we ought to do something about the crumbling schools. We \nthink we ought to do something to reduce class sizes, to add 100,000 \nteachers in this country just as we added 100,000 police in the crime \nbill in 1993 that has had such a remarkable effect in reducing the \ncrime rate in the Nation over the last 5 years. Each and every year, \nthe crime rate has come down once we put 100,000--the authorization, at \nleast, for 100,000 additional police on the streets and took tough \nmeasures to strengthen the crime laws of this country. We also believe \nwe ought to provide 100,000 additional teachers across America to \nimprove the educational performance of our kids.\n  So there are places that where think additional funds should be \nspent. The truth is, if you look at the next year or next 5 years in \nterms of spending, there is very little difference between the \nRepublican plan and the Democratic plan--very little difference.\n  This shows, in the 1999 budget, the red is the Republican spending \nplan, the blue is the Democratic spending plan. You will notice there \nis very little difference, indeed, hardly any. There is about a $12 \nbillion difference between the Republican plan and the Democratic plan, \nout of a $1.7 trillion budget. In fact, the Republicans' spending plan \nis for $1.73 trillion for 1999; the Democratic plan is for $1.74 \ntrillion.\n  The difference is, Democrats believe we ought to put some more money \ninto education. We believe we ought to put some more money into child \ncare, because the vast majority of parents are both working and they \ntell us, we need some help; we are under enormous pressure.\n  I just had a neighbor of mine come and tell me he is spending \n$17,000, he and his wife, this year--$17,000--for child care. Now, he \nis probably relatively highly paid, a hard-working guy. Both he and his \nwife work, have two kids. They are paying $17,000 for child care.\n  All across the country, parents are coming to us and saying, ``Look, \nthis is a part of our expenses that we really need some assistance on. \nCan't there be some tax relief for child care expenses that is above \nwhat we currently are provided?''\n  The Democratic response has been, yes, we have made dramatic progress \non getting our fiscal house in order. We are preserving the budget \nsurpluses until we get Social Security secured for the long term. But \nwe have some additional revenue because of the proposed tobacco \nsettlement, and we could use some of that money for smoking-related \nmatters, health research, smoking prevention, smoking cessation, but we \ncould also use some of it to strengthen child care in this country. We \ncould use some of it to improve education in this country.\n\n  So the Democrats say, yes, we will take a little bit of that money \nand use it for those purposes. For the 5-year spending plan, from 1999 \nto 2003, the Republican spending plan is in red --that is $9.16 \ntrillion; the Democratic plan is in blue, $9.24 trillion. A little bit \nmore money, $80 million more over 5 years in the Democratic plan as \ncontrasted with the Republican plan.\n  Again, why the difference? Because we believe we ought to invest a \nlittle more money in education. Yes, we believe we ought to invest a \nlittle more money in child care because working parents all across \nAmerica tell us that is a priority for them. And yes, we ought to use a \nlittle of that money for increasing the investment in highway funds, a \npriority that our Republican friends on an overwhelming basis have \nagreed with us on.\n  There are other areas of disagreement and perhaps the big area of \ndisagreement is on the question of providing for the use of the tobacco \nfunds. In the budget resolution, the Republicans say all of the money \nthat comes from a possible settlement of tobacco, all of that ought to \ngo to Medicare. Democrats disagree. Democrats say some of the money \nought to go to Medicare, absolutely, that is appropriate. Some of the \nmoney, we believe, ought to be used to strengthen Social Security. The \nRepublicans say no, not a dime should be used to strengthen Social \nSecurity. We disagree with that. We also believe some of the money \nought to be used to fund smoking cessation and smoking prevention and \ncounter tobacco advertising, and have health research, and improve the \nfunding for the National Institutes of Health. The Republicans say no, \nnone of the money, none of it, not a dime, from the tobacco settlement \nshould go for those purposes; all of it, every penny, should go for \nMedicare. We just disagree. We don't think that is the appropriate set \nof priorities.\n  Obviously, Medicare is important. No question about that. Democrats \nare the ones who helped pass it, the ones who helped preserve it, the \nones who helped protect it. But we also recognize there are other \ncritically important priorities from a windfall that might come from a \ntobacco settlement--shouldn't spend it all; some of it should be saved. \nThat is why we say some of it should be used to strengthen Social \nSecurity. Yes, some of it should be for Medicare. We also recognize \nthat if we are really going to be protecting Medicare, then we have to \ntake steps to keep young kids from getting hooked and addicted to \ntobacco, because 90 percent of those who are smokers started before age \n19; nearly half started before they were age 14. And the addiction of \nkids puts a later burden on Medicare and Medicaid and veterans' \nprograms because of that addiction.\n  We think an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. The \nRepublicans just want to deal with it at the final result stage. They \njust want to deal with it once the people are addicted and diseased. We \nsay let's prevent addiction and disease. Let's spend some of that money \non smoking prevention, smoking cessation, counter tobacco advertising, \nso that we really prevent people from getting in those situations.\n  The fact is the Republican plan in terms of revenue that might come \nfrom the tobacco settlement puts all the money into Medicare, none to \nthese other purposes. They say to us, ``We are funding some of those \ntobacco control efforts other places in the budget.'' That is their \nanswer. The problem with that answer, if you look at numbers what, is \nthat what they have put elsewhere in the budget is nowhere adequate to \nmeeting the need; it doesn't take care of the problem.\n  We have had all the health experts come in and they have told us you \nneed to be spending about $2 billion a year on tobacco control, smoking \ncessation, smoking prevention, counter tobacco advertising. \nInterestingly enough, every comprehensive bill introduced on this floor \nby Republicans or Democrats adopts a spending pattern on tobacco \ncontrol efforts of about that magnitude, about $2 billion a year--some \nmuch more, some are as much as $4 billion a year. The proposed \nsettlement itself contains $11.3 billion for these\n\n[[Page S2736]]\n\npurposes. The Republican budget over this next 5-year period provides \n$600 million, about \\1/20\\th of what the experts say is necessary in \norder to really accomplish the goals of reducing teen smoking and of \nprotecting the public health.\n\n  The budget resolution that Republicans have offered also ignores FDA \nfunding for tobacco. In all of the bills that are out there--\nRepublicans and Democrats--every comprehensive tobacco bill that has \nbeen offered says we ought to expand FDA authority to control this drug \nlike they were given authority and responsibility to control every \nother drug in our society. Obviously, there is a cost to that. The \nproposed settlement says that cost is $1.5 billion over 5 years. The \nRepublicans haven't given a dime for that purpose. It really makes you \nwonder if our friends on the other side of the aisle are at all serious \nabout accomplishing the goals for the reduction of teen smoking and \nprotecting our citizens from addiction, disease, and death caused by \nthis industry.\n  These are the matters that will be central to this debate as we go \nforward. It is important to define differences between us because those \ndifferences are real and we have seen the difference they have made \nover the last 5 years. We believe the record has proved the Democrats \nwere right when they cast a courageous vote in 1993 to really get our \nfiscal house in order. The results are undeniable. They are just as \nclear as they can be: deficit reduction, strong economic growth, the \nbest performance on inflation and unemployment in nearly a quarter of a \ncentury. That is the record. It is a powerful one. It is one of which \nwe are proud.\n  Now the question is, what do we do going forward? The Democratic \nanswer is we have to maintain fiscal discipline. Yes, we have to \nachieve that unified balance in our budget, but we have to go further \nand preserve budget surpluses until we have secured the future of \nSocial Security. As the President said to us, ``Save Social Security \nfirst.'' The Democrats agree to that position.\n  In addition, we believe with the windfall that may be anticipated as \na result of any tobacco agreement, we ought to use some of that funding \nto accomplish the goals of protecting the public health, reducing teen \nsmoking, and also we ought to put some of it toward strengthening \nSocial Security, we ought to use some of it for preserving Medicare, \nand yes, we ought to improve health research in this country and \nchildren's health care. Those are things that the American people think \nare important, and we agree. No higher priority can be attached to \nanything than improving the education of the children of our country. \nThat is something we simply must do.\n  If we are going to preserve the competitive position of the United \nStates, we must have the best educated work force in the world. That is \none reason we are doing well. If we are going to continue to do well, \nwe must make certain that educational excellence is at the top of our \npriority list.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Senator \nfrom Alabama, Senator Sessions, will be here momentarily for the \npurpose of offering the first substantive amendment to be considered. \nIn light of that, perhaps we could enter into a unanimous consent \nagreement. I ask unanimous consent that after the Senator from Alabama \noffers and discusses his amendment, we then allow the other Senator \nfrom North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, to seek recognition and be \nrecognized following the Senator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent Philippe Ardanaz, an American \nAssociation of Political Science fellow with the Budget Committee, be \ngranted floor privileges during consideration of the budget resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield 20 minutes to the Senator from Alabama for the \npurpose of introducing an amendment and speaking to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2166\n\n(Purpose: Expressing the sense of Congress that the Federal Government \n  should acknowledge the importance of at-home parents and should not \ndiscriminate against families who forego a second income in order for a \n          mother or father to be at home with their children)\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions], for himself and \n     Mr. Enzi, proposes an amendment numbered 2166.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Congress finds that--\n       (1) studies have found that quality child care, \n     particularly for infants and young children, requires a \n     sensitive, interactive, loving, and consistent caregiver;\n       (2) as most parents meet and exceed the criteria described \n     in paragraph (1), circumstances allowing, parental care is \n     the best form of child care;\n       (3) a recent National Institute for Child Health and \n     Development study found that the greatest factor in the \n     development of a young child is ``what is happening at home \n     and in families'';\n       (4) as a child's interaction with his or her parents has \n     the most significant impact on the development of the child, \n     any Federal child care policy should enable and encourage \n     parents to spend more time with their children;\n       (5) nearly \\1/2\\ of preschool children have at-home mothers \n     and only \\1/3\\ of preschool children have mothers who are \n     employed full time;\n       (6) a large number of low- and middle-income families \n     sacrifice a second full-time income so that a mother may be \n     at home with her child;\n       (7) the average income of 2-parent families with a single \n     income is $20,000 less than the average income of 2-parent \n     families with 2 incomes;\n       (8) only 30 percent of preschool children are in families \n     with paid child care and the remaining 70 percent of \n     preschool children are in families that do not pay for child \n     care, many of which are low- to middle-income families \n     struggling to provide child care at home;\n       (9) child care proposals should not provide financial \n     assistance solely to the 30 percent of families that pay for \n     child care and should not discriminate against families in \n     which children are cared for by an at-home parent; and\n       (10) any congressional proposal that increases child care \n     funding should provide financial relief to families that \n     sacrifice an entire income in order that a mother or father \n     may be at home for a young child.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the functional totals in this concurrent resolution on the \n     budget assume that--\n       (1) many families in the United States make enormous \n     sacrifices to forego a second income in order to have a \n     parent care for a child at home;\n       (2) there should be no bias against at-home parents;\n       (3) parents choose many different forms of child care to \n     meet the needs of their families, such as child care provided \n     by an at-home parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle, neighbor, \n     nanny, preschool, or child care center;\n       (4) any quality child care proposal should include, as a \n     key component, financial relief for those families where \n     there is an at-home parent; and\n       (5) mothers and fathers who have chosen and continue to \n     choose to be at home should be applauded for their efforts.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I think the issue before the Senate as \nwe debate the budget resolution is how to set our priorities as a \nnation. Where do we want to spend our resources? Are we expending our \nresources in ways that strengthen our American Republic and the people \nwho make it up? Are we using resources in a way that will strengthen \nfamilies? And are we using resources in a way that undermine families \nor at least undermine the freedom of families to make choices they \nbelieve are important in their lives?\n  I have just introduced an amendment which expresses the sense of \nCongress\n\n[[Page S2737]]\n\nthat the Federal Government should acknowledge the importance of stay-\nat-home parents and should not discriminate against families who decide \nto forego a second income in order for a mother or father to be at home \nwith their children. The resolution is nearly identical to the House \nresolution sponsored by Representative Bill Goodling, chairman of the \nEducation and Work Force Committee, which passed the House of \nRepresentatives on February 11 by a vote of 409-0.\n  President Clinton has proposed spending $21.7 billion over the next 5 \nyears in new Federal child care programs. Although the money the \nPresident is proposing to spend will benefit parents who use business \nand institutional day-care providers, it will not assist the single \nlargest provider of child care in this country, at-home parents. The \nPresident's plan does provide us with an opportunity to think seriously \nabout this subject and see if we can provide a better way to help \nparents raise their children.\n  I believe this resolution is critically important. It provides this \nbody with an opportunity to discuss and debate our Nation's focus on \nthe issue of child care: Should our Government continue to promote and \nfund child care programs designed to give middle-class parents who hire \nothers to care for their children tax cuts or other benefits while at \nthe same time denying relief to parents who make sacrifices so that one \nparent can remain at home to care for their young children?\n  It seems unfair to me that we tax families who sacrifice outside \nearnings to ensure that one parent is home with their children while \nsubsidizing families in which both parents work. In fact, the \nstatistics show that when both parents work, they have a higher income. \nSo in fact we are taxing those with a lower income to subsidize \ndecisions of those with a higher income.\n  Studies show that most parents would prefer to work less and spend \nmore time with their children if they could afford to do so. By \nsubsidizing only nonparental care for our children, our Government is \npushing many families in a direction they do not wish to go. More \nparents are staying home. They are choosing to forgo extra income. \nThese private, personal, and family decisions are being reached on \nlong-term moral, religious, and educational considerations. Good \ndecisions by parents in these matters benefit our Nation, and they \nshould be affirmed by governmental policy, not undermined by \ngovernmental policy.\n  As I traveled my State over the last recess and talked with people \nraising this issue, people would come up to me after meetings, and they \nwould say: ``Jeff, we agree with you. We both used to work. Now only \none of us works. We prayed about it and we know we are going to have to \nget by with less money. But we decided this is the best for our \nfamily.''\n  I don't denigrate in any way families who choose for both parents to \nwork. I don't ask that we diminish support for the single parent who \nworks. I just say, Mr. President, it is time for this body to join the \nHouse and to send a message to America and a statement to the President \nand to the rest of this Government that we believe that those parents \nwho stay at home to raise their children ought to be affirmed also. \nThey also should receive benefits, and they ought not to be the chumps \nin this process. Because they are giving of themselves with great \nsacrifice to raise the next generation of Americans who will lead this \ncountry.\n  Make no mistake our economy is in great shape. This Nation is strong \nand vibrant economically. The one threat I see that could undermine \nthat strength is for us to undermine the values that we pass on to our \nchildren. That our work ethic is reduced, that our moral discipline and \nintegrity as a people is undermined. These qualities are strengthened \nwhen families can spend those formative years with their children in a \nclose relationship. Psychiatrists and psychologists refer to it as \n``bonding.'' During those first years, it is important for a parent and \na child to bond in order for that child to develop confidence and a \nsense of self-worth that can only be gained in many instances from that \nrelationship with their parents. We have many difficult societal \nproblems, and none are more important than developing properly the next \ngeneration of leaders.\n  I just say this, Mr. President: Our Nation can never rise higher than \nthe individual quality of the citizens who make it up. And what are \nthose qualities that make us a great people? It goes beyond mere \neducation. It goes beyond how much money we make or how smart we are. \nIt really depends on a willingness to cooperate, to work together, on \nwhether or not we have high ideals, whether or not our children are \nraised with hope and a vision for progress, whether or not they have \nintegrity, good discipline, a work ethic that will allow us to be \ncompetitive in the world. We need to strengthen our families as they \nendeavor to raise the next generation of leaders.\n  Now, Mr. President, last year, we passed a budget that wonderfully \nprovided a $500 per child tax credit to families in this country--one \nof the finest steps we have taken in many years to actually help \nfamilies. This allows them to keep money that they could spend as they \nwish. A family of three could, in effect, have $120 extra each month, \ntax free, not taxable, a tax credit that they could use for their \nchildren. This extra money may mean buying shoes, textbooks, or the \nextra money it takes to go to a movie or on a school trip. These \nfamilies are able to make their own decisions about spending. That was \na wonderful step in the right direction. It did not discriminate \nagainst those families who work or those who choose not to have both \nparents work. It was an equal, across-the-board benefit, something that \nwas good. I think now we need to make this additional statement by this \nbody: That we expect in the future to treat all parents equally. The \namendment makes a number of points, Mr. President, and I will share \nthose briefly. I don't know what my time is, but I don't want to go \nover.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11 minutes remaining on the \ntime requested.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. All right. Mr. President, the resolution notes a number \nof things. It notes that, whereas ``a recent National Institute for \nChild Health and Development study found that the greatest factor in \nthe development of a young child is `what is happening at home and in \nfamilies.' ''\n  That is something all of us have known instinctively, and we believe \nthat our public policy has not affirmed that effectively. Our \nresolution would move us in the right direction.\n  It goes on to note: Whereas,\n\n       as a child's interaction with his or her parents has the \n     most significant impact on the development of the child, any \n     Federal child care policy should enable and encourage parents \n     to spend more time with their children;\n       nearly \\1/2\\ of preschool children have at-home mothers and \n     only \\1/3\\ of preschool children have mothers who are \n     employed full time;\n       a large number of low- and middle-income families sacrifice \n     a second full-time income [by their own decision] so that a \n     mother may be at home with her child;\n       the average income of 2-parent families with a single \n     income is $20,000 less than the average income of 2-parent \n     families with 2 incomes;\n       only 30 percent of preschool children are in families with \n     paid child care and the remaining 70 percent of preschool \n     children are in families that do not pay for child care, many \n     of which are low- to middle-income families struggling to \n     provide child care at home;\n       child care proposals should not provide financial \n     assistance solely to the 30 percent of families that pay for \n     child care and should not discriminate against families in \n     which children are cared for by an at-home parent;\n       any congressional proposal that increases child care \n     funding should provide financial relief to families that \n     sacrifice an entire income in order that a mother or father \n     may be at home with a young child.\n\n  Therefore, it be resolved that the Congress of this United States \nrecognizes that:\n\n       many families in the United States make enormous sacrifices \n     to forego a second income in order to have a parent care for \n     a child at home;\n       there should be no bias against at-home parents;\n       parents choose many different forms of child care to meet \n     the needs of their families, such as child care provided by \n     an at-home parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle, parent, \n     neighbor, nanny, preschool, or child care center;\n       any quality child care proposal should include, as a key \n     component, financial relief for those families where there is \n     an at-home parent; and\n       mothers and fathers who have chosen and continue to choose \n     to be at home [with their children] should be applauded for \n     their efforts.\n\n  Mr. President, the purpose of this resolution is not to suggest that \nwe do\n\n[[Page S2738]]\n\nnot need more relief for families. We need relief for families where \nboth parents work or where the only parent works. They need relief. But \nwe ought not to discriminate and be biased against those parents who \nsacrificially choose to spend the time they believe is necessary for \ntheir child to develop emotionally, morally, religiously, and \nethically.\n  That is a good thing for America. It is a good thing when parents can \nand are willing to spend their time with their children. Public policy \nshould affirm that choice, just as it affirms other choices that \nparents make or feel compelled to make. I would suggest that this is a \nmatter we ought to support aggressively. I believe it is a matter that \nwill help set the tone for our budget process as we go forward. It will \nsend a signal to those on the committees who will be considering \nlegislation to see what we can do to strengthen our ability to care for \nchildren, and I believe this resolution to be quite significant and \nrepresentative of a marked change in the direction that we have \nfollowed before.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Dodd be added as \na cosponsor to this amendment. He called our office before I had a \nchance to add his name to the sponsors of this resolution, among whom \nare Senators Lott, Shelby, Enzi, Faircloth, Helms, Nickles, Grams, \nMcConnell, Lieberman, Brownback, Inhofe, Craig, Hutchison, Frist, \nCoverdell, Ashcroft, Abraham, Mack, DeWine, and Coats, and others are \nbeing added as we go along.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator wish to add those names as \ncosponsors?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The names I read, except for Senator Dodd, have already \nbeen listed as sponsors on the legislation.\n  I ask that Senator Dodd and Senator Domenici be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator will yield for a question.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask the Senator if he would allow my name to be added \nalso as a cosponsor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would be honored to have that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that my name be added as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous \nconsent that the occupant of the Chair, Senator Roberts, be added as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you. Mr. President, I think, indeed, we are \ndealing with an important issue. I know the Chair himself, along with \nother Senators, has introduced legislation that would, in effect, \naccomplish many of the things that are called for in this amendment. I \nsalute you for your concern for children and your work in that regard. \nI think it is time for us to make sure that we establish a policy in \nthis body that treats parents equally who sacrifice for their children. \nI think this amendment makes that point, and I am proud to offer it.\n  Mr. President, I believe we do have, by consent, 2 hours set aside \nfor debate on this amendment. At this time, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the remainder of that time be reserved. I would like to speak on \nit some more, and other Senators have advised me that they would be \nspeaking on this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The time \nis reserved.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, under the previously agreed-to unanimous \nconsent agreement, I believe that the Senator from North Dakota will be \nrecognized for up to 20 minutes, and I would like to seek unanimous \nconsent that following the statement of the Senator from North Dakota \nwe would then recognize the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg, for \nup to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator is correct. Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                           Budget Priorities\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I may not take the entire 20 minutes. But \nI thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, we are talking about the budget. This is a ritual that \noccurs here every year in the U.S. Senate. And the budget reflects our \npriorities. What do we think is important? What do we hold dear? What \ndo we think are the most important issues in this country?\n  I have said before that 100 years from now we will all be dead. None \nof us will be here. Historians will look at what this Congress felt was \nimportant, and find that out by evaluating what kind of a budget this \nCongress enacted. That will tell historians what Congress felt was \nimportant about the lives of the people who live in this country and \nwhat matters. What is the priority? That is what this budget debate is \nall about.\n  The Senator from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, spoke a bit ago about \nwhere we have been. I recall a few years ago, during a particularly \naggressive debate about the economy and fiscal policy, a colleague of \nmine standing on the floor of the Senate talking about how awful things \nare in America and how we really ought to be ashamed about what has \nhappened in the last 35 years in this country. I sat over here. I \nlistened to that. I thought, gosh, we must be living in different \nplaces.\n  I think this is a remarkable country. Yes; we have significant \nchallenges. But I look at the last 50 years as 50 years of significant \nadvancement in this country in a dozen different ways. Yet some see it \ndifferently.\n  We find ourselves in this country today living in a country with an \neconomy that is growing, more people working and fewer people \nunemployed. The inflation rate is down; the unemployment rate is down; \neconomic growth is up; the crime rate is down; and the welfare rolls \nare down. Things are moving in the right direction in this country. It \ndoesn't mean we don't have some challenges. But the fact is things are \nmoving in the right direction.\n  I suppose some have their own ideas about why this has happened, why \nis it that we have reached this intersection and why this country is \ndoing quite well.\n  Senator Conrad indicated that in 1993--at a time when our budget \ndeficits were growing year after year and a swollen budget deficit that \nwas getting worse, not better--that Congress was called upon by a new \nPresident to do something serious about fiscal policy and to send a \nmessage to the people of this country that times in the future will be \ndifferent, that Congress and a President would no longer sit around and \naccept increasing budget deficits. He proposed a plan that was \nenormously controversial. It passed by one vote here in the Senate and \none vote in the House of Representatives.\n  For anybody who asks if one vote matters, it does. In 1993, a plan \nthat was very controversial passed by one vote in both bodies. The \nresult was the American people finally understood that we were going to \nput this country on the right track on reducing the Federal budget \ndeficit and getting this country's fiscal policy under some kind of \ncontrol. Yes, that bill made the right investments in the future, but \nit cut a good deal of spending, and yes, it did increase certain taxes, \nin most cases only for the wealthiest Americans. But it did. And that \nis what made it so controversial. It was hard to vote for. Some of my \ncolleagues who voted for it are not here any longer. But it was the \nright thing to do, and it put this country on the right track. We find \nourselves in a country where things are better.\n\n  Now the question is, What should this budget provide? What is \nimportant now for the future--education, health care, safe food, a \nclean environment, safe workplaces, jobs? What represents the priority \nof those of us serving now today? Are we trying to move forward, or are \nwe holding back?\n  Let me just again remind people that we have always had in the \nCongress folks who have their dander up, saying, ``Don't go there. \nDon't do that. It won't work.'' We had that with Social Security. We \nhad it with Medicare. We had it with virtually everything that was \nintended to be done to make this a better country. When we decided to \nstop employing children in this country--let\n\n[[Page S2739]]\n\nus stop having 12-years-olds work 12 hours a day in the mines--we will \nhave child labor laws, we had people who said, ``Don't do that. It will \nruin the economy.'' When we decided we were going to have a minimum \nwage law, we had people saying, ``Don't do that. It will ruin the \nAmerican economy.'' When we decided to have Social Security, we had \npeople who said, ``Don't do that. It is socialism.'' When we said let \nus have a Medicare program because half the senior citizens in the \ncountry can't afford health care, people said, ``Don't do that. It will \nruin this country.''\n  This country has been strengthened by a lot of good ideas that have \nmade this a better place. Yes. Social Security. Yes. Medicare. Yes. \nFood safety standards, clean air requirements, child labor law, minimum \nwages--a whole series of things that have made a better country. This \ncountry has a wonderful, wonderful history, and I think a better \nfuture.\n  We survived a civil war. We survived a depression. We won two world \nwars. We defeated Hitler. We cured polio. We put people on the Moon. We \ninvented the television, the computer, and the jet airplane. This is \nquite a remarkable country. There is nothing quite like it on Earth.\n  If you look at other developed nations around the world, their \neconomies have slowed down and are not doing well. Yet this country--\nthe biggest, most successful democracy in the world, truly a country \nwith significant economic might--is on the move again, on the march \nagain, and doing much, much better.\n  So what do we have to do now, in order to keep our country moving \nforward? We need to face several big challenges: Medicare and Social \nSecurity. Before I talk about the priorities in the budget, let me talk \nabout Medicare and Social Security. Those are the two big entitlements \nthat we have to deal with. Even though we have dealt with most of the \nfiscal policy problems, we have a demographic problem in the future \nwith Medicare and Social Security. I want to make one point about that.\n  The problems in Medicare and Social Security are born of success. We \ncould solve Medicare and Social Security instantly if we simply go back \nto the same life expectancy that we had 30 or 60 years ago. Those who \ncreated the Social Security program created a program that said, by the \nway, you are expected to live, on average, to be 63 years of age and we \nwill pay a retirement benefit after 65. I went to a small school. But I \nunderstand that adds up pretty well. If you are paying benefits at 65 \nyears and people are living on average 63 years, that works out pretty \nwell.\n  But from the turn of the century, when we were expected to live to \nage 48 in this country, to now, when you are expected to live to age \n77, nearly 78 years of age, we have increased life expectancy in this \ncountry by nearly three decades. Does that put some strain on Social \nSecurity and Medicare? Yes; it does. But, again, it is born of success. \nJust ratchet back life expectancy 30 years and you will solve the \nfinancing problem for Social Security and Medicare.\n  So we ought not shirk from these challenges. These are not difficult \nchallenges. We can solve the demographic problems confronting Social \nSecurity and Medicare. But let us remember that the reason these \nproblems exist is because we have had significant success in this \ncountry. People are living longer, better, and healthier lives. That is \nwhat is causing the problems in these areas.\n\n  Let me just for a moment talk about the priorities in the budget. \nSenator Conrad talked about several of them. I want to focus on a \ncouple.\n  Tobacco: Senator Conrad has done a lot of work on the tobacco issue \nas the chairman of the task force here in our caucus. This budget \nresolution indicates that all of the revenue that will come from a \ntobacco settlement must be used exclusively to adjust the balances of \nthe Medicare trust fund. In other words, it explicitly says no money \nfrom any tobacco settlement can be used for the central goal of the \ntobacco legislation, and that is, preventing people from starting to \nsmoke in the first place, protecting young people in this country from \nthe dangers of smoking.\n  Almost no one reaches 25 or 30 years of age and wonders what they can \ndo to further enrich their lives and come up with the idea they ought \nto start smoking. Nobody does that because at that age they understand \nsmoking can kill you. Cancer, heart diseases, and other illnesses \npersuade people who know the facts not to start smoking. The only \nfuture customers who exist for tobacco are kids. The targeted \ncapability to try to addict our kids is something we are trying to \nattack in tobacco legislation.\n  The use of the funds from the tobacco settlement must be, it seems to \nme, used for anti-smoking education initiatives all across this \ncountry, for smoking cessation programs, for those who are addicted, \nfor FDA tobacco-control activities, to counter tobacco advertising, and \na range of other ways. But none of them are capable of being funded in \nthis budget. None of them.\n  It doesn't make any sense at all to write handcuffs into this budget \nresolution that stop us from using the proceeds of the tobacco \nsettlement to do the very things that we are having the tobacco \nsettlement for in the first place, and that is to try to address the \nissue of teen smoking and to stop cigarette companies from addicting \nteens. Yet none of it is possible in this budget agreement. That cannot \nstand. We must have amendments and will have amendments on that issue.\n  Second, education: We have had a number of people here in the U.S. \nCongress who forever have said, ``Let's just say no on education'' when \nit comes to the U.S. Congress. I understand and respect the fact that \nmost of elementary and secondary education funding comes from State and \nlocal governments. It is that way and ever should be that way. Yet we \nin the Congress have developed some niche financing and some assistance \nin certain areas that help invest in education and make our schools \nbetter.\n  President Clinton has made some proposals dealing with education that \nare very, very important proposals that will not be funded in this \nbudget. The proposal dealing with repairing America's schools is a very \nimportant proposal.\n  We have thousands of schools in this country that are 50 years old, \nor 60 years old, or 80 years old. They are coming apart at the seams. \nWe send our children there. In the morning we tell our children good-\nbye. We kiss them good-bye and send them to school. We in this country \ndon't want our kids to go to unsafe schools or go to schools that are \nin disrepair. None of us want, as parents, to do that.\n  I have two young children in public school. The taxes I pay to \nsupport their education are something that I am enormously proud of. I \nwant those children, and all American children, to be the best educated \nchildren that they can possibly be. I want them to be able to say, ``I \nwent to the best schools in the world.'' That is what I want our public \neducation system to be in this country. Yet, this budget says no to \nthose education initiatives. It says we can't do anything about trying \nto stimulate the repair of crumbling schools by providing just a basic \nincentive from the Federal level to State and local school districts \nand others who would be able to put up the money at reduced interest \ncharges to repair crumbling schools. This budget says we can't do that. \nIt just says no to fixing crumbling schools.\n\n  Or, the question of class size. My daughter last year was in public \nschool in a class of 30 students. Does anybody believe that it doesn't \nmatter if your kid is in a class with 35 students or 30 students versus \n15 students or 18 students? We know better than that. All of us know \nbetter than that. We all know that smaller class sizes mean better \neducation, particularly more teacher time for each student. President \nClinton talks about funding 100,000 new teachers, to try to reduce \nclass sizes in this country. He is proposing after-school programs for \nschool-age children who don't have any place to go after school because \nboth parents are working. For all of these initiatives, the response is \nthe response that we have had for 50 years from some of the same \nvoices. ``Just say no to these issues. It is not the Federal \nGovernment's job.'' Gosh, if we had relied on that advice we wouldn't \nhave done much of anything that has made this a better country. A fair \namount of what we have done in terms of public\n\n[[Page S2740]]\n\ninvestment has made this country a much, much better place in which to \nwork and to live.\n  When President Clinton proposes smaller class sizes with qualified \nteachers, he is talking about an initiative of over 7 years to help \nlocal schools provide small classes by hiring more teachers in the \nearly grades. When he talks about modern school buildings, he is \ntalking about Federal tax credits to pay interest on $22 billion in \nbonds to build and renovate public schools in this country.\n  But this budget that came out of the Budget Committee falls far short \non these issues. The suggestion is, Well, this isn't a priority. This \ndoesn't rank with other priorities. I disagree with that. And we have \nroom, obviously, to disagree on these issues.\n\n  But if one doesn't believe that education is the first priority in \nthis country--that our future is our children and the education of our \nchildren will determine what kind of country we have in the future, how \nwe compete in the global economy, whether this country grows--if we \ndon't believe that, we are not going to do well in the future. We must \ndo as those who came before us have done and say that education is a \npriority. It represents the first priority for this country.\n  There is another little part of this budget we are considering that I \nfind highly troubling, and I know at first blush it will be very, very \ninteresting to some people. It is a piece that says let us sunset the \nTax Code. In other words, it is saying that the Congress should sunset \nand get rid of the existing income tax system we have in this country. \nIt includes a sense of the Senate provision providing for repealing the \nentire Internal Revenue Code at the end of 2001. Notice that it doesn't \nsay what they would replace it with. It just says repeal the Tax Code.\n  Well, what that says to somebody who just bought a home yesterday or \nis considering buying a home tomorrow or next month or did 6 months \nago, it says, ``By the way, don't count on your interest deduction on \nyour mortgage being deductible, because there may not be a tax system \nthat allows you to deduct interest on your mortgage.'' Can you imagine \nthat coming from this Congress?--this Congress saying, ``Don't count on \nthat?''\n  By the way, are you contributing to an IRA? This budget says, ``Don't \ncount on that being treated as it is now for tax purposes.'' Are you \nmaking a charitable contribution? ``Don't count on that being \ndeductible.'' Are you a business person about to make an investment, or \na business about to make an acquisition of another company, and it \nhinges on the question of, How will this be handled from the Tax Code \nstandpoint?'' What this says is, ``Don't count on it. Don't count on \nthis Tax Code, because we have other ideas.''\n  We have billionaires walking around saying, ``We want a flat tax.'' \nOnly in Washington, DC, would it be a new idea to hear a billionaire \ntalking about a flat tax plan that cuts his own taxes. Only here could \nsomeone call that a stroke of genius. Flat tax, VAT tax, sales tax--\nthese are the alternatives that are being proposed to the current \nsystem. What is behind this proposal to abolish the current Tax Code at \n2001 without providing for an alternative? The stimulus behind this is \nthat some people want to create a national sales tax, a national VAT \ntax, or some sort of national flat tax, all of which will cut taxes for \nthe wealthiest Americans and increase taxes for working Americans.\n  Let me say that again, because it is important. This budget bill does \nnot tell us what people have in mind as a replacement for the current \nsystem, because the majority can't agree on that. But all the plans \nthat are being discussed to replace the current IRS Code--all of them \nwould essentially say we are going to tax work and we are going to \nexempt investment.\n  I ask people this: Why is the income from work any less worthy than \nthe income from investment? Why this romance with a plan that says, if \nyou are a worker, we tax you; if you are an investor, we don't? If you \nget your money by working all day and you are bone tired at night after \n10 hours going out working for a wage, trying to provide for your \nfamily, you pay a tax. But if you sit in a chair and clip your coupons \nand make your $10 million a year from interest and dividends, this \nCongress likes you so much that you don't have to pay any tax. It is \njust the work that is taxed, the investment is not. We will have an \namendment to strike this provision.\n  Get rid of the Tax Code? I don't particularly like the Tax Code. I \nthink we could substantially improve it, dramatically simplify it. But \nget rid of it and replace it with a plan that says the upper-income \npeople pay less taxes and lower- and middle-income people pay more \ntaxes? I don't know who came up with this approach, but I hope they are \nprepared to defend it on the floor in discussing this amendment that I \nwill offer at some point during the debate.\n\n  Mr. President, those are some of the difference I have with this \nbudget. But I don't want people to believe that there is nothing in \ncommon among Senators. There are things in the budget resolution to \nwhich we will all agree.\n  I just stood and asked the Senator who was introducing the child care \namendment to add my name as a cosponsor. He is a Republican; I am a \nDemocrat. I happen to think what he has said on the floor and what he \nhas written on that amendment make good sense. It is right to say to \nthose who need to find good child care, when both parents have to go \noff to work because they must make ends meet, and they have child care \nproblems--can we and should we help them? Yes, I think we could and we \nshould. Does it also imply that those who make sacrifices to have one \nspouse stay at home to take care of those children, should they have \nsome opportunity to see us reach out to try to provide some help to \nthem? Absolutely.\n  There are a number of things--this being just one example--where we \nagree on public policy issues. I have mentioned a few where we don't \nagree. Where we don't agree, from time to time we have significant \ndebate about that, and then we vote, and when the vote is over, we \ncount the votes. The winner is the one with the most votes. We \nunderstand that. My party here in this Chamber has fewer votes than the \nother party. Hopefully, a number of these amendments will not be party \nline votes. The child care issue, which I just mentioned, is a good \nexample of that.\n  I hope the first issue I mentioned will be another example. On \ntobacco, there is a big difference, I mean a huge difference. There are \nbillions of dollars coming from a tobacco settlement that the majority \nsays cannot be used under any circumstance to deal with teenage \naddiction. But the whole purpose of this settlement is to say to \ntobacco companies, ``We won't allow you to addict our kids anymore. It \nis wrong.'' And we want to use some of the money from a tobacco \nsettlement to fund smoking prevention, smoking cessation, addiction \ntreatment and other public health work to deal with smoking. But the \nmajority's budget says ``No, you can't do it.'' Well, this budget has \nto be changed, and we are going to have a big debate about that.\n  The last item I mentioned, the Tax Code, do we want a budget to go \nthrough the Congress that says: ``By the way, American people, we are \ngoing to sunset the Tax Code; we are going to get rid of the Tax Code \nat the end of 2001. So now, if you have your house, and you sit out \nthere and wonder whether you are going to be able to deduct the \ninterest on your mortgage? Just go ahead and wonder, because we are \ngoing to get rid of the Tax Code that allows to you do that and we are \nnot going to tell you what we are going to put in its place. We may put \na national sales tax in its place,'' they would say. ``We will not tell \nyou that yet, because we know that is controversial and we know how you \nwill react when you find out what a national sales tax would do.''\n  Well, we know what a national sales tax does because all the studies \nshow it. There is no dispute about it. We know it will cut taxes for \nupper-income folks and raise taxes on working people. But the majority \nsays, ``We are not going tell you what we are going to replace it with, \nbut all we are going to do is serve notice on you today that your home \nmortgage interest may not be deductible tomorrow or in 2001.'' So we \nare going to have an amendment on that. We need to change that \nprovision in this budget resolution.\n  Mr. President, I have used my time. There are several other items \nthat I\n\n[[Page S2741]]\n\nwill talk about later in this debate. I have mentioned a couple of \namendments I intend to offer. I thank Senator Conrad for giving me the \ntime on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized \nfor 20 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, a number of points have been made by the \nSenator from North Dakota. He always makes them well. Even when I \ndisagree with him, I enjoy listening to him.\n  Let me point out a few things that I want to talk about initially \nrelative to this budget that, if you were to listen to the other side, \nyou might not fully understand, because there appears to be an \nincomplete explanation.\n  For example, on the issue of education, the Senator from North Dakota \nused the term: ``The Federal Government has niches which it is \nresponsible for in the area of funding education.'' I think that is a \ngood term, ``niches.'' The Federal Government does not have \nresponsibility for the overall funding of elementary and secondary \nschool education. In fact, that has always been reserved to the local \ncommunity, and should be reserved to the local community. It should be \nparents and teachers who are empowered, controlling their schools by \ncontrolling their local dollars.\n  But yes, we do have some niches that we are interested in as the \nFederal Government. Probably the primary niche we are interested in is \ntaking care of the special-needs child. In fact, we have a law called \n94-142, otherwise known as IDEA, the purpose of which is to make sure \nthe special-needs children get adequate funding as they try to get \ndecent schooling. When this law was passed, the Federal Government said \nit would pay 40 percent of the cost. Regrettably, the Federal \nGovernment, as of 2 years ago, was only paying about 6 percent of the \ncost. But as a result of the leadership of people on our side of the \naisle, myself included, and Senator Lott and a number of other people--\nSenator Collins from Maine--we have aggressively pursued trying to \nincrease the funding for special education, and we have gotten it up to \nabout 9.5 percent of the local cost. But it still remains the single \nlargest unfunded mandate the Federal Government puts on local school \ndistricts and basically has the effect of saying to the local school \ndistrict: You must educate these children. The Federal Government said \nit will pay 40 percent. We are not going to pay our 40 percent. \nTherefore, you must use your local tax dollars to pay the Federal \nshare, and therefore you have very little flexibility in how you use \nyour local tax dollars, because the Federal Government is requiring you \nto use them to educate children to pay for costs which the Federal \nGovernment was supposed to pay for in the first place.\n  Well, the administration has been grotesquely lax in its fulfillment \nof this obligation also. When the Senator from North Dakota says the \nadministration has all these wonderful new education initiatives--they \nare going to go out and build schools and reduce class sizes, they are \ngoing to add proposals and programs for after-school education--what \nthey do not mention--what they do not mention--is the administration, \nthe White House, the President, and the Democratic Members of this \nCongress, in their own budget as proposed, failed to increase at all, \nfor all intents and purposes, funding for special-ed kids. They failed \nto even make a minor attempt to try to fulfill the obligation of the \nspecial-ed child, something that we are by law required to do.\n  So, yes, the Federal Government has niches in education. One of those \nprimary niches, which we have cited, by law, is that we will pay 40 \npercent of the cost of the special-needs child. We don't do it. The \nDemocratic Membership is unwilling to do it. The White House is \nunwilling to do it. Why? They want to take all kinds of new programs to \ntake care of new constituencies to generate new press releases. It is \nabout time they lived up to the obligation on the books. Our budget, \nthe Republican budget, does that. It moves one more time aggressively--\nin fact, outlines $2.5 billion of new spending for special education \nover the next 5 years--with a strong, firm commitment to try to get to \nthat 40 percent, something that is totally ignored on the other side.\n  So, when you wanted to talk education, the Republican budget lives up \nto the obligation of the Congress, the Federal Government, in the area \nof education. The Democratic proposals just put out press releases and \ntry to buy new constituencies and do nothing for the special-needs \nchild. Basically, they failed in that arena.\n  Now we go to the issue of the tobacco settlement, and that is what I \nwant to talk about primarily here today. The tobacco settlement is \nobviously a very complex and intricate piece of process. But there \nshould be some black-letter rules that guide us in this settlement. The \nSenator in the chair has been a leader on identifying one of these \nblack-letter rules, which is that attorneys should not get an \noutrageous amount of income out of these settlements. The billions of \ndollars in attorney's fees that are being awarded in Texas and Florida \nare just obscene, obscene. They are going out of the pockets of the \ntaxpayer into the attorneys' pockets, and they are not doing anything \nfor anybody. Clearly, there should be some action taken in that arena. \nThat should be a black-letter law addressing this issue, and I \ncongratulate the Senator in the chair for his leadership on that count.\n\n  Equally, we ought to recognize what the problems are that are created \nfor the Federal Government as a result of tobacco smoking. The single \nbiggest problem we have as a Federal Government as a result of tobacco \nsmoking from a health standpoint is that senior citizens are \ndisproportionately impacted by the health impacts of smoking all their \nlife, and that impact on senior citizens flows directly back to the \ncost being on the Federal Treasury in the Medicare system. So it is \nperfectly reasonable and appropriate and right, to the extent that the \nFederal Government receives revenues as a result of this tobacco \nsettlement, that those revenues should go to support the primary cost \nwhich the Federal Government incurs as a result of tobacco smoking in \nthis country, which is the cost to take care of our senior citizens.\n  I point out, the other side of the aisle suddenly has decided to \nspend this tobacco settlement money on all sorts of new initiatives for \na panoply of new constituencies and programs, the purpose of which \nappears to be once again to create press releases rather than create \nsubstantive progress. I point out to the other side, it was just a year \nago we saw from the other side such crocodile tears, it now appears--\nbecause they wouldn't be genuine tears or they would be supporting us \nin this matter--crocodile tears about their concern for the trust fund, \nMedicare trust fund, and how it was being raided, they alleged, by the \nRepublican side of the aisle.\n  We made a firm, unalterable commitment to Medicare. We recognize on \nour side that Medicare remains probably the single most difficult \nentitlement program, from the standpoint of fiscal solvency, that we \nhave on the books. Social Security is a tough one, but Medicare is even \ntougher. If we are going to address it effectively, we do need those \nrevenues from the tobacco settlement in order to make sure that our \nseniors have a legitimate health insurance program.\n  So this proposal that we have in this budget to put the money into \nMedicare is the most logical place that it should go. It should not go \nto some new program that the President announces. Every day, he seems \nto announce a new program on the basis of the tobacco settlement. There \nwas a week where I think literally every day of the week he announced a \nnew program.\n  Let's support the programs we have on the books, both in education \nand in health care.\n  The tobacco settlement raises other issues, issues that I am \nconcerned about. I read in the papers about the movement toward an \nagreement on the tobacco settlement. From my standpoint, I find the \nissue of immunity to be really the core issue of how this settlement \ncomes down. Of course, it is the issue of immunity which the tobacco \ncompanies are trying to buy as they try to settle this lawsuit--this \nsituation; it is not a lawsuit. It is a lawsuit in some areas but not a \nlawsuit at the Federal level. They are trying to buy immunity, and I \nhave a lot of problems with that, and I should think any thinking \nAmericans would have a lot of problems with that.\n\n[[Page S2742]]\n\n  Basically, what we would be doing if we give the tobacco companies \nimmunity--remember that we as a Congress have been unwilling to give \nproduct liability protection, not immunity, just plain little old \nprotection to company after company that functions across this country \nproducing legitimate products that make sense for the American people, \nthat they use regularly and that they need, whether it happens to be \nyour toaster oven, or whether it happens to be some gadget in your car, \nor whether it happens to be some other item--your computer screen. \nCompany after company which has sought product liability reform in this \nCongress has met with a stone wall. The only product liability we have \ngiven in this Congress over the last 10 years has been for the small \nplane producer, which was a very good decision, and it has worked great \nfor them.\n  For every other industry in this country, legitimate industries \nproducing legitimate products that are used daily by Americans and that \nbenefit Americans--benefit Americans--we have said no, absolutely no \nproduct liability protection.\n  Yet, the tobacco companies come to us--the producers of a product \nwhich, by its very nature, causes an addiction which it appears the \ntobacco companies knew caused an addiction, the purpose of which was to \nnot only addict Americans generally but specifically targeted at our \nkids to addict them to something that will kill them--when the tobacco \ncompanies come to us, we say, ``Oh, maybe we should give them \nimmunity.''\n  What great irony. What incredible irony. We won't give immunity to \nthe person who is making the toaster oven or the person who is making \nthe computer or the person who is maybe making the device that allows \nsomebody to live longer and live a better life, but we will give \nimmunity to companies which are producing a product the purpose of \nwhich is to kill people, addict people and specifically targeted on our \nkids. I just find it incredible--incredible--that we would be \nconsidering that.\n  What is the argument for giving immunity? ``Well, if we don't give \nthem immunity, the tobacco companies won't agree to advertising \nrestraints.'' That is the only thing they give us for their immunity. \nWe allow them to continue to produce a product which is inherently \ndeadly, which is addictive, and what do we get? We get a little less of \nJoe Camel. What a great deal that is for the American people and for \nthis Congress. It is absurd. Yes, we can't put limitations on their \nadvertising without their agreeing to it because of the first \namendment, in many ways, but there are limitations we can put on that \nare within the first amendment.\n  More importantly, we could act unilaterally as a Congress in all the \nother areas of this tobacco settlement, whether it has to be raising \nthe cost of cigarettes so they become less marketable--which is exactly \nwhat we should do--whether it happens to be addressing the issues of \nimmunity, or whether it happens to be initiating our own \ncounteradvertising campaign, and certainly the Government of the United \nStates has the capacity, the will and the dollars to do that without \nany question in a manner that will be equally effective. I will be \nhappy to go into the arena of advertising and debate the issue.\n  We can do everything in this tobacco settlement without granting \nimmunity, but by granting immunity, we get virtually nothing. All we \nget is the tobacco companies agreeing to advertising limits. To me, it \nis inherently inconsistent and affronts the logic of the institution \nfor us to be having our first major product liability protection flow \nto companies, flow to an industry which is producing a product the \npurpose of which is to addict people, specifically children, with the \nknowledge that it will kill them. It makes no sense.\n\n  For that reason, I am offering a sense-of-the-Senate amendment on the \nissue of immunity.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside, and \nI send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2167.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 3  . SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING IMMUNITY.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the levels in this \n     resolution assume that no immunity will be provided to any \n     tobacco product manufacturer with respect to any health-\n     related civil action commenced by a State or local \n     governmental entity or an individual prior to or after the \n     date of the adoption of this resolution.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, what this amendment says is it is the sense \nof the Senate that we won't grant immunity. Really this is a very \nsimple vote for people. You can either come down on the side of setting \nthe worst precedent I can imagine, which would be that the first major \nproduct liability reform in this country would be immunity, total \nabsolute immunity, for all intents and purposes, granted to tobacco \ncompanies in exchange for their paying us money which we could obtain, \nif we decided to go that route, through some other policy without \nhaving to grant immunity.\n  The same amount of revenue can be generated a number of other ways \nwithout their agreement for advertising restraints, which means little \nto us, because we can address the advertising in other forums. For \nthose two reasons, we grant immunity and, in the process, give a \nproduct which, as I mentioned a number of times, is inherently harmful, \naddictive, and aimed at our children and kills you, protection from \nlawsuits. It makes no sense.\n  Thus, I think the Congress should speak on this. I know a number of \ncommittees in the Congress are addressing this issue right now. They \nare negotiating through the process. But I believe we should as a \nCongress, as a Senate, speak on it early so that we lay out the \nframework of this debate early. If Members feel there is some value \nfrom giving immunity, let them vote that way. From my point of view, \nthere is no value in giving this type of immunity. I just don't think \nthe pluses outweigh the minuses in any sense of the word.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask that that request be withheld.\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have a reservation of a right to object.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I simply don't want to yield back the time \non my amendment. I will be happy to have the Senator proceed----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. On the bill, on our time.\n  Mr. GREGG. Right.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nMassachusetts proceed under the bill and not under the time on my \namendment which is pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, over the next few days, we will cast important votes \non the budget resolution, including some of the most important votes \nthis year on education priorities. We will also address issues \naffecting children, health care, enforcement of our antidiscriminatory \nlaws, and on the proposed tobacco legislation.\n  I look forward to those debates. We will be having virtually all of \nthem within a relatively short period of time. We will be debating many \npublic policy questions. I want to take a few moments this afternoon to \naddress some of those issues that I believe deserve the attention and \nsupport of the Members of the Senate.\n  We will consider a very important amendment by the Senator from the \nState of Washington, Senator Murray, on reducing class size. The \nPresident proposed to help ensure high academic achievement by all \nstudents by reducing the ratio of the number of teachers per student. \nIt would help increase effective communication between the\n\n[[Page S2743]]\n\nteacher and the students, and give students more individual attention. \nThe President's proposal will help reduce class size by increasing the \ntotal number of teachers for students in K through 12. We are going to \nhave to actually increase the number of teachers by 50,000 a year just \nto maintain the current ratio of teachers to students, and this doesn't \ntake into consideration the fact that in many parts of the country, we \nhave an aging teaching population, as well as current shortages of \nteachers.\n\n  There was a request by the President of the United States to \nrecognize that need and to also commit resources to that effort, and \nthat was turned down by the Republican Budget Committee. The Budget \nCommittee did not address the need to modernize our schools, even \nthough a General Accounting Office study showed that we need over $110 \nbillion to ensure that students in our schools are safe and secure, \nfree from environmental hazards, and in an atmosphere and climate where \nstudents can grow and learn. That effort, led by Senator Carol Moseley-\nBraun, would provide $22 billion in bonding authority to States and \ncommunities--and they would get the bonds interest-free.\n  The President has also advanced a concept called education \nopportunity zones. We should help school districts and communities \naddress the challenges that they are facing, whether it is academic \nfailure or significant problems in school dropouts or other kinds of \ndifficulties giving them needed resources to implement creative and \ninnovative reforms that work for their communities.\n  Chicago, for example, seems to be having success with its reforms. \nThis city is tackling school reform head on, and it's working. We \nshould help more communities that are attempting to do that. But the \nRepublican budget ignores those needs, and turned down the Education \nOpportunity Zones proposal as well.\n\n  The Republican Budget ignores the fact that 5 million children were \ngoing home to empty homes or empty apartments, unattended, \nunsupervised, after school. Their only friend was a television set--\nwith all of the problems and challenges that exist out there for young \nstudents, creating temptations for misbehaving. After-school programs \nhave been so successful in this country, and they have had a dramatic \nimpact in reducing violent crimes, reducing teenage pregnancy, and \nincreasing academic achievement. Some of the programs I have seen in \nBoston help students develop skills that might eventually develop into \njob skills in photography or in cooking.\n  Parents and students alike support after-school programs. Parents \nknow their children are safe and engaging in productive activities, and \nwhen they get home, the children have done their homework and are able \nto spend quality time with their parents.\n  It is clear that the Republicans do not want to address these issues. \nPerhaps we will have a chance later on in the Congress to resurrect \nthese measures. But the way that the procedures work here, they will \nneed what we call a supermajority, not just a bare majority, to get \napproval--we will need more than 60 in order to be successful.\n  So these debates will be very, very important in these next few days. \nWe also should support efforts to increase funding for the IDEA \nprogram, for children with disabilities. There was some increase in \nthose funds, but not nearly to the degree that they should be. We ought \nto at least have an opportunity to debate those issues and make a \njudgment on them.\n  We are effectively cut into a short period of time as a result of the \nBudget Act. And then when we return after the Easter break, we are \nrestricted further on debate on the Coverdell bill. So it is obviously \nfrustrating, when we know that the American people put the question \nabout education front and foremost, but we are not being able to give \nthe kind of full attention and support that we think these issues \nrequire.\n  Nonetheless, I wanted to say why I support the proposal that Senator \nMurray will be advancing and we will have an opportunity to debate on \ntomorrow, on the question of reducing the class size in grades K \nthrough 3 across the country.\n  And I say, Mr. President, I hope that all of our Members will pay \nspecial attention to Senator Murray as a former schoolteacher, former \nmember of a school board, someone who has been active in the local life \nof a community, in the school policy issues. She brings enormous, \nrefreshing insight and awareness and understanding of what really works \nin local communities, and I congratulate her on her leadership on this \nparticular issue. I think all of us who listen to her benefit immensely \nfrom her range of knowledge, her understanding, and her real insight \ninto education issues, and particularly when she speaks to the \nimportance of reducing class size in grades K through 3 across the \ncountry.\n  A necessary foundation for success in school is a qualified teacher \nin every classroom to make sure that young children receive individual \nattention. That is why it is so important we help bring the 100,000 new \nqualified teachers into the public schools and reduce class size in the \nelementary schools. Research has shown that students attending small \nclasses in the early grades make more rapid progress than students in \nlarger classes. The benefits are greatest for low-achieving, minority, \nand low-income children. Smaller classes also enable teachers to \nidentify and work effectively with students who have learning \ndisabilities and reduce the need for special education in later grades.\n  A national study of 10,000 fourth-graders in 203 school districts \nacross the country and 10,000 eighth-graders in 182 school districts \nacross the country found that students in small classes perform better \nthan students in large classes for both grade levels. Gains were larger \nfor fourth-graders than eighth-graders. Gains were largest of all for \ninner-city students in small classes. They were likely to advance 75 \npercent more quickly than students in large classes.\n\n  Another significant analysis, called Project STAR, studied 7,000 \nstudents in grades K through 3 in 80 schools in Tennessee. Again, \nstudents in small classes performed better than students in large \nclasses in each grade from kindergarten through third grade. The gains \nwere larger for minority students.\n  We also know that overcrowded classrooms undermine discipline and \ndecrease student morale. Many States and communities are considering \nproposals to reduce class size, but you cannot reduce class size \nwithout the ability to hire additional qualified teachers to fill the \nadditional classrooms. And the Federal Government should lend a helping \nhand.\n  This year, California Governor Wilson proposed to spend $1.5 billion \nto reduce fourth-grade classes to 20 students or less, after having \nreduced class sizes for students in grades K through 3 last year.\n  In Pennsylvania, a recent report by the bipartisan legislative \ncommission on urban school restructuring recommended capping class \nsizes in kindergarten through grade 3 in urban districts at 20 students \nper teacher.\n  In Wisconsin, the Student Achievement Guarantee In Education Program \nis helping to reduce class size in grades K through 3 in low-income \ncommunities.\n  In Flint, MI, efforts over the last 3 years to reduce class size in \ngrades K through 3 have led to a 44 percent increase in reading scores \nand an 18 percent increase in math scores.\n  Congress can do more to encourage all of these State and local \nefforts. We've tested the effects of reducing class sizes, and we are \nseeing positive results. But it is only taking place in a handful of \nplaces across the country. The Murray amendment will take the success \nof those particular impressive outcomes and make them available to \nother communities across the country so that when the demonstrated \nsuccess is out there, it will be replicated and duplicated all across \nthe Nation.\n  This is a concept whose time is overdue. We have an excellent \nopportunity to make a very, very important contribution to helping \nlocal communities. This is a partnership between the local, State, and \nthe Federal Government. We have all acknowledged that our participation \nat the Federal level is extremely small, about 7 cents out of every \ndollar. This is a modest program but one that can demonstrate very, \nvery significant. We can help lead the way in reducing class size. I \ncertainly urge my colleagues to support Senator Murray's amendment and \nto\n\n[[Page S2744]]\n\nincrease our investment in education. The Nation deserves our support.\n\n\n                          Tobacco Legislation\n\n  Mr. President, on another subject, while I have great respect for the \ntime and the effort which the chairman of the Commerce Committee has \ndevoted to tobacco legislation in recent weeks, the proposal he \nannounced over the weekend is inadequate to address the public health \ncrisis of youth smoking.\n  The seriousness of the threat to our children requires a much \nstronger response. The chairman's mark does too little to protect \nchildren from smoking, and it does far too much to protect the tobacco \nindustry from its victims. On each of the key issues, this proposal \nfalls short of what comprehensive tobacco control legislation should \nbe.\n  First, the significant price increase of $1.10 per pack over 5 years, \nwhich the Commerce bill proposes, is not substantial enough to produce \nthe dramatic reduction in youth smoking which all of us desire. Public \nhealth experts have concluded that an increase of $1.50 per pack \nswiftly instituted and indexed for inflation is necessary to achieve \nour youth-smoking-reduction goals.\n  Dr. Koop and Dr. Kessler, the National Academy of Sciences, the ENACT \nCoalition, and the Save Lives, the Not Tobacco Coalition have all \nstressed the importance of a price increase of at least $1.50 per pack. \nNearly half the Members of the Senate have already cosponsored bills \nproposing a $1.50 per pack increase within 3 years. The Budget \nCommittee also endorsed a $1.50 increase on a bipartisan vote of 14-8.\n\n  According to Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, every 10 \ncents in price will reduce youth smoking by 270,000 children over 5 \nyears. Thus, the difference between $1.10 and $1.50 will be more then \none million additional kids smoking in the year 2003.\n  Only an increase of at least $1.50 a pack can reduce youth smoking to \nthe targets outlined in the June 20 settlement, which is 60 percent in \n10 years, and prevent these additional children from a lifetime of \nnicotine addiction and tobacco-induced diseases.\n  One million young people between the ages of 12 and 17 take up this \ndeadly habit every year--3,000 smokers a day. In fact, the average \nsmoker begins smoking at the age of 13 and becomes a daily smoker \nbefore the age of 15.\n  These facts are bad enough, but the problem is growing worse. \nAccording to a spring 1996 survey conducted by the University of \nMichigan Institute for Social Research, the prevalence of teenage \nsmoking in America has been on the increase over the last 5 years. It \nrose by nearly one-half among 8th graders and 10th graders, and nearly \na fifth among high school seniors between 1991 and 1996.\n  I point out on the floor that we have seen a dramatic difference in \nour own State of Massachusetts where we have reduced the consumption by \na third of the national average. It is very interesting. We had a very \nmodest increase in the cost of tobacco in my State, but we also had a \ncounteradvertising campaign. And lo and behold, the tobacco industry \nreduced the prices to absorb all of the increase that had been required \nby the State. But with the tobacco education campaign, we saw a \nreduction of a third as measured to other kinds of nationwide figures.\n  So the point that we are making here is that with the additional \n$1.50 to $2, which virtually every one of the public health authorities \nhave mentioned to be essential within the short period of time of 3 \nyears, and the attendant kind of counteradvertising campaign and the \ncessation programs to help to assist kids to stop smoking and the \nsupport for antismoking campaign efforts by nonprofit and community-\nbased organizations--all of those programs can have a dramatic impact.\n  Now we know that there will be those who say--$1.12 at least is where \nthe President's request would have been in terms of his budget \nsubmission. But the fact is the President and the Vice President, the \nadministration, have basically supported the $1.50 in the shorter \nperiod of time. I hope that we are not looking for what is the least we \ncan do for the young people of this country. I hope what we would be \nsaying as a test is that we are looking for what is in the best \ninterest of the young people of this country. How are we going to set \nthat standard? Rather than what is the least we can penalize the \ntobacco companies in order to please them, we ought to be looking for \nwhat is in the best interest of these young people in order to meet \nthat particular responsibility.\n  Mr. President, I hope we will have an opportunity to vote on that \nduring the course of the consideration of the budget. I know we have \ninclusion in the budget of $1.50 per pack, but I hope that we will, or \nI expect we will, have a chance to vote on $1.50 as well and put the \nMembers on record on this particular issue, and I welcome the chance to \nsupport that if our leaders, Senator Conrad and Senator Daschle, offer \nthat.\n  We have a very simple way of doing this, making sure the FDA is going \nto have the kind of legislative authority to be able to deal with the \nproblems of addiction. And it is very clear what words have to be added \nto the authority of the FDA to be able to do that. We know the FDA will \nhave the authority and the power to do so. However, the Commerce \nCommittee refused to accept this regulatory approach, and they have \nother language in there which I am very much concerned may create \nendless litigation opportunities for America's most litigious industry, \nbig tobacco.\n  We will look forward to seeing the details of the language. Again, I \nwonder why we don't try and do it right, do what is in the public \nhealth's interest, but that is the standard rather than what is more \nacceptable to the tobacco industry.\n  I know our friend and colleague, Senator Conrad from North Dakota, \nwill go into considerable detail. The fact is that these look-back \nprovisions in the Commerce Committee draft are fundamentally flawed, \nand I think all of us in this body understand if we don't have adequate \npenalties, then we really don't have adequate protections. Penalties \nhave to be effective, at least have an effective action in discouraging \nyouth from smoking. As designed in the Commerce Committee proposals, I \nbelieve they are woefully lacking.\n  Once children are hooked into cigarette smoking at a young age, it \nbecomes increasingly hard for them to quit. Ninety percent of current \nadult smokers began to smoke before they reached the age of 18. Ninety-\nfive percent of teenage smokers say they intend to quit in the near \nfuture--but only a quarter of them will actually do so within the first \neight years of lighting up.\n  If nothing is done to reverse this trend in adolescent smoking, the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that five million \nof today's children will die prematurely from smoking-caused illnesses.\n  Increasing cigarette prices is one of the most effective ways to stem \nthis tide. Study after study has shown that it is the most powerful \nweapon in reducing cigarette use among children, since they have less \nincome to spend on tobacco and many are not already addicted.\n  An increase of $1.50 per pack in cigarette prices is also realistic. \nIt will not bankrupt the industry, which will pass it on in the form of \nhigher prices. If we increase the pack by $1.50, the total cost will be \n$3.45 a pack--still lower than the cost in many European countries --\n$3.47 in France, $4.94 in Ireland, and $5.27 in England.\n  Secondly, I am concerned about the FDA provision in the Commerce \nCommittee draft. It will not allow FDA to regulate nicotine as a \n``drug'' and cigarettes as ``drug delivery devices.'' Public health \nexperts strongly believe that this is the most effective way to \nregulate tobacco products. When the Commerce Committee refused to \naccept this regulatory approach, compromise language was drafted to \ncreate a new FDA chapter for tobacco products. I am concerned that this \napproach will create endless litigation opportunities for America's \nmost litigious industry--Big Tobacco. Why not provide the public health \nadvocates with the legal tools which they believe will be the most \neffective in regulating tobacco products? Why place unnecessary hurdles \nin their path?\n  Third, the lookback provisions in the Commerce Committee draft are \nfundamentally flawed. The penalties for the tobacco industry's failure \nto meet the youth smoking reduction targets are arbitrarily capped at \n$3.5 billion, which is the equivalent of only 15 cents\n\n[[Page S2745]]\n\na pack. An increase this small will hardly give tobacco companies a \nstrong economic incentive to stop marketing its products to children. \nIt will just become a cost of doing business. This proposed cap will \ndestroy the effectiveness of the lookback penalties as a meaningful \ndeterrent.\n  In addition, the penalties are imposed on an industry-wide basis, \nwhich removes the incentive for an individual company to stop marketing \nits products to children. In fact, the Commerce Committee draft will \ncreate a perverse incentive for a company to increase its marketing to \nchildren. Each company knows that if it captures a greater youth market \nshare, its own costs will rise by no greater an amount than its \ncompetitors, while its future profits will be increased and its \ncompetitors will bear a portion of the cost associated with gaining \nthat long-term competitive advantage. It is critically important that \nthe penalties are assigned on a company-specific basis to give each \nindividual company a strong economic incentive to discourage children \nfrom beginning to smoke.\n  The targets for the reduction in smokeless tobacco use among children \nare also not in parity with the targets for cigarette use reduction.\n  The use of oral snuff and chewing tobacco is a serious public health \nproblem. It causes cancer, gum disease, tooth loss, as well as nicotine \naddiction and death.\n  The Committee should not let smokeless tobacco products become a \ncheaper substitute for children if the price of cigarettes increases \ndue to the lookback penalties. In Massachusetts, once the price of oral \nsnuff and chewing tobacco was brought into parity with cigarettes, its \nuse among adolescents fell by over two-thirds between 1993 and 1996. \nSmokeless tobacco deserves equal attention, and we should expect \nsimilar reductions in use among children.\n  Fourth, the environmental tobacco smoke provisions are clearly \nunacceptable. States will be allowed to opt out of providing \nprotections from exposure to secondhand smoke to workers and their \nfamilies. This means there will be no national minimum standard to \nprotect non-smokers, particularly children, from exposure. The Commerce \nCommittee draft also exempts restaurants from smoke-free requirements, \ndespite the fact that the Journal of the American Medical Association \nhas reported that environmental tobacco smoke exposure for restaurant \nworkers are estimated to be two times higher than for office workers, \nand at least 1.5 times higher than for persons who live with a smoker.\n  Fifth, the provisions on document disclosure in the Commerce mark are \ngrossly inadequate. It would not require disclosure of many of the most \nsignificant documents. It would allow the industry to hide behind a \n``trade secret\" privilege no matter how significant the information \nconcealed was to advancing the public health.\n  Sixth, while the Chairman has not yet publicly disclosed the full \nextent of the litigation protection he intends to offer the industry, \nthe proposals being promoted in private discussions are truly \ndraconian. They would prohibit all class actions for past misconduct, \nprohibit punitive damages for past misconduct, prohibit all third party \nclaims and impose other serious restrictions on aggregation of claims. \nCollectively, these restrictions would make it practically impossible \nfor the victims of smoking induced illness to recover from the industry \nwhose product is killing them. We must not bar the courthouse doors to \nthe victims of the tobacco industry. I hope these extreme and grossly \nunfair proposals are never put before the Commerce Committee.\n  One litigation protection for the tobacco industry is already in the \nCommerce Chairman's mark. It is really the ultimate protection any \nindustry could be given. On page 96 of the draft, tobacco companies are \ngranted an 80 percent tax credit for money paid in judgments or \nsettlements for lawsuits. In plain language, this means that the \nAmerican taxpayers will pay 80 cents of every dollar the industry is \never required to pay to its victims. Instead of using the money raised \nby the $1.10 per pack cigarette price increase to deter youth smoking, \nto conduct anti-smoking education and counter-advertising campaigns, to \nassist smokers who want to quit, and to conduct medical research into \nsmoking related diseases, this legislation proposes to give it back to \nthe tobacco industry to cover its litigation losses. This outrageous \nidea should be rejected by all one hundred Senators. Congress was \nembarrassed last summer by the $50 billion tobacco industry tax credit \nsnuck into the Balanced Budget Act. Enactment of the tobacco company \ntax credit in the Chairman's mark would be an even greater \nembarrassment.\n  The legislation which the Commerce Committee is scheduled to consider \nthis week is seriously flawed. It should be sent back to the drawing \nboard for a major redesign. Congress has an extraordinary opportunity \nthis year to protect generations of children from a lifetime of \naddiction and premature death. To accomplish that great goal will \nrequire a much stronger bill than the one currently before the Commerce \nCommittee.\n  I want to next address the child care challenges that we are facing \nin the budget. President Clinton is right in giving it a high priority. \nCutting-edge research is giving us a greater understanding of the great \nsignificance of the early childhood years and development. Obviously, \nthe best possible care should be available and affordable, and it \nshould be quality. That is central to what this issue is really all \nabout.\n  We know we need more child care and child development programs. We \nknow we need money to pay for those programs. The Senate Democrats have \nproposed increasing our commitment to child care improvements by at \nleast $14 billion in mandatory spending over the next 5 years. This was \nimmediately attacked as ``big government spending'' on new programs. \nWhy is it only when the investment is in our children that it is \nconsidered ``big government spending''?\n  The Republican budget would preclude the possibility of child care \nlegislation beyond their proposed increase of $5 billion in \ndiscretionary authority for the Child Care and Development Block Grant \nand $9 billion in tax cuts. Both of these approaches are problematic. \nWe know we will never see discretionary money for child care, given the \ndiscretionary spending squeeze.\n  Obviously, these child care dollars would only become available if \noffsets were made in other discretionary programs, and programs for \nlow-income children and families are always most vulnerable. In \naddition, the proposed tax cuts are unlikely to help the very families \nwho most need assistance in paying for child care--low-income working \nfamilies. As long as the dependent child care tax credit remains \nnonrefundable, expanding it does nothing to assist low-income working \nfamilies, who have no tax liability. In effect, the child care \nproposals in the Republican budget are empty promises that simply give \nRepublicans a chance to say that they have done something for child \ncare. Our children and families need guarantees. We must have real, \nmandatory money for children and their families.\n  On another issue, employment discrimination takes many forms, whether \nbased on gender, age, race, or national origin. Bigotry in the \nworkplace undermines the fabric of our country and society.\n  When the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was signed over 30 years ago, \nCongress intended that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission \nserve as a national watchdog against workplace discrimination. The \nAgency's mission is laudable. It has been an important force in curbing \nreal and widespread problems of work force bias.\n  For example, the EEOC was able to reach a settlement with Del \nLaboratories after 15 women brought charges alleging several decades of \negregious sexual harassment. The Agency was also able to end 15 years \nof discrimination against African Americans and women at Estwing \nManufacturing Company. Estwing had a policy of race-coding applications \nto prevent the hiring of African Americans and refusing to hire women \nto perform certain jobs.\n  Who can forget the outrageous incidents of gender discrimination \ntaking place at Mitsubishi Motor Company. The EEOC is currently \nrepresenting over 300 women in that Mitsubishi legislation.\n  In recent years, the Agency has ``reinvented'' itself, and, without \nadditional resources, managed to decrease the number of cases waiting \nfor investigation and resolution. There is a\n\n[[Page S2746]]\n\nlimit, however, to what the EEOC can do without a budget that reflects \nits responsibilities.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the President's request for $279 \nmillion for the EEOC. The Senate must earmark these funds for the \nAgency. It is the right thing to do and this is the time to do it.\n\n\n                                Medicare\n\n  Too many Americans nearing age 65 face a crisis in health care. They \nare too young for Medicare, but too old for affordable private \ncoverage. Many of them face serious health problems that threaten to \ndestroy the savings of a lifetime and prevent them from finding or \nkeeping a job. Many are victims of corporate down-sizing or a company's \ndecision to cancel the health insurance protection they relied on.\n  Three million Americans aged 55 to 64 are uninsured today, but no \nAmerican nearing retirement can be confident that the health insurance \nthey have today will protect them until they are 65 and are eligible \nfor Medicare.\n  The consequences of being uninsured at this age are often tragic. As \na group, they are in relatively poor health, and their condition is \nmore likely to worsen the longer they remain uninsured. They have \nlittle or no savings to protect against the cost of serious illness. \nOften, they are unable to afford even the routine care that can prevent \nminor health problems from turning into serious disabilities or even \nlife-threatening illness.\n  If we do not act to stem this trend, the problem will only get worse. \nBetween 1991 and 1995, the number of workers whose employers promise \nthem benefits if they retire early dropped twelve percent. Barely a \nthird of all workers now have such a promise.\n  In recent years, many others who have counted on an employer's \ncommitment found themselves with only a broken promise. Their coverage \nwas canceled after they retired.\n  For these older Americans left out and left behind through no fault \nof their own after decades of hard work, it is time to provide a \nhelping hand.\n  Democrats have already introduced legislation to address these \nissues--and the budget must provide for its enactment. The legislation \nallows uninsured Americans age 62-64 to buy in to Medicare coverage and \nspread part of the cost throughout their years of eligibility through \nthe regular Medicare program. It allows displaced workers aged 55-62 to \nbuy into Medicare to help them bridge the period until they can find a \nnew job with health insurance or until they qualify for Medicare. It \nrequires companies that drop retirement coverage to allow their \nretirees to extend their coverage through COBRA until they qualify for \nMedicare.\n  This legislation is a lifeline for millions of older Americans. It \nprovides a bridge to help them through the years before they qualify \nfor full Medicare eligibility. It is a constructive next step toward \nthe day when every American will be guaranteed the fundamental right to \nhealth care. It will impose no additional burden on Medicare, because \nit is fully paid for by premiums from the beneficiaries themselves.\n\n\n                              Managed Care\n\n  A week ago, Helen Hunt received an Oscar for her role as the mother \nof a severely asthmatic child in the movie ``As Good As It Gets.'' In \nthe movie, she delivers a line of unrepeatable insults aimed at her \nson's HMO. And audiences across the nation burst into applause and \nhoots of knowing laughter. In some cases, life imitates art. In this \ncase, however, art imitates life.\n  We face a crisis of confidence in health care. A recent survey found \nthat an astonishing 80 percent of Americans now believe that their \nquality of care is often compromised by their insurance plan to save \nmoney. Another survey found that 90 percent of Americans--men and \nwomen, across the political spectrum--say a Patients' Bill of Rights is \nneeded to regulate health insurance plans. And they report that they \nare willing to pay for it, despite a campaign of disinformation from \nthe business community and insurance industry.\n  One reason for this concern is the explosive growth in managed care. \nIn 1987, only 13 percent of privately insured Americans were enrolled \nin HMOs. Today 75 percent are in some form of managed care.\n  At its best, managed care offers the opportunity to achieve both \ngreater efficiency and higher quality in health care. In too many \ncases, however, the priority has become higher profits, not better \nhealth.\n  The list of those victimized by insurance company abuse grows every \nday.\n  These abuses are not typical of most insurance companies. But they \nare common enough that Congress needs to act to protect the American \npublic. A recent report in California found that 17 percent of managed \ncare enrollees developed permanent disabilities as a result of plan \ndenials. The Clinton Administration is prepared to support legislation \nto address these issues. Members on both sides of the aisle in both \nchambers are prepared to act. And the time to act is now.\n  We need to ensure access to appropriate specialty care--care that \npeople pay for through their premiums, deductibles and copayments. We \nneed to ensure that patients have the rights to appeal plan denials, \nespecially those that threaten the life, health or future potential of \nthose in need of services. We need to take action to monitor and \nimprove the quality of care for everyone. We need to make plans \naccountable for their decisions, and provide all patients, regardless \nof whether they receive their insurance in the individual market, from \na public program or through an employer, with the right for redress \nwhen plan denials result in injury or death. We need to simply make \nsure that people are aware of their rights and able to compare their \noptions--when they are fortunate enough to have a choice of plans.\n  Legislation must be carefully crafted, so that it curbs abuse without \nstifling innovation and appropriate measures to control costs, but \naction is essential. The American people know that the current system \nis out of control, and they want protection. This can be the Congress \nthat finally enacts a health insurance bill of rights to assure that \npatients receive the protection their insurance company promises but \ntoo often fails to deliver. Our national bottom line must be patient \nneeds, not industry profits.\n\n\n                           Children's Health\n\n  Last year, we created a new children's health program designed to \nreach uninsured children in working families whose income is too high \nfor Medicaid but too low to afford private health insurance. We made an \nunprecedented investment of 24 billion dollars over the next five \nyears. More than 10 million children are uninsured, and approximately \none-third of those children are already eligible for, but not \nparticipating in, Medicaid. We need to do more to enroll children in \nthe programs for which they qualify. And we need to ensure that the \nproper resources and options are available to states to encourage \nenrollment in the new program.\n  The President included proposals in his budget to expand the outreach \nopportunities available to states. They were paid for by other \nadministrative savings in Medicaid. But they have mysteriously \ndisappeared in this Republican budget. Instead, it appears that the \nsavings extracted from a program that serves primarily low-income women \nand children are being used to buy bridges and roads. Gone are the \nprovisions, scored by CBO at only $400 million, that would help states \nfulfill our goal of enrolling every eligible child in the health \ninsurance program for which they qualify. Why? They could have included \nthe outreach provisions and still had a billion dollars to spend on \nother priorities.\n  Mr. President, these games have to stop. When the Congress acts to \nprovide its citizens with opportunities, we should make every effort to \nfollow-through with policies that address implementation concerns. If \nwe really want children to receive the health insurance we extended to \nthem last year, we need to fully fund outreach activities. This budget \nfails to deliver the funds necessary to ensure uninsured children \nreceive the care to which they are entitled.\n\n\n                            disabled persons\n\n  Mr. President, I want to reinforce an issue of great importance to \nevery American in this country that Senator Jeffords will be speaking \nabout later today--the need for accessible and affordable health care \nfor disabled persons, so they can work and live independently.\n\n[[Page S2747]]\n\n  Disability does not pick its owner--it can happen to any of us here \ntoday, and we have seen many of our own colleagues and Members of this \nCongress struggle with the unexpected consequences of disability in \ntheir lives. Yet disability policies in this country continue to \nimpoverish disabled persons and disregard their ability to be \nproductive members of their community.\n  The lack of accessible and affordable health care is the reason that \nonly one half of 1 percent of disabled persons ever go to, or return to \nwork. There are 54 million disabled people in this country who may have \nthe capacity to work but cannot because they are afraid of losing their \nhealth care.\n  This Congress needs to put in place health care options that support \ndisabled persons to work, live independently, and be productive and \ncontributing members of their community. I encourage your support in \nfunding these options during this budget process.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the leadership of \nSenator Kennedy on the critical issue of protecting the public health \nand the tobacco legislation. He has been one of the most valued members \nof the task force on tobacco in the Democratic Caucus. No one has \nworked harder to make certain that we keep our eye on the ball of what \nare the important priorities. Over and over, he has reminded our \ncolleagues that the priority is to protect the public health and to \nreduce teen smoking. Those are the things that I think all of us want \nto accomplish. I thank him publicly for the extraordinary leadership he \nhas brought to the cause.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from North Dakota \nis willing to yield back the time remaining on my amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We are prepared to yield back, and the Senator is \nprepared to yield back.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent we both be allowed to yield back--\nI yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING FREEDOM OF HEALTH CARE \n                   CHOICE FOR MEDICARE SENIORS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Medicare beneficiaries should have the same right to \n     obtain health care from the physician or provider of their \n     choice as do Members of Congress and virtually all other \n     Americans.\n       (2) Most seniors are denied this right by current \n     restrictions on their health care choices.\n       (3) Affording seniors this option would create greater \n     health-care choices and result in fewer claims being paid out \n     of the near-bankrupt medicare trust funds.\n       (4) Legislation to uphold this right of health care choice \n     for seniors must protect beneficiaries and medicare from \n     fraud and abuse. Such legislation must include provisions \n     that--\n       (A) require that such contracts providing this right be in \n     writing, be signed by the medicare beneficiary, and provide \n     that no claim be submitted to the Health Care Financing \n     Administration;\n       (B) preclude such contracts when the beneficiary is \n     experiencing a medical emergency;\n       (C) allow for the medicare beneficiary to modify or \n     terminate the contract prospectively at any time and to \n     return to medicare; and\n       (D) are subject to stringent fraud and abuse law, including \n     the medicare anti-fraud provisions in the Health Insurance \n     Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     seniors have the right to see the physician or health care \n     provider of their choice, and not be limited in such right by \n     the imposition of unreasonable conditions on providers who \n     are willing to treat seniors on a private basis, and that the \n     assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     resolution assume that legislation will be enacted to ensure \n     this right.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, this amendment is a sense of the Senate \nentitled ``Freedom of Health Care Choice for Medicare Seniors.'' The \npurpose of this amendment is for Members of the Senate to go on record \nas supporting the eventual adoption of legislation that will ensure \nthat all seniors have freedom of choice in obtaining health care \nservices for themselves and members of their families.\n  As a result of the balanced budget amendment of last year, an \namendment went into effect on January 1 that precludes most seniors \nfrom having this freedom to contract. While it establishes the \nprinciple that they may do so, it puts forth a condition that is \nvirtually impossible for them to satisfy; namely, to find a physician \nwho is willing to dump all of his Medicare patients for a period of 2 \nyears prior to the time that their services are sought. As a result, it \nis impossible for most seniors to exercise a choice that is \ntheoretically theirs in the law today.\n  This proposal to be amended into the Balanced Budget Act is to \nexpress our sense that we intend to adopt legislation later that will \nprovide for this right. As a matter of fact, I have introduced \nlegislation, as has Congressman Bill Archer from Texas in the House of \nRepresentatives, that would fulfill this commitment. Mine is Senate \nbill 1194, the Medicare Beneficiaries Freedom to Contract Act. We have \n49 cosponsors for this at the moment, and I think number 50 is on the \nway. Clearly, it is a popular idea because of the expressions of \nconcerns by our senior citizens that they would like to have the \nfreedom to contract for the services they desire. In the House of \nRepresentatives, Representative Archer, chairman of the Ways and Means \nCommittee, has over 190 cosponsors.\n  What is this sense of the Senate, and why do we need it? We believe \nthe sense-of-the-Senate amendment here provides that Medicare \nbeneficiaries should have the same right to obtain health care from the \nphysician or provider of their choice as do Members of Congress and \nvirtually all other Americans, and that there should be no unreasonable \nprovisions or unreasonable\n\n[[Page S2748]]\n\nconditions that prevent them from obtaining this care. Moreover, we \nspecifically provide that the assumptions underlying the budget \nresolutions assume that this legislation will be enacted.\n  So what is the problem here? Prior to January 1 of this year, and for \nall of the time that Medicare has been in effect, Americans have had \nthe ability to go to the physician of their choice, and if that \nphysician did not feel he could treat them under Medicare, or chose not \nto do so, or they chose not to be treated under Medicare, they would \nhave the choice to contract outside of Medicare. Obviously, they had to \npay the bill themselves.\n  For most Americans, Medicare is such a good deal that this was rarely \ntaken advantage of. However, there are situations in which a senior \ncitizen might want to take advantage of this requirement. It had always \nexisted. For example, a constituent of mine wrote to me and pointed out \nthat in her community there was only one specialist that she felt could \ntake care of her particular kind of diabetic condition. She went to see \nthat physician, and he said that since she was 65 years of age, she was \na Medicare beneficiary, she was Medicare eligible, and since she was \nMedicare eligible, he would have to submit the bill to Medicare if he \ntreated her, but that he could not take on any more new Medicare \npatients, that he had as many as he could afford to continue to provide \ncare to. She said, ``No problem, I'll pay you. You bill me directly, \nand we will save Medicare the money.'' He pointed out--and verified \nthis with the Health Care Financing Administration--that they would \nassume he had committed fraud if he took care of her, submitted the \nbill to her, and had her pay him directly.\n\n  Unless the bill is sent to Medicare, the care can't be provided. In \neffect, it is Medicare or no care. As of January 1 of this year, that \nis the law of the United States of America, believe it or not. Once you \nturn 65, you lose a right that all other Americans have, which is to go \nto the physician of your choice. It is Medicare or no care. You cannot \ncontract outside of Medicare for Medicare-covered benefits. That is \nfundamentally un-American.\n  If you have saved all of your life to provide for health care for \nyourself, your spouse, and your family, you are going to do anything \nwithin your power to help your spouse, let's say, who is ill, and if \nshe wants to go to someone who is not treating new Medicare patients, \nfor example, or is a non-Medicare-treating physician, you are going to \nspare no expense to save her life. I had this happen to a friend of \nmine. I was able to get a compassionate release from FDA to get an \nexperimental drug so she could use it in the last few months of her \nlife. Unfortunately, she passed on anyway. Her husband was willing to \ndo anything to preserve her life, go to any lengths.\n  Are we going to tell senior citizens in the United States they can't \ndo that, they can't go to the doctor of their choice, that they have to \ngo through Medicare or they can't be cared for at all? If they can't \nfind somebody willing to treat their particular condition under \nMedicare, that is it, sorry, this is the United States of America, but \nthey don't have that right anymore?\n  If you are 64 and a half, of course, you have that right. If you are \na Member of Congress, you have that right. If you are in Great Britain, \nunder a socialized medicine system, you have that right. Even in Great \nBritain, which has socialized medicine, you can either go to that \nprogram or contract privately, so long as you pay the bill yourself. \nThat is all we are asking for the United States of America. Yet, under \nan amendment that the President insisted be part of the Balanced Budget \nAct of last year, that right has been taken away from seniors in this \ncountry.\n  All over the country, seniors are beginning to complain because they \nhave figured out what has been taken away. This is one of the first \nthings being brought up in town hall meetings. They ask me, ``Why are \nyou taking away the Medicare rights?'' I have said, ``Look, I didn't do \nit. I didn't know that agreement had been struck in the middle of the \nnight and snuck into the Balanced Budget Act. Everyone voted for it, \nand we knew nothing about it. A couple of days later, it was revealed \nthat the President had insisted that this provision go into the law.''\n  So, Madam President, I think it is important for the Members of the \nSenate to go on record in the Budget Act here as supporting the \nprinciple of freedom to contract. The measure I have introduced has all \nkinds of safeguards to prevent fraud and abuse. We can have a good \ndiscussion about exactly what those should be. If you have a suggestion \non how to make it better, fine with me, let's talk that out. At some \npoint, we will actually bring that legislation to the floor and have \nthat debate.\n\n  I think all of us can agree on the basic principle that, A, we should \nhave the freedom of choice to contract with the physician of our choice \nin this country; B, there should be adequate provisions to prevent \nfraud and abuse; and, C, we need to get this done as soon as possible. \nThat is what our sense of the Senate calls for, Madam President. I hope \nthat those people who have expressed opposition to this legislation \nwill come forward and debate the issue. Let's have an open public \ndebate, because the people of America need to understand what the \nCongress and the President did to them last year when it took away this \nfundamental right. Those of us who believe in the principle of doing \neverything you can for your loved ones need to support this.\n  One final thought before I sit down. This law that is currently in \neffect is just like saying to seniors on Social Security that the only \nway you can provide for your retirement, your financial needs, is \nthrough the Government's Social Security system; you can't save any \nmoney, you can't have any stocks and bonds, you can't have any pension, \nyou can't have any insurance annuities--none of that; it is either the \nSocial Security system, the Government program, or no system. That is \nwhat we have said with regard to health care--you either take the \nMedicare health care program or nothing; you cannot contract outside of \nMedicare for covered benefits. As I said, it is ludicrous when you \npresent it that way.\n  Opponents say that there might be some fraud and abuse here. I think \nthat sells the physicians in this country and our senior citizens very \nshort. I know of nobody more careful about their bills than seniors. I \nknow my mom and dad are. They can tell you whether they were \novercharged. We can put provisions in this to ensure that there is no \nfraud and abuse. I think it is fundamentally wrong for us to deny this \nright to citizens just because we feel there may be some physician out \nthere who would abuse the system.\n  So I conclude by urging colleagues, when we have an opportunity to \nvote on this, to support this principle again in the Budget Act--and at \nthis point it can only be a principle; it cannot be the effective \nlegislation. We will propose that later. Surely we can support this \nprinciple through the sense of the Senate and, at a later time, \nactually support the legislation that would accomplish the principle.\n  Madam President, at this time I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, earlier, Senator Kennedy raised concerns \nabout the tobacco legislation that is moving through Congress. \nObviously, tobacco legislation is part of the budget resolution as \nwell. The budget resolution provides a special reserve fund so that, in \nfact, if the tobacco legislation moves, it will be possible to use \nthose funds for a number of purposes.\n  Senator Kennedy had indicated that at the same time there is \nlegislation moving through the Commerce Committee. He raised a number \nof concerns about the legislation as it has been described in the \npress. Madam President, just let me add my voice of concern to what we \nhave heard about that legislation moving through the Commerce \nCommittee. One of the major issues on comprehensive tobacco legislation \nis, Will this industry be given special, unprecedented protection--\nprotection that has never been granted any other industry at any time? \nThat is, special protection against suits by victims of the industry, \nwhether they be individuals or third parties who have had\n\n[[Page S2749]]\n\ncosts imposed on them by the use of tobacco products.\n\n  Madam President, the bill going through the Commerce Committee at \nthis point is silent on the question of liability--liability for the \ntobacco industry. Being silent on liability in tobacco legislation is \nlike having a discussion of the Titanic and failing to mention the \niceberg. This is central to any discussion that anybody can have about \ntobacco legislation. How can you be silent on the question of \nliability?\n  Many of us believe that there should be no special protection granted \nthis industry. Many of us believe it is inappropriate to give this \nindustry, of all industries, the kind of unprecedented protection that \nthey seek. It is troubling that we saw this industry come before \nCongress and swear under oath that their products caused no health \nproblems, swore under oath that they had never targeted our kids for \nmarketing and advertising, swore under oath they had never manipulated \nnicotine levels in order to make their products more addictive, and \nthat their products were not addictive.\n  Now the documents have come out. The documents show that, without \nquestion, in fact, these products cause the health problems that they \nhave sworn they do not cause. We know, based on the release of the \ndocuments, that they have targeted our kids for marketing and \nadvertising. In fact, they have targeted kids as young as 12 years old \nin their marketing and advertising. The documents disclose it. The \ndocuments also disclose that they knew their products were addictive. \nThe documents disclose that they knew they were engaged in these \nefforts, which they absolutely denied when they were before Congress. \nAnd now they come to us and they say, well, look, if we are going to be \ninvolved in this, you have to give us special protection.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire sent an amendment to the desk that \nsays we ought not to give this industry immunity, we ought not to give \nthem special protection, and we ought to deal with this industry the \nway we have dealt with every other industry; we ought to address head-\non the problems that they create and do it without giving them some \nkind of special deal. I think the overwhelming majority of Americans \nwould say that is exactly the right thing to do. We should not be \ngiving them special protection. They don't deserve it. They don't need \nit. It is not necessary in order to accomplish the result.\n  So at some point very soon we are going to have a chance to debate \nand discuss the amendment of the Senator from New Hampshire. I just \nwant to commend him this afternoon for offering that amendment. I look \nforward to the debate. I want to hear on the floor of the Senate the \nargument advanced that this industry should be given special \nprotection. I want to hear people in public defend the position that \nthis industry should be given special treatment. I want to hear on the \nfloor of the Senate how somebody rationalizes and defends this \nindustry. I don't think it is possible. I don't think it will stand the \nlight of day.\n  Out here in the back room someplace when nobody is around and nobody \nis reporting, all of a sudden there is a lot of grave talk about, oh, \nwe have to give this industry special protection. I want to hear those \narguments made out here in the cold light of day. I want to see our \ncolleagues have a chance to vote on the question of whether we are \ngoing to give special protection to this industry or not.\n  Madam President, I very much look forward to our debate and \ndiscussion on that question. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for \noffering that amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I certainly appreciate the support of the \nSenator from North Dakota on this amendment. I believe he has \nsummarized the concern which I have as well. The fact is you can't \ndefend immunity. It is just inconsistent with the policies of discovery \nto give immunity to a business which has basically targeted young \npeople with an addictive product which was intended to kill them. The \nidea that we would start by giving immunity to that industry is not \nonly ironic but totally wrong.\n  So I certainly appreciate the support of the Senator from North \nDakota in this effort.\n  Madam President, I make a point of order that a quorum is not \npresent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, I seek the floor for purposes of \nspeaking in regard to the budget resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The resolution is the pending business. The \nSenator is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you very much.\n  Madam President, I rise today to express my opposition to the budget \nresolution.\n  More than just being an accountant's ledger, the Federal budget \nshould embody our Nation's values. Yet, from looking through the \nbudget, the values that are transmitted here seem to be nothing more \nthan an inflated sense of Washington's self-arrogance. The budget \nrepresents Washington's arrogance, Washington's belief that the \ninterests of the individual and individual taxpayers are second, if not \nthird, fourth, or fifth, as compared to the bureaucrat and the \nbureaucratic appetite to consume resources at the Federal Government \nlevel.\n  I think it is a slap in the face of Americans who thought they sent \nindividuals to Washington to curtail the size of Government, those who \nhave worked to make sure that they sent individuals here to guard their \nfreedoms. It is a challenge to them when they see the House and the \nSenate march steadily forward on bigger and bigger budgets consuming \nmore and more of the resources of an average family. I believe that I \nwas sent to Washington to cut taxes to make it possible for people to \nretain more of what they earn to spend on their own families rather \nthan have Washington somehow come to the conclusion that Washington \ncould spend the money more effectively on America's families than \nAmerica's families could.\n  I oppose this budget based on the fact that it is designed to grow \nGovernment substantially and it is designed to take more and more of \nwhat people earn. I have prepared a series of proposals of $1 trillion \nin tax cuts and debt and tax limitation measures. I would like to see \nus put those in our public policy. But, frankly, there is really not a \nchance to do that because this budget and the budget rules that are \nproposed are designed to block such measures, ensuring that the \npriorities and judgments of the Budget Committee remain inviolable. I \nwould like to explain in detail my opposition to this budget.\n  First, it increases the size of the Government. The budget resolution \nrecommends that the Federal Government spend $9.15 trillion over the \nnext 5 years. That represents a 17.3 percent increase over the previous \n5 years. The past 5 years as compared to the next 5 years, a 17.3 \npercent increase. Five years from now the Federal Government would \nspend $276.5 billion more than it will spend this year. That is an \nincrease of 16.5 percent.\n\n  So this massive growth of Government I don't believe is consistent \nwith the mandate of the American people. Even President Clinton intoned \nin his State of the Union Message a little over a year ago that the era \nof big Government was over. He could hear the footsteps of the \nelectorate in their steady march demanding that we have smaller \nGovernment--meaning greater capacity for our families. And, yet, here \nwe go again. We have growth that amounts in the next 5 years to 16.5 \npercent.\n  Second, I oppose the budget because it takes far more tax revenue \nfrom the American people than ever before. The budget resolution \nrecommends that the Federal Government collect $9.3 trillion in tax \nrevenue over the next 5 years. That is a 27.5 percent increase over the \nprevious 5 years. Five years from now the Federal Government would \ncollect $327.9 billion more than it will collect this year. That is an \nincrease of 19.5 percent.\n  Now that we know what the budget resolution does, we should address \nthe one thing that the resolution does not do. This budget resolution \ndoes not cut taxes.\n\n[[Page S2750]]\n\n  As a recent report by the Senate Republican Policy Committee reads, \n``The fiscal year 1999 budget resolution provides for no reconciliation \nbill. It, therefore, contains no specific tax-cut instruction.''\n  Year by year, the amounts by which the aggregate levels of Federal \nrevenues should be changed are as follows: Zero, zero, zero, zero, \nzero, zero.\n  The numbers in this resolution do not reflect that the report \naccompanying the resolution holds out the hope that Congress might pass \na $30 billion tax cut over 5 years. $30 billion over 5 years is a \nnumber which might be hard for folks to anticipate. But here is what it \namounts to. It amounts to $1.83 per person per month in terms of tax \nrelief--$1.83 per person per month. Inflation may be tame. But even the \nmost frugal consumer would be hard pressed to stretch $1.83 very far.\n  Looking at this another way, $30 billion in tax relief out of the \n$9.3 trillion in tax revenue represents a cut of three-tenths of 1 \npercent over 5 years. That is the equivalent of getting a 30-cent \ndiscount on a $100 order of groceries. And if that weren't bad enough, \nthis budget resolution would consider offsetting those cuts with tax \nincreases.\n  Page 70 of the committee report accompanying the budget resolution \nreads:\n\n       This ``reserve fund'' would permit tax relief to be offset \n     by reductions in mandatory spending or revenue increases.\n\n  This is no idle threat. The last page of the chairman's mark lists \nillustrative examples of taxes that could be raised, including taxes on \nvacation and severance pay, and adopting some of President Clinton's \nproposed tax increases.\n  I believe it is wrong for us to be considering tax increases, \nespecially at a time when the average American is still working for the \nGovernment this year. I say ``still working for the Government this \nyear'' because, according to authorities, we all work until May 9 now \nin order to pay for Government. It is only after we have worked all the \nway until the second week in May that we begin to pay ourselves instead \nof to pay our Government.\n  Compared to last year's resolution, this budget resolution recommends \nthat the Federal Government collect $212 billion more in tax revenue \nthan was recommended for the same period last year.\n  Whose interest does this resolution serve? As I mentioned earlier, \nthis budget has its priorities upside down. They are inverted. They are \nskewed. My clear understanding of Government is that it exists to serve \nthe people. But this budget has that backwards. This has people \nexisting to serve the interests of Government.\n\n  Let me read a disturbing line from page 52 of the committee report \naccompanying the budget resolution:\n\n       The tax writing committees will be required to balance the \n     interests and desires of many parties while protecting the \n     interests of taxpayers generally in drafting the tax cut.\n\n  Why did the Budget Committee feel a need to include a reminder in \nthis report to keep the interests of the taxpayers in mind? Taxpayers \nshould have been in the forefront of our mind. It read as if the \ninterests of the taxpayers are secondary. That said, the American \ntaxpayers deserve more consideration than this budget allows.\n  Relief for taxpayers cannot come a moment too soon, and we should \nhave a budget which reflects our ability to constrict Government and to \nenlarge the capacity of individuals.\n  Allow me to place this budget package within the context of the \novertaxed worker.\n  For the past 5 consecutive years, the growth in personal tax payments \nhas outstripped that of wages and salaries. This is an important point. \nPeople have had their taxes going up faster than their salaries and \nwages have been going up. Not since 1980-1981 have there been more than \n2 consecutive years in which tax growth had exceeded wage growth. Well, \nnot until the past 5 years.\n  The average American now works until May 9, as I mentioned, a full \nweek longer than the average American worked for the Government when \nBill Clinton assumed the Presidency. The average American now is \nworking to May 9 to pay Federal, State, and local taxes. Some \nindividuals think that includes State and local taxes. What do we have \nto do with that? Frankly, a significant share of what State and local \ngovernments charge in terms of taxes is being charged because we have \nmandated programs on the State and local governments.\n  I can't help but think of President Reagan's definition of a \ntaxpayer: ``Someone who works for the Federal Government but doesn't \nhave to take a civil service exam.''\n  Frankly, all of us have been working for the Federal Government. We \nwill all be working for the Federal Government until May 9 this year--\nfor the government at least.\n  The last year that the Federal Government collected less tax revenue \nthan it did the year before was 1983. That was 16 fiscal years ago. If \nyou define a ``tax cut'' as when the Government collects less in taxes, \nwe have not had a true tax cut since 1983.\n  Because of the tax increases of 1990 and 1993, taxpayers will give \nthe Federal Government $600 billion more over the next 5 years than \nthey would have otherwise.\n  Why are taxes so high? Taxes are high because Government is too big \nand because Government spends too much. Taxes are high because our \nbudgets reflect that we believe that the bureaucracy is better at \nspending money on American families than American families are. I \nbelieve that is a mistaken belief.\n  This year the $1.7 trillion that Washington will spend is more, in \ninflation-adjusted dollars, than the Federal Government spent \ncumulatively from 1800 to 1940. Over the past 20 years, Congress has \nallowed Federal spending to increase 291.3 percent. Adjusted for \ninflation, that represents a real spending increase of nearly 60 \npercent. In the past 10 years nondefense Federal outlays adjusted for \ninflation have increased by one-third.\n  The last year that the Federal Government spent less than it did the \nyear before was in 1965, 34 fiscal years ago.\n  When I entered the Senate in 1995, I hoped that the new Republican \nmajority in Congress would pursue a general downsizing of the Federal \nGovernment, allocating to States and local governments, and, yes, to \nthe best government of all, the family, which obviously finds the best \ndepartment of social services and the best department of education, the \nbest department of health when it spends its own resources fostering \nthe needs, ambitions, aspirations, hopes, and achievements of the \nfamily, I had hoped that we would reduce the size of the Federal \nGovernment to make the resource allocation of this culture more \neffective and more efficient by placing it in the family and close to \nthe family, where good decisions could best be made.\n  Despite our efforts, the Federal establishment is growing more costly \nand more intrusive than ever before. Federal spending has grown by $200 \nbillion just since 1995. Nobel laureate Milton Friedman observed, \n``Congress will spend whatever revenue it receives plus as much more as \nit collectively believes it can get away with.'' Another way folks say \nthat, back in Missouri, is, ``We live by the `they send it, we spend \nit' motto.''\n  Frankly, it is time to say to the American people ``You earned it, we \nreturned it.'' We need to give to the American people some of their \nmoney back so they can make good judgments and good decisions of how to \ndeploy their own resources on themselves and their families and in \ntheir own communities without sending it through the shrinking process \nof the bureaucracy in Washington, DC.\n  This budget resolution assumes a cumulative surplus of $149 billion \nbefore any tax cuts over the next 5 years. As each week passes, the \ncall for new spending seems to grow. The Senate spent last week \ndebating whether to pass emergency legislation that would breach the \ndiscretionary spending caps, including $4.48 million for maple syrup \nproducers to replace taps and tubing damaged by ice storms in the \nNortheast.\n  Before closing, let me just reiterate my opposition to the resolution \nfor these reasons:\n  No. 1, the budget increases the size of Government. It is time for us \nto increase the size of opportunity for American families.\n  No. 2, the budget resolution does not instruct Congress to cut taxes. \nWe were\n\n[[Page S2751]]\n\nsent here to limit the size of Government, to cut the burden on the \nAmerican people. The American people are paying more in taxes than ever \nbefore in history. It is time--we are not at war--to understand if we \nare at war, that we are at war with ourselves and we should stop taking \nso much of the resource of American families. We should make it \navailable to them.\n  No. 3, when spoken about, the so-called predicted tax relief would be \na proverbial slap in the face, or at least in the wallets, of the \nAmerican people: $1.83 per person per month. You can't get a cup of \ngourmet coffee--I couldn't get it if I drank it--at that price.\n  No. 4, it would allow Congress to offset the tax cut with a tax \nincrease rather than with spending cuts.\n  And, No. 5, it would have the Federal Government collect $212 billion \nmore than the budget resolution agreed to just last year.\n  The Senate should reject this budget resolution and adopt a \nresolution that reflects the values of those who sent us here, one that \ncurtails spending, one that provides tax relief, and one that further \nlimits the Federal debt. I encourage my fellow Senators to vote no on \nthis backwards budget, this budget that really believes and sets a \nvalue on the idea that Washington knows best.\n  It is pretty obvious to me that you let the person spend the money \nwho you think can make the best investment. And it is pretty clear to \nme that Washington thinks it can make better investments and better \njudgments about our family and our culture than can people in their \nfamilies and businesses in their institutions. I do not believe that \nWashington knows best. The genius of America is not that the values of \nWashington would be imposed on the people; the genius of America is \nthat the values of people would be imposed on Washington. But this \nbudget gathers to the bosom of the bureaucracy the capacity to \nconfiscate the resources of the people and to spend them in an arrogant \nsense that we know better how to spend resources on America and her \nfamilies than America's families do. Nobel laureate Milton Friedman \nobserved Congress will spend whatever revenue it receives plus as much \nas they can get away with, and this is one of those settings where it \nlooks to me like we are making that kind of commitment to expenditure.\n  I believe Members of this body should look carefully at this budget \nand should understand it does not reflect the values of the American \npeople. It fails, for instance, to obliterate or to curtail or to \nremove the marriage penalty. If we want a system which would reflect \nthe values of America, understanding that this country is most likely \nto succeed in the next century if we have strong families, then we \nwould endow the family with strength and the finances to do what \nfamilies ought to do. Instead, this budget resolution provides the \nbasis for continuing the marriage penalty, which is really a way of \nfining people for being married and saying to individuals who are \nmarried in this culture: We will charge you $29 billion a year. That is \nthe freight for being married in America.\n\n  It is time for us to abandon that and say what we want in this \nculture is lasting, durable marriages and families that will provide \nthe basis for a culture in the next century which will allow America to \ncontinue to prosper and to lead. We cannot do that if we have a value \nsystem reflected in a budget which attacks America's principle of \nstrong families rather than reinforces that principle.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to reject this budget and to call \nfor a budget which would reduce the impact and size and onerous burden \nof the Federal Government and to empower the people to make decisions \nthat will foster families and institutions at the local level with the \nrequisite strength to preserve and protect America's greatness.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I am here today to discuss aspects of \nthe budget. Today we continue the discussion on our 1999 budget, and I \nam generally pleased with the work that the committee has done. I am \ngenerally optimistic about our country as we progress, but today I wish \nto place an emphasis on education with a special emphasis on the \ncongressional responsibility for the education of the children of the \nDistrict of Columbia, the Nation's Capital.\n  In 1995, when the Republicans took over the leadership role in \nCongress, I became chairman of the subcommittee responsible for \neducation on the Labor and Human Resources Committee. I also, as No. 13 \nin seniority on the Appropriations Committee, became the subcommittee \nchairman on the DC Appropriations Subcommittee.\n  Although I left the Appropriations Committee in 1997 to go to the \nFinance Committee, I vowed to continue my work for the schoolchildren \nof the District. I did so to follow through with the work I helped \nstart in 1996, with the writing of the new education plan for the \nDistrict.\n  Also, when I became chairman of the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee, I believed I had a special obligation for education in the \nDistrict of Columbia. The Constitution, through the District clause, \nconfirmed by the Supreme Court, endows in Congress the same powers over \nthe District of Columbia that a State has--not only powers but \nresponsibilities. Thus, Congress is responsible under the Constitution \nfor the District's education. We must not forget that.\n  As Republicans, we believe strongly that State and local governments \nare the key players in establishing education policy. This conviction \nworks beautifully for every State in the Nation except for the Nation's \nCapital. What an irony. We, as Republicans in leadership of this \nCongress, have not fully recognized that under the Constitution we must \nact as both the State entity for the District and the local governing \nentity for education.\n  In 1996, Congress did recognize that the District's educational \nsystem was indeed in trouble; in fact, the whole city was in deep \ntrouble.\n  The control board was established to help the District's education \ncrisis. The present DC education reform plan was written in the 1996 \nappropriations bill with assistance from Congressman Steve Gunderson, \nwho had strong support from the Speaker, and also with the help of the \nthen-Senate majority leader, Bob Dole. The implementation of this plan \nbegan in earnest under the leadership of General Becton and continues \nunder Chief Academic Officer Arlene Ackerman. They recently gave a \nnationally known student achievement test to evaluate basic student \nperformance in the District. It clearly established a severe problem. \nThe Nation's Capital, for which we are constitutionally responsible, \nhas the worst educational results in the country, including the worst \nstudent dropout rate of close to 40 percent.\n  In addition, through decades of neglect, the District of Columbia has \none of the worst school infrastructure problems in the Nation. GSA \nfound that $2 billion of repairs and improvements are needed.\n  When I took the chairmanship of the DC Appropriations Subcommittee in \n1995, I immediately met with the superintendent, then-Superintendent \nFranklin Smith, who was a member of the DC school board.\n  They all had great intentions and great plans. And, in fact, they had \ngreat plans and great intentions for many years, but evaluation results \ngot worse, not better. This was true even though teachers were teaching \nto the same tests they had been using since 1978. They told them what \nthe tests were going to be. It was obvious that the superintendent of \nthe school board had no control over the system.\n  The control board had been established realizing the dimension of the \nproblem. This is back in 1996. They knew that the firm leadership with \nappropriate authority had to be established. In my mind, the board very \nwisely chose two generals to answer that challenge--General Williams as \nfinancial officer and General Becton as superintendent. In my opinion, \nthe generals, with considerable personal sacrifice, performed \nadmirably, and ably. We are indebted.\n  In particular, General Becton is a unique individual. He is 70-plus, \nbut\n\n[[Page S2752]]\n\nlooks 50, and has the energy of a 40-year-old. He is personable and \ntough. Although not primarily an educator, his accomplishments as \npresident of Prairie View A University proved his ability in this \nfield. He got the job done. They both got the job done. The generals \nhad to kick a lot of butts. Friends are not made that way, wounded \ncritics are. But they got results.\n  Per-pupil costs are down to within the average in the Washington \nmetropolitan region, a constant source of irritation with many Members \nwho claim they add all this money. They do not anymore. Personnel \nnumbers had been reduced. Many inefficient managers were replaced. The \ncongressionally enacted school reforms are being implemented. Tough \ndecisions, such as ending social promotion, have been made; and that is \na tough one. This, of course, has created a great need for remedial \nhelp for tens of thousands of kids who must improve to warrant \ngraduation.\n  A most qualified chief academic officer, soon to be superintendent, \nArlene Ackerman, has been hired. The challenges before her are \ndaunting. The dimension of the remedial help required for ending social \npromotion, not only in Washington but nationwide, has not yet been \nfully appreciated. She will need our help. She must have our help.\n  As mentioned above, the education infrastructure is in a shameful \ncondition after decades of neglect, requiring $2 billion worth of \nimprovements. Fortunately, Parents United had been formed some time ago \nand has brought a lawsuit to enforce corrective action.\n  Unfortunately, after Generals Williams and Becton had initiated their \nplans for school repairs, and finally having funding available in a \nmanner that would not have required any closing of the schools, the \njudge, in her frustration, ordered the schools closed anyway. This \ncaused emergency actions in contracting to get the schools opened and \nraised the costs considerably. I was present with the control board \neducation trustees the night this happened. They did what they had to \ndo. In fairness to the judge, her frustration, expressed in her ruling, \nraised the public's awareness to the deplorable condition of the \nschools.\n  But where will the $2 billion needed for repairs come from? Congress \nis responsible for making it available. This may require money from the \nbudget, it may not, but it has to be found. Bonding is obvious, but how \nis it to be paid for?\n  This January, I held hearings on the DC school situation. I have \nattached Professor Raskin's applicable testimony that the Constitution \nrequires us to find the funds.\n\n  At the beginning of 1997, I left the Appropriations Committee and \nwent to the Finance Committee. I vowed to continue to fight for funds \nfor DC. During reconciliation, I nearly got an amendment for $1 billion \npassed in the committee. The Senate did provide $50 million for the \nrepairs of the Washington, DC, schools--a small amount, relatively, to \nthe $2 billion.\n  In conference with the House, at the House's insistence, the $50 \nmillion was cut. But OMB Director Frank Raines agreed to work with me \nto find the money. He asked me to put together a working group. This \nhas been done. To help prepare material for the working group, I held \nthree days of hearings in January. Material from these hearings has \nbeen forwarded to the members of the working group.\n  I have also outlined several options for the working group's \nconsideration. Some require no Federal funds; others are completely \nFederally funded. Somewhere we have to find the answer. I hope we can \nfurnish guidance soon. I have attached materials showing the need for \ncongressional action, as the DC financial system under present \ncircumstances cannot provide a sufficient revenue stream to pay for \nbonds.\n  Let us end on a positive note. Progress is being made to improve the \nDC school system. I recently traveled to Chicago with General Becton. I \nalso traveled to Long Beach, CA, with Arlene Ackerman. These school \nsystems are examples of sound reform where corrective action is being \ntaken. We learned a great deal on these trips. And work is starting \nhere.\n  First, we must make sure children can read and comprehend. Programs \nsuch as Everybody Wins!, a literacy-mentoring program I am deeply \ninvolved with, have been started, helping thousands of youngsters. \nHundreds of our volunteers come from the Senate, and they have been \ndoing a wonderful job in bringing the reading situation in that school \nunder control, but thousands more are needed to help. The flow of \nnonreaders to upper grades must stop. Substantial growth here is \nexpected by next year in these programs. There are two others called \nthe President's Program for Reading and also another one called the \nEverybody Reads Program started by the District.\n  To help the students ``in the pipeline,'' summer schools will be \nheld. The second thing: A group to find remedial solutions through \ninformation technology has been formed. Much needs to be done.\n  No. 3, legislation has been introduced, S. 1070--my bill--to form \nregional efforts in skill training, giving an opportunity for those \nyoung people to be able to get those $30,000 to $50,000 jobs, high-\npaying jobs, that are available and can be filled.\n  No. 4, I also met with the presidents of regional universities and \ncolleges to work together with the business community to form a \ncohesive, seamless educational system, for which the comprehensive \nframework should be established by the end of May. And that is \ncritical. We have the resources in this region, we have the people in \nthis region, but we must work together to all do what we can for the \nschool system.\n  No. 5, the critical needs for in-service training of teachers must be \nmet. The Department of Education and the local teacher colleges are \npledged to help. I just met with some from the Department of Education. \nThe Higher Education Act soon will be out on the Senate floor, and that \nwill help, also across the Nation, to assist us with respect to the \nserious problems we have with our schools not having the professional \ndevelopment necessary.\n\n  Let me close by emphasizing that our problems in education will end \nonly when the classrooms provide the appropriate education. This is a \nprimary responsibility of the States and local school districts. Just \nremember, as for DC, under the Constitution, DC is our ``State.'' And \nwe are responsible for our local schools, those in the Nation's \nCapital. Right now, we have the worst schools in the Nation. They must \nand they should be the best.\n  Madam President, at this time I would like to turn to another \neducation issue dealing with the budget also, and I just alert the \nBudget Committee as to what is being done.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Jeffords pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1882 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Finally, I will talk to another matter which will have \nan impact upon the budget also. Hopefully, CBO comes up with figures \nyou like; these figures are so small in terms of what the good is we \nshould find no cause for alarm here.\n  I rise to discuss an issue that is critically important to this \nNation. Today there are millions of people with disabilities who want \nto work but just cannot. Why? Because the day they start work they lose \naccess to affordable health insurance. These bright, intelligent, and \nvery willing individuals are denied the right that every other citizen \nin this Nation has--the right to work. We have the responsibility to \nreverse this desperate situation and grant people with disabilities the \nright to become productive, taxpaying workers.\n  Last week, I introduced legislation with Senator Kennedy and Senator \nHarkin entitled the Work Incentives Improvement Act. This bill will \nreform Social Security's work incentive programs and remove employment \nbarriers for people with a disability. This legislation was developed \nover many months with the help of the disability community, the Social \nSecurity Administration, the Health Care Financing Administration and \nother congressional offices. This bill will end the insurmountable \nhealth barriers to individuals who wish to work.\n  Our friends with disabilities do not need an incentive to work. They \nwant to work. In fact, they are so desperate to obtain gainful \nemployment that they are pushing this Congress to complete action on \nthis legislation this year. And we must. These citizens are trapped by \na system that penalizes their attempts to be productive. Social\n\n[[Page S2753]]\n\nSecurity's current work incentive system has had limited success. Out \nof 7.5 million people who are social security disability beneficiaries, \nless than one percent can take advantage of these work incentives and \nactually are employed. The benefits offered are too expensive, time \nlimited, and offer too few health care services for the many persons \nwith disabilities who wish to work.\n  For many years I have assessed why so few disabled social security \nbeneficiaries return to work. The primary barriers relate to their \ninability to obtain or keep adequate and affordable health care \ncoverage. For example, disabled social security beneficiaries who \nreturn to work are covered through Medicare, but after 39 months they \nmust pay full fare for their health benefits--more than $370 every \nmonth. I seriously doubt that even a well-off person can afford to pay \nthis rate every month over the course of their working life. In fact, \nout of more than 3.5 million beneficiaries, only 114 have chosen to \ntake advantage of this Medicare coverage, preferring the alternative--\nstaying at home and receiving it for free. I don't know whether they \nprefer it; that is probably not right.\n  Another barrier to work is the inability to get coverage for certain \nmedical services. These services are usually unavailable in the private \nmarkets. If they are available, they are unaffordable. Necessities like \npersonal assistance services and prescription drug coverage are offered \nthrough some state Medicaid plans, but disabled social security \nbeneficiaries who need access to these Medicaid services must \nimpoverish themselves to get them. Many are doing just that. These \ndisabled social security individuals who have coverage for low-income \nMedicaid, called ``dual eligibles,'' are the fastest growing \nentitlement population in the government.\n  The Work Incentives Improvement Act will provide access to \nappropriate health insurance for those persons with disabilities who \nwish to return to work. Many of these beneficiaries will be eligible \nfor affordable Medicare. Beneficiaries will have access to limited \nMedicaid services through State Work Options Programs. They will be \nable to access critical services like Personal Assistance and \nprescription drugs in states that chose to offer them. Such incentives \nwill allow people to return to work, confident in the knowledge that \nthey will both keep their health care and get coverage for other needed \nservices.\n  No one in this body can disagree with the idea that work is a central \npart of the American dream. This budget resolution should provide \nfunding for these and other initiatives designed to allow people with \ndisabilities to work. Providing cost-effective assistance for people to \nwork is both fiscally responsible and morally right. Those who work \nwill become fully contributing members of society by paying for their \nown insurance coverage, and as taxpaying citizens of our nation, paying \nfor these government programs as a whole.\n  Inaction by this body will ensure that our Government continues to \ndeny a person's dream to get back to work to help himself, to help \nherself, to pay taxes, to be able to participate in our society in a \nmeaningful way. I hope the Senate will move ahead to resolve this \nproblem and help persons with disabilities realize their dream to work.\n  I wish everyone had a chance to be at the press conference we held \nwith former leader Bob Dole and Justin Dart and other leaders in this \nfield to see the expression on their faces and the joy that came when \nwe announced what we would do to help those who were assembled to be \nable to participate in the workplace. I can assure Members that this \nbill--we have had CBO estimates much lower than previous estimates. It \nis hard to conceive why it costs money because all you are doing is \nallowing people benefits to work and to start paying taxes and to \ncontribute to the cost.\n  It is very difficult for me to see how there is any cost whatever. I \nyield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/30/senate-section/article/S2733-2", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2753-S2754]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          EDUCATION SAVINGS ACT FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. As everybody knows by now all too well, we have been \nin the midst of a filibuster going all the way back to last summer on \neducation reform proposals. We have been battling the White House, the \nminority leadership and the status quo. I am pleased to announce--in \nfact, I am ecstatic--that the filibuster is over and that a unanimous \nconsent has been entered into, I think a reasonable agreement, that \ndoes adhere to our view that all amendments should have been related to \neducation and not extraneous and not broad new tax policy. We will go \nto our education reform on the day we return from the recess on April \n20 of this year.\n  Now, the majority leader needs to be commended for the diligence and \nthe attention he gave to try to end this filibuster. I also am \ncomplimentary of the minority leader and his attempt to bring this \nfilibuster to an end. But I am especially grateful to the Members on \nthe other side of the aisle, principally my key cosponsor, Senator \nTorricelli of New Jersey, for the attempts and effort they made--under \nvery difficult circumstances I might add--for an extended period of \ntime to recommend that a filibuster was not the way to handle education \nreform.\n  Because the filibuster has been ended, America's children are going \nto be the major beneficiaries--and their families. At the end of the \nday, millions of American families are going to be able to open \neducation savings accounts to help children in public schools, private \nschools and home schools. Now with the suggestions from the other side \nof the aisle, we are going to have an opportunity for expanded school \nconstruction and financing that aids and abets school construction \nacross our Nation.\n\n  After all is said and done, bringing this to a favorable conclusion \nwill lead to a very healthy and wholesome debate about reforming \neducation and moving away from the status quo. Madam President, the \nwinners, those who are going to gain the most from the fact that we \nhave set this filibuster aside, are America's children. They are going \nto be the beneficiaries of the fact that the Senate has now, on a \nbipartisan basis, agreed to go to an extended and meaningful debate \nabout reforming education in America, principally grades kindergarten \nthrough high school.\n  I thank all who have been involved on both sides of the aisle. I \nthink it will prove most beneficial to America and her children.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I will take just a moment. I did want to \nrespond ever so briefly to the remarks of Senator Coverdell.\n  I did not object to the unanimous consent request by which we will \nconsider the Coverdell proposal. Amendments have now been made in order \nand the proposal will be considered on the floor of the Senate in a way \nthat limits the amendments and limits the time for each amendment.\n  I say the Senator from Georgia puts his own construct on exactly what \nhas happened. There is another construct, and that is that this was not \na filibuster but a lockout--circumstances where we were told that a \nbill was to come to the floor of the Senate, a bill dealing with tax \ncredits for education, and the only circumstance under which it could \ncome to the floor of the Senate is if those on the minority side would \nbe willing to restrict their amendments both as to type of amendments \nand as to time.\n  It is a very unusual Senate procedure. It is not a procedure that has \nbeen followed by the majority side, I might say. As one Member of the \nSenate who will not want to see this habit-forming, I simply say to the \nSenator from Georgia that I am happy he will get his day on this piece \nof legislation. The amendments have indeed been limited. I think he \nwould not want to be in a similar circumstance on the next issue on \nwhich someone on this side would, if in the majority, say we would like \nto bring our bill to the floor, and by the way, we will only do that in \nways that restrict your opportunity to offer amendments, and only do \nthat in ways that restrict the time of the amendments that you do \noffer.\n  For example, among the ideas that exist here are not just an idea to \nprovide tax credits for people who send their children to nonpublic \nschools--all schools, but especially nonpublic schools; among the ideas \nthat exist\n\n[[Page S2754]]\n\nhere are, for example, a proposal to provide some assistance to repair \nsome of the crumbling schools in this country, not so that the Federal \nGovernment will be involved in rebuilding local schools--that is the \njob of local school districts, State and local governments --but an \nincentive in a way that says we can at least pay some of the interest \non the bonds that provide the right incentive to invest in our schools \nbecause so many of them are now 30, 50, 70 years old and more, and some \nof them are in desperate condition and need help.\n  On that amendment, for example, under this agreement there will be, I \nbelieve, 1 hour of debate. A significant amendment of significant \nimportance, but the Senate will only devote 1 hour to that subject \nbecause to devote more would somehow abridge the interests of those who \nwant to contain the debate on education here in the Senate.\n\n  I use that as an example. There are others. I say to the Senator from \nGeorgia, I did not, since the first day of this discussion, feel the \nproblem was a filibuster. I felt and still do feel very strongly the \nproblem is that the majority leader said this is our bill, this is our \nagenda, it is what we feel is important, and we will bring it to the \nfloor, but you must comply with what we expect of you. Don't you be \noffering amendments we don't want. Don't you be demanding time for your \namendment to talk for 3 hours on school construction, for example--and \nthat was what was happening to us over all of these weeks and what \nresulted in a number of cloture votes.\n  So I see it differently than does the Senator from Georgia. But as I \nindicated, he will have his day on his amendment, and I have indicated \npreviously I have great respect for him, but this ought not be habit-\nforming. This is not the way the Senate works with respect to the \ncurrent rules of the Senate. It is not the way your side of the aisle \ndealt with issues when you were in the minority, and I don't think you \nwould expect us to deal with these issues in that manner on a routine \nbasis.\n  As I said, I did not object to the unanimous consent request after \nthis had been worked out by the majority leader and the minority \nleader. Education is critically important. In my judgment, there aren't \nmany more important issues than education here in the U.S. Senate. This \nought to be job one for the Senate to deal with the critical education \nissues. We have now a list of them, albeit limited in time and scope \nwith respect to the amendments, but when we get to this issue we will \nhave, I think, a good and thoughtful and constructive debate.\n  I stand today to say do not make it habit-forming to say it is our \nagenda and we will demand every other Senator in this place who is not \npart of the majority conform to our description of how we want to \ndebate these amendments, because that is not the way the Senate should \nwork.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/30/senate-section/article/S2753-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2754-S2759]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET FOR THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR \n                    1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, AND 2003\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.    . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING SCHOOL MODERNIZATION \n                   AND CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the General Accounting Office has performed a \n     comprehensive survey of the Nation's public elementary and \n     secondary school facilities and has found severe levels of \n     disrepair in all areas of the United States;\n       (2) the General Accounting Office has concluded that more \n     than 14,000,000 children attend schools in need of extensive \n     repair or replacement, 7,000,000 children attend schools with \n     life safety code violations, and 12,000,000 children attend \n     schools with leaky roofs;\n       (3) the General Accounting Office has found the problem of \n     crumbling schools transcends demographic and geographic \n     boundaries. At 38 percent of urban schools, 30 percent of \n     rural schools, and 29 percent of suburban schools, at least \n     one building is in need of extensive repair or should be \n     completely replaced;\n       (4) the condition of school facilities has a direct effect \n     on the safety of students and teachers and on the ability of \n     students to learn. Academic research has provided a direct \n     correlation between the condition of school facilities and \n     student achievement. At Georgetown University, researchers \n     have found the test scores of students assigned to schools in \n     poor condition can be expected to fall 10.9 percentage points \n     below the test scores of students in buildings in excellent \n     condition. Similar studies have demonstrated up to a 20 \n     percent improvement in test scores when students were moved \n     from a poor facility to a new facility;\n       (5) the General Accounting Office has found most schools \n     are not prepared to incorporate modern technology in the \n     classroom. Forty-six percent of schools lack adequate \n     electrical wiring to support the full-scale use of \n     technology. More than a third of schools lack the requisite \n     electrical power. Fifty-six percent of schools have \n     insufficient phone lines for modems;\n       (6) the Department of Education has reported that \n     elementary and secondary school enrollment, already at a \n     record high level, will continue to grow over the next 10 \n     years, and that in order to accommodate this growth, the \n     United States will need to build an additional 6,000 schools;\n       (7) the General Accounting Office has determined the cost \n     of bringing schools up to good, overall condition to be \n     $112,000,000,000, not including the cost of modernizing \n     schools to accommodate technology, or the cost of building \n     additional facilities needed to meet record enrollent levels;\n       (8) schools run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) for \n     Native American children are also in dire need of repair and \n     renovation. The General Accounting Office has reported that \n     the cost of total inventory repairs needed for BIA facilities \n     is $754,000,000. The December 1997 report by the Comptroller \n     General of the United States states that, ``Compared with \n     other schools nationally, BIA schools are generally in poorer \n     physical condition, have more unsatisfactory environmental \n     factors, more often lack key facilities requirements for \n     education reform, and are less able to support computer and \n     communications technology;''\n       (9) State and local financing mechanisms have proven \n     inadequate to meet the challenges facing today's aging school \n     facilities. Large numbers of local educational agencies have \n     difficulties securing financing for school facility \n     improvement;\n       (10) the Federal Government has provided resources for \n     school construction in the past. For example, between 1933 \n     and 1939, the Federal Government assisted in 70 percent of \n     all new school construction; and\n       (11) the Federal Government can support elementary and \n     secondary school facilities without interfering in issues of \n     local control, and should help communities leverage \n     additional funds for the improvement of elementary and \n     secondary school facilities.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     budget resolution assume the enactment of legislation to \n     allow States and school districts to issue $21.8 billion \n     worth of zero-interest school modernization bonds to rebuild \n     and modernize our Nation's schools, and to provide Federal \n     income tax credits to the purchasers of those bonds in lieu \n     of interest payments.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2176\n\n (Purpose: To increase Function 500 discretionary budget authority and \n outlays to accommodate an initiative promoting after-school education \n                              and safety)\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I will say a word on the amendment \noffered on behalf of myself, Senator Lautenberg, and others. The \npurpose of that amendment is to make possible comprehensive tobacco \nlegislation on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  As the occupant of the chair knows, in the Budget Committee a \nresolution came out that provides that the funding from any possible \nresolution of the tobacco issue can only go for Medicare. While \nMedicare is clearly a key priority, there are other priorities as well. \nAmong those are the question of preventing kids from taking up a habit. \nThe experts have all told us that we need to use some of the funds for \nthe purpose of tobacco prevention programs, smoking cessation programs, \ncounter-tobacco advertising programs, to increase health research, to \nprovide some easing of the transition for tobacco farmers, and also to \nfund the expanded role of FDA and the question of regulating these \nproducts.\n  The experts have told us, unanimously, that there is simply no way to \nhave comprehensive tobacco control legislation without those priorities \nbeing included. In fact, every single bill that has been introduced \nthat is comprehensive in nature on the floor of the Senate, by \nRepublicans and Democrats, provides for taking some of that money for \nthose purposes. Unfortunately, under the budget resolution, every \nsingle comprehensive bill--those introduced on the Republican side and \nthose introduced on the Democratic side--is out of order. Not a single \none\n\n[[Page S2756]]\n\nof the bills would be in order under the budget resolution as it came \nout of the committee.\n  So the amendment offered by myself, Senator Lautenberg, Senator \nBingaman, and Senator Reed is to correct that deficiency, to allow the \nSenate to work its will on comprehensive tobacco legislation, so that \nwe have a chance when we finally get to a discussion of the tobacco \nbills, that the budget resolution is not an impediment to passing \nnational tobacco policy.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator will yield for a question.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, the provision in the budget prohibits \nthe use of any of the funds from the tobacco settlement for the range \nof programs, such as the program for smoking cessation, for education, \nto try to prevent teens from beginning smoking; is it the case that \nthis budget provision prevents the use of any of the tobacco settlement \nmoney for any of those programs?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes, exactly. It seems startling, but that is what the \nbudget resolution provides. The resolution says that not one dime of \nany tobacco settlement money can go for tobacco smoking cessation, \nsmoking prevention, or any of the other programs that all of the \nexperts have said are required. We could not have any of this money go \nfor the National Institutes of Health and Research. We could not use \nany of the money for the expanded FDA role in regulating tobacco \nproducts. None of the money could be used for counter-tobacco \nadvertising programs. Every single expert that has come to us has said \nthose are essential to a comprehensive plan to actually reduce teen \nsmoking. So the budget resolution is clearly deficient in that regard.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield further for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I understand that those who put this prohibition in the \nbudget agreement said, ``But there are areas in the budget and other \nareas that expend money for these programs, so these programs are not \nbeing shorted.''\n  Can the Senator describe whether in fact the money is available in \nother programs sufficient to address these issues?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Well, that is the convention of those who debated this \nissue in the Budget Committee. They said, ``Well, we have provided the \nfunding elsewhere in the budget . . .''--not out of the tobacco \nrevenues, which is a curious thing if you think about it. Since these \nare clearly tobacco-related expenses, you would think you would fund \nthem out of the tobacco revenue. They said, ``Don't worry, we funded it \nsomewhere else.''\n  Let me say to the Senator that there is not any assurance that there \nwould be one thin dime anywhere else in the budget for that purpose \nbecause, as you know, the Budget Committee does not make those \ndeterminations. What has been set up by the Budget Committee is mounds \nof money that would be a jump ball. The appropriators would decide. You \nserve on the appropriation committee and you understand that the Budget \nCommittee gives you an overall spending limit and you decide what the \npriorities are. If you decided that existing priorities were more \nimportant, there might not be any money for smoking cessation, smoking \nprevention, counter-tobacco advertising, and all the rest. So that is \nthe problem with the budget resolution. They have an assumption in \nthere. The assumption is that the appropriators will provide something \nover $100 million a year for these purposes, but every single major \nbill that is out here provides $2 billion a year for these purposes--\nsmoking prevention, smoking cessation, counter-tobacco advertising, \nexpanded health research, FDA authority--and so there is no way that \nthis comes anywhere close to meeting the need.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I have one additional question. The \nSenator indicated that the Budget Committee does not determine the \nlevel of expenditures--the actual expenditures. That is the \nAppropriations Committee's job. I agree with that. But it is true that \nthe Budget Committee, with this provision, will determine what you \ncannot expend money for. They, apparently, by this provision, \ndetermined that any money coming from the tobacco settlement cannot and \nwill not be used for these specific areas--smoking cessation, curbing \nteen smoking, a National Institutes of Health investment, and so on.\n  So is it not the case that, while they don't determine what the money \nis going to be spent for, they are with this provision trying to \ndetermine what you cannot spend the money for? I guess it would require \nat least a 60-vote provision on the floor to overturn what they are \ntrying to prevent. Can the Senator tell me why on earth the Budget \nCommittee--because the Senator serves on that committee--can bring a \nbill to the floor that says we are going to have a tobacco settlement, \nbut, by the way, you can't use any money from the settlement to deal \nwith teen smoking, or addiction, or smoking cessation? What on earth \ncould have persuaded them to provide a provision like this in the \nbudget bill?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I tell you, I have no idea. I will respond in this way. I \nfind it the most curious thing that has happened all year--why you \nwould provide a special reserve fund so that if there is tobacco \nlegislation that passes, you can have the revenue flow to the Federal \nTreasury; but then you say, when we go to spend the money, none of it \ncan be used for smoking cessation, smoking prevention, counter-tobacco \nadvertising, expanded health research, funding the FDA so that they can \nattend to their added responsibilities under any of the bills that have \nbeen offered, by either Republicans or Democrats.\n\n  The curious thing is that every single bill that has been offered out \nhere, whether it is the bill of Senator Hatch, who is chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, the bill of Senator McCain, who is chairman of the \nCommerce Committee, or Senator Jeffords' bill, all those bills would be \nout of order. So you have three Republican chairmen who have offered \nbills out here, and their bills would be out of order under what has \nbeen provided for under the budget resolution.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, in listening to the debate brought \nforward through questions on the floor, I would like to put some \nfactual statements into the Record. First, the budget resolution puts \nSocial Security and Medicare first. I think people recall that the \nPresident was saying we should use any surplus to save Social Security, \nthat this is an important program and we need to invest and protect \nSocial Security and, therefore, we should take any surpluses and put it \ninto Social Security.\n  We agree, but we also believe that we should go one step further and \nsay that any extra funds and resources here should be used to preserve \nand protect Medicare as well. Medicare is an enormously important \nprogram to the American public. I don't know how many people remember \nlast year when we debated how to save, preserve, and protect Medicare. \nWhat is being talked about in the budget agreement is using the \nresources to save Medicare. Now, you can go a couple of ways here. You \ncan say, OK, I am going to use these resources to save Medicare, this \nenormous program that provides health care for over 35 million \nAmericans that have had a very difficult financial time, or you can say \nwe are going to start a whole bunch of other programs to do this--\nwhich, by the way, we are taking care of in other parts of the \nagreement. The Budget Committee decided to save and use these resources \nto preserve and protect Medicare. Let's take care of first things \nfirst, and Medicare is one of those programs. Instead of promising to \nspend billions of dollars on new programs, we propose to dedicate any \ntobacco receipts, if there are any, to Medicare solvency. Let's protect \nwhat we have first. I think that is an important point that needs to be \nbrought into this debate.\n  Madam President, I have an amendment to offer, but before I do that I \nwill yield to the Senator from Wyoming for a statement that he has. He \nhas been on the floor waiting for a longer period of time than I.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, my original intent was to give some \ncomments on amendment No. 2166. Before I\n\n[[Page S2757]]\n\ndo that, since the topic is opened up on the tobacco settlement, I feel \ncompelled to make a few statements based on what has been said on the \nfloor.\n  I am on the Labor Committee and that has been a part of the tobacco \nsettlement debate. I can tell you how far we have gotten on that \ncommittee. We have had a filibuster so far on the very issues the \nSenators from North Dakota have been saying they want to get into the \nbudget. So the progress on this thing has been so disappointing to me. \nLast week, when I was flying back from Wyoming--I go back almost every \nweekend, and it's quite a trip to get from there back to Washington--I \nstarted working on my laptop computer and listing the reasons why a \ntobacco settlement might not happen this year. There were three single-\nspaced pages on why it won't happen this year. I changed it to why it \nwon't happen this year.\n  What we are suggesting here is that we ought to go ahead and spend \nthe money anyway. I can't tell how the negotiations have gone that you \nhave been in, but I certainly never have liked to be in negotiations \nwith anybody where I had already spent the money I might get out of the \nprogram. That is why we are taking some precaution with that. That is \nwhy we are saying let's put it in Medicare. That is the biggest program \nthat we have to save that deals with health--particularly the health of \npeople in the United States. It is something we have to be concerned \nabout. We put that first. There can be changes made later. But after \nthat, there is some agreement from these three pages, single spaced, \nand reasons why 100 Senators here may not be able to come to any \nagreement on why there ought to be a tobacco settlement, let alone how \nthat tobacco settlement ought to take place.\n  Having said that, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak \nfor up to 10 minutes on amendment 2166, the Sessions-Enzi amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2166\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise today in support of amendment 2166 \nintroduced by me and my colleague and good friend from Alabama, Senator \nSessions. Our amendment is entitled the ``Antidiscrimination of At-Home \nParents Amendment.''\n  I am proud to lend my support of this amendment that would give at-\nhome parents, who forego a second income so that one parent can raise \ntheir children, the recognition by the federal government that they \ntruly deserve.\n  There has been a lot of talk about beefing up the quality and \navailability of child care across our nation. I, too, have played a \nrole in this debate and feel it's one to be taken seriously. Parents \nwho choose to enroll their kids in day care face a difficult decision--\none based on trust, reliability, the quality of care and, of course, \nthe high costs. Moreover, that decision touches one of our nation's \nmost important resources--our children.\n  Unfortunately, this debate has unfairly excluded married couples who \nface an even bigger decision--at-home care. There are more families \nthat fit this mold than I think many of us are aware. In fact, only 37 \npercent of mothers with children under the age of 6 are employed on a \nfull-time basis. The remaining percentage includes a constituency with \nlittle representation. That must change.\n  It is true that conditions can be difficult for two income families. \nI don't refute that. It is very hard for single, working moms to raise \nchildren. To be fair, however, we must not imply that families who \nchoose to keep one parent home with their children are not making \nsacrifices. For years now, the debate on family policy has been \ncentered on single working parents and day care. For years the sub-text \nof federal family policy has been that everyone should work and that \nthe burden of accommodation should be on those parents who choose to \nstay at home to raise their children. However, if the debate revolves \naround the quality of care our children receive, we must modify \nexisting federal policy and end this senseless discrimination.\n  It would seem at times as if all forces conspire against single \nincome families. America's tax burden has grown so large that in many \ninstances, a second parent has to work just to pay their families tax \nburden. A 1993 survey found that more than 50 percent of working women \nwould ``stay at home if money weren't an issue.'' Most families in \nwhich both parents work would much prefer to have one parent stay at \nhome with the children if expenses would allow.\n  The financial penalty inherent in having one parent stay at home to \nraise the children is large indeed. The few families who pursue such an \narrangement don't do it because they can easily afford it. They do it \nbecause they believe that it is best for their kids. It should not be \nthe work of this body to second guess their judgement of their values. \nMost importantly, these parents should not be discriminated against by \nits own federal government simply because they sacrifice greater \nfinancial gain for their children.\n  As you can see, there are a growing number of parents who give up one \nincome so that the mother or father can stay at home and be with their \nchildren. Not long ago, this decision to utilize at-home care was \ncommonplace. However, our nation's workplace has changed significantly \nas more parents move into the workforce--making parent's decision to \nsacrifice one income for their child all the more difficult. This is \ntruly saddening, because the people who can best care for our nation's \nchildren are the parents.\n  I have listened during the last few months to members implying that \nparents who choose to forego a second income to stay home with their \nchildren do so at no financial sacrifice. It has even been implied that \nsuch parents lead a life of luxury and self-indulgence while working \nmothers make the real sacrifice for their children. This notion is as \noffensive as it is unfounded.\n  Parents who decide to forego a second income so that one parent might \nbe at home during their children's formative years incur quite an \nexpense, as several members of my own staff can attest. I have two \nfathers on my staff that have made this difficult decision. One of \nthose parents on my staff spends four hours each work-day commuting to \nand from work--only because raising a family on a single, moderate \nincome simply cannot be done here in Washington, DC. I am confident \nthat parents all over the nation are in similar straits.\n  If the Senate is serious about issues facing our nation's children, \nthen it must not exclude parents who choose at-home care for the \nbenefit of their kids. If those parents are left out, then the message \nthis body sends about the quality of care for American's children is \nshort-sighted at best. This amendment is geared to provide that \nrecognition and I encourage all members of the Senate to carefully read \nit, cosponsor it, and vote in favor of its passage.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield the remainder of my time but reserve the time remaining for \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2177\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding economic growth, \n              Social Security, and Government efficiency)\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas (Mr. Brownback) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2177.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON ECONOMIC GROWTH, SOCIAL \n                   SECURITY, AND GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the functional totals \n     underlying this resolution assume that--\n       (1) the elimination of a discretionary spending program may \n     be used for either tax cuts or to reform the Social Security \n     system.\n       (2) the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Balanced \n     Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, and other \n     appropriate budget rules and laws should be amended to \n     implement the policy stated in paragraph (1).\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, this amendment to the budget \nresolution being considered before us today\n\n[[Page S2758]]\n\nwould make it a priority for this Congress to cut taxes and to begin \nshoring up our teetering Social Security system.\n  Madam President, before I begin I wish to commend Chairman Domenici \nand other Members for their excellent work on the budget committee. \nWhile I would prefer a budget that cut government spending more as well \nas cut taxes more; I appreciate the enormity of the task before the \nchairman and would like to compliment him for his leadership in this \narea. As well, I look forward to working with the chairman to both \nensure a more fiscally responsible government as well as lower taxes \nfor all Americans.\n  Madam President, I would like to begin by making a few remarks on the \nsize and scope of our federal government and the importance of keeping \nour promise with the American people by living up to the spending \nparameters outlined in the bipartisan budget deal reached last year \nbetween the Congress and the administration and with the American \npeople; and also to speak on the importance of honestly addressing the \nneed to begin reforming our Social Security system.\n  It is absolutely paramount and fundamental and something we must give \nour attention to.\n  Although many of us agree that the Federal government is too large, \nand too intrusive most of us seldom seem to be able to make the \nnecessary cuts to the federal government that will actually curtail its \nsize and curb its consumptive desires. In fact, the Administration \nwhich once declared that ``the era of big government is over,'' has now \nproposed an expansion of government programs that will have the effect \nof busting the bipartisan budget deal that was so difficult to get to \nin the first place. This is not only inconsistent but bad policy.\n  In contrast, I believe that it is imperative that we live within the \nconstraints agreed to last year during negotiations with the \nadministration. We had a deal. We had a deal with the administration \nthat set the limits on the size and scope of the federal government. \nAnd, we had a deal with the American people.\n  Now is not the time to walk away from the principles that we outlined \nin our bipartisan agreement just a few months ago simply because the \nbudget--thanks mostly to the entrepreneurial spirit of main street \nAmerica--is now near balance.\n  The fact of the matter is that our books aren't really balanced at \nall because we are continuing to allow the federal government to raid \nthe social security trust fund in order to finance its day to day \noperations. If a company in the private sector tried to do that they \nwould be shut down--and rightfully so.\n  If the President is serious about saving social security then he \nwould not continue raiding the Social Security trust fund to prop up \nhis government programs and he would not be proposing $140 billion in \nnew spending (which is coincidentally just a little more than expected \nsurplus receipts to the OASDI trust fund this year), rather he would be \ncutting government spending and paying down the debt in anticipation of \nunfunded future social security obligations. But he is doing just the \nopposite.\n  Because this administration doesn't want to lead, the Congress must. \nAnd my amendment takes the lead by prioritizing Social Security \nsolvency and tax cuts over more government spending and budget games.\n  Let's stop the nonsense.\n  Americans don't want more glib talk about big government programs \nsolving all of their problems. They don't want more empty promises. \nThey want a less intrusive government, they want lower taxes and they \ndeserve retirement security.\n  In order to help in our efforts to cut the size of the government I \nam offering an amendment expressing the sense of the Senate that we \nshould destroy the firewall between spending reductions and tax cuts; \nby allowing for government spending reductions to be used for either \ntax cuts or Social Security solvency.\n  Heretofore we have had a firewall between cutting domestic \ndiscretionary programs and paying for tax cuts, saying we can't cut \nthis to pay for tax cuts. I am saying let's have a provision such that \nyou can eliminate discretionary spending in certain categories and that \nmoney to be used to pay for tax cuts or Social Security solvency.\n  Currently, according to budget law Congress cannot make cuts in \ndiscretionary spending programs in order to finance tax cuts. Rather, \nCongress has to make cuts in mandatory spending programs like Social \nSecurity and Medicare in order to pay for its tax cuts. It is wrong to \npit Social Security against tax cuts.\n  My amendment flips the table on this false tradeoff by pitting Social \nSecurity and tax cuts against big Government spending on the other \nside. Let's use the cuts in big Government spending to support Social \nSecurity and tax cuts.\n  According to the current budget law every time someone wants to cut \ntaxes they are essentially forced to propose cuts in either social \nsecurity or Medicare. That just isn't right.\n  Our federal government is too large, and this arcane law is part of \nthe reason. We need to focus our efforts on cutting government \nspending--not increasing it. And I believe one way to help accelerate \nthe downsizing of our massive federal bureaucracy is by allowing cuts \nin discretionary spending to be used for tax cuts and Social Security \naccounts.\n  My amendment would call for a change in budget law that would allow \nfor tax cuts to be implemented in the amount of program eliminations \nand for saving Social Security. So, when we eliminate a program during \nconsideration of an appropriations measure that money would be credited \nto the PAYGO scorecard and reserved for tax cuts and Social Security.\n  Therefore, should my amendment pass and budget law be changed, we can \neliminate programs like the Advanced Technology Program, the National \nEndowment for the Arts, the Department of Commerce, and a whole host of \nother government programs while at the same time giving the taxpayers \nthe tax relief they deserve and the retirement security they need--and \nwe can do it without making draconian cuts to mandatory spending \nprograms that ultimately do little to save the programs and much to \nsimply prolong the crisis.\n  With my amendment we can eliminate wasteful programs and at the same \ntime provide the American taxpayers with a solvent Social Security \nSystem along with the tax relief that they deserve.\n  That is why I am offering this amendment. We can begin to cut taxes \nand to reform our Social Security system by transforming the debate \nabout Social Security from rhetoric into reality.\n  We have a unique opportunity to substantively begin to reform our \nsocial security system in order to ensure long-run solvency.\n  We have this opportunity in large part because for the first time in \nover a generation we will have a balanced budget this fiscal year.\n  This presents Congress with a chance to begin making changes to the \nSocial Security system that will both protect current benefits for \nretirees, and those about to retire, as well as to help preserve \nbenefits for future generations.\n  We must make use of this historic opportunity to cut more government \nspending and to use those cuts along with the unified budget surplus to \nhelp shore up the Social Security trust fund.\n  My amendment begins the process of reforming our government by making \nit a priority for this Congress to cut taxes and to begin shoring up \nour teetering Social Security system.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2178\n\n   (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the use of \n  agricultural trade programs to promote the export of United States \n                 agricultural commodities and products)\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I send the desk an amendment to the \nbudget.\n\n[[Page S2759]]\n\n It is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. I ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Burns] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2178.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING AGRICULTURAL TRADE \n                   PROGRAMS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the functional totals in \n     this concurrent resolution assume the Secretary of \n     Agriculture will use agricultural trade programs established \n     by law to promote, to the maximum extent practicable, the \n     export of United States agricultural commodities and \n     products.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, this is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. \nEvery year, we have authorized and we have appropriated moneys for \nprograms sponsored by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to help market \ngrain abroad; in other words, to beef up our exports and to be able to \ncompete in the international market.\n  We are going through times now where prices are very, very stressed \nand depressed, I would say. We need all the help we can get to move the \nsupply that we have into foreign hands after the collapse of the \nfinancial markets in the Pacific rim that have been major buyers of our \nagricultural commodities. Of course, the actions of the IMF and what \nthis country has undertaken to help those countries out of that \nfinancial condition will help those of us who depend heavily on \nagricultural exports.\n  This is just a sense of the Senate to tell the USDA and the \nInternational Trade Representative that we need help. It does no good \nto put the loaded pistol in the holster if the USDA doesn't pull it in \ntimes when we really need it. The time is now. This is just a sense of \nthe Senate to say that we have authorized it, we have funded it, and we \nhope the USDA will use it.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Kennedy's name \nbe added as a cosponsor to the Conrad amendment No. 2174.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nEnzi be added as a cosponsor to S. 1873, the American Missile \nProtection Act of 1998.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, this bill was introduced by Senator \nInouye and me on March 19. After we sent a letter to all Senators \ninviting cosponsors, we received a very positive response. I am pleased \nto advise the Senate that with the addition of Senator Enzi, there are \nnow 40 cosponsors of S. 1873.\n  This bill would make it the policy of the United States to deploy as \nsoon as technologically possible an effective national missile defense \nsystem capable of defending the territory of the United States against \nlimited ballistic missile attack, whether accidental, unauthorized or \ndeliberate.\n  We believe this policy is necessary because of the growing \nproliferation threat. The proliferation threat includes both weapons of \nmass destruction and long-range ballistic missile delivery systems.\n  The fact is that determining how quickly the United States will be \nfacing an ICBM threat from a rogue nation is difficult to estimate. The \nDirector of Central Intelligence recognized this point last year when \nhe said to the Senate, ``Gaps and uncertainties preclude a good \nprojection of exactly when `rest of the world' countries will deploy \nICBMs.''\n\n  That ``gaps and uncertainties'' exist is not an indictment of our \nintelligence agencies. We have many fine and dedicated people in the \nintelligence community who have devoted their professional careers to \nobtaining information about and analyzing proliferation. But it is \nextremely difficult to predict accurately just how quickly technology \nwill move forward and will be made in certain countries.\n  Predicting the rate of technological advance would be difficult even \nif rogue states were to accept no outside assistance in their pursuit \nof mass destruction weapons and missile delivery platforms of ever-\nincreasing range. But adding the knowledge now available in the \ninformation age to anyone with a computer and a telephone line to the \nfact that some nations are actively assisting pursuit of these \ncapabilities makes for a situation in which predictions can be outdated \nsoon after they are made.\n  Take, for example, the case of the Shahab-3 and Shahab-4, two \nintermediate-range ballistic missiles Iran is pursuing with substantial \nhelp from Russian organizations. Last Friday's Washington Times carried \nan article entitled ``Pentagon Confirms Details on Iranian Missiles.'' \nIt describes this situation, and I think it is very alarming.\n  It is no secret that Iran is pursuing these missiles. The Shahab-3, \nwith a range of 1,300 kilometers, will be capable of striking U.S. \nforces throughout the Middle East and our close allies in the region as \nwell. The Shahab-4, with a range of 2,000 kilometers, will be able to \nreach into Central Europe.\n  We all understand that neither of these missiles will have the range \nto strike the United States unless they are launched from some kind of \na mobile platform, like a ship. But the important point is that these \nmissiles are proceeding at a much more rapid pace than anticipated just \nlast year, and the reason these missiles can be ready sooner than we \nexpected is because of Russian expertise provided to Iran.\n  In February the Director of Central Intelligence testified to the \nSenate:\n\n       . . . since I testified, Iran's success in getting \n     technology and materials from Russian companies, combined \n     with recent indigenous Iranian advances, means that it could \n     have a medium-range missile much sooner than I assessed last \n     year.\n\n  Madam President, the very kind of outside assistance that is speeding \nthis Shahab-3 along so rapidly could also contribute in a similar way \nto the acquisition of long-range ballistic missiles by rogue nations. \nThese kinds of nations are interested in ICBMs because they make the \nUnited States vulnerable to coercion or intimidation in time of crisis. \nIt is a vulnerability that disappears when an effective national \nmissile defense is deployed.\n  That is why we have introduced the American Missile Protection Act of \n1998. America should end its ICBM vulnerability as soon as the \ntechnology is available.\n  Madam President, given the uncertainties about just when other \nnations will possess ICBMs, it only makes sense to be clear now in our \ncommitment to deploy defenses against these systems as soon as the \ntechnology is ready. If the choice is to deploy a national missile \ndefense capable against a limited threat 1 year too soon or 1 year too \nlate, let it be 1 year too soon. The lesson of the Shahab-3 is that \neven the best intentioned estimates can be wrong.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Madam President, that the article I referred \nto from the Washington Times be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Mar. 27, 1998]\n\n             Pentagon Confirms Details on Iranian Missiles\n\n                            (By Bill Gertz)\n\n       The Pentagon identified Iran's two medium-range ballistic \n     missiles for the first\n\n[[Page S2760]]\n\n     time publicly this week, giving their ranges and also \n     providing details on an older Chinese nuclear-tipped missile.\n       Iran's Shahab-3 missile will have a range of about 800 \n     miles and a second version, the Shahab-4, will be able to hit \n     targets as far as 1,240 miles away, according to Senate \n     testimony by Air Force Lt. Gen. Lester Lyles, director of the \n     Ballistic Missile Defense Organization.\n       It was the first time the Pentagon has confirmed the \n     existence of the Shahab missiles, which were disclosed last \n     year by The Washington Times.\n       U.S. intelligence officials have said the missiles could be \n     deployed within two years and that both Russia and China \n     provided materials and technology.\n       ``The development of long-range ballistic missiles is part \n     of Iran's effort to become a major regional military power \n     and Iran could field a [medium-range ballistic missile] \n     system in the first half of the next decade,'' a Pentagon \n     official said.\n       The chart made public Tuesday identified the Iranian and \n     Chinese missiles as potential targets for U.S. regional \n     missile defense systems under development. It was part of \n     Gen. Lyles' testimony before the Senate Armed Services \n     Committee.\n       The chart also listed the range of China's CSS-2 nuclear \n     missile, which has a range of about 1,860 miles and is the \n     only intermediate-range missile ever exported. Saudi Arabia \n     purchased about 40 of the missiles. China has deployed about \n     40 CSS-2s for more than 25 years.\n       According to an Air Force intelligence report obtained by \n     The Times last year, the CSS-2 is being replaced by China's \n     new and more capable CSS-5. About 40 CSS-5s, with a ranges of \n     about 1,333 miles, have been deployed, and a more accurate \n     version, is awaiting deployment.\n       The chart showed two Scud missiles with ranges of between \n     62 and 186 miles, China's M-9 missile with a 372-mile range, \n     and the North Korean Nodong, with a 620-mile range.\n       Meanwhile, Pentagon officials yesterday disclosed new \n     details of global missile deployments and developments that \n     will be made public in a report due out next week.\n       The officials, who declined to be named, revealed that \n     Russia and China are developing new short-range missiles \n     called the SSX-26 and CSSX-7, respectively. Both will have \n     ranges greater than 185 miles. Egypt also has a new 425-mile-\n     range missile called Vector, they said.\n       Pakistan and India also have new missiles and are in the \n     process of building longer-range systems, the officials said. \n     Pakistan's will have a 700-mile range and India is working on \n     a longer-range version of the Agni missile with a 1,250-mile \n     range.\n       The new missiles could be used in regional conflicts, armed \n     with nuclear, chemical or biological warheads, or against \n     U.S. troops abroad. There is also the danger that they might \n     be transferred to rogue nations.\n       According to the Pentagon, more than 19 developing nations \n     currently possess short-range ballistic missiles and six \n     others have acquired or are building longer-range missiles \n     with ranges greater than 600 miles.\n       North Korea has three longer-range missiles dubbed Nodong \n     and Taepodong 1 and 2. They have ranges of between 600 miles \n     and 3,700 miles--enough to hit Alaska.\n       The longer-range missiles of China, Saudi Arabia, North \n     Korea, India, Pakistan and Iran ``are strategic systems and \n     most will be armed with nonconventional warheads,'' one \n     official said.\n       Missile states of concern include Afghanistan, Belarus, \n     Bulgaria, China, Egypt, India, Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Libya, \n     North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, Slovakia, Syria, Turkmenistan, \n     Ukraine, Vietnam and Yemen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/30/senate-section/article/S2759-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2760]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JOHN PERKINS\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, at the end of this month, my long-time \ngood friend, John Perkins, will retire from service as a member of my \npersonal staff. He has served as press secretary in my office since \nAugust 1979.\n  Our friendship dates from the 1940s when we were students in \nelementary school at Byram Consolidated School near Jackson, MS. We \nalso were members of the same Boy Scout troop.\n  John got his first newspaper job when we were in high school. My \nfather was our principal, and he and our football coach were asked to \nrecommend a stringer for the Jackson, MS, papers to report scores and \nhighlights of our football games. The person they recommended was John \nPerkins. The year was 1953, and John was in the ninth grade.\n  From that beginning, he went on to serve on the student newspaper \nstaff at Millsaps College where he graduated with a major in history in \n1961. After college, he served in the U.S. Army Reserves, and then \nbecame a docket and reading clerk in the Mississippi State Senate.\n  He attended graduate school in journalism at the University of \nMississippi and worked in press relations for the Charles Sullivan \ncampaign for Governor, in our State, in 1963.\n  He then held a series of newspaper jobs covering a range of subjects \nfrom sports to local governments at the Jackson Daily News and the \nMeridian Star before being named managing editor of the Daily \nCorinthian in 1965. The next year John returned to the Meridian Star as \nmanaging editor and political writer.\n  He was elected to the Mississippi House of Representatives for a 4-\nyear term in 1967 and was an active member of the coalition that \nsuccessfully worked for passage of Governor John Bell Williams' highway \nprogram in the House.\n  When David Bowen was elected to Congress in 1972, he recruited John \nPerkins to come to Washington as his press secretary. As a member of \nour State's delegation in the House, I had the opportunity to observe \nthe work of all the press secretaries from Mississippi. And soon after \nI became a Member of the Senate, I invited John to join my staff.\n  I have enjoyed very much working with him for these 18\\1/2\\ years. \nOur State and Nation have been well-served by the diligence, dedication \nand commitment to excellence of John Perkins. He has put forth his best \nefforts to reflect credit on me, our State, and the U.S. Senate, and he \nhas succeeded.\n  He will be missed by us all, but we intend to stay in close touch and \ncontinue the close friendship that began 50 years ago.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to discuss a major threat \nto the life and health of countless Americans. I am referring to the \nalcohol-impaired drivers on our roads.\n  Madam President, as part of the Senate's action on the highway bill, \nwe passed an extremely valuable measure that would save many of these \nprecious lives. Through the amendment offered by myself and my \ncolleague from New Jersey, who is on the floor now, we said that if a \nperson's blood contains .08 percent alcohol or higher, that person is \nnot fit to drive.\n  This Lautenberg-DeWine amendment, passed this body by a very wide \nmargin. I rise this afternoon because there is a rising tide of \ndisinformation being spread about this .08 legislation. This \nmisinformation campaign is funded in large part by the alcoholic \nbeverage industry.\n  I strongly believe that as we move this measure forward through the \nlegislative process, we all must be guided by the facts. The facts are \nsimple: All widely accepted studies indicate that the blood alcohol \nstandard should be set at .08 BAC. ``BAC,'' of course, stands for \n``blood alcohol content.'' At .08 BAC, individuals simply should not be \ndriving a car.\n  The risk of being in a crash rises gradually with each increase in \nthe blood alcohol content level of an individual. But when a driver \nreaches or exceeds the .08 blood alcohol content level, the risk rises \nvery rapidly.\n  At .08 a driver's vision, balance, reaction time, hearing, judgment, \nand self-control are seriously impaired. Moreover, at .08, critical \ndriving tasks--concentrated attention, speed control, braking, \nsteering, gear changing and lane tracking--are also all negatively \naffected.\n  The alcohol industry, in arguing against the .08 standard, claims \nthat ``only'' 7 percent of fatal crashes involve drivers with blood \nalcohol content levels between .08 and .09. Well, let us look at what \nthat really means. If we take their own statistics, if we use the 1995 \nfigures, that means that approximately 1,200 Americans died because of \nalcohol, drivers impaired at the levels of .08 and .09--1,200 lives \nwere lost.\n  Madam President, that obviously is too many. Changing the blood \nalcohol\n\n[[Page S2761]]\n\nstandard to .08 could have saved these lives.\n  Let me talk now about the tragic consequences of .08 alcohol driving \nfor some real Americans.\n  State trooper Steven Blue of Toledo, OH, arrested a young woman who \nwas driving at a blood alcohol level of .15. She was convicted and \nspent the mandatory 3 days under Ohio law in jail. Madam President, 8 \nmonths later the same officer arrested the same person again. This time \nshe was driving with a blood alcohol content level of .085. The officer \nwanted to charge her with impaired driving, driving under the \ninfluence, but her defense attorney argued that because the per se \nstandard in Ohio is .10, the charge should be knocked down to reckless \noperation.\n  Now, of course, Madam President, in Ohio, as in most States, if you \nare below .10 but still seriously impaired, you can be charged with \ndriving under the influence. In fact, the Ohio law reads, as most \nStates do, ``appreciably impaired.'' So even if you test at .10, \ntechnically you can be charged with this offense, but as a practical \nmatter, the standard is .10, pure and simple.\n  In this case, regrettably, the prosecutor felt compelled to reduce \nthe charges. If these charges had not been reduced, if they had gone \nahead with the original charge of driving under the influence, the \nyoung woman would have spent 10 days in jail, and maybe, just maybe, \nthat would have turned her life around and at least warned her off from \nfurther alcohol-impaired driving.\n  But that did not happen. She then moved to San Diego, and 2 years \nlater Trooper Blue got a call from a law firm asking him for his \ntestimony about his earlier arrests of the same young woman. You see, \nshe had taken up drunk driving again. Driving the wrong way down a one-\nway street, she killed two people.\n  Madam President, the State trooper, Steven Blue, has to deal with the \nreal-life consequences of .08 alcohol driving. So did I when I was a \nlocal county prosecutor in Greene County, OH, dealing with mangled \nbodies and devastated relatives of people who died much too soon.\n  But you don't have to be a State trooper or county prosecutor to \nunderstand a simple fact: .08 drivers kill people. No amount of \npropaganda can obscure that fact. That is why in this morning's \nWashington Post an editorial calls our .08 measure ``a most reasonable \nand effective measure to curb deadly drunk driving.'' The Washington \nPost is not alone in praising this bill. The Austin American-Statesmen \nfrom Austin, TX, the Baltimore Sun, Omaha World Herald, Toledo Blade, \nNew York Newsday, and many, many other papers have all endorsed this \nlegislation.\n  Madam President, this measure will save lives. That is why I will \ncontinue to fight for its enactment all the way through this \nlegislative process.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent we continue in \nmorning business, as has just been requested by the Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I want to say a couple of words about the dialog that \nSenator DeWine and I have had, working together, about the reduction of \nthe blood alcohol content to .08. I listened very carefully to the \ninformation he just gave regarding repetitive assaults on excessive \nalcohol in this one case even, at the fairly reduced level of .085. It \nkind of forecast a tale that would have an unfortunate outcome.\n  I think it is important, as we consider legislation on ISTEA that \ncarries this prohibition of driving over .08 blood alcohol content, we \nought to review the case and see what it is we are discussing because \nI, too, in the State of New Jersey and around the country, have been \nsubjected to criticism from the restaurant associations, the Alcoholic \nBeverage Association, and others who say, ``What do you want to do, \ntake away social drinking and friendliness?''\n  We have only one mission, and I share this with the distinguished \nSenator from Ohio on this particular issue. That is to protect the \nlives of between 500 to 700 people a year, it is predicted, and also to \nsend out notice that drinking and driving is an unacceptable condition \nin America. Mr. President, .08 certainly is a level which, I think it \nis fair to say, has conclusively been established as the beginning of \nsignificant impairment behind the wheel, including slowness in \nadjusting to different speeds, braking, turning.\n  It happens enough. We lose 17,000 people a year, Mr. President, to \ntraffic accidents that involve alcohol. Over 40,000 to 41,000 people \nare killed each and every year. I use a reference fairly frequently \nthat, in the worst year of Vietnam--when this country was, if not in \nvirtual mourning, certainly in virtual internal turmoil about what was \nhappening there--in its worst year, we lost about 17,000-plus people in \nVietnam, and every year we lose 17,000-plus people on our highways and \nit doesn't get the same kind of public reaction as it did when we were \nengaged in combat in a cause that our people served but one that had us \nchallenging the policy decision that got us there in the first place. \nThere can't be any challenge here. It is such an easy thing.\n  I was the author of the uniform drinking age bill that raised the age \nto 21 across the country. We had had modest alcohol requirements in \nlegislation offering incentives for States to get this thing done--\nreduce, make sure you had your road checks, and make sure you were \ncautioning people about driving while under the influence of alcohol, \ndriving while intoxicated. It never quite did the trick.\n  But we found out when we raised the drinking age to 21, and we said \nthose States that don't do it will be subjected to penalties by virtue \nof a loss of the highway or infrastructure funding that they may get, \nwe had a devil of a time. It took a long time to persuade some places, \nlike Washington, DC, which was making the callous calculation about \nwhether or not revenues derived from tavern receipts, restaurant \nreceipts, would be more than that which they would lose if they failed \nto raise the drinking age to 21. They finally agreed, and we had the \nunanimous support of all 50 States and the District of Columbia.\n  I am pleased to report that it is estimated that over 15,000 lives \nare saved as a result of a minimum drinking age of 21. Imagine, 15,000 \nfamilies that don't have to mourn, 15,000 families that don't even want \nto contemplate what it might be like to have an empty place at the \ntable.\n  We both have heard from the Frazier family in Maryland that lost a 9-\nyear-old daughter. Her name was Ashley Frazier. When you see her \nparents and her sister talk about the emptiness that surrounds that \nhousehold, about the place at the table where the mother sits \noccasionally because they want to be reminded that Ashley was a \nsignificant part of their everyday lives--they set the table for four, \nand only three of them are there for dinner. I have watched Mrs. \nFrazier compelled to tell her story through tears because she doesn't \nwant another family to have to go through that experience. Her daughter \nwas killed at 8 o'clock in the morning by a woman who was just over \n.08, who drove up on the sidewalk as Ashley and her mother were waiting \nfor the schoolbus to pick her up. She describes in the most horrifying \nlanguage how she felt when she heard the impact and realized what \nhappened to her daughter.\n  So, Mr. President, this is a pursuit that we are going to continue to \nengage in, the Senator from Ohio and I and many others who supported us \nwhen we had the vote on the issue here, because it is the right thing \nto do.\n  The one thing that I can't believe is that the Licensed Beverage \nAssociation wants to stand up and challenge whether or not .08 is \nreally an impairment. Mind you, it takes, according to the National \nHighway Traffic Safety Education, over four beers, four drinks, four \nhighballs--over four--4\\1/2\\, to be precise--for a 170-pound person on \nan empty stomach to reach the .08 level. Now, that sounds like fairly \nheavy drinking. A woman of roughly 135 pounds would have to take 3\\1/2\\ \ndrinks for her to get to .08 in 1 hour on an empty stomach.\n\n[[Page S2762]]\n\n  That is pretty significant drinking. And so we say to the Restaurant \nAssociation, Why? ``Well, it could ruin our business and throw all of \nthese people out of work.'' Well, Mr. President, I can tell you this--\nwe heard the same appeal or the same challenge in 1984 when the \ndrinking age was raised to 21, and the Restaurant and the Licensed \nBeverage Association said, ``You are going to ruin business in this \ncountry.''\n  I don't know whether anybody has noticed an absence of restaurants or \nhospitality spots in our society since 1984, but I can tell you that I \nhaven't. I don't think anyone else has. Just read the list of the \nbetter restaurants and of the new beverages that come out, the new \nconcoctions, mixed drinks. They are not going to lose any business with \nthis either. And if they do, so what? If they save somebody's child \nfrom dying because someone was too drunk to drive, then that is a price \nthat ought to be paid. I, frankly, think that if they are serious about \nthis and they remind their bartenders and servers and people are \nreminded through campaigns that when you get to .08, you can't go \nbehind that wheel--not without risking serious punishment, perhaps loss \nof a license and something even worse if it is repeated.\n  And so, Mr. President, so many times we go through the legislative \nprocess here and we forget, at times, the impact that it has on a \nfamily or on an individual. It becomes too much a calculation of other \nthings than the right thing. We ought to do this. I am hoping that as \nISTEA moves along, we will not only have .08 in there but we will have \nit with the measures that we have introduced and said, at the end of 3 \nyears, if you haven't reduced your blood alcohol level acceptance to \n.08, you lose 5 percent, and if it goes for another year, you lose 10 \npercent. But at the end of 6 years, you still state A, B, or C, and you \nstill have the opportunity to reclaim those funds that you would have \nlost, because we are giving it that much latitude. The program begins 3 \nyears out and goes until 6 years without permanent loss of funding.\n  So I commend the Senator from Ohio for his interest and his attention \nto the details. As a prosecutor, we heard him say, he saw too much of \nthe mayhem that is produced from someone getting behind the wheel who \nis unfit to drive. I look forward to working with him on this issue and \nother issues in which we share a common interest.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in morning business \nfor the next 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I congratulate my colleague from New \nJersey for an excellent statement and for his long-time dedication to \nthis very important issue. The point he makes he makes very well. We \nare dealing with real people here. Sometimes when we come to the Senate \nfloor, we don't know the consequences of our actions. But this is a \ncase when we came here and the Senate passed, by a very, very \nsubstantial margin, this amendment and put it into the ISTEA bill. We \nknew what the consequences were. As I said at the time, before the \nvote, this is one of the few times when you can come to the Senate \nfloor and know that if you cast a yes vote as a Member of the U.S. \nSenate, that yes vote is going to save lives. You will never know whose \nlife will be saved, but you can be assured that hundreds and hundreds \nof people will live because of that law that is getting ready to be \npassed that you were voting on. The majority of the Members of the \nSenate, by a big margin, did in fact agree with that.\n\n  I would like to, as I did a moment ago, focus on individuals and on \nreal stories. I did that a moment ago when I talked about the woman who \nhad been convicted of DUI in the State of Ohio and tested at a high \nlevel. The same highway patrol officer arrested her again a few months \nlater. This time, she tested ``only'' .08. Under Ohio law, the \nprosecutor did not feel they could go forward with the DUI, so she was \nultimately charged with reckless operation. Then, of course, the tragic \nend to that story, as I related a moment ago, is that it wasn't too \nlong after that when she showed up in San Diego, and this time deaths \noccurred as a result of her drinking and driving, and the family had to \nsuffer that horrible, horrible tragedy.\n  Let me tell another story, and this is true. This happened a couple \nof weeks ago. Just a couple of weeks ago in Ohio, on March 1, in \nMontgomery County, OH, a Dodge Ram pickup truck collided with the rear \nof a stopped Honda Prelude. The Dodge Ram rode up right on top of the \nHonda and turned over on its side. The Honda was pushed forward into \ntraffic, where it hit a sheriff's cruiser that was stopped in traffic. \nThe sheriff's cruiser was pushed forward, and it hit a Chevrolet C10 \nvan.\n  How can one car hit another car--a stopped car--so fast that it rides \nup on top of it and tips over? The answer is simple: The driver of the \nDodge Ram was impaired, in this case, with a blood alcohol level of \n.76.\n  Mr. President, the risk of being in a crash rises gradually with each \nincrease in the blood alcohol level. When a driver reaches or exceeds a \n.08 blood alcohol level, the risks rise very, very rapidly. They take \noff at about that point. At .08 a driver's vision, his or her balance, \nreaction time, hearing, judgment, self-control, are all seriously \nimpaired; critical driving tasks, like concentrated attention, speed \ncontrol, braking, steering, gear changing, and lane tracking, are also \nnegatively affected.\n  That is why the driver of this Dodge Ram piled on top of a stopped \ncar and caused a four-car pileup that led to the summoning of emergency \nmedics. Just another example, another unnecessary casualty, of a blood \nalcohol limit that is simply too high.\n  Let me relate to the Members of the Senate several other true \nstories. We talked in the last several days to another highway \npatrolman in Ohio, Barry Call of Gallipolis, OH. He has been a highway \npatrolman for 6 years and has seen about a dozen cases where the driver \nwas clearly impaired but could not be charged because they tested \n``only'' between .07 and .09 on the breathalyzer.\n  Trooper Barry Call, in one case, saw a car pulling left of center a \ncouple of times and pulled over the driver. The driver was clearly \nimpaired, and she should not have been behind the wheel of a car. Her \nbreathalyzer test showed a blood alcohol level of .084.\n  Another example: Trooper Richard Donley of Wilmington, OH, has seen \nfatalities in cases where drunk driving was a factor and the blood \nalcohol level was .06, .07, or .08. Sadly, says Trooper Donley, the \ncourts, as a matter of practice, generally will throw out any DUI \ncharge under .10, because the reality is that when you set your level, \nwhether it be .08 or 10, or, as it was many years ago, .15, while the \nlaw says that if you hit that level and you test that, under most State \nlaws it is a per se violation in and of itself. That level, at the same \ntime, also really sets the standard. So anything below that, even if \nthe officer observes very erratic driving, even if the person fails the \nsobriety test--what they call ``field test'' out on the road--the \nreality is that those cases are very difficult to win if the driver \ndoes not test over that limit. And so that limit really becomes the \nstandard of the State.\n\n  As my colleague from New Jersey pointed out so very well, when we say \n.08, what we have to understand is that an average male, a male of 165 \npounds, would have to consume over four beers in an hour on an empty \nstomach. I think most of us know from our own experience that if we \nhave four beers in an hour on an empty stomach, we absolutely have no \nbusiness being behind the wheel of an automobile. We know that--\nabsolutely.\n  Another way of looking at it is to ask a question: If you were at a \nparty--maybe some people were at your house--and you observed a friend \nof yours have four beers in an hour on an empty stomach, and didn't eat \nanything, would you put your 5-year-old daughter in the car and let him \ntake her out to get an ice cream cone or something? We all know what \nthe answer to that would be. It would be a very foolish and reckless \nperson that would do that. No one would do that. No one in their right \nmind would do that.\n  So we know from our own experience that that person who tested .08 \nsimply should not be behind the wheel of a car. What the Senate did, \nand what I hope\n\n[[Page S2763]]\n\nthe Congress will do, is set this very minimum national standard so \nthat wherever you drive--if you live in Cincinnati, for example, you \nmight be in Kentucky one minute and in Indiana the next minute. We all \nmove around from State to State. If you live in this area, you might be \nin Washington, DC, and then Virginia, and then Maryland. We move \naround. There will be some minimum standard so a driver and passengers \ncan be assured that it will be illegal for a driver who is coming at \nthem or who is on the other side of the road to test over .08, no \nmatter where they are, on what road, anyplace in these great 50 States.\n  Let me give some more personal testimonies or examples. We have \ntalked to Ken Betz, whom I have known for a number of years in many \ncapacities. He is now the director of the Coroner's Office in \nMontgomery County, OH. Of the 36 alcohol-related driving fatalities his \noffice has seen in just the past year, seven of these involved drivers \nwho had a blood alcohol content of .08 or less. I will repeat that. In \nMontgomery County, OH, there were 36 alcohol-related driving fatalities \nin the last year. Of those 36, seven of them involved drivers who had a \nblood alcohol content of .08 or less.\n  One driver lost control of his car late at night and was killed. His \nblood alcohol level was .06. Another driver was killed when he ran into \nthe back end of a stopped construction truck. His blood alcohol level \nwas under .06. Another person was driving a motorcycle and turned left \ninto an oncoming Ford Mustang. He wasn't wearing a helmet. He was \nkilled. His blood alcohol content was .07. Another driver went off the \nright side of the road, down into a culvert. He and a passenger were \nboth killed. His blood alcohol level was .07.\n  These are actual cases from Montgomery OH, in the last year.\n\n  Another driver lost control and struck several steel poles before \nplowing into a stopped car. He was killed. His blood alcohol level was \n.08.\n  Mr. President, people who drive at a .08 blood alcohol level are \nclearly impaired. There is absolutely no doubt about it. The risk of \nbeing in a crash rises gradually with each increase in the blood \nalcohol level, beginning at .01. But when a driver reaches or exceeds \nthe .08 blood alcohol level, the risk rises very, very rapidly. At .08, \na driver's vision, balance, reaction time, hearing, judgment, and self-\ncontrol are all seriously impaired.\n  It is interesting, Mr. President, as this debate continues, and as we \nread some of the information that is put out by the alcohol industry. \nThey can't really seriously cite or argue that anyone who tests .08 is \nnot appreciably impaired in their reaction time, in their \nconcentration, in their judgment. No one can say that. We all know that \nfor a fact. Moreover, at .08, critical driving tasks like concentrated \nattention, speed control, braking, steering, gear changing, and lane \ntracking are all affected.\n\n  The Senate overwhelmingly passed our legislation. I hope the whole \nCongress will pass it. It would help America crack down on these \nimpaired drivers and make our roads safer for our children and for our \nfamilies. That is why I will continue to fight for this lifesaving \nmeasure throughout the legislative process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/30/senate-section/article/S2760-2", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2763]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Missouri \nhome schoolers who will observe Missouri Home Education Week, May 3-May \n9, 1998. As a parent and former educator, it is a privilege for me to \nparticipate in celebrating this event.\n  As a nation we promote education as a key to success. A good \neducation is associated with responsible, intelligent, and productive \ncitizenship. To maintain greatness as a nation, we must strive for \nexcellence as individuals. And the standard of excellence is largely \nset by our nation's leaders--especially those in the home. Training in \nthe home that guides children in setting the highest standards for \ntheir lives is essential to the continuity of morality in our culture. \nI am encouraged by all parents and students who take on the task of \neducation in the home.\n  There is no bigger responsibility than being a parent. It is my \ndesire that parents be role models to their children. Teachers have \nalways had a place as role models in our society. Each of us can \nprobably remember a teacher who pushed us to achieve more and to reach \nhigher. We are thankful for the leadership of those who promote \neducation and serve as role models. So for home schooling parents, may \nyou find inspiration in performing the dual role of parent and teacher, \nand may you be doubly rewarded for your efforts.\n  In Missouri, home schooling has had great success. I look forward to \nthe continued contributions that Missouri home schoolers will have in \neducation and to the positive impact home schooled children will have \nin Missouri's communities and across the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/30/senate-section/article/S2763-2", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2763-S2764]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  HONORING DR.

A bill to provide for the permanent extension of income \naveraging for farmers; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                          FARMERS' LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I introduced an amendment to the Revenue \nReconciliation Act of 1997 back in 1997. It extended to our agriculture \nproducers--farmers and ranchers--the ability to average their income \nover a 3-year period. The amendment was included and made part of the \nU.S. Tax Code, but only after further negotiations, sunset the \nprovision after 3 year which would make it run out in 2001.\n  Today, I would like to introduce a bill that would make income \naveraging for our agriculture producers permanent in the U.S. Tax Code. \nThis bill will give our agriculture producers--farmers and ranchers--a \nfair tool to offset the unpredictable nature of their business.\n  Our man in the chair this morning from the great agricultural State \nof Nebraska, and the rest of us in the breadbasket of this country \nunderstand what farmers and ranchers go through. It has always been a \ngood business and at times it is a great business. But we are going \nthrough some times now that are very stressful. As a friend of mine \nsaid the other day, there is nothing wrong down on the farm except the \nprice. That is what we have now.\n  There are not very many segments of the American economy that are \ntaking in the same amount of money for their commodity today as they \nwere taking when World War II ended, some 50 years ago. However, they \nare expected to keep producing food not only in generous proportions \nbut also the safest, the best quality and nutritious food in the world.\n  What makes this Nation unique is, we not only produce it, but we have \nthe infrastructure that allows distribution--our processors, purveyors, \ntransportation, grocery stores, everything from the breakfast table of \nAmerica all the way back to the first seed that goes into the ground is \nunmatched anywhere in the world. It is something of a great marvel in \nthis country. And it is also true that every one of us alive today in \nthis country goes about our daily business of feeding the Nation. \nSomewhere along the line, we are participants in this great \ninfrastructure to deal with our own subsistence.\n  But basically, I want to talk about--the production level, I don't \nthink there is a commodity today that is not hurting when it comes to \nthe marketplace and to the whims of Mother Nature's elements that she \nrains down on agriculture. Agriculture production is a 7-day-a-week job \nas anybody that has ever worked on a dairy farm knows. I assumed that \nmost Americans knew that, but I am finding out that I was wrong. They \nthink milk cows take off the weekend, too, but they don't. Farming is \nan ongoing situation--7 days a week, 52 weeks a year. Farmers and \nranchers take pride in their work. They produce as economically as they \npossibly can, knowing that they fall under the old philosophy that they \nalthough they sell wholesale, they have to buy retail, and they pay the \nfreight both ways, knowing that agriculture has always been in that \nkind of a predicament.\n  Not only do they take great pride in what they produce, but probably \nno other segment of the American public has a greater understanding of \nland stewardship and the environmental problems that face our country \ntoday. Yet, very few of them are ever asked their advice on how to deal \nwith an environmental problem. Several colleagues that serve in this \nbody, who grew up on a farm or a ranch, certainly understand the \nfrustration of the business. They only get paid about two, maybe three \ntimes a year. So it is a crucial time for the farm families across this \ncountry when we take a look at the situation we find ourselves in now. \nWith the financial collapse of many Asian markets in the Pacific rim, \nwe see wheat at an all-time low. Our corn and soybeans will suffer. As \nfar as export trade is concerned, we export a lot more than we receive. \nWe also see a time when we fall whim to the psychology of the market \nmore than the market itself.\n  With the recent passage of the freedom to farm bill, we told farmers \nthat subsidies were going to go away, that they were going to have to \nstand on their own. We also said that we would give them the tools with \nwhich to operate their farms.\n  Market forces are unique. We still fall victim to flood and drought, \ndisease, new infestations which are far,\n\n[[Page S2765]]\n\nfar beyond the control of the producer himself. Farmers make money one \nyear, but may break even the next year, and then lose money the next \ntwo years. If you take market elements and Mother Nature into \nconsideration, farmers fall outside of the business of control. So, at \nbest, they are lucky to break even 2 years in a row, and if they have \ndone that, they think they are really ahead.\n  The business is capital intensive, and labor intensive. To give you \nan idea just why this is an important thing, many young people right \nnow due to death taxes--in other words, estate taxes--agriculture \nproducers usually find themselves in the situation where they are land \nrich but they are cash poor. Passing the farm and ranch on to the next \ngeneration is hard when the tax situation is where they cannot do it. \nThey may have exceeded the limit and heavy estate taxes prevent that. \nWith increases in the top marginal tax and with a record of high \ncommodity taxes, it is time to allow some of that income that goes back \nto the farm to be retained and to allow them to average their income \nover 3 years at those marginal tax rates.\n  We made a deal with agriculture when we passed the Freedom to Farm \nAct. We made a deal with them that there would be no more subsidies, \nbut we would give them income averaging and all the tools that it would \ntake to hang on to their money so that they could invest in next year's \ncrop. If you want to really measure a man's faith, have him take his \nmoney, his time, his efforts, and his investment and have him put a \nseed in the ground in hopes that it will just sprout, let alone \nharvesting a crop.\n  That is faith, we have always had it in agriculture, and it has \nalways been the backbone of every State economy and it still is. When \nthings are good in agriculture, they are usually good for the rest of \nthe country. But I would say this economy right now, the one we are \nexperiencing that everybody raves about is still riding the backs of \nthose who are in the business of producing a raw commodity.\n  So, Mr. President, I offer this bill to put in a permanent place for \nincome averaging for agriculture producers.\n  Mr. President, there will be letters coming out to my colleagues \nexplaining what we have done here. I think it is very important. It is \nimportant to my State. It is important to all of us. It is important to \nthe smaller communities of America, because if agriculture is not \nhealthy, those communities suffer also. That is why we work very hard \non communications infrastructure, and that is why we work awfully hard \non power infrastructure. Smaller communities that rely so heavily on \nagricultural income must find ways to attract other economic \nopportunities and those two other parts are very important to their \ninfrastructure in the future.\n  I appreciate the time from my friend from Wyoming. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, thank you very much. I thank the Senator \nfrom Montana for his comments with respect to income averaging and \nagricultural activity. I certainly support that. I think, as evidenced \nby its passage last year, it is generally supported.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional \nmaterial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                  Joint Committee on Taxation,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 19, 1998.\n     Hon.

The election applies to taxable years beginning \n     after December 31, 1997, and before January 1, 2001.\n       Under your proposal, the election to average farm income \n     over a three-year period would be extended permanently. The \n     proposal would become effective on the date of enactment.\n       For the purpose of preparing a revenue estimate for your \n     proposal, we have assumed that enactment will occur during \n     calendar year 1998. Estimated changes in Federal fiscal year \n     budget receipts are as follows:\n\n                                                                [In millions of dollars]                                                                \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                     Fiscal years--                                     \n                             Item                             ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                   1998         1999         2000         2001         2002      1998-2002    1998-2007 \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPermanent extension of income averaging for farmers..........  ...........  ...........  ...........           -2          -21          -23         -138\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       I hope this information is helpful to you.

A bill to provide States with the authority to permit \ncertain employers of domestic workers to make annual wage reports; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                      domestic workers legislation\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce important \nlegislation which will remove a significant tax filing burden currently \nimposed on employers of domestic workers.\n  In 1994, Congress adopted legislation reforming the imposition of \nSocial Security and Medicare taxes on domestic employees. These new \nrules introduced more rationality into the tax system, and relieved \nreporting requirements of domestic employers.\n  Unfortunately, the legislation did not go as far as needed. By not \nfully reforming the federal unemployment tax (FUTA), Congress left in \nplace a significant burden on domestic employers which previously \nexisted. Today I urge you to consider my legislation which would amend \nFUTA as well by removing the burden of filing quarterly state \nemployment tax returns for employers of domestic workers.\n  The Social Security Domestic Employment Reform Act of 1994, Public \nLaw 103-387, changed the Social Security and Medicare tax rules. The \nnew law provides that domestic employers (employing maids, gardeners, \nbabysitters, and the like) no longer owe these taxes for any domestic \nemployee who earned less than $1,000 per year from the employer.\n  In addition, the Act aimed to ease reporting requirements. Under the \nact, domestic employers need no longer file quarterly returns regarding \nSocial Security and Medicare taxes nor the annual FUTA return. Rather, \nall federal reporting is now consolidated on an annual Schedule H filed \nat the same time as the employer's personal income tax return.\n  Nevertheless, the goal of the 1994 act--to substantially reduce \nreporting requirements for domestic employers--has not been fully \naccomplished for employers who endeavor to comply with all aspects of \nthe law. Under FUTA, employers must make quarterly reports and payments \nto state unemployment agencies, then pay an additional sum of federal \ntax (now once a year, as part of schedule H). In addition, The Social \nSecurity Act continues to require that employers report wages quarterly \nto the states regarding all employees. In other words, despite the 1994 \nact, a domestic employer who abides by the law must still keep track of \nall domestic employees, and must still fill out forms and send tax \npayments on a quarterly basis to his or her state employment agency.\n  Congress was not unaware of the relationship of FUTA to Social \nSecurity taxes at the time it passed the 1994 act. Besides eliminating \nthe separate FUTA return for domestic employers, the act also added a \nprovision which permits the Secretary of the Treasury to enter \nagreements with States to permit the federal government to collect \nunemployment taxes on behalf of the States, along with all other \ndomestic employee taxes, once a year. That statute, if used, would \neliminate the need for domestic employers to report to state \nunemployment agencies. However, to\n\n[[Page S2766]]\n\ndate no state has entered such an agreement. Undoubtedly, that is \nbecause the Social Security Act continues to require quarterly reports \nanyway.\n  The primary justification cited for the quarterly reporting \nrequirement is that it makes information more accessible to state \nagencies that investigate unemployment claims. However the burden of \nthis provision far outweighs its benefit. The number of household \nemployer tax filings is relatively small. Representatives from the \nGeorgia Department of Labor and their counterparts in other states are \nconfident that the investigation of unemployment claims will not be \nhindered by annual rather than quarterly reporting requirements.\n  I suppose one could argue that the change this legislation proposes \nis unnecessary, since few people even bother to comply with the FUTA \nrequirements for domestic employees. I believe that avoiding a change \nfor that reason is an insult to citizens who endeavor to comply with \nall tax laws. For example, one Pennsylvania resident paid a 12 year old \ngirl $4 per hour during one quarter for her babysitting services. This \nresident was then required by law to record, then pay eight cents in \ntax on her behalf. Needless to say, this is ridiculous. The young \nbabysitter would never claim unemployment compensation.\n  In short, the federal requirement of quarterly state employment tax \nreports for purely domestic employers should be eliminated. To ease the \nreporting burden on domestic employers, my legislation proposes that \nstates be allowed to provide for annual filing of household employment \ntaxes. Under my bill, any state which so chooses could retain quarterly \nreporting, but I believe few states would opt for such an unnecessary \nburden on its taxpayers. I urge my colleagues to join me in the effort \nto finish the job of rationalizing the taxpayer obligations for \ndomestic employment taxes by supporting this bill. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of my bill be inserted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 1880\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. AUTHORIZATION FOR STATE TO PERMIT ANNUAL WAGE \n                   REPORTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1137(a)(3) of the Social Security \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 1320b-7(a)(3)) is amended by inserting before \n     the semicolon the following: ``, and except that in the case \n     of wage reports with respect to domestic service employment, \n     a State may permit employers (as so defined) that make \n     returns with respect to such service on a calendar year basis \n     pursuant to section 3510 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n     to make such reports on an annual basis.''\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply to wage reports required to be submitted on and \n     after the date of enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN:\n  S. 1881. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, relating to \nthe installation of emergency locator transmitters on aircraft; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                   THE AIRPLANE EMERGENCY LOCATOR ACT\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce \nthe Airplane Emergency Locator Act. This important legislation would \nrequire most small aircraft to have emergency locator transmitters. A \nsimilar bill was introduced in the House by Representative Christopher \nShays.\n  On Tuesday December 24, 1996 a Learjet with Pilot Johan Schwartz, 31, \nof Westport, Connecticut and Patrick Hayes, 30, of Clinton, Connecticut \nlost contact with the control tower at the Lebanon, New Hampshire \nairport. The crash occurred in poor weather and after an aborted \nlanding. Despite efforts by the federal government, New Hampshire state \nand local authorities, and Connecticut authorities, extremely well \norganized ground searches failed to locate the two gentlemen or the \nairplane. The thick pines of the NH countryside have hampered the \neffort. This plane did not have an emergency locator transmitter, a \ndevice which could have made a difference in saving the lives of these \ntwo men.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is straightforward--the only \naircraft that would be exempt from having emergency locator \ntransmitter's would be planes used by manufacturers in development \nexercises and agricultural planes used to spread chemicals over crops. \nIt is my strong belief that these devices will play a vital role in \nsearch efforts, where timing is so critical in any rescue mission.\n  I applaud my colleague Christopher Shays for introducing similar \nlegislation in the House and I urge my colleagues to join us in support \nof the Airplane Emergency Locator Act. Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1881\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Airplane Emergency Locator \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) on December 24, 1996, a plane piloted by Johan Schwartz \n     and Patrick Hayes disappeared near Lebanon, New Hampshire;\n       (2) an extensive search was conducted by the States of New \n     Hampshire, Connecticut, Vermont, New York, Maine, and \n     Massachusetts, in cooperation with the Federal Government, in \n     an unsuccessful effort to locate the plane and any survivors;\n       (3) the plane described in paragraph (1) was not required \n     under law to carry an emergency locator transmitter; and\n       (4) emergency locator transmitters have been found to be \n     very helpful in locating downed aircraft and saving lives.\n\n     SEC. 3. APPLICABILITY OF REQUIREMENT.\n\n       Section 44712(b) of title 49, United States Code, is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(b) Nonapplication.--Subsection (a) does not apply to \n     aircraft when used in--\n       ``(1) flight operations related to the design and testing, \n     manufacture, preparation, and delivery of aircraft; or\n       ``(2) the aerial application of a substance for an \n     agricultural purpose.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Coats, and Mr. \n        Dodd):\n  S. 1882. A bill to reauthorize the Higher Education Act of 1965, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                The Higher Education Amendments of 1998\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will be introducing a bill today in \nrelation to the changes that we have worked on with members, of course, \nof both parties in our committee with respect to the higher educational \nprograms.\n  There is nothing more important to this Nation than maintaining our \ninternational superiority as the country with the best higher \neducation. That is the reason this Nation is where it is today. And if \nwe allow that to sink, as we have allowed our k-12 to sink, then, Mr. \nPresident, we will be sliding down, in the next century, to a position \nof lesser importance.\n  I am introducing the bill today--with Senators Kennedy, Coats, and \nDodd--the Higher Education Amendments of 1998. This legislation is a \nproduct of work begun by the Committee on Labor and Human Resources \nover a year ago.\n  The Higher Education Act is among the most significant statutes under \nthe jurisdiction of the committee. Since its inception in 1965, the act \nhas been focused on enhancing the opportunities of students to pursue \npostsecondary education. The grant, loan, and work-study assistance \nmade available by this act has made the difference for the countless \nmillions in pursuing their dreams for a better life.\n  At the start of the reauthorization process, we set out to achieve a \nnumber of important goals designed to strengthen these programs. I am \npleased to say that this legislation achieves the five major objectives \nidentified at the beginning of our efforts.\n  First, the bill preserves the focus on students, who are the prime \nreason we have a Higher Education Act in the first place. Students now \nin school will be assured of receiving a lower interest rate on their \nloans and will see less of their own earnings penalized with respect to \nthe Pell grant awards they receive. Students now in high school who \naspire to a college education will continue to benefit from early \nintervention programs, including the National Early Intervention \nScholarship Program--NEISP--and TRIO. Students who have graduated and \nare faced with exceptionally high loan burdens will be able to take \nadvantage of extended repayment options under the Guaranteed Student \nLoan Program.\n\n[[Page S2767]]\n\n  Second, the bill takes a two-pronged approach to helping our Nation's \nelementary and secondary school teachers. They will be thoroughly \nprepared to offer the quality of instruction needed to assure that \nstudents achieve the standards we need and expect. Working at both the \nState level to promote system-wide reforms and at the local level to \ndevelop partnerships to enhance the quality of teacher training, the \nbill offers a comprehensive and systematic approach to this pressing \nnational need. No longer will the Higher Education Act contain a \ncollection of small, unfunded teacher training programs. Rather, the \ngood ideas represented in these proposals--along with the many useful \nsuggestions made by members of the committee--have been shaped into a \nbroad approach. It is an approach which I hope will command the \nattention and support of Congress when we turn to the appropriations \nbill.\n  Third, the bill reflects a strong commitment to the maintenance of \ntwo viable loan programs--the guaranteed or Federal Family Education \nLoan Program, known as FFELP, and the Direct Loan Program. To the \nextent possible within budgetary constraints, the bill levels the \nplaying field to assure the continuation of fair and healthy \ncompetition between the two programs.\n  Fourth, the bill takes important steps to improve the delivery of \nstudent assistance programs. In cooperation with the administration, we \nhave developed a performance-based organization--a PBO--designed to \nstrengthen the management of key systems with the Department of \nEducation. A number of provisions in the legislation also pave the way \ntoward taking advantage of efficiencies made possible through \nelectronic processing and other technological advances.\n  Finally, we have made every attempt to streamline programs, including \nthe streamlining of the act itself. This bill takes nearly 50 programs \noff the books--off the books--and cuts in half the number of titles in \nthe act. We have also attempted to relieve the regulatory burden on \nprogram participants while protecting the strong and effective \nintegrity provisions included in the 1992 reauthorization.\n  Perhaps one of the most difficult issues to resolve has been the \nchange in the student loan interest rate scheduled to take effect on \nJuly 1 of this year. This has, of course, been a strong concern of the \nBudget Committee. This legislation adopts the proposal approved a few \nweeks ago by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. For \nseveral months, Members of the House and the Senate have grappled with \nthe issue. The dilemma has been to balance the desire to offer students \nthe lowest possible interest rate while assuring an uninterrupted flow \nof loan capital so that borrowing will be possible.\n  All analysts have concluded that allowing the scheduled rate to go \ninto effect will mean the demise of the FFEL program. That outcome is \nunacceptable, given the substantial likelihood of program disruption.\n  The Direct Loan Program, which now handles only 30 percent of total \nloan volume, simply is not in a position to pick up the slack. To do \nanything to interrupt the ability of our young people to participate in \nthe FFEL program would be a disaster at this time. The solution offered \nby the House committee included in the bill is by no means perfect. \nLike Winston Churchill's comments about democracy, however, I say: This \nproposal is the worst possible option, except for all others.\n  I am extremely appreciative of the hard work which my colleagues on \nthe committee put into the development of this bipartisan bill. The \ncommittee will be considering this measure on Wednesday, and I hope \nthat the full Senate will have the opportunity to debate it in the near \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/30/senate-section/article/S2764-4", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2767-S2773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            Higher Education Act Amendments of 1998--Summary\n\n\n                      TITLE I: GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\n       Current Title 1--Partnerships for Educational Excellence--\n     is repealed, as programs authorized under the title have not \n     been funded.\n       General Provisions, now included in Title XII, will be \n     transferred to Title I.\n       Obsolete/unfunded sections of Title XII are repealed.\n       Language is added to require the Secretary to publish the \n     expiration dates of terms of members of the National Advisory \n     Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity and to \n     solicit nominations for vacancies on the Committee.\n\n\n                  TITLE II: IMPROVING TEACHER QUALITY\n\n       The teacher education provisions from Title V will be moved \n     to Title II.

Mr. President, it is an honor to be a sponsor of the \nHigher Education Act Amendments of 1998 with Chairman Jeffords and \nSenators Coats and Dodd. The reauthorization of this Act is a \nbipartisan effort of all members of the Labor Committee, and I am \npleased that we have achieved a consensus on so many issues.\n  Our goal in this bill is to strengthen federal support for higher \neducation. Our legislation increases the maximum authorization for Pell \ngrants, and expands the formula for need analysis to protect more of \nthe income of working parents and students.\n  The bill also continues the critical investment in graduate education \nthrough the institution-based program of Graduate Assistance in Areas \nof National Need, as well as the portable Javits Fellowships, which are \nvital for talented students in the arts, humanities, and social \nsciences, where other sources of funding are limited.\n  An additional initiative in the bill will enable institutions to work \nwith faculty and administrators to improve teaching for students with \ndisabilities. Increasing numbers of students with disabilities are \nparticipating in higher education, and faculty members often have \nlittle experience in adapting their teaching techniques for these \nstudents. This initiative will reach out to many different types of \ninstitutions, including community colleges, graduate schools, and urban \nand rural institutions. It also includes graduate teaching assistants--\nthe faculty of the future. This program was first suggested by the \nUniversity of Massachusetts, and it is supported by the Consortium for \nCitizens with Disabilities on behalf of 20 disability groups.\n  The bill takes a major step to improve the training of teachers by \ncreating strong programs for training and recruitment. The training \nprogram has two parts. Fifty percent goes to local partnerships that \ninclude elementary and secondary schools, programs or schools of \nteacher training, schools of arts and sciences, and other groups, such \nas teachers unions, businesses, and community organizations. The other \n50 percent of the funding goes to competitive grants to state education \nagencies. This teacher training proposal represents a thoughtful \ncompromise, and I hope it will receive strong support in the Senate.\n  The bill helps teachers in another way, through loan forgiveness. I \nhave long supported more loan forgiveness for teachers, and I am \npleased that there is bipartisan support for this proposal. It forgives \nloans for teachers who teach for at least 3 years in high-need schools. \nMany college graduates with heavy debt loads cannot afford to go into \nteaching in schools where we need them most. This loan forgiveness \nprogram will make it easier for idealistic young men and women to work \nwith needy children.\n\n[[Page S2772]]\n\n  The bill also calls for the creation of a Performance Based \nOrganization at the Department of Education. Following Vice President \nGore's initiative to re-invent government, this organization will \nstreamline and improve the financial aid functions at the Department. \nWe are working with the Department to make a plan that will work well \nfor it, for students, and for all others involved in student aid.\n  Two provisions of the bill raise significant question. One of those \nprovisions modifies the payment structure for the guaranty agencies \nthat work with banks in the student loan program. But greater reform of \nthese agencies is needed. They are paid too much if students go into \ndefault, and they are not paid enough for preventing defaults in the \nfirst place. I am pleased, however, that the bill does allow guaranty \nagencies to enter into voluntary, flexible agreements with the \nSecretary of Education that will be more business-like and will focus \nmore heavily on preventing defaults. ASA, the guaranty agency in \nMassachusetts, has been at the forefront of the reform movement, and \nsupports these voluntary agreements.\n  Finally, the bill, like the House bill, reduces the interest rate \nthat students pay on their college loans by almost 1% from the current \nrate. This reduction will be a substantial benefit for students. The \naverage borrower with a loan of $12,000 will save $650 in interest over \nthe life of the loan, and the average master's degree student with a \ndebt of $20,000 will save more than $1000. For borrowers with larger \nloans, the savings will be greater. I am pleased that Republicans and \nDemocrats agree that reducing the interest rate on student loans is \nnecessary.\n  But the bill trims the rates paid to banks only slightly. As under \nthe House bill, students will pay less interest to the banks, but the \nfederal government will make an additional payment to the banks, so \nthat bank receipts will go down only slightly from the high rates now \nin effect. This subsidy is paid by the taxpayers. The cost is at least \n$1.2 billion over 5 years, and may be as high as $3.9 billion.\n  The banks complain that they cannot live with even this very modest \ncut. In 1992, they told us that they could not accept any cut in the \ninterest rate on student loans. Congress cut the rate anyway, and the \nbank loan program continued to thrive. Today, however, at a time when \ninterest rates in the economy are low, the interest rate for government \nguaranteed student loans is higher than the rate for either car loans \nor home mortgages. A recent report from the Treasury Department shows \nthat if the interest rate on student loans is cut by almost 1%, the \nbanks can still make a reasonable profit.\n  The interest rate subsidy in this bill is not offset by other \nrevenues. We will have to work with the Budget Committee, with our \ncolleagues in the House, and with the Administration to resolve this \nproblem. We must do all we can to reduce the high cost of borrowing for \nstudents, without subsidizing banks at the expense of taxpayers.\n  This legislation is designed to improve higher education in all parts \nof America. It renews our commitment to needy students, to graduate \neducation, to teacher training, and to improving loan service for \nstudents. I look forward to working with my colleagues on this \nimportant legislation in the weeks to come.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, Senator \nJeffords, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Coats, in introducing the Higher \nEducation Act Amendments of 1998.\n  The Higher Education Act is the foundation of opportunity and access \nto post-secondary education. Pell Grants, College Work Study, federal \nstudent loans and federal TRIO programs are what make college possible \nfor the all Americans. The bill we introduce today makes important \nchanges in these programs and updates and streamlines the law to ensure \nthe vitality of federal aid programs in the next millennium.\n  There are few pieces of legislation that we will consider this \nCongress that are as important to American families as this bill. \nParents recognize that their child's success is in no small measure \ndependent on their educational achievement. Statistics bear this out--a \nperson with a Bachelor's degree earns twice as much as one with just a \nhigh school education.\n  But this issue is not only of concern to families; higher education \nhas defined and shaped America's economy in the post World War II era. \nOur economy has grown on the strength of knowledge-based, highly-\nskilled industries and workers. This would not have been possible \nwithout higher education or without our federal commitment to ensuring \naccess to college.\n  Since the GI Bill, millions of Americans have been able to attend \ncollege because of the assistance offered by the Federal Government. \nToday, 75 percent of all student aid is federal.\n  And yet, with rising college costs and growing student debt, families \nincreasingly worry that college is slipping beyond their grasp. Studies \nsuggest that, even with the nearly $35 billion of federal aid available \neach year, affordability is already becoming a factor for those at the \nlowest income levels.\n  And in nearly all families, a letter offering financial aid is as, if \nnot more, important than the actual letter accepting the student into a \ncollege of his or her choice. This bill works to make sure that the \nserious problem of rising college costs does not become more of a \nreality for America's families and reaches out to those who already \nbelieve that college is slipping beyond their reach.\n  In particular, we have adopted many of the recommendations of the \nCost of College Commission, formed by the Congress last year. We \nstreamlined many regulatory requirements that may contribute to rising \ncosts. We also adopted strong new disclosure requirements about cost. \nThese provisions will provide families with new, reliable and \ncomparable information on college costs, so they can exercise their \npower as consumers to choose institutions that are of high quality and \nreasonable cost.\n  This legislation also strengthens federal financial aid programs \nwhich are a lifeline for millions of families as they struggle with \ncost increases. We authorize an increase in the maximum Pell Grant \naward and hope that appropriators and our Budget Resolution will follow \nthrough with adequate funds. We also adjust the treatment of the \nneediest students' earnings to ensure that they and their families are \nnot penalized in the award of aid because the student works, as I \nrecommended in earlier legislation. We also expand campus-based aid \nprograms, like College Work Study and low-cost Perkins Loans, to reach \nmore students. We improve the federal student loans programs by \nproviding extended repayment for students with large balances and by \ngiving colleges more tools to help their students avoid expensive \nloans.\n\n  Students are also guaranteed a substantially lower student loan \ninterest rate. As many members are aware, the issue of the student loan \ninterest rate has been the most controversial and closely followed \nissue in this bill. I am very pleased that the solution we put forward \ntoday ensures that students will receive the long-term benefit of \nsubstantially lower rates. However, I am disappointed that this bill \nexpects taxpayers to foot this bill with a new subsidy to banks. This \nnew entitlement to banks is also costly and raises serious budget \nconcerns on our bill. I am hopeful that we can continue to work on this \nissue with the majority, the Budget Committee and the Administration to \nreach a better solution for taxpayers than the one proposed today.\n  This legislation also includes new authority for the Secretary to \nexplore the potential of distance education and learning. In the past, \ndistance education too often meant correspondence courses with little \nmerit and high cost. Today, the Internet, the World Wide Web, and other \nemerging technologies offer new opportunities for quality, interactive \nlearning right from a student's home. However, current law provides \nlittle opportunity for institutions and their students to explore these \nexciting opportunities. The bill we introduce today directs the \nSecretary to undertake and carefully monitor a demonstration program in \ndistance education.\n  The bill also includes another important initiative to increase \naccess to post-secondary education--the Child Care Access Means Parents \nin School Act, which Senator Snowe and I introduced last year. This \nbill will support\n\n[[Page S2773]]\n\ncampus-based child care centers meeting the needs of low income \nstudents. As the non-traditional student population grows, one of the \nmajor obstacles facing students who are parents is locating affordable, \nquality child care. Campuses are a key place to meet this need. In my \nhome state of Connecticut, all of our community-technical colleges have \ncampus-based child care facilities. The centers provide student-parents \nwith convenient, high quality care and also serve as laboratories for \ntraining new child care providers.\n  Colleges are also our nation's laboratories for training teachers. \nThis bill offers significant new support in this area. The committee \nhas worked hard with its members and developed a comprehensive teacher \ntraining program that supports state-level initiatives and local \npartnerships. This two-track approach will ensure that colleges and \nschools who work together to improve teacher training will be rewarded \nat the state level with recognition for achieving higher standards. In \nanother important initiative, this bill also offers teachers working in \nhigh poverty schools with loan forgiveness. This effort will provide \nhighly qualified teachers with a powerful incentive to share their \ntalents, skills and knowledge with the neediest children.\n  Beyond bringing student aid programs in line with today's realities, \nwe also take a key step to modernize and improve the delivery of these \ncrucial student aid programs in the creation of the Performance-Based \nOrganization within the Department of Education. the PBO will \nadminister and deliver all federal student aid. At nearly $35 billion a \nyear, the complexity of this undertaking demands talent, energy, \nexperience, and performance. A PBO will ensure that the Secretary can \nrecruit the best people to this job and retain them based on their \nperformance.\n  Mr. President, this is a strong and comprehensive bill. But perhaps \nmost importantly for its future, it is a bipartisan bill. I was pleased \nto be a part of the effort of our chairman, Senator Jeffords, Senator \nKennedy, and Senator Coats in pulling this bill together. It may not be \neverything any one of us wanted; however, it is what America's students \nand their families need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Congress finds that--\n       (1) studies have found that quality child care, \n     particularly for infants and young children, requires a \n     sensitive, interactive, loving, and consistent caregiver;\n       (2) as most parents meet and exceed the criteria described \n     in paragraph (1), circumstances allowing, parental care is \n     the best form of child care;\n       (3) a recent National Institute for Child Health and \n     Development study found that the greatest factor in the \n     development of a young child is ``what is happening at home \n     and in families'';\n       (4) as a child's interaction with his or her parents has \n     the most significant impact on the development of the child, \n     any Federal child care policy should enable and encourage \n     parents to spend more time with their children;\n       (5) nearly \\1/2\\ of preschool children have at-home mothers \n     and only \\1/3\\ of preschool children have mothers who are \n     employed full time;\n       (6) a large number of low- and middle-income families \n     sacrifice a second full-time income so that a mother may be \n     at home with her child;\n       (7) the average income of 2-parent families with a single \n     income is $20,000 less than the average income of 2-parent \n     families with 2 incomes;\n       (8) only 30 percent of preschool children are in families \n     with paid child care and the remaining 70 percent of \n     preschool children are in families that do not pay for child \n     care, many of which are low- to middle-income families \n     struggling to provide child care at home;\n       (9) child care proposals should not provide financial \n     assistance solely to the 30 percent of families that pay for \n     child care and should not discriminate against families in \n     which children are cared for by an at-home parent; and\n       (10) any congressional proposal that increases child care \n     funding should provide financial relief to families that \n     sacrifice an entire income in order that a mother or father \n     may be at home for a young child.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the functional totals in this concurrent resolution on the \n     budget assume that--\n       (1) many families in the United States make enormous \n     sacrifices to forego a second income in order to have a \n     parent care for a child at home;\n       (2) there should be no bias against at-home parents;\n       (3) parents choose many different forms of child care to \n     meet the needs of their families, such as child care provided \n     by an at-home parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle, neighbor, \n     nanny, preschool, or child care center;\n       (4) any quality child care proposal should include, as a \n     key component, financial relief for those families where \n     there is an at-home parent; and\n       (5) mothers and fathers who have chosen and continue to \n     choose to be at home should be applauded for their efforts.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        GREGG AMENDMENT NO. 2167\n\n  Mr. GREGG proposed an amendment to the concurrent resolution, Senate \nConcurrent Resolution 86, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 3  .

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING FREEDOM OF HEALTH CARE \n                   CHOICE FOR MEDICARE SENIORS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Medicare beneficiaries should have the same right to \n     obtain health care from the physician or provider of their \n     choice as do Members of Congress and virtually all other \n     Americans.\n       (2) Most seniors are denied this right by current \n     restrictions on their health care choices.\n       (3) Affording seniors this option would create greater \n     health-care choices and result in fewer claims being paid out \n     of the near-bankrupt medicare trust funds.\n       (4) Legislation to uphold this right of health care choice \n     for seniors must protect beneficiaries and medicare from \n     fraud and abuse. Such legislation must include provisions \n     that--\n       (A) require that such contracts providing this right be in \n     writing, be signed by the medicare beneficiary, and provide \n     that no claim be submitted to the Health Care Financing \n     Administration;\n       (B) preclude such contracts when the beneficiary is \n     experiencing a medical emergency;\n       (C) allow for the medicare beneficiary to modify or \n     terminate the contract prospectively at any time and to \n     return to medicare; and\n       (D) are subject to stringent fraud and abuse law, including \n     the medicare anti-fraud provisions in the Health Insurance \n     Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     seniors have the right to see the physician or health care \n     provider of their choice, and not be limited in such right by \n     the imposition of unreasonable conditions on providers who \n     are willing to treat seniors on a private basis, and that the \n     assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     resolution assume that legislation will be enacted to ensure \n     this right.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    ALLARD AMENDMENTS NOS. 2170-2172\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. ALLARD submitted three amendments intended to be proposed by him \nto the concurrent resolution Senate Concurrent Resolution 86, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n                           Amendment No. 2170\n\n       At the end of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING SCHOOL MODERNIZATION \n                   AND CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the General Accounting Office has performed a \n     comprehensive survey of the Nation's public elementary and \n     secondary school facilities and has found severe levels of \n     disrepair in all areas of the United States;\n       (2) the General Accounting Office has concluded that more \n     than 14,000,000 children attend schools in need of extensive \n     repair or replacement, 7,000,000 children attend schools with \n     life safety code violations, and 12,000,000 children attend \n     schools with leaky roofs;\n       (3) the General Accounting Office has found the problem of \n     crumbling schools transcends demographic and geographic \n     boundaries. At 38 percent of urban schools, 30 percent of \n     rural schools, and 29 percent of suburban schools, at least \n     one building is in need of extensive repair or should be \n     completely replaced;\n       (4) the condition of school facilities has a direct effect \n     on the safety of students and teachers and on the ability of \n     students to learn. Academic research has provided a direct \n     correlation between the condition of school facilities and \n     student achievement. At Georgetown University, researchers \n     have found the test scores of students assigned to schools in \n     poor condition can be expected to fall 10.9 percentage points \n     below the test scores of students in buildings in excellent \n     condition. Similar studies have demonstrated up to a 20 \n     percent improvement in test scores when students were moved \n     from a poor facility to a new facility;\n       (5) the General Accounting Office has found most schools \n     are not prepared to incorporate modern technology in the \n     classroom. Forty-six percent of schools lack adequate \n     electrical wiring to support the full-scale use of \n     technology. More than a third of schools lack the requisite \n     electrical power. Fifty-six percent of schools have \n     insufficient phone lines for modems;\n       (6) the Department of Education has reported that \n     elementary and secondary school enrollment, already at a \n     record high level, will continue to grow over the next 10 \n     years, and that in order to accommodate this growth, the \n     United States will need to build an additional 6,000 schools;\n       (7) the General Accounting Office has determined the cost \n     of bringing schools up to good, overall condition to be \n     $112,000,000,000, not including the cost of modernizing \n     schools to accommodate technology, or the cost of building \n     additional facilities needed to meet record enrollent levels;\n       (8) schools run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) for \n     Native American children are also in dire need of repair and \n     renovation. The General Accounting Office has reported that \n     the cost of total inventory repairs needed for BIA facilities \n     is $754,000,000. The December 1997 report by the Comptroller \n     General of the United States states that, ``Compared with \n     other schools nationally, BIA schools are generally in poorer \n     physical condition, have more unsatisfactory environmental \n     factors, more often lack key facilities requirements for \n     education reform, and are less able to support computer and \n     communications technology;''\n       (9) State and local financing mechanisms have proven \n     inadequate to meet the challenges facing today's aging school \n     facilities. Large numbers of local educational agencies have \n     difficulties securing financing for school facility \n     improvement;\n       (10) the Federal Government has provided resources for \n     school construction in the past. For example, between 1933 \n     and 1939, the Federal Government assisted in 70 percent of \n     all new school construction; and\n       (11) the Federal Government can support elementary and \n     secondary school facilities without interfering in issues of \n     local control, and should help communities leverage \n     additional funds for the improvement of elementary and \n     secondary school facilities.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     budget resolution assume the enactment of legislation to \n     allow States and school districts to issue $21.8 billion \n     worth of zero-interest school modernization bonds to rebuild \n     and modernize our Nation's schools, and to provide Federal \n     income tax credits to the purchasers of those bonds in lieu \n     of interest payments.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        BOXER AMENDMENT NO. 2176\n\n  Mr. CONRAD (for Mrs. Boxer) proposed an amendment to the concurrent, \nSenate Concurrent Resolution 86, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 16, line 9, increase the amount by $50,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 10, increase the amount by $6,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 13, increase the amount by $50,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 14, increase the amount by $40,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 17, increase the amount by $50,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 18, increase the amount by $49,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 21, increase the amount by $50,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 22, increase the amount by $50,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 25, increase the amount by $50,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 1, increase the amount by $50,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 8, decrease the amount by $50,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 9, decrease the amount by $6,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 12, decrease the amount by $50,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 13, decrease the amount by $40,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 16, decrease the amount by $50,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 17, decrease the amount by $49,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 20, decrease the amount by $50,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 21, decrease the amount by $50,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 24, decrease the amount by $50,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 25, decrease the amount by $50,000,000.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      BROWNBACK AMENDMENT NO. 2177\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK proposed an amendment to the concurrent resolution, \nSenate Concurrent Resolution 86, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC.     .

Mr. President, recently some of my colleagues \non the Energy Committee and I traveled to Venezuela to tour some of the \noil and gas operations run by the state-owned oil company, Petroleos de \nVenezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), and to learn more about the U.S.-Venezuela \nrelationship on energy matters. Not many weeks prior to our trip, I had \ntraveled to Venezuela for the first time to attend and address the \nHemispheric Energy Conference in Caracas, which was co-chaired by \nEnergy Secretary Federico Pena.\n  As Chairman of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, I \nbelieve my colleagues should know the important role Venezuela plays in \nU.S. and hemispheric energy security. And, as a Senator strongly \ncommitted to preserving and strengthening the U.S. oil and gas \nindustry, I believe it is essential that we understand to the fullest \nextent possible the relationships between our countries and energy \nindustries, and how we stand in relation to the rest of the world. I \nthink it is safe to say, Mr. President, that very few people in our \ncountry appreciate Venezuela's importance in the global energy picture.\n  Our visit to Venezuela was particularly timely in light of the recent \ndrop in world oil prices and the agreement among OPEC and non-OPEC \nmembers to curtail production to halt the downward fall in prices. \nVenezuela is a member of OPEC, and is a country others are looking to \nfor cooperation in scaling down production.\n  What my colleagues and I learned about Venezuela's energy industry \nfrom our brief visit, Mr. President, is very impressive. I want to \nshare some of the information we gathered with the rest of our \ncolleagues in the Senate.\n  The United States and Venezuela have a long history of cooperation on \nenergy matters. Venezuela has continuously provided oil to the U.S. for \nmore than 70 years. During World War II, the Korean War, the conflict \nin Vietnam, and more recently the oil embargos and Persian Gulf War, \nVenezuela has been a stable and reliable source of oil for the United \nStates. The U.S. presently imports just under 1.5 million barrels of \noil a day from Venezuela, making Venezuela the largest supplier of \ncrude. Venezuela, Mexico and Canada are the leaders in the Western \nHemisphere in supplying oil to the U.S., which imports 52 percent of \nits daily production from that region.\n  Because of the proximity of our two countries, and certain synergies \nin our energy industries, the U.S. and Venezuela now enjoy a robust \nenergy relationship that is triggering economic development and opening \nnew trade and investment opportunities in both countries. To date, \nVenezuela's oil company has invested $2 billion in the U.S., and is \nimporting hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. goods and services \nused for energy production in Venezuela. A new bilateral investment \nprotection treaty presently being negotiated between the two countries \nwill afford U.S. investors greater safeguards in such important areas \nas capital transfers, international arbitration, intellectual property \nrights and others, and will put U.S. investors on an even playing field \nwith investors from other countries.\n  Venezuela has 75 billion barrels of proven conventional crude oil \nreserves, ranking fifth-largest in the world and first outside of the \nMiddle East. By comparison, U.S. crude oil reserves are three times \nsmaller. In Venezuela's Orinoco Belt, which we visited, there are 1.2 \ntrillion barrels of extra-heavy oil in place. Using a conservative rate \nof recovery of 20 to 25 percent at today's technology, it is estimated \nthat 270 to 320 billion barrels of this resource could be recovered and \nused as a boiler fuel. In addition, Venezuela has 146 trillion cubic \nfeet of natural gas reserves, which rank seventh-largest in the world. \nThe U.S. is sixth in the world with 165 trillion cubic feet of natural \ngas reserves.\n  Mr. President, Venezuela is prepared to share its abundant oil \nresources with the rest of the world, and is implementing plans to \nalmost double oil production from 3.7 to 6.5 million barrels per day by \nthe year 2007. In order to do so, PDVSA plans to invest $65 billion in \nthe next 10 years, $37 billion of which will come from its own revenue \nstream. $18 billion will come from PDVSA's foreign partners, and $10 \nbillion will come from strategic alliances with foreign firms. Of the \n$65 billion total investment, PDVSA plans to invest $1.5 billion in the \nU.S.\n  To expand production and improve operating efficiency, PDVSA has \nundertaken several rounds of ``oil openings,'' a process in which \nparticipation of companies operating around the world is solicited in \nan open bidding process. In the first round of bidding, ten light- and \nmedium-crude fields were opened to foreign investment. Eight of the ten \nsuccessful bidders were companies operating in the U.S.--Amoco, BP \nAmerica, Benton Oil and Gas Company, Dupont Conoco, Enron Oil and Gas \nCompany, Louisiana Land and Exploration Company, Maxus Energy Corp., \nand Mobil Corp.\n  PDVSA is involved in five joint ventures with U.S. companies to open \nVenezuela's extensive heavy oil reserves in the eastern Orinoco Belt \nand the western Boscan field. Those companies are Arco, Chevron, \nConoco, Mobil and Total, N.A.\n  In addition, PDVSA has issued more than a dozen contracts to \ncompanies to develop marginal and inactive oil fields that contain \napproximately 2 billion barrels of light and medium crude oil. Those \ncompanies include Amoco, Benton Oil and Gas Co., Chevron, Mosbacher \nEnergy Company, Occidental, Pennzoil, Total, and Shell.\n  Similar opportunities for investment in Venezuelan joint ventures lie \nahead for U.S. companies.\n  Mr. President, the harsh reality is that the U.S. will import greater \nand greater amounts of oil to meet its domestic energy needs in the \ncoming decades, notwithstanding our efforts to maintain a viable \ndomestic oil and gas industry. Presently, the U.S. is importing about \n54 percent of its daily crude oil needs, and that level is expected to \nexceed 60 percent in a few short years.\n  I believe U.S. government policies should favor reasonable oil and \ngas exploration and production efforts, fair royalty and tax treatment, \nand balanced environmental and conservation measures so that we can \nproduce our own energy for our growing economy. Unfortunately, the \nAdministration does not have those goals in mind, and does not see the \nimportance of setting a national energy policy.\n  In my State of Alaska, we have potentially large untapped crude oil \nreserves in the ANWR and on the Alaska Outer Continental Shelf. The \nAdministration does not support environmentally responsible exploration \nof ANWR, however. Elsewhere in the lower 48 states, the Administration \nis frustrating exploration and production activities on federal lands \nby removing promising acreage from inventory of lands accessible for \nexploration purposes, and is making more difficult the job of producing \nenergy by imposing onerous economic and regulatory requirements.\n  Now, at a time when world oil prices are plummeting to record lows, \nit will be more and more difficult for American companies to produce \noil at a reasonable price. While this is good news\n\n[[Page S2778]]\n\nto the people of the U.S. because gasoline is at its lowest price ever \nwhen adjusted for inflation, it is not welcome news to small and \nindependent oil and gas producers who will be especially hard hit, or \nto the larger energy producing companies.\n  It stands to reason, Mr. President, that the U.S. economy and \nindustrial sector will benefit during times of low energy prices. The \nbad news is that there is a down-side to lower energy prices, and one \nthat few people fully appreciate. When world oil prices fall below a \ncertain level, as they have recently, the U.S. stands to lose \nproduction from stripper wells and marginally economic wells, along \nwith the jobs associated with those wells. That, in turn, has ripple \neffects elsewhere in the economy through loss of jobs in the industries \nthat supply goods and services to producers, and in the communities \nwhere they operate.\n  While we can take comfort in knowing that Venezuela is prepared to \nmeet our oil import needs now and in the future, Mr. President, our \ntrip served to bring more clearly into focus the U.S. energy situation \nand the need for policies and programs to preserve domestic production \nso that the current price situation does not cause permanent loss of \njobs and domestic oil and gas reserves.\n  I intend to take important steps in the coming weeks to address the \nU.S. energy situation, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/30/senate-section/article/S2777-2", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          HONORING RICHARD M. WILLIAMS FOR 24 YEARS OF SERVICE\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a man \nwho has spent the last twenty four years of his life working to ensure \nthat Vermonters who are struggling to make ends meet, can afford to \nkeep a roof over their heads. Richard Williams is far too humble to ask \nfor recognition for those years of service, but that service has meant \ntoo much to go unrecognized.\n  The Vermont State Housing Authority (VSHA) was the first statewide \nhousing authority in the United States, and Richard has been with it \nalmost from the beginning. He came to VSHA in 1974 as an accountant \nwhen the organization itself was only six years old. Through the years \nhe has served as Director of Fiscal Management, Deputy Director, and \nsince 1984, Executive Director.\n  Under his leadership, VSHA has grown considerably. Today it \nadministers the Section 8 program providing 4,585 families with rental \nassistance. The organization's non-profit arm, The Housing Foundation \nInc. (HFI), which Richard helped to establish, created additional units \nof affordable housing and mobile home park lots. Through the HFI and \nvarious partnerships 1,050 units of affordable housing are now \navailable for low-income families in Vermont. Just recently, Richard \noversaw a creative interpretation of the tax code which, with the help \nof the Howard Bank, produced an $8.1 million tax exempt bond to \nrefinance most of the mobile home parks in The Housing Foundation \nportfolio, to the benefit of 565 Vermont households.\n  But Richard was never content to limit himself to the work of VSHA. \nHe sits on more boards and has served in more associations than I could \nrecount here today. Among them are the Governor's Housing Council, the \nAdvisory Group for the Consolidated Plan, and the Low-Income Housing \nTax Credit Committee. With all of these commitments, it amazes me that \nhe gets any rest at all. Vermonters are fortunate indeed to have \nsomeone so dedicated to making housing affordable for all, and who \napparently needs so little sleep.\n  This year, the Vermont State Housing Authority is celebrating its \nthirtieth anniversary, and that is indeed cause for celebration. I \napplaud VSHA for thirty years of outstanding service to Vermont, and at \nthe same time recognize Richard Williams for the large part he has \nplayed in that success. I know I speak for thousands of Vermonters who \nhave a roof over their heads today because of his efforts, in saying \nthank you to Richard for twenty four years of service to \nVermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/30/senate-section/article/S2778-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       EXTENSION OF DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSION OF COMMISSION REPORT\n\n  Mr. DeWINE.

Mr. President, further, on behalf of the majority leader, \nI ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of S. Res. 202 submitted earlier today by Senators Lott \nand Daschle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 202) to authorize representation by \n     the Senate legal counsel.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, as my colleagues are aware, the \nCongressional Accountability Act of 1995 created procedures for \njudicial review of employment discrimination claims throughout the \nCongress to govern cases arising after the requirements of the law took \neffect on January 23, 1996. The Senate's antecedent process for review \nof discrimination claims in Senate employment, which was created by the \nGovernment Employee Rights Act of 1991, continues to govern older \ncases. The cases of William L. Singer versus Office of Senate Fair \nEmployment Practices and Office of the Senate Sergeant at Arms versus \nOffice of Senate Fair Employment Practices, now pending in the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, arise under the 1991 \nAct.\n  These consolidated cases present the Federal Circuit with two \npetitions for review of the same underlying order. The first petition \nwas filed by William Singer, a former member of the Capitol Police. \nAfter Officer Singer filed his petition for review, the Office of the \nSenate Sergeant at Arms, Officer Singer's ``employing office'' under \nthe statute, filed its own petition for review. Both petitions seek \nreview of a ruling of the Select Committee on Ethics concerning Officer \nSinger's request for reimbursement of attorneys' fees incurred in an \nunderlying employment discrimination action.\n  Under the Government Employee Rights Act, a final decision of the \nEthics Committee is entered in the records of the Office of Senate Fair \nEmployment Practices, which is then named as the respondent if the \ndecision is challenged in the Federal Circuit. As petitions for review \nin the Federal Circuit challenge final decisions of a Senate \nadjudicatory process, under the Government Employee Rights Act the \nSenate Legal Counsel may be directed to defend those decisions through \nrepresentation of the Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices in \ncourt.\n  Accordingly, this resolution directs the Senate Legal Counsel to \nrepresent\n\n[[Page S2779]]\n\nthe Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices, in the cases of Singer \nversus Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices and Office of the \nSenate Sergeant at Arms versus Office of Senate Fair Employment \nPractices, in defense of the Ethics Committee's final decision.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to \nthis measure appear at this point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 202) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 202\n\n       Whereas, in the cases of William L. Singer v. Office of \n     Senate Fair Employment Practices, No. 98-6002, and Office of \n     the Senate Sergeant at Arms v. Office of Senate Fair \n     Employment Practices, No. 98-6003, pending in the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, petitioners \n     William L. Singer and the Office of the Senate Sergeant at \n     Arms have sought review of a final decision of the Select \n     Committee on Ethics, which had been entered, pursuant to \n     section 308 of the Government Employee Rights Act of 1991, 2 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1208 (1994), in the records of the Office of \n     Senate Fair Employment Practices;\n       Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(1) of the \n     Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 288b(a) \n     and 288c(a)(1)(1994), the Senate may direct its counsel to \n     defend committees of the Senate in civil actions relating to \n     their official responsibilities;\n       Whereas, pursuant to section 303(f) of the Government \n     Employee Rights Act of 1991, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1203(f) (1994), \n     for purposes of representation by the Senate Legal Counsel, \n     the Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices, the \n     respondent in this proceeding, is deemed a committee within \n     the meaning of sections 703(a) and 704(a)(1) of the Ethics in \n     Government Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 288b(a), \n     288c(a)(1)(1994): Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate Legal Counsel is directed to \n     represent the Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices in \n     the cases of William L.
