So everyone should understand, \nthis vote tonight is a very important vote. I am disappointed some \nSenators aren't going to be here.

We will have \nsome votes that may be more meaningful, as this one is.\n  During this next work period, the only time we will have off will be \nNovember 11 for the celebration of Veterans Day. Therefore, if we are \ngoing to finish our work in this 4-week period, that means we are going \nto have to work on Mondays and Fridays.

What a remarkable young man he is.\n  He was a student at Stanford, and to get into Stanford you have to be \na very good student. I am impressed with his academic skills, but he \nwas also a tight end for the football team at Stanford, No. 5 in the \nNation. They have a great football program. Everyone will meet Cory \nBooker and find that he is a very big man physically.\n  After graduating with a degree from Stanford in political science, he \ngot his master's degree in sociology from Stanford. He then became a \nRhodes Scholar and studied U.S. history at Oxford. He received his law \ndegree from Yale. What an outstanding record: Stanford, a couple of \ndegrees; Rhodes Scholar, Oxford; Yale Law School. That is quite \nimpressive. Then he served on the Newark City Council and was mayor for \n2 years, a job that has been noticed all over the country, recognizing \nthe great work he has done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/28/senate-section/article/S7563-8", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7563-S7565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE WORK AHEAD\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, during this 4-week period we are going to do \na number of things, not necessarily in this order, but we are going to \nconsider ENDA, known as the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which \nwould provide basic protections against workplace discrimination on the \nbasis of sexual orientation and gender identity. We haven't taken this \nup for a number of years. We tried and failed in the House of \nRepresentatives before, but we are going to take it up here again.\n  We are going to consider a bipartisan bill to make compounding drugs \nsafer. As we will recall, there was a terrible tragedy in the \nNortheast, where a number of people died as a result of not compounding \nthese products properly. This bipartisan legislation will allow\n\n[[Page S7564]]\n\nus to have safer compounding drugs and track prescription medicines \nfrom factory to the drug store.\n  We are going to consider job creation legislation that will build on \nthe economic recovery and strengthen middle-class families, and we are \ngoing to take up the Defense authorization bill which supports our \ntroops and ensures this Nation does everything in its power to keep \nAmerica safe from those who would do us harm.\n  Before we debate any of these matters, we must consider a number of \nvital Presidential nominations, including several that have been \nstalled for more than 1 year. One of those is somebody who has been \nwanting to work in the Defense Department, something vitally important \nfor the Pentagon, and has been held up for 1 year on an unrelated \nmatter. It is too bad, but this has been held up by one Republican \nSenator. So we are going to move forward and do it very quickly.\n  It is no secret the Republicans have systemically slow-walked and \nblocked scores of President Obama's judicial and executive branch \nnominations. Pending executive nominations wait an average of 5 months. \nDemocrats have broken filibusters of 66 of the President's nominations. \nRepublicans have blocked or delayed more than that with secret holds \nand procedural holds.\n  As a Senate, we reached an agreement the first of the year to \nconsider a number of important nominations that have been stalled for \nmonths and, in far too many cases, for years. But obstructionism once \nagain has reared its ugly head and we have a backlog now. It is time to \nmove forward without delay and fill those crucial roles.\n  In the wake of a Republican government shutdown, the Nation is \nwatching for a sign the Senate can function efficiently and normally. \nIt is time to show the American people how well and how quickly the \nSenate can work when cooperation is present. Likewise, our colleagues \nin the House of Representatives owe the American people to stop wasting \ntime on political show votes and start legislating.\n  I have enough trouble with my schedule, but I just have to briefly \ncomment on the House schedule. They are going to work until noon on \nWednesday and then they are taking off the next 10 days. From now until \nthe first of the year, they have scheduled 18 working days. That is all \nI will say on that.\n  Our colleagues in the House owe it to the American people to move \nforward on legislation. On many of the most important issues of the \nday, the Republican leaders have refused to allow the House of \nRepresentatives to be heard. Some are allowed to be heard, but Speaker \nBoehner has a rule that Democrats don't get to participate unless he \ncan first prove there is a majority of the majority to vote on an \nissue. That is not the way it needs to be.\n  We are going to have a celebration here tomorrow on the life of Tom \nFoley. I had the good fortune of serving with him in the House. He came \nfrom a real conservative district in the State of Washington. He served \nfor many years. He was the majority leader, he was the Speaker and a \nfine man. He, similar to the other leaders I served with, O'Neill and \nWright, tried to get 218 votes to pass a measure. They didn't try to \nget 218 from the Democrats. They had plenty of Democrats and could have \ndone that. But everyone was allowed to vote. That is the way it should \nbe now. It is too bad it isn't. What has happened over there is the \nRepublican leadership has refused to allow the whole House of \nRepresentatives to work its will.\n  Immigration reform is one of the most glaring examples of their not \nallowing the body to run as it used to. Last June the Senate passed a \ncommonsense bipartisan bill to fix the broken illegal immigration \nsystem. It would have strengthened our borders, required undocumented \npeople to get right with the law, and put them on a path to \ncitizenship. There are about 11 million people. But for 4 months--120-\nplus days--the House of Representatives has failed to act on \nimmigration legislation. If we brought up a bill, the Senate bill would \npass overwhelmingly. Even many mainstream Republicans believe House \nRepublican leadership should allow a vote on the comprehensive plan to \namend the broken immigration system. I repeat, if the whole House were \nallowed to vote, it would pass.\n  The House also failed to take up the Senate's bipartisan agricultural \njobs bill--the farm bill, as we call it--a bill that cuts the debt by \n$23 billion and supports 16 million American jobs. They have also \nrefused to bring up something so common sense.\n  The Presiding Officer, before coming here, was Governor of the State \nof Virginia. I am sure the Presiding Officer, as I have, has gone \nthrough towns and neighborhoods and seen those little strip malls with \nall these places for lease. If we passed in Congress, as we have done \nin the Senate, the so-called Workplace Fairness Act, it would allow \nthese small businesses to get back and rent space allowing it to \nsurvive. Think of the advantages online retailers have. They don't have \nto pay 5 percent, 7 percent of what the others pay. So it is very \nunfair for these brick-and-mortar places to be left to the mercy of \nthese big online folks.\n  When we brought up this bill, I got a call from one of the major \nonline organizations. They said: We will support your legislation if \nyou will put a ceiling that we don't have to do anything until there is \n$5 million in sales. They want $5 million in sales and then pay no \nsales tax--a pretty good deal. We passed--rightfully so--a bipartisan \nbill. The House will not take this up. It is too bad.\n  So on these and other issues, it is time for reasonable Republicans \nto raise their voice in the Senate and of course in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  There has been a troubling trend over the last 3 years. I have been \ntroubled to watch these so-called mainstream Republicans be \nmarginalized by Members of their own party. It is not the marginal \npeople who are being marginalized. It is the mainstream Republicans. \nEven more troubling, moderate Republicans have been complicit in \nallowing this disturbing trend to continue. It is no surprise when tea \nparty extremists force our economy to the brink of disaster when they \nshut down the government for the sake of ideological stunts. We saw \nwhat happened. We weren't surprised that the tea party did this, but I \nwas surprised that the sensible mainstream Republicans didn't speak \nup--and speak up sooner--and many didn't speak up at all in defense of \nreason and responsibility.\n  Think about that. There are 232 Republicans in the House of \nRepresentatives. On a vote to open the government after 16 days of \nbeing closed and defaulting on the debt, only 85 of the 232 voted to \nreopen the government and keep us from defaulting on our debt. That is \na scary number. So the vast majority of the Republicans in the House \nwanted to keep the government closed and to default on the debt.\n  Wow, that is spooky.\n  As their more radical colleagues drove the nation and the world to \nthe brink of economic collapse, most middle-of-the-road Republicans \nsaid nothing and did nothing to stop it, which was certainly a surprise \nto me. Although I deplore the behavior of the extremists who sparked \nthis month's manufactured crisis--and many of the crises over the past \n3 years--I do not blame only them for holding the United States \nGovernment's full faith and credit hostage. I also blame the so-called \nmain stream Republican colleagues who remained silent even as these \nanarchists among us committed political malpractice. They knew better. \nThey should have known better. They know the consequence of default, \nand they know the cost of a government shutdown. Yet they allowed \nmembers of their own party to take the country down a dangerous road, \ndoing irreparable harm to the country and, I believe, to the Republican \nParty.\n  As a conference committee sits down to negotiate a long-term budget \nagreement and sets a course for fiscal responsibility, reasonable and \nmoderate Republicans, main stream Republicans, must not absent \nthemselves from these discussions. A significant number of radical \nRepublicans have said they would rather risk default than cooperate or \ncompromise with Democrats. Sensible Republicans must not allow these \nradicals to rule the day.\n  We, the Democrats, are ready to do the difficult work of finding \ncommon ground for the good of our country. We don't expect radical tea \nparty Republicans to join us, but we do hope our mainstream Republican \ncolleagues will find their voices, reclaim their party,\n\n[[Page S7565]]\n\nand work with Democrats to govern once again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/28/senate-section/article/S7565-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, tomorrow, according to the statement \nmade by the majority leader, we will be voting on the nomination of \nRichard Griffin, Jr. for General Counsel of the National Labor \nRelations Board.\n  I will be voting against Mr. Griffin's nomination for general counsel \nbecause I am concerned about the direction of the NLRB as an advocate \nmore than an umpire, and I do not believe his presence as the general \ncounsel will improve that situation.\n  As the senior Republican on the Labor Committee, working with my \nfriend, the chairman, Senator Harkin, and with others, what I hope we \ncan do over the next several years is look for a long-term solution for \nthe restructuring of the National Labor Relations Board--one that will \nensure that it will operate more as an umpire than as an advocate, \nwhether the President is a Democrat or a Republican.\n  The Board has become far too politicized under recent \nadministrations. This did not start with the Obama administration, but \nit has gotten worse with this administration, and it has moved more and \nmore toward the side of union advocacy with such major shifts as ambush \nelections, micro-unions, and undermining State right-to-work laws.\n  Swinging back and forth on important labor policy issues does the \nAmerican working man and woman no good in this time of underemployment \nand unemployment.\n  So, later this fall, I will join other Senators in introducing \nlegislation that will restore balance to the National Labor Relations \nBoard--a proposal that will retain the rights of workers and employees, \nbut reduce the swing that occurs from administration to administration \nbased upon who is in power. What we should be striving for is fairness \nand consistency.\n  There are exceptions, of course, but as a general proposition, I \nbelieve a President should have an up-or-down vote on his nominee, so I \nintend to vote for cloture. But Mr. Griffin's nomination does not do \nenough for me to show the promise of moving the Board from advocacy \ntoward umpire and, therefore, I do not intend to vote to confirm his \nnomination.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and I thank Senator Harkin for his \ncourtesy in allowing me to go first.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, again, I want to thank my colleague and \ngood friend Senator Alexander for a great working relationship on our \ncommittee. Obviously, we have differences of views and opinions on \nmatters--that is the nature of legislation and this body--but we have \nalways worked together in a very conciliatory fashion, and open, and \nworking things out. So I appreciate his approach and the fact that the \nSenator is willing to give us cloture so we can get an up-or-down vote. \nI understand he has certain reservations about the nominee. I \nunderstand that. But, again, I thank my colleague for being willing to \nget us to the point where we can have an up-or-down vote on Mr. \nGriffin.\n  Madam President, tomorrow--we were going to vote today, but the \nleader came out and announced there was an agreement on both sides to \nput the vote off until tomorrow to consider the nomination of Mr. \nRichard Griffin to serve as General Counsel of the National Labor \nRelations Board, a very important role as the top prosecutor for \nviolations of this country's labor laws.\n  Given his depth of experience and knowledge of the act, Mr. Griffin \nis exceptionally well qualified for this position, and I have no doubt \nhe will do an outstanding job of enforcing our Nation's labor laws for \nworkers, unions, and employers.\n  In July, we confirmed five new NLRB members, preventing the agency \nfrom shutting down, giving it a full slate of members for the first \ntime in a decade. With a fully functional five-member Board and a new \nSenate-confirmed General Counsel, it is my hope we can provide this \nimportant agency with some much-needed certainty, mark a new positive \nchapter for the NLRB, and finally put an end to the delay and \nobstruction that has recently become all too familiar every time a new \nNLRB nominee is appointed. Without relitigating the previous \ncontroversies, I think it is fair to say that over the past few years \nthe NLRB has been the target of unnecessary political attacks and \nobstruction.\n  What most concerns me about this political game-playing is how it \naffects the everyday lives of working people across America. These \nattacks on the Board have had real consequences for real people.\n  Working Americans need and deserve a fully functioning agency to \nprotect their rights and enforce our Nation's labor laws. That is why \nover 75 years ago Congress enacted the National Labor Relations Act, \nguaranteeing American workers the right to form and join a union and to \nbargain for a better life. For both union and nonunion workers alike, \nthe act provides essential protections. It gives workers a voice in the \nworkplace. It allows them to join together and speak up for fair wages, \ngood benefits, and safe working conditions. These rights ensure that \nthe people who do the real work in this country see the benefits when \nour economy grows and are not mistreated or put at risk on the job.\n  The National Labor Relations Board is the guardian of these \nfundamental rights. Workers themselves cannot enforce the National \nLabor Relations Act. The Board is the only place workers can go if they \nhave been treated unfairly and denied the basic protections the law \nprovides. Thus, the Board plays a vital role in vindicating workers' \nrights. In the past 10 years, the NLRB has secured opportunities for \nreinstatement for 22,544 employees who were unjustly fired. It has also \nrecovered more than $1 billion on behalf of workers whose rights were \nviolated.\n  I know many times people think: Well, a lot of these old abuses of \nworkers whom you read about in your history books--well, that is just \nhistory and we have gotten over that. Quite frankly, I wish that were \nthe truth. But the fact that in 10 years 22,544 employees were \nreinstated because they were unjustly fired indicates there are still \nunfair labor practices being committed by businesses today. And $1 \nbillion recovered on behalf of workers just in the last 10 years--that \nis $1 billion that unscrupulous companies took from their workers \nwithout the right to do so, and the NLRB got that money back for \nworkers. Think about that: $1 billion.\n  The Board does not just protect the rights of workers and unions; it \nalso provides relief and remedies to our Nation's employers, our \nbusinesses. The Board is an employer's only recourse if a union \ncommences a wildcat strike, for example, or refuses to bargain in good \nfaith during negotiations. By preventing labor disputes that could \ndisrupt our economy, the work the Board does is vital to every worker \nand every business across the Nation.\n  Further, the NLRB, you have to understand, is divided into two \nindependent sides. There is the Board side, which adjudicates and \ninterprets the law; then there is the General Counsel side, which \ninvestigates filed charges, prosecutes violations, and generally \nsupervises the processing of cases. The general counsel position is \nimportant because the NLRB receives about 20,000 to 30,000 charges per \nyear from employees, unions, and employers, and it is the primary \nfunction of the general counsel to make sure these charges--each \ncharge--are thoroughly investigated and prosecuted if they are \ndetermined to have merit.\n  The general counsel also serves an important role that some of my \ncolleagues may not know about. The attorneys in the General Counsel's \nOffice help facilitate settlements to resolve disputes efficiently. For \nexample, when two unions picketed Walmart in 2012, Walmart filed a \nclaim with the NLRB, and the agency negotiated a settlement. Indeed, \nsettlements are not the\n\n[[Page S7568]]\n\nexception at the NLRB but the rule, and they are encouraged. In fact, \nover 90 percent of meritorious unfair labor practice cases are settled \nby agreement, either through a Board settlement or a private agreement \nby the two sides.\n  Now that I have discussed the importance of the NLRB in protecting \nrights and the role the General Counsel plays at that agency, I want to \nturn the page and talk about Mr. Griffin, the nominee who is before us \nnow to be the General Counsel, and I want to again indicate why I \nstrongly support his nomination.\n  Richard Griffin has a wealth of experience as a labor lawyer. He is \ndeeply steeped in labor and employment law. He most recently served as \nan NLRB board member himself from January 2012 until this past August. \nPrior to that, Mr. Griffin was general counsel for the International \nUnion of Operating Engineers for more than 17 years. Mr. Griffin \nactually began his legal career over 30 years ago at the NLRB as a \ncounsel to Board members.\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have agreed that \nDick Griffin is well qualified to serve as general counsel--indeed, I \nthink his expertise in labor law is difficult to question--but some of \nmy friends on the Republican side continue to oppose his nomination \nbecause of an outstanding legal issue that has nothing to do with Mr. \nGriffin's previous public service, his background, or his ability to \nfunction in this new position.\n  Here is what this is all about: Much has been made about the process \nby which Mr. Griffin was previously recess appointed to serve as a \nBoard member. The controversy began when the District of Columbia \nCircuit Court issued a ruling in a case which is called the Noel \nCanning case that diverged from the decisions of three other courts of \nappeals--the Second Circuit, the Ninth Circuit, and the Eleventh \nCircuit--and my friends on the Republican side are questioning the \nvalidity of an appointment process that has been in place for over 220 \nyears. And that was the decision in the Noel Canning case. \nSubsequently, two other appeals courts have addressed this issue. The \nSupreme Court is set to resolve the legal issue once and for all during \nthis session of the Supreme Court.\n  Again, to sum it up, we have different circuit courts deciding \ndifferently on an appointment process that any President uses to fill \nrecess appointments. This litigation is still pending. The legal \nquestion remains unresolved until the Supreme Court decides it. But a \nnumber of my colleagues during that period when we had different \ncircuit courts deciding differently on this appointment issue called \nfor Mr. Griffin to resign his position on the Board, even though he had \ndone nothing personally wrong and he had taken an oath of office to \nfulfill his duties.\n  I believe that request from my Republican colleagues was \nunreasonable. There was clear precedent at the Board for Mr. Griffin to \ncontinue to serve until the final legal matter was ultimately resolved. \nWhen there is a split among the circuit courts of appeals, the NLRB has \na longstanding history of waiting until the legal question is resolved \nby the Supreme Court before they take action, particularly when the \nissue involves the Board's operability.\n  The situation that was facing the Board after this Noel Canning case \nis directly parallel to a circumstance by the Board a few years ago \nwhen the Board only had two members--only had two members. The DC \nCircuit ruled in a case called the Laurel Baye case that the two-member \nBoard lacked a quorum to do business. Even after the DC Circuit's \ndecision, the two-member Board, one Republican, one Democrat, continued \nto hear and issue cases until the Supreme Court ruled on the question.\n  Not a single Republican Senator called on either one of those two \nBoard members to resign simply because they refused to acquiesce to the \ndecision of the DC Circuit. So here is what happened. Mr. Griffin and \nhis fellow recess appointee Sharon Block acted appropriately in \nfollowing this direct precedent and continuing to serve on the Board \nuntil the Supreme Court addressed the validity of their recess \nappointments.\n  To argue that Mr. Griffin's decision to uphold his oath of office and \nfollow the Board's prior practice, that somehow that makes him \nunqualified to now serve as the Board's General Counsel is, quite \nfrankly, a position I think is not only disappointing but I think \nwithout substance.\n  In addition to this questionable objection, Republicans also continue \nto claim that recent NLRB nominees, including Mr. Griffin, are \nunacceptable simply because they have worked on behalf of workers or \nunions and support our system of collective bargaining.\n  These nominees have been accused of being biased and unfit to serve. \nBut now I want to point out what the law actually says. Keep in mind, \nwhen Board members, as well as general counsel, are appointed to the \nBoard and we confirm them, they take an oath of office to uphold the \nlaw. So it is kind of interesting to note what the law actually says \nthat they are sworn by oath to uphold.\n  I have often quoted from the National Labor Relations Act on this \npoint. I will do so again. Here is what the law says, the National \nLabor Relations Act--the law that Board members and eventually Mr. \nGriffin, if he is confirmed--and I believe he will be--will take an \noath of office to uphold. Here is the law. I will quote it exactly as \nit is written:\n\n       It is declared to be the policy of the United States to \n     eliminate the causes of certain substantial obstructions to \n     the free flow of commerce and to mitigate and eliminate these \n     obstructions when they have occurred by encouraging the \n     practice and procedure of collective bargaining and by \n     protecting the exercise by workers of full freedom of \n     association, self-organization, and designation of \n     representatives of their own choosing, for the purpose of \n     negotiating the terms and conditions of their employment or \n     other mutual aid or protection.\n\n  Those are the exact words. That is what the law says. The purpose and \nthe policy is to promote collective bargaining, to promote collective \nbargaining and freedom of association, protecting workers and their \nrights of self-organization, the designation of representatives of \ntheir own choosing. That is what the law says.\n  I think the fact that Mr. Griffin takes that purpose seriously makes \nhim more qualified, not less qualified, to serve as general counsel. \nHis past career is not cause for concern. Most labor lawyers devote \ntheir careers either to representing workers and unions or the \nmanagement. That is the nature of practicing labor and employment law.\n  We have confirmed NLRB nominees in the past, some of whom have been \nunion side and some have been management side. We have done so without \nsubstantial controversy. The fact that Mr. Griffin happens to come from \nthe union side practice does not make him inherently biased. For years, \nRepublican and Democratic Presidents have appointed promanagement \nattorneys to fill positions at the NLRB.\n  There is even the one example of where a Board member came directly \nfrom an in-house position at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. But I do not \nhear anyone on the Republican side accusing those nominees of bias. I \nguess it is only when you represent labor unions that you are biased, \nnot when you represent the Chamber of Commerce.\n  I would also like to point out that while I certainly have not agreed \nwith the politics or ideology of every past NLRB nominee, I voted to \nsupported Republican nominees, such as Phillip Miscimarra and Harry \nJohnson, who are on the Board now, not because I agreed with them but \nbecause, given their experience and their diverse backgrounds, they \nwere qualified to serve. They were qualified, as is Mr. Griffin, \neminently well qualified.\n  Board members can and do separate their past work as an advocate from \ntheir work as a neutral interpreter of the act once they are confirmed. \nI am absolutely sure Mr. Griffin will do the same if confirmed as \nGeneral Counsel. I have every confidence that Mr. Griffin will be, in \nthe words of one of the current Board members, not prounion, not \nproworker, not promanagement, but pro-act, pro-Labor Relations Act or \nput maybe more succinctly prolaw, prolaw enforcement.\n  With this in mind, and for all of the reasons I have mentioned, I \nurge all of my colleagues, my Republican colleagues, to consider voting \nfor Mr. Griffin because he deserves a strong bipartisan vote.\n\n[[Page S7569]]\n\n  As I stated earlier, I voted for Republican members. When we had \nBoard members earlier this year, in July if I am not mistaken, in July \nof this year, Democrats voted for the two Republican nominees, again \nnot because we agreed with them ideologically, maybe where they were \ncoming from, but they were qualified to serve.\n  Yet when we have nominees with whom the Republicans are opposed \nideologically, even though they are well qualified, Republicans vote \nno. Think about that. When we have nominees to the National Labor \nRelations Board, whom the Republicans support, to whom we may be \nopposed ideologically but they are qualified, we vote for them. \nDemocrats vote for them. When we have nominees to the National Labor \nRelations Board who are well qualified but whom the Republicans \ndisagree with ideologically, they vote against them--quite a \ndifference.\n  Now is the time to start breaking that down. It did not used to be \nthis way. It never was this way in the past. If they were qualified \nunder a Republican President, we would support them; a Democratic \nPresident, we would support them. We wanted to know what were their \nqualifications, what were their backgrounds, were they vetted \nproperly--no criminal activity, nothing in their background that would \nindicate they could not judiciously act openly and fairly.\n  I am sorry it has gotten to this position now where Republicans feel \nthey have to vote against someone to the National Labor Relations Board \nsimply because that person was a lawyer for a labor union. I voted for \nNLRB members who were lawyers for businesses. That is fine. I have no \nproblem with that. Why do my Republican colleagues have such a problem \nvoting for someone who was a lawyer for a labor union? Labor unions are \nlegal entities protected by national law, the National Labor Relations \nAct.\n  So I hope again that my Republican colleagues will look at Mr. \nGriffin for who he is, for what he is, for his background, eminently \nwell qualified, has always been fair, has always been judicious--a good \nlawyer.\n  Yes, he represents labor unions. But in all of the vetting we had in \nour committee on Mr. Griffin, we had people from the business side and \nothers who all said he represented labor unions, but he did so fairly. \nHe did that fairly, with competence and with the ability to work out \nagreements with the other side. What more can you ask?\n  I am hopeful this vote tomorrow will mark a new beginning for the \nNational Labor Relations Board. We will have a vote on cloture and then \nwe will have an up-or-down vote. So we have 60 votes for cloture to \nbring it to a close. Then there will be up to 8 hours of debate on the \nnominee. I do not think we need to take that long. I am hopeful some of \nmy Republican colleagues will vote for Mr. Griffin and start to break \nthis thing down, where if it is someone appointed by a Democratic \nPresident, Republicans vote no; if it is someone appointed by a \nRepublican President, Democrats vote no. That should not be the way it \nshould be, not the way it has been in my lifetime here, in all of my \ntime in the Senate.\n  I have served with three Republican Presidents in the Senate. They \nhave made nominations to the National Labor Relations Board. I have \nbeen on this committee since then. We always supported them. As long as \nthey were qualified and they went through the vetting process and they \nwere qualified, it was fine. The President should have his nominees. We \nwould vote for them.\n  I am hopeful we will get back to that. I hope we will have a new era, \nwhere the agency is no longer haunted by political attacks, political \ngames. It is time, long past time, to allow the NLRB to function as the \nlaw intends and let the dedicated public servants who work there do \ntheir jobs.\n  We will have this vote, I am told, tomorrow afternoon on cloture. As \nI said for the benefit of Senators, we will have up to 8 hours. I do \nnot imagine we will take all of that. We will have up to 8 hours of \ndebate on the nominee. Again, I hope we have a good strong vote on both \ncloture and on the nominee himself. Mr. Griffin, as I said, is \neminently well qualified--eminently well qualified. Nothing in his \nbackground would ever indicate that he would be anything less than an \noutstanding counsel at the National Labor Relations Board.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Donnelly). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/28/senate-section/article/S7569-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO ROBERT M. GREELEY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the important work of \nMr. Robert M. Greeley, who is retiring on November 15, 2013, after a \nlong and distinguished career with the United States Capitol Police.\n  Mr. Greeley joined the Capitol Police in June, 1996, as director of \nthe Security Services Bureau, the most senior civilian security \nposition in the department. Mr. Greeley's team is responsible for the \ndevelopment, operation, and maintenance of the physical and technical \nsecurity systems needed to counter the threat of terrorism. In this \ncapacity, Mr. Greeley led the management of the multimillion dollar \nenhancements to the Capitol Complex following the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11, 2001. His expertise in the development and implementation \nof these security projects and systems was critical to the long- and \nshort-term protection of the personnel and facilities of the \nlegislative branch.\n  Prior to joining the Capitol Police, Mr. Greeley spent 14 years as a \nsecurity engineering officer with the U.S. Department of State's Office \nof Diplomatic Security and Foreign Missions. In that capacity, Mr. \nGreeley served overseas with regional responsibilities in Athens, \nMexico City, and Prague.\n  Mr. Greeley proudly served in the United States Air Force as a \nnavigational aids equipment specialist from 1978-1982.\n  As a former Capitol Police Officer, I appreciate the hard work and \ndedication of our nation's law enforcement officers, and I still feel a \nspecial bond with those who honor the badge by protecting and serving \nour communities. I, along with my colleagues in the Senate, \ncongratulate Mr. Greeley on his well-earned retirement and wish him \nwell in his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/28/senate-section/article/S7569-2", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7569-S7570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING BRIAN MONKS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to Mr. Brian Monks of \nHuntingtown, NY, who graciously donated his time and unique talent to \nhelp create the beautiful and historic pen set for the United States \nSenate.\n  In 2012, the Office of the Senate Sergeant at Arms began designing a \nnew pen set for use at the Presiding Officer's desk when the Senate is \nin session. The pen set was to be constructed using historically \nsignificant materials, including marble removed from the West Brumidi \nCorridor of the Senate side of the Capitol during its expansion in \n2001, and wood from a 120-year-old mahogany tree that was removed from \nthe Capitol grounds in 2009. The Senate Cabinet Shop crafted the base \nand the pen holders using these historic materials. When the time came \nto construct the pens themselves from the same mahogany wood, the \nCabinet Shop needed to look for outside assistance.\n  This is when Mr. Monks stepped forward. He volunteered to expertly \nhand turn pieces of the historic wood into unique writing instruments \nfor the new Senate Chamber pen set.\n  Mr. Monks is the vice president of Underwriters Laboratories, and his \nhome in Long Island has housed his wood working hobby for many years. \nHe has earned a reputation as both an accomplished pen maker and a \ncreator of fine hand crafted furnishings. His handiwork on the \nPresiding Officer's pen set debuted in the Senate in April 2012 and is \nnow on display every time the Senate is in session.\n  Mr. Monks's fine craftsmanship not only resulted in high quality pens \nfor use by Senators serving as the Presiding Officer, but also \ncontributed to the overall beauty and historical significance of the \nPresiding Officer's desk in the Senate Chamber.\n  I join with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in saluting Mr. \nBrian\n\n[[Page S7570]]\n\nMonks for his artistic excellence, his spirit of volunteerism, and his \ngenerous contributions to the history and operations of the United \nStates Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/28/senate-section/article/S7570-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN COLOMBIA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to express my thanks to the \ngovernments of Colombia, Cuba and Norway, and to the International \nCommittee of the Red Cross and the Reverend Jessie Jackson, for their \nefforts to secure the release yesterday of American citizen, Kevin \nScott Sutay, who was kidnapped by the FARC earlier this year. I hope \nthis is another sign that negotiations to end Colombia's decades long \narmed conflict are progressing, and that a peace agreement is possible.\n  I also want to take this opportunity to call attention to the \ncontributions of two courageous Colombian human rights activists, \nIslena Rey and Father Alejandro Angulo Novoa, and to the challenges \nthey and other human rights defenders face.\n  On September 9, Colombia's Human Rights Day, both were awarded for \ntheir human rights work in a presentation organized by Di logo Inter-\nAgencial en Colombia, a consortium of international nongovernmental \norganizations working for human rights in Colombia. This is the second \nyear of the awards, and they were presented during a time of increasing \nattacks against human rights defenders in that country. The awards are \nsignificant not only because they recognize the recipients' \ncontributions, but also because they help to reduce the social stigma \nthat surrounds human rights work in Colombia and many other countries.\n  Islena Rey, founder of the Meta Civic Committee for Human Rights, was \nnamed Defender of the Year for her efforts to bring together and \norganize community leaders in support of victims of human rights \nabuses. She works in one of Colombia's most dangerous regions, the \nEastern Plains, which has long been plagued by violence spurred by the \nillegal narcotics trade.\n  Ms. Rey knows the risks. Four years ago this month, she was shot and \nseriously wounded while returning from a community meeting. She is also \nthe sole survivor of the original Meta Committee members, who, \nthroughout the 1990s, were systematically assassinated, leaving her to \ncarry out her advocacy work alone. Four years after nearly losing her \nlife, she presses on, conducting investigations, providing support to \nvictims, and working to rebuild the Meta Committee.\n  In addition to recognizing Islena Rey, the organization presented \nFather Alejandro Angulo Novoa with the Life Long Defender award for his \ncontributions to human rights in Colombia over the past 4 decades. \nFather Alejandro is one of the founders of the Center for Research and \nPopular Education in Bogota. He is currently the coordinator of CINEP's \nhuman rights database which collects, records, and disseminates \ninformation on the most serious violations of human rights and \ninternational humanitarian law. He has dedicated his life to this work \nand to supporting the poor and excluded.\n  The courage and dedication displayed by these two individuals \nrepresents just a small fraction of the essential work being done by \nhuman rights defenders in Colombia. It is all the more remarkable \nbecause, despite some notable progress in investigating, prosecuting \nand punishing those responsible for heinous crimes, impunity is the \nnorm and Colombia remains a very dangerous place for lawyers, social \nactivists, and journalists who work and report on human rights.\n  Islena Rey, Father Alejandro, and countless other brave Colombians \nwill continue tending to victims of human rights abuses. They are \nundeterred by the social stigma they face, or the threats and acts of \nviolence against them and their colleagues. They deserve our respect \nand our thanks, because the protection of human rights, wherever they \nare threatened or denied, is everybody's responsibility.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/28/senate-section/article/S7570-2", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        ELECTRONIC COMMMUNICATIONS PRIVACY ACT 27TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act \nECPA, one of the Nation's premiere digital privacy laws, was enacted 27 \nyears ago on October 21. I join the many privacy advocates, technology \norganizations, legal scholars and other Americans who celebrate this \nmilestone and all that ECPA has come to symbolize about the importance \nof safeguarding our privacy rights in cyberspace.\n  When I introduced ECPA with former Republican Senator Charles Mathias \nin 1986, I said that ``the privacy protections in ECPA are designed to \nprotect legitimate law enforcement needs while minimizing intrusions on \nthe privacy of system users as well as the business needs of electronic \ncommunications system providers.'' During the last three decades, ECPA \nhas become the premier law for protecting Americans from unauthorized \ngovernment intrusions into their private electronic communications.\n  When Congress enacted ECPA, email was a novelty and no one imagined \nhow prevalent it would become in our daily communication let alone how \nlong it might be stored. But after almost three decades, new \ntechnologies--such as the Internet, social networking sites and cloud \ncomputing--have changed how Americans use and store email. Storing \ndocuments and other information electronically has become much less \nexpensive and mobile technologies permit users to access stored \ndocuments wherever and whenever they choose. As a result, the digital \nprivacy protections put in place 27 years ago have not kept pace with \nnew technologies.\n  That is why Congress must revitalize the digital privacy protections \nthat were enacted in ECPA. That is also why I am working in a \nbipartisan manner to update this law to reflect the realities of our \ntime.\n  In April, the Judiciary Committee favorably reported bipartisan \nlegislation that I authored with Republican Senator Mike Lee to update \nECPA and to bring this law fully into the digital age. Our bipartisan \nbill updates ECPA to require that the government obtain a search \nwarrant--based upon probable cause--before obtaining the content of our \nemails and other electronic communications. The commonsense reforms in \nour bill carefully balance the interests and needs of consumers, the \nlaw enforcement community, and our Nation's thriving technology sector. \nThe bill enjoys the support of a diverse coalition of more than 100 \nprivacy, civil liberties, civil rights and technology organizations \nfrom across the political spectrum, including the American Civil \nLiberties Union, the Heritage Foundation, the Center for Democracy and \nTechnology and Americans for Tax Reform. The bill is also the product \nof careful consultation with many government and private sector \nstakeholders, including the Departments of Justice, Commerce and State, \nlocal law enforcement, and members of the technology and privacy \ncommunities. I remain disappointed that a single Republican Senator has \nobjected to the unanimous consent request to pass this bipartisan bill, \nwhich overwhelmingly passed the Judiciary Committee.\n  The privacy reforms in this bill are too important to delay. Like \nSenator Lee and me, all of the bill's supporters understand that \nprotecting our digital privacy rights is not a Democratic ideal, nor a \nRepublican ideal, but an American ideal that all of us should embrace. \nAs ECPA reaches another milestone, it is important to remember that \nAmericans continue to face threats to their digital privacy. I hope \nthat all Senators will join me in supporting the Electronic \nCommunications Privacy Act Amendments Act and that the Senate will pass \nthis bill without delay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/28/senate-section/article/S7570-3", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7570-S7571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO HEDY RATNER AND CAROL DOUGAL\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to thank two exceptional \nwomen who have been strong advocates for social justice and for the \nadvancement of women's business ownership in the State of Illinois, \nacross America, and beyond.\n  Hedy Ratner and Carol Dougal have recently stepped down after working \n27 years as the founders and co-presidents of the Women's Business \nDevelopment Center, WBDC. The WBDC is the first, and largest, nonprofit \norganization that provides services to encourage women's business \nownership across the United States.\n\n[[Page S7571]]\n\n  When the WBDC was founded in 1986, less than 10 percent of the \nbusinesses in the United States were owned and operated by women. \nToday, thanks in part to the leadership and encouragement provided by \nHedy and Carol, there are over 8.6 million women-owned businesses \nthroughout the country, generating over $1.3 trillion in revenues this \nyear and employing nearly 7.8 million people.\n  As a champion for women's economic development, the WBDC has worked \nto assist tens of thousands of women in entrepreneurial efforts \nnationwide. From business certifications to financial assistance \nworkshops, the WBDC provides women business owners with the training \nthey need to establish and expand their businesses. By providing women \nwith essential resources to become successful business owners, the WBDC \nhas empowered women and helped them achieve economic independence \nthrough entrepreneurship.\n  Since its founding in 1986, the WBDC has expanded in size and scope \nfrom a two-person operation seeking to address the lack of \nrepresentation of women in the business sector, to a staff of 24 full-\ntime employees and contractors that now influence policies on the \nfederal, State and local levels. The achievements of Hedy and Carol are \nsignificant, and the positive role of the WBDC in supporting women's \nentrepreneurship is evident.\n  On behalf of the people of Illinois, I thank Hedy and Carol for their \n27 dedicated years with the WBDC and congratulate them on their many \ncontributions for women in the business sector. I wish both of them the \nbest as they continue to inspire and provide leadership for women's \nentrepreneurship in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/28/senate-section/article/S7571-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       NATIONAL CENTER FOR BIOTECHNOLOGY INFORMATION ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the 25th anniversary \nof the National Center for Biotechnology Information--NCBI--part of the \nNational Library of Medicine at the National Institutes of Health, \nAmerica's world-renowned research institution in Bethesda, MD.\n  The late Senator Claude Pepper, for whom a major building on the NIH \ncampus is named, authored six separate laws creating individual \ninstitutes at NIH. In 1987, while a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives and chairman of the Select Committee on Aging's \nSubcommittee on Health and Long-Term Care, Pepper introduced H.R. 393, \nthe National Biotechnology Information Act, which established the NCBI. \nAt a March 1987 hearing on H.R. 393, Pepper explained that ``we are \ndealing with nothing less than the mystery of human life and the \nunfolding scroll of knowledge, seeking to penetrate that mystery, which \nis life itself.'' He noted that his bill was intended ``to facilitate \nthe development of advanced computer and communication systems that \nwill make it possible for the vast expanding knowledge of the gene to \nbe assimilated into a computer system and made available for \ndistribution to researchers and to people generally all over the \nWorld.''\n  Soon thereafter, Congress embraced the importance of the \nbiotechnology field, recognized the pressing need to harness the large \nvolume of data emanating from the genetic revolution in science, and \nendorsed the establishment of NCBI to manage this valuable resource for \nthe benefit of human health. With strong bipartisan support in \nCongress, Pepper's bill was enacted as part of Senator Ted Kennedy's \ncomprehensive measure, the Health Omnibus Extension Programs of 1988, \non November 4, 1988.\n  Today, biomedical research encompassing genomic and genetic knowledge \nis a major driver of medical progress. The foresight of Congress in \nestablishing the NCBI, combined with the innovative leadership of \nDirector Dr. David Lipman and the expertise of the agency's dedicated \nstaff, has led to the emergence of an impressive national resource for \nmolecular biology information. In June of this year, Dr. Lipman was \nhonored by the White House with the ``Open Science'' Champions of \nChange Award for his work at NCBI. By organizing and integrating \ngenomic data for developing diagnostic and clinical applications, the \nCenter serves as a bridge from research to the medical community. Each \nday, more than 3 million users access NCBI's 40 interlinked genomic and \nbibliographic databases and download more than 30 terabytes of data.\n  I am proud that Congress has continued to support funding for the \nNCBI over the past 25 years. Recently, by requiring that the results of \nNIH-funded research be made public through the Center's PubMed Central \nDatabase, Congress has opened to everyone the full text of published \njournal articles that are essential to advancing scientific research \nand public health.\n  The biomedical research funded by the NIH provides knowledge \nessential to combat debilitating diseases, and continuing this research \nis dependent on the resources and tools that NCBI has developed so \nsuccessfully for the benefit of the biomedical community. As NIH \nDirector Francis Collins has noted, we are entering an era of precision \nmedicine in which a patient's genetic makeup may determine the exact \ntreatment that is provided. Surely, the NCBI databases and tools will \nbe needed on the front lines of this new effort.\n  On the occasion of this 25th anniversary, I ask my colleagues to join \nme in congratulating Dr. Lipman and the outstanding staff of NCBI, who \nthrough their skill and vision have built this unique biomedical \nresource.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/28/senate-section/article/S7571-2", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7571-S7572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR.

In his time at the NAE, Dr. Vest worked \ntirelessly to identify and address the most pressing and important \nchallenges facing American engineering, including the declining \ninterest in math and science among our Nation's students and the \ngrowing challenges of information flow among government, the private \nsector, and academia. As NAE president, Dr. Vest was instrumental in \nurging Congress to pass the America COMPETES Act, which provided a \nblueprint for investing in critically important scientific and \ntechnological pursuits. Dr. Vest also helped craft the Grand Challenges \nfor Engineering, a global initiative that identifies the greatest \nchallenges and opportunities facing engineers today. In this \nincreasingly technology-based and globalized world, Dr. Vest recognized \nthe need for a clear and strong national vision for our engineers and \nscientists. He provided the dynamic leadership that the NAE required to \nallow American engineers to compete and thrive in a rapidly evolving \nworld.\n  A native of Morgantown, WV, Chuck displayed a clever and inquisitive \nmind from a young age. Growing up under the shadow of Sputnik, he \ndeveloped a keen interest in electronics and he would constantly tinker \nwith surplus World War II gadgets, such as microphones and resistors. \nThis curiosity led him to West Virginia University where he received a \ndegree in mechanical engineering. Chuck continued his education at the \nUniversity of Michigan, earning a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering; he \nremained there for 22 years as a professor, a dean, and university \nprovost.\n  Dr. Vest has since served as a director of DuPont and IBM. He has \nheld positions on an array of Federal committees and commissions, \nincluding the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology \nand as vice chair of the U.S. Council on Competitiveness. Chuck has \nauthored three books, received honorary doctoral degrees from 18 \nuniversities, and was awarded the 2006 National Medal of Technology and \nthe 2011 Vannevar Bush Award.\n  Quite possibly, Dr. Vest's most important achievements occurred \nduring his tenure as president of the Massachusetts Institute of \nTechnology, MIT. In his 14 years at the helm of MIT, Dr. Vest proved a \nworthy advocate of more robust communication and sharing within the \nscience community. Under his extraordinary leadership, MIT launched its \nOpenCourseWare initiative and cofounded the Alliance for Global \nSustainability. As he will readily attest, though, one of Dr. Vest's\n\n[[Page S7572]]\n\nproudest accomplishments at MIT was in improving the diversity of the \nuniversity's student body and faculty. Chuck worked tirelessly to \nensure that opportunities at MIT were available to anyone with the \nright mind and work ethic.\n  In all that he has done and stood for, Chuck has embodied what is \nbest about being a West Virginian and an American. Chuck's passion for \nhelping others--whether as a teacher, an engineer, or a leader--has \nimpacted countless lives and ensured his place among our country's most \nrespected and honored citizens. Dr. Charles M. Vest has long shone as \none of West Virginia's brightest stars, and today it gives me great \npleasure to commend him--and thank him--for his enormous contributions \nto the Nation's science, technology, engineering, and mathematics \nenterprise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/28/senate-section/article/S7572-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  GREENE COUNTY COURTHOUSE CENTENNIAL\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I rise today to honor an important \nhistorical date in Greene County, MO, my home county. October 26 was \nthe centennial of the historic Greene County Courthouse--the place \nwhere I worked for more than a decade as county clerk.\n  The current Greene County Courthouse is actually the third built in \nGreene County. The 20th century courthouse was intended to be a \nunifying structure for what had developed as two communities prior to \nthe Civil War. Both communities came under one municipal government in \n1887, and the new courthouse was to be a structure built between North \nSpringfield and the central business district. Work to find a site was \nbegun in 1904 and concluded with the purchase of a lot on Central \nAvenue in 1908.\n  Architect A.N. Torbitt, of Miller, Opel and Torbitt in Jefferson \nCity, MO, was chosen to draft plans for the new structure, and the \ncornerstone ceremony for the new courthouse was held on July 16, 1910. \nThe impressive new building, built of Greene County Phoenix stone, took \nnearly 2 years to complete. In March 1912, the courts moved into the \nnew building. Even Springfield's city hall took up residence there, \nwhere it remained for more than 25 years until its move into the post \noffice a block away.\n  The historic Greene County Courthouse was and remains important to \nthe economic growth, development and prosperity of Springfield and \nGreene County. Over the years, the courts expanded to an additional \njudicial center nearby, but the old courthouse remains the center of \nGreene County administrative duties. Today, it is occupied by the \nGreene County commissioner, clerk, recorder of deeds, treasurer, \nassessor and collector of revenues.\n  Today, the interior of the 100-year-old courthouse is in great shape, \nand plans are underway to raise funds to replace the parapet. Past \nelected officials have worked to improve the building's energy \nefficiency and maintain its appearance. As a former Greene County clerk \nand one who has a deep appreciation for the history of Greene County \nand this grand building, I want to express my pride in the services \nthat are provided in this structure and those county employees who work \nin it every day. My hope is that the historic Greene County Courthouse \nhas many years of service ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/28/senate-section/article/S7572-2", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    WILLIAMS-CONE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL\n\n Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am delighted to commend the \nWilliams-Cone Elementary School of Topsham, ME, on being named a 2013 \nNational Blue Ribbon School of Excellence. This year, Williams-Cone was \none of only 236 public schools across the country to receive this \nprestigious recognition of high accomplishment by the U.S. Department \nof Education.\n  Created in 1982, the Blue Ribbon Schools Program honors public and \nprivate schools that are either academically superior in their States \nor that demonstrate significant gains in student achievement. The \nschools singled out for this national recognition are models of high \neducational standards and accountability.\n  This award recognizes the remarkable improvements made in student \nachievement rates at Williams-Cone Elementary over the past several \nyears. During the 2007-2008 academic year, students achieved 66 percent \nproficiency in reading and math. Four years later, Williams-Cone's \napproximately 200 students scored 81 percent proficiency in reading and \n77 percent in math. These outstanding academic improvements can be \nattributed to the positive learning environment fostered at Williams-\nCone School, where students are encouraged to pursue their interests, \nteachers instruct in innovative ways, and teachers and administrators \nengage with families to create a strong school community.\n  I am pleased that the U.S. Department of Education has selected \nWilliams-Cone Elementary School for this well-deserved honor, and \ncongratulate not only the students, but also the administrators, \nteachers, staff, and parents on this outstanding achievement. Together, \nthey are making a difference in the lives of hundreds of students and \nhelping them become responsible learners and engaged citizens in their \ncommunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/28/senate-section/article/S7572-3", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING PETE CENARRUSA\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, my colleague Senator Risch joins me \ntoday in honoring the life of former Idaho Secretary of State Pete \nCenarrusa. The State of Idaho lost a dear friend with the passing of \nPete Cenarrusa.\n  Pete had a unique capacity to lead people and institutions with good \nwill, great humor and wise counsel. Pete was a personal friend and \nadviser to both of us, and we will forever remember the example he set \nfor all public servants.\n  Throughout his distinguished career, Pete was widely respected for \nhis integrity, fairness, determination and dependability. He dedicated \nmore than 50 years to public service, serving nearly 36 years as \nIdaho's Secretary of State and nine terms in the Idaho House of \nRepresentatives, three of which he served as Speaker of the House. In \naddition to his public service, Pete ran a successful sheep operation \nwith his wife of 66 years, Freda. He was also a private pilot for 59 \nyears and was a high school teacher in Cambridge, Carey and Glenns \nFerry, ID. Additionally, he served as a U.S. Marine Corps officer, \naviator and instructor, which included his service as a pilot in World \nWar II. Further, Pete was a strong advocate for the Basque community. \nPete and Freda founded the Cenarrusa Foundation for Basque Culture that \nhas provided resources for the promotion of the Basque culture.\n  Like the many people who greatly respected him, Pete's list of \nqualities and experiences is remarkably long. Pete lived life to the \nfullest. He developed skills in a variety of fields and utilized his \ntalents and principles for the betterment of Idaho. We are truly \nblessed to have known Pete and to have learned from his example of \ncommitted service, honesty and resolve. Pete's long and dedicated \nservice to the people of Idaho will last forever. He was a beloved \npublic servant, rancher, pilot, veteran, teacher, son, brother, \nhusband, father, uncle, grandfather, great-grandfather and friend. Our \nthoughts and prayers are with Freda, their family and all of Pete's \nfriends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/28/senate-section/article/S7572-4", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7572-S7573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO SANDRA MATHESON\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and \ncongratulate Director Sandra Matheson of the NH Attorney General's \nState Office of Victim/Witness Assistance, OVWA, for more than 30 years \nof dedicated service to the State of New Hampshire.\n  A former law enforcement officer and crisis center director, Ms. \nMatheson was on call to respond to homicides for over 12 years, where \nshe learned first hand about the unique needs of victims. She \ncoordinated New Hampshire's efforts to establish victim/witness \nservices in all 10 counties and to establish the New Hampshire Victim \nCompensation Program in 1989.\n  During her long career, Ms. Matheson was responsible for founding and \noverseeing the OVWA homicide victim unit, which provides 24-hour \nstatewide direct services in all of the State's homicide cases, from \ndeath notification throughout the judicial process. She has also \ndeveloped and presented numerous trainings on traumatic grief and loss, \nhomicide, and the extensive\n\n[[Page S7573]]\n\nimpact these crimes have on the families left behind. She developed and \npresented the State's first death notification training curriculum and \nshe is a regular instructor at the NH Police Standards and Training \nAcademy. She is on the faculty of the ME/NH Victim Assistance Academy, \nwhere she teaches the sessions on homicide and drunk driving, among \nothers.\n  Ms. Matheson was an instrumental part of numerous statewide \ninitiatives aimed at standardizing the systemic response to crime \nvictim issues, and has built a strong, effective, collaborative \nrelationship with numerous State and community partners. She was a \nfounder of the NH Domestic Violence, Child Fatality and Elder and \nIncapacitated Adult Fatality Review Committees, and served as chair of \nthe Attorney General's Task Force on Child Abuse and Neglect, the NH \nSexual Assault Nurse Examiner, SANE, Advisory Board, the Sexual Assault \nand Domestic Violence Protocol Projects, the Sexual Assault Domestic \nViolence Conference Committee, and is a partner of the New Hampshire \nAmeriCorps Victim Assistance Program. She has been a key player in \ngetting legislation passed to help victims of crime, including drafting \nthe NH Crime Victim Bill of Rights in 1991.\n  A recipient of numerous awards for her work with victims and \nfamilies, in April of 1994 Director Matheson received a National Victim \nServices Award from President Clinton and was honored at a Rose Garden \nceremony for ``outstanding service on behalf of victims of crime.'' \nMost recently in 2013, the National Association of Attorneys General \nselected Sandra for the ``President's Award'' for her extraordinary \nwork over the years.\n  On a personal note, as New Hampshire's Attorney General, I was \nhonored to work with Sandra. She is smart, passionate, and tireless in \nserving victims of crime and in making NH safer. She represents the \nvery best of what it means to be a public servant.\n  As Director Matheson celebrates her retirement, I commend her on a \njob well done, and ask my colleagues to join me in wishing her well in \nall future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/28/senate-section/article/S7573-1", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/28/senate-section/article/S7573-2", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/10/28/senate-section/article/S7573-3", "month": "10", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 3, 2013, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on October 17, 2013, during the \nadjournment of the Senate, received a message from the House of \nRepresentatives announcing that the House has agreed to the following \nconcurrent resolution, without amendment:\n\n       S.

A bill to amend the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \nAct to require transparency in the operation of American Health Benefit \nExchanges; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                           OBAMACARE EXCHANGE\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, before the Internet, RCA knew how many \nrecords Elvis sold every day. Before the Internet, Ford knew how many \ncars they were selling every day. Before the Internet, McDonald's could \ntell you how many hamburgers it was selling every day. Yet the Obama \nadministration cannot tell us how many Americans have tried to sign up \nfor ObamaCare. They can't tell us how many Americans did sign up for \nObamaCare. They can't tell us what level of insurance they bought, nor \ncan they tell us in what zip code they live.\n  They told us that 20 million Americans have visited the ObamaCare Web \nsite. They have the basic information to shop, but how many have tried \nto sign up? How many did sign up? Where do they live? What kind of \ninsurance did they buy? Not only have they not told us, they have done \ntheir best to keep us from finding out.\n  With WikiLeaks and Edward Snowden spilling our beans every day, what \nis happening on the ObamaCare exchanges is the biggest secret left in \nWashington, DC. The National Security Agency could learn lessons from \nSecretary Sebelius. We should not have to rely on anonymous sources to \nget basic information about what is happening with ObamaCare.\n  Therefore, I am introducing legislation today to require the \nadministration answer the following questions every week: How many \npeople tried to sign up? How many people did sign up? What level of \ninsurance did they buy? In what ZIP code do they live? What are they \ndoing to fix the problems? This is not complicated information.\n  In the Internet age, the administration ought to be able to provide \nthis information not every week but every day. In fact, they should be \nable to provide it every minute. We should not have to pass a law to \nfind these things out. I hope that every Senator will support this \nsimple request that this legislation makes. It is a six-page bill. I \nwill put it in the Congressional Record today, and everyone will have a \nchance to read it tomorrow. After everyone has had a chance to read it, \nI intend to ask unanimous consent to pass it.\n  This Congress--both sides of the aisle--is dedicated to transparency. \nThis administration has described itself as the most transparent \nadministration in American history. So why should we not unanimously \npass legislation to ask for the most basic information about what is \nhappening on the ObamaCare exchanges?\n  Health insurance companies say that in order to guarantee that \neveryone has a chance to sign up for insurance before January 1, which \nis when the law says they must, the application has to be in by \nDecember 15. That is not very far away.\n  The administration has been talking about giving a grace period of a \nfew weeks before the IRS will fine them for not having bought \ninsurance, as\n\n[[Page S7578]]\n\nObamaCare says most Americans must buy health insurance. Still, if the \nWeb site is not fixed, millions of Americans will be required to sign \nup for health insurance on a Web site that does not work. As a \nconsequence of not being able to sign up for health care, they will be \nfined by the Internal Revenue Service.\n  There is a much bigger problem than the fine, and that is millions of \nAmericans may be without any health insurance at all after January 1 \nbecause their insurance is being canceled because of ObamaCare. \nRemember when President Obama said: If you like your insurance, you can \nkeep it? Well, like a lot of things that have been said about \nObamaCare, that is turning out not to be the case.\n  Our staff has counted the announcements by health insurance companies \nthat are ceasing to offer policies on January 1 because they don't \nqualify under the ObamaCare law. For example, in Tennessee, the State \nprovides 16,000 Tennesseans who have trouble getting insurance with a \nplan called CoverTN. Because it doesn't meet the exact requirements of \nObamaCare, the State is having to cancel that insurance on January 1, \nand those 16,000 Tennesseans won't have health insurance.\n  Other Americans--for example, Tennesseans I have talked to--have what \nwe call catastrophic insurance. They have insurance that provides for a \ncatastrophe. That kind of insurance is often not available under \nObamaCare. It is not allowed by ObamaCare for most people. An insurance \ncompany that offers these policies will not be offering them after \nJanuary 1, and as a result, millions of Americans will not be able to \nbuy the insurance they now have.\n  If individuals can't or won't sign up, that will mean that after \nJanuary 1, many of the sickest people will go into the exchanges. The \nresult will be that the price of insurance--for everyone who has \ninsurance--will go through the roof. We are already seeing that in the \ninsurance markets today.\n  The bottom line: If the Web site is not fixed, millions of Americans \nwill not only be fined by the IRS for not buying insurance on a Web \nsite that doesn't work, more importantly, they will be without health \ncare insurance on January 1, insurance that many of them have today.\n  The President has said over the last few days that the Web site will \nbe ready by November 30. You are supposed to have your application in \nby December 15 and have the insurance bought by January 1, which only \ngives 2 weeks for millions of Americans to make their way through this \nmaze. We tried to obtain this simple information that I have asked for, \nyet repeatedly, the requests which I have directed to Secretary \nSebelius have come back with no answer at all--no answers, nothing.\n  Outside analysts tell us that only \\1/2\\ of 1 percent of the people \nwho logged on to the ObamaCare Web site in the first week were able to \nenroll, but we really don't know.\n  Two weeks ago I sent a letter with House Oversight Chairman Darrell \nIssa to Secretary Sebelius, asking for the information she and the \nPresident are not giving us Such as how many people have enrolled \nsuccessfully in the exchanges, what the technical problems are, how \nmuch it already costs, and how much it will cost to address these \nproblems. The deadline for a response to our request has passed. \nChairman Issa has said--and I joined him in the letter--that he may \nconsider a subpoena to get that information. The American people \ndeserve an answer to these questions.\n\n  Often when the debate comes up, someone will say, Well, the \nRepublicans don't have any proposals of their own. I have often made \nthose proposals. I remember on this floor of the Senate many times \nproposing steps we should take to change our health care system so more \npeople could afford insurance. We went back and counted the number of \ntimes when, during the health care debate, various Republicans talked \nabout our step-by-step proposals for what we should do about health \ncare, and there were 173 mentions of our step-by-step proposals.\n  The basic problem with what happened with the new health care law was \nthat we--the Democratic Congress did, I didn't; I didn't vote for it--\nexpanded a health care delivery system that already costs too much. \nThat was the wrong thing to do. That was an historic mistake. What we \nshould have done is to make changes, step by step, in the health care \ndelivery system that would reduce the cost of health care for the \nlargest number of Americans so more people could have afforded it. \nThose were the steps we should have taken. We can still do that. Our \nhealth care delivery system is nearly 20 percent of our economy.\n  ObamaCare is not our health care delivery system. Rather, ObamaCare \nincludes some additions to our health care delivery system. ObamaCare \nis an expansion of a health care delivery system that already costs too \nmuch. The law is making some changes such as the ones I described \nearlier in my remarks. Those changes have been described as a train \nwreck, but we can turn the train around and head it in another \ndirection--a direction of more competition, more choices, and lower \ncosts for Americans buying health insurance.\n  How can we do that? That is a subject for a long discussion, but here \nare a few of the ideas: Make Medicare solvent. The trustees have said \nthat in 10 years there won't be enough money to pay hospital bills. We \nhave a duty to make Medicare solvent.\n  Reform Medicare Advantage to increase more choices and put it on a \nmore level playing field with Traditional Medicare. That will provide \nseniors more options and it should save some money.\n  Make Medicaid more flexible. I was Governor. I said on the floor that \nevery Senator who voted for ObamaCare ought to be sentenced to go home \nand serve as Governor and try to implement the law. During my time as \nGovernor, Medicaid was 8 percent of the State budget. I see it has \ngrown to 26 percent today in Tennessee, soaking up money that otherwise \nwould go for higher education or for other needed parts of State \ngovernment.\n  We should encourage workplace wellness. We had a lot of debate about \nthat during the ObamaCare debate and we have ended up with a regulation \nthat is too restrictive. We can change that.\n  We can allow small businesses to pool their resources and offer a \nlarger number of plans to a larger number of Americans at prices they \ncan afford. We can allow Americans to purchase insurance across State \nlines. That would reduce the cost of health care, which should be our \nmajor goal.\n  We could expand health care savings accounts.\n  There is bipartisan legislation before the Senate that would define \nfull-time employment for purposes of the health care law--this one or \nany one in the future--as 40 hours instead of 30 hours. That would be a \ngreat help to American business and an even bigger help to the \nemployees who are being forced to go from 40 hours to 30 hours--\nemployees who most need that income, and who, by going to 30 hours, \nwill have to go to a second part-time job, and in many cases, in doing \nso, lose whatever health care benefits that might be available to them. \nI don't know where the 30 hours came from. That sounds as though it was \nmade in France. A made-in-America part-time job ought to be up to 40 \nhours.\n  Those are just a few of the steps we could take to turn the train \naround and avoid the wreck and move us in the right direction. We will \nbe making those arguments over time. But for now, we need information \nabout what is happening on the ObamaCare exchanges.\n  I intend to ask unanimous consent tomorrow to pass a simple, six-page \nbill. It is legislation which requires the administration to give us \nweekly reports about how many have tried to enroll, how many have \nsucceeded, what ZIP Code they live in, and what level of insurance they \nhave purchased. Congress needs to know that, if millions of Americans \nare going to lose insurance on January 1, before they have a way to buy \nit through a Web site that doesn't work. States need to know it \nbecause, as time goes on, these decisions are going to have an effect \non the Medicaid Programs that States are a partner in and are \noperating. Americans need to know it because, in many cases--we have \ncounted at least 1.5 million cases and we expect millions more policies \nthat were available to Americans when the law passed will not be \navailable after January 1. So these\n\n[[Page S7579]]\n\nAmericans--and this includes people working in the Congress and people \nwho are in the Congress--these Americans are going to have to make \ndecisions before January 1 about what insurance they will have, because \nthe insurance they now have isn't going to be available under the new \nhealth care law.\n  This is a six-page bill, and a pretty simple idea. If RCA knew how \nmany records Elvis was selling every day, if Ford knew before the \nInternet age how many cars Ford was selling every day, if McDonald's \nbefore the Internet age knew how many hamburgers it was selling every \nday, surely the Obama administration can tell us every week how many \nare enrolling on ObamaCare's Web site, how many are successfully \ngetting their insurance, where they live, and what kind of insurance \nthey buy. The stakes are much higher than Elvis's records, than Ford's \ncars, and than McDonald's hamburgers. These are the stakes of health \ninsurance that involve the lives of millions of Americans, and I hope \nmy colleagues will join me tomorrow when I ask unanimous consent to \napprove legislation that will require these weekly reports.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HAGAN:\n  S. 1591. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nthe work opportunity credit to small businesses which hire individuals \nwho are members of the Ready Reserve or National Guard, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. HAGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to highlight the importance of \nveteran unemployment and to announce the reintroduction of the ``Hire-\na-Hero Act''--a bill, which I introduced with Senator Scott Brown of \nMassachusetts at the start of the last Congress, to make permanent the \nWork Opportunity Tax Credit, WOTC, for qualified veterans and members \nof the Ready Reserve and the National Guard.\n  The issue of veteran unemployment is more important today, than it \nhas ever been.\n  Though the overall unemployment rate stands at 7.2 percent, the \njobless rate among veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan is 10.1 \npercent, nearly 3 percentage points higher than the national average. \nOverall, 708,000 veterans are without a job.\n  This issue is even more important in North Carolina, because of its \nlarge active duty and veteran population. More than \\1/3\\ of our \npopulation is either in the military, is a veteran, or has an immediate \nfamily member who is in the military or a veteran. In addition, North \nCarolina has 3 percent of the U.S. population, but 5 percent of the \nunemployed veterans.\n  Employers know that hiring a veteran is not only the right thing to \ndo, but it also makes good business sense. These men and women are \nhighly motivated, highly-trained, and have succeeded in the most trying \ncircumstances imaginable.\n  I know the value of hiring veterans myself. I have three veterans and \na member of the National Guard currently on my staff who bring unique \nperspectives to their roles that they acquired during their time in \nuniform. And it allows them to provide the best possible service to the \npeople of North Carolina.\n  Unfortunately, the expiration of the WOTC for veterans at the end of \nthis year could make it more difficult for employers to hire veterans.\n  The WOTC has been in place for many years. The credit for veterans \nhas been subject to periodic short-term extensions. Recognizing the \nserious unemployment challenges facing veterans in North Carolina and \nthe need for incentives to hire veterans, I introduced the ``Hire-a-\nHero Act of 2011'' in February of 2011 to make this important tax \ncredit permanent.\n  While that bill, did not become law, Congress was able to enact the \nVow to Hire Heros Act of 2011 on November 21, 2011. This legislation \nexpanded the WOTC for returning heroes and wounded warriors, by \nallowing larger tax credits for certain groups and extended the credit \nthrough 2012. Recognizing that this credit was set to expire, on \nJanuary 2, 2013, Congress extended the credit to December 31, 2013, as \na part of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.\n  This crucial tax credit is set to expire again in just two months. \nThat is why I am re-introducing the Hire-a-Hero Act with the support of \nthe American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Military \nOfficers Association of America, the National Guard Association of the \nUnited States and the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. This \nbill would finally, make the WOTC permanent for veterans and members of \nthe Ready Reserve and National Guard.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider cosponsoring this important \nlegislation that will help address the unemployment issue among \nveterans in this country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Begich, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Durbin, \n        and Mr. Tester):\n  S. 1593. A bill to amend the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to \nenhance the protections accorded to servicemembers and their spouses \nwith respect to mortgages, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce the Servicemember Housing \nProtection Act along with my colleagues Senators Begich, Whitehouse, \nDurbin, and Tester. Our country has a strong tradition of ensuring that \nour service members are protected while they serve to keep our nation \nsafe. Building on such laws and efforts, in 1940, as World War II \nescalated across the globe, Congress enacted the Soldiers' and Sailors' \nCivil Relief Act ``to protect those who have been obliged to drop their \nown affairs to take up the burdens of the nation.'' In 2003, Congress \npassed a new version of this law to reflect the new challenges of post-\n9/11 service and renamed it the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, SCRA. \nSince that time, Congress has further amended this law, most recently \nin August 2012, in order to address the country's high foreclosure \nrates and their impact on service members.\n  Additionally, in 2010, when it became evident that military families \nneeded an entity to serve as a watchdog, provide education, and help \nmonitor and respond to concerns, questions, and complaints about \nconsumer financial products and services, I led the bipartisan effort \nduring the Dodd-Frank Act debate to create a new Office of \nServicemember Affairs within the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, \nCFPB.\n  The Servicemember Housing Protection Act continues in this vein, and \nseeks to address one such ongoing challenge--helping service members \nwith their housing needs so they can maintain a focus on the difficult \ntask of protecting our country.\n  First, this bill would make it easier for service members to claim \ndeployment-related financial and credit protections by expanding what \ncould be submitted to constitute ``military orders.'' Currently, \ncreditors require a copy of military orders in order to trigger SCRA \nprotections. However, these orders are often not cut until just before \ndeployment or once the service member is already deployed, placing a \nburden on some military families as they try to work with banks to \nsecure SCRA protections. Broadening the scope of what could be \nsubmitted to trigger protections before orders have been received would \nfurther ensure that service members have more time to prepare for \ndeployment and promptly receive SCRA protections, including the \ninterest rate limitation of six percent on qualifying mortgages.\n  Second, this bill would extend foreclosure protections to surviving \nspouses. Currently, service members have a 1-year window of foreclosure \nprotection following service, to provide time to reacclimate to \ncivilian life and get their personal affairs back in order. Our bill \nextends this one-year window of foreclosure protection to a surviving \nspouse who is the successor in interest to the home. After suffering \nsuch an unspeakable loss, a military spouse should not have the \nadditional burden of dealing with immediate foreclosure.\n  Lastly, this bill would help facilitate the transition from off-base \nto on-base housing. Due to the shortage of on-base military housing, \nmany service members temporarily find off-base housing until on-base \nhousing becomes available. When a service member on a waiting list is \ngiven the chance to move into on-base housing, he or she is sometimes \nunable to terminate his or her off-base housing lease. Including an\n\n[[Page S7580]]\n\norder or opportunity to move from off-base to on-base housing as \nadditional grounds for lease termination would allow service members \nand their families the chance to move into the military housing \ncommunity. Several States, including Florida, Georgia, and Virginia, \nhave similar laws, and we should extend this opportunity to service \nmembers serving at any of our military bases.\n  While the men and women of our Armed Forces are protecting our Nation \noverseas, we should do everything possible to protect their families \nand homes. I urge my colleagues to join Senators Begich, Whitehouse, \nDurbin, Tester and me, as well as the Military Officers Association of \nAmerica and the Veterans of Foreign Wars, in supporting this bill, and \ntaking these next steps to add protections for our military families.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL:\n  S.J.
