Mr. President, today it is my pleasure to welcome the next \nSenator from Montana, Lt. Gov. John Walsh. Governor Walsh will be sworn \nin prior to the weekly caucus meetings.\n  I am really happy with this man coming here. My friend the assistant \nleader has heard me say this before, but I think it is worth repeating. \nWhen I served in the House of Representatives, I served on the Foreign \nAffairs Committee, and Henry Kissinger appeared before the subcommittee \nchaired by Congressman Solarz from New York. The Congressman said to \nHenry Kissinger: ``I am really at a loss as to what to call you. \nDoctor?'' He was a Ph.D. ``Mr. Ambassador?'' He had been an ambassador. \n``Mr. Secretary?'' He went through some other titles he previously had. \nFinally, Kissinger interrupted him and said: ``Your Excellency'' would \nbe just fine.\n  We now have the same problem. John Walsh has been a general. He has \nbeen Lieutenant Governor, and it is protocol when one is Lieutenant \nGovernor to be referred to as ``Governor.'' So he has a number of \ndifferent titles, but soon he will be Senator.\n  I have talked to him on many different occasions. He is a fine man. I \nam confident he will find his time here among the most rewarding \nexperiences of his distinguished career. And he is distinguished. He \nspent his entire adult life serving the people of Montana and our \nNation.\n  Lieutenant Governor Walsh served in the Montana National Guard for \nmore than three decades. After enlisting as a private, he rose through \nthe ranks to lead the Montana National Guard as Adjutant General. He \nled 2,000 guardsmen in response to the devastating wildfires in 2000. \nGeneral Walsh also led 700 soldiers of the Montana National Guard's 1st \nBattalion, 163rd Infantry Regiment in combat in Iraq. And combat it \nwas. It was some of the most difficult fighting that took place in the \nentire war. It was the largest mobilization of guardsmen in Montana \nsince World War II. The battalion was awarded the Valorous Unit \nCitation, and General Walsh received a Bronze Star for his exemplary \nservice.\n  In 2008 Lieutenant Governor Walsh was appointed Adjutant General for \nthe Montana National Guard. He led the State's guardsmen until 2012, \nwhen he retired to continue his public service in a new capacity as \nLieutenant Governor of the State of Montana. Both as Adjutant General \nand as Lieutenant Governor, he has fought for access to education for \nveterans and for every Montana child. The Walsh family places great \nvalue on the power of education. Lieutenant Governor Walsh was the \nfirst member of his family to graduate from college. His wife of 29 \nyears, Janet, has taught in the public schools in Montana for many \nyears. In fact, John and Janet met while they were\n\n[[Page S860]]\n\nboth attending Carroll College in Helena, MT. They have two children \nand one grandchild, all of whom they are very proud. John Walsh \nreceived his master's degree at the U.S. Army War College in 2007.\n  John Walsh possesses a true independent Western spirit and a \ncommendable dedication to the people of Montana. I have no doubt he \nwill continue to serve his State and the Nation with distinction as a \nU.S. Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/11/senate-section/article/S860-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESTORING EARNED PENSIONS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in addition to the swearing-in of Lieutenant \nGovernor Walsh, I expect that this afternoon the Senate will adopt the \nmotion to proceed to legislation to restore the earned pensions of \nmilitary retirees. This measure restores cost-of-living adjustments for \nmilitary retirees. Although no veterans will be affected until the end \nof next year, there is no reason to delay a solution. I will continue \nto work with my Republican colleagues to process what we need to do to \npass this important measure.

Mr. President, I was surprised this morning to hear \nRepublicans literally howling over President Obama's decision to ease \nthe transition for medium-sized businesses to providing health \ninsurance for all of their employees. Republicans have complained that \nhealth care reform is a burden to employers, but now they are \ncomplaining that President Obama is trying to ease that burden and \nsmooth the transition to a new system. Think about that one.\n  But this Republican duplicity should come as no surprise. After all, \nRepublicans are the ones who invented the individual mandate. It was \ntheir idea. It is a conservative idea that every American has a \nresponsibility to seek insurance to cover their health care needs, and \nthe government has a responsibility to make that coverage accessible \nand affordable. But now Republicans are attacking their own brain \nchild--the individual mandate. The individual mandate was their idea, \nand Republicans are willfully ignoring the fact that the Affordable \nCare Act creates a transition period for individuals to obtain \ninsurance as well.\n  It is time for Republicans to stop talking out of both sides of their \nmouths. If they have legitimate concerns about the Affordable Care Act, \nor ObamaCare, and not just political gripes, they should work with the \nPresident and the Democrats in Congress to fix and improve the law; \notherwise, they should stop complaining and get out of the way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/11/senate-section/article/S860-3", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the two parties have engaged in a lot \nof big debates over the past several years, and no one, obviously, \nshould be surprised by that. The President came into office vowing to \nfundamentally transform the country, and a lot of us have had big \nproblems with the policies he has tried to implement in pursuit of that \ngoal. But there are some things we should all agree on, and one of them \nis this: No President--no President of either party--should use the \npower of the Federal Government to punish his ideological opponents. \nThat is why, when the targeting of conservative groups by the IRS came \nto light after the last Presidential election, just about everybody \ndenounced the Nixonian tactics up and down and loudly declared that it \nshould never be allowed to happen again. They knew that this kind of \ntargeting represented a direct attack on our most fundamental \nfreedoms--on our abilities to organize and educate and engage in the \ndemocratic process. And while the abuse may have been aimed at \nconservatives this time, it is easy to see how it could one day be used \nagainst organizations of any ideological hue.\n  So America's culture of civic engagement simply has to be defended--\nby all of us. Yet, with the passage of time, that is not what we have \nseen. Instead of putting safeguards in place to protect our civil \nliberties, the Obama administration is now dragging the IRS back in the \nopposite direction. It is now pushing a regulation that would actually \nentrench and encourage the harassment of groups who dare to speak up \nand engage in the conversation. It is trying to intimidate into silence \nthose who send donations to civic groups too.\n  Predictably, the Obama administration has tried to spin these \nregulations as some sort of ``good government'' measure, as reforms \ninitiated in response to the IRS scandal, but, of course, we know that \nis simply not true. In recent days we learned that these regulations--\nregulations designed to suppress free speech--have been in the works \nfor years.\n  So let's be clear. All of this is simply unacceptable. After \ndenouncing the abuse last year, I believe it is shortsighted of our \nfriends on the other side not to oppose these rules forcefully today. \nThe path this administration is embarking on is a dangerous one with \nthe slipperiest of slopes. Left-leaning civic groups should be just as \nalarmed about what these regulations could mean for them in the future \nas what the rules almost certainly will mean for conservative groups \ntoday. That is why some, such as the ACLU, have begun to speak out \nagainst these regulations.\n  Last week I joined several of my colleagues in sending a letter to \nthe new Commissioner for the IRS that laid out these concerns. We \nreminded Commissioner Koskinen that he was confirmed with a mandate to \nreform the IRS and return the agency to its actual mission--processing \ntax returns, not suppressing speech. We expect him to fulfill that \nmandate--to prove his reformist credentials--by halting the regulations \nimmediately and to enact new rules that would stop similar harassment \nfrom occurring in the future. This is something the Commissioner can \nand must do now. He needs to realize this isn't some issue to move past \nbut a serious threat to be confronted.\n  Commissioner Koskinen could go down in history as a hero, as did the \nIRS Commissioner who stood up to Nixon and said no to harassment of \npolitical opponents. I want to believe that this is the choice he will \nmake, that he wants to be remembered as a strong and independent public \nservant rather than some political pawn. But we can't be sure what he \nwill do, and the American people need a backup plan in case he decides \nhis fealty lies with the opponents of free speech rather than with \nthem.\n  That is why today I, along with Senators Flake, Roberts, Hatch, and \nothers, have introduced legislation that would prevent the IRS from \nenacting regulations that would permit the suppression of First \nAmendment rights. It aims to return the agency to its mission and get \nit out of the speech police business altogether--a goal that should be \na bipartisan one.\n  This is something worth fighting for. It is something I hope \nCommissioner Koskinen will work with us to achieve. But if he does \nnot--if he does not--he should know we are prepared to go to the mat to \ndefend the First Amendment rights of our constituents and our \nneighbors--and that we will continue to do so until those rights are \nsafe once again.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/11/senate-section/article/S860-5", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Illinois.\n\n[[Page S861]]\n\n                            Ayotte Amendment\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Presiding Officer is new to the \nSenate, and we are glad to have him. He will find in the course of his \nsenatorial experience that occasionally good legislative ideas come \nfrom unexpected places. Occasionally they come from phone calls to your \noffice, emails, and letters, where people tell their stories, and from \nthose stories you see the need for a new law, a change in policy.\n  That happened to me 13 years ago. A Korean-American mother called my \noffice in Chicago with a problem. Her problem was that her daughter \nTereza was about to graduate from high school and had an opportunity to \ngo, on scholarship, to the Manhattan Conservatory of Music in New York.\n  This was a poor family. Mom worked at a dry cleaners. They barely got \nby. But her daughter had an extraordinary musical talent. She was an \naccomplished pianist, even as a senior in high school, and this was her \nchance.\n  As her daughter started to fill out the application form for the \nManhattan Conservatory of Music, there was a box that asked her to \nidentify her nationality, her citizenship. She turned to her mom and \nsaid: What should I put here? Her mother said: I'm not sure.\n  You see, Tereza Lee was brought to the United States at the age of 2 \non a visitor's visa. When the visa expired, her mom, her dad, and she \nstayed in the United States and did nothing else. Technically Tereza, \nhaving lived about 16 years in this country, was just another \nundocumented kid.\n  So they called my office and said: What do we do about this? Well, we \nchecked the law. The law is very clear. Tereza and those just like her \nwere to be deported from the United States for a minimum of 10 years \nand then be allowed to petition to come back in.\n  That seemed to me fundamentally unfair. So I wrote a change for the \nlaw called the DREAM Act. The DREAM Act said if you are a child under \nthe age of 16 brought to this country by parents, if you will finish \nhigh school, have no serious criminal record, and you are prepared to \ngo to college or enlist in the military, we will put you on a path to \ncitizenship.\n  I introduced that 13 years ago. As you can see, the wheels of justice \ngrind exceedingly slow in the U.S. Senate. But over the years, this \nidea of the DREAM Act has really caught hold. The reason is not because \nof me; it is because of the DREAMers. Initially, they were frightened, \nafraid of deportation, raised as children in families where they were \nwarned every day: Be careful. Do not get in a position where you are \ngoing to get arrested. You will get deported, and the whole family \nmight get deported. We don't want to break up our family, so be \ncareful. So they held back in the shadows, wondering, worrying about a \nknock on the door.\n  Over time, though, something happened, and I cannot explain it. The \nsame kids who used to stand outside my meetings, after I would talk \nabout the DREAM Act in Chicago--waiting in the darkness, in the \nshadows, to tell me, in a whisper, they were DREAMers--decided to step \nup and speak to the United States, to identify themselves. It was an \nact of courage. Some people say: Well, they were kids, and kids do rash \nthings. I think it was more courageous than rash.\n  I came to the floor on more than 50 different occasions to tell the \nstory of the DREAMers: who they are, what they have done, what they \nhope to do--amazing stories, incredible stories, of young people across \nAmerica just asking for a chance to be legalized, to be part of \nAmerica's future. They felt they were Americans start to finish.\n  The Presiding Officer's colleague, Senator Bob Menendez, used to talk \nabout Hispanics, who are the largest group of DREAMers, standing in \nthose classrooms, hand over their heart, pledging allegiance to the \nonly flag they have ever known, who faced the cruel reality that they \nwere not going to be American citizens unless we changed the law.\n  Here is the good news. Over time--a long time; 13 years--the \nsentiment not just of the American people but of Members of Congress \nstarted to change. It changed for the better. The House of \nRepresentatives enacted the DREAM Act. Even the Senate, in the \ncomprehensive immigration reform bill this last year, enacted the \nstrongest DREAM Act ever written.\n  In fact, just last week, when Speaker Boehner, in the midst of his \nexamination, if you will, of the immigration issue, issued a statement \nof principles, smack-dab in the middle of it, in clear language, was an \nendorsement of the DREAM Act. So although the Speaker may have some \nmisgivings--and I am sorry to say I disagree with him--but may have \nsome misgivings about comprehensive immigration reform, he acknowledged \nthat on a bipartisan basis the DREAM Act was something that both \nparties should embrace.\n  I still believe in comprehensive immigration reform. The DREAMers \nwill be the first to say: Don't forget my mom and dad when you are \ntalking about immigration reform. But the reason I give this preface to \nmy remarks is to put in perspective an amendment which will be on the \nfloor of the Senate this week offered by Senator Kelly Ayotte of New \nHampshire. It is an amendment which addresses a provision of the Tax \nCode.\n  Here is what our laws currently say when it comes to taxes and \nfamilies working in America. If you are undocumented, you are not \nlegally allowed to work in America. That is what the law says. But if \nyou do work in America, even undocumented, you have a legal obligation \nto pay your taxes. So how would an undocumented worker pay their taxes? \nWell, they would have an ITIN, they call it, a basic identification \nnumber that they can use to file their tax returns; and so many do.\n  Undocumented workers here in the United States pay their income \ntaxes, as required by law. One of the provisions in our Tax Code--for \nevery taxpayer--says if you are in certain income categories, you are \nallowed to claim a credit for your children. It helps 38 million \nAmerican families who take this credit on their tax returns because \nthey are working families and have children and the Tax Code said: We \nwill help you raise your children.\n\n  On its face, it is worth about $1,000 a year in reduced taxes. But \nthere are limitations. If your income reaches certain levels, you do \nnot qualify for this tax credit.\n  Now comes Senator Ayotte who makes a proposal that we basically \nchange this child tax credit as it applies to the tax-paying \nundocumented workers--that we say to them their children can only be \nclaimed for this child tax credit if the children can produce a Social \nSecurity number. Therein lies the problem, because many of these \nchildren, although they are legally claimed today, do not have a Social \nSecurity number.\n  Let's talk about DREAMers, because that is a group affected most \ndirectly by the Ayotte amendment. DREAMers--those who would qualify if \nthe DREAM Act becomes law--have been given a special status because of \nPresident Obama. He created a deferred deportation, deferred action \nprogram so that DREAMers could step up, identify themselves to the \ngovernment, register, be given a work permit, and be allowed to apply \nfor a Social Security number--DACA it is called.\n  We estimate there are about 2.1 million eligible DREAMers in America \nfor the law that I want to change. So far, a half a million of them \nhave applied for DACA and therefore can obtain Social Security numbers. \nThat leaves 1.6 million DREAMers who cannot, under the Ayotte \namendment, be counted as children under the child tax credit.\n  So ultimately what Senator Ayotte is doing is to deny those who are \nworking in America and paying their income taxes that provision of the \nTax Code which says: You get a special consideration for your children. \nI think that is just plain wrong.\n  Listen to these numbers: The child tax credit--a refundable credit \nfor working families--of $1,000 for each child under the age of 17 is \nlimited, as I mentioned earlier. The most anyone can claim for the tax \ncredit is 15 percent of family income minus $3,000, regardless of the \nnumber of children. For example, a minimum-wage worker earning $14,500 \nwith two or more children would receive at most $1,725 as a tax credit \nor refundable tax credit. The credit is only available for taxpayers \nwho are working, earning income, and raising children.\n  The Ayotte amendment, though, has to be put in this perspective. \nNearly 38 million families are expected to benefit from this child tax \ncredit this year--I should say this year, filing for last\n\n[[Page S862]]\n\nyear's income. Sixty percent of those who claim this tax credit earn \nless than $25,000 a year. Nearly half of the workers, members of \nfamilies working in America claiming the child tax credit, earn $10 an \nhour or less, and 90 percent of those who would be hurt by the Ayotte \namendment are Hispanic.\n  The tax credit is legally available for qualified taxpayers who have \nchildren with ITINs--these are individual tax identification numbers--\nand not everyone who uses an ITIN is undocumented. This amendment, the \nAyotte amendment, would also affect lawfully present children who use \nITINs, including victims of human trafficking, DREAMers, as I \nmentioned, under DACA, Cuban and Haitian entrants, and those with a \npending application for asylum.\n  The child tax credit, we estimate, lifts about 3 million people, \nincluding 1.5 million children, out of poverty every year. It is an \nincentive for these low-income families who are working and paying \ntaxes but not earning enough to take care of their kids. The Ayotte \namendment would eliminate the use of a tax credit for 1 million \nchildren, pushing many low- and moderate-income families with children \ndeeper into poverty.\n  What Senator Ayotte is trying to do is to use the proceeds from this \namendment she is offering to pay for the cost-of-living adjustment \nunder the military pensions. Those veterans have already paid for their \npensions. They paid by volunteering to serve this country and risk \ntheir lives. Some of them have come home with visible and invisible \nwounds of war that will be with them for a lifetime.\n  I do not believe we should come up with a pay-for for something these \nveterans have already paid for, No. 1. And, No. 2, I think it is unfair \nfor us to impoverish more children in America as a means of helping our \nveterans. What a cruel choice to put before the U.S. Senate.\n  Do not take my word for it. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the statement I am about to refer to be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From the NETWORK, Feb. 10, 2014]\n\n              Immigrant Families Should Not Pay the Price\n\n                          (By Simone Campbell)\n\n       For a while now, kids--particularly those in immigrant \n     families--have been unfairly under attack in the Senate, and \n     the only plausible explanation is unconscionable: to score \n     political points.\n       Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., recently proposed variations of \n     a plan to strip away the refundable Child Tax Credit that now \n     goes to millions of children of taxpaying immigrant workers \n     in low-wage jobs.\n       Ayotte alleges that immigrants are fleecing taxpayers by \n     claiming children who do not live in the country or do not \n     really exist. At one point, the senator said she wanted money \n     gained by denying the tax credit to pay for extension of \n     emergency unemployment insurance benefits. Then she switched \n     her focus to helping restore earlier cuts to veterans' \n     pension benefits. In fact, there are much fairer sources of \n     funding for these goals. For example, New Hampshire's other \n     senator, Jeanne Shaheen, said veterans' benefits could be \n     paid for by closing offshore tax loopholes.\n       In the end, it doesn't really matter where the money would \n     go since taking money away from children of low-wage, tax-\n     paying families is indefensible. Ayotte's proposal is \n     misguided and antithetical to the Gospel call to care for \n     children and those at the margins of society. It violates our \n     long-held values as a nation, and it should be rejected.\n       To set the record straight, children targeted by her plan \n     do exist and they do live in the U.S. Four million of them \n     are U.S. citizens and others are ``little DREAMers,'' young \n     children brought to this country by their families. Under \n     existing tax laws, their families may apply for the child tax \n     credit if they qualify financially. If fraud is suspected, \n     the solution is not to deny all eligible children access to \n     this critical antipoverty program. That is cruel and \n     ineffective.\n       The Child Tax Credit is a proven success in addressing \n     poverty. Senators concerned about child poverty agree that \n     funding for other programs can be found without targeting \n     needy children.\n       Ayotte says she understands families' needs, yet wants to \n     deny a child tax credit to taxpaying immigrant families. \n     Actions speak louder than words, and her proposal hurts \n     families.\n       Our political leaders should never place poor children in a \n     position of competing with other vulnerable populations for \n     funds that help pay for food and other basic needs.\n       Deliberately harming immigrant families goes against the \n     fundamental goodwill of Americans, including thousands of \n     people we met last year as our ``Nuns on the Bus'' traveled \n     6,500 miles across the U.S. to speak out for justice. \n     Throughout our journey, we stood with, prayed with, and heard \n     the stories of hundreds of immigrants who have long served \n     the needs of our nation.\n       Responsible leaders in Congress should look into their \n     hearts and reject proposals like this one pushed by Ayotte. \n     This political tactic is not good for our economy or the \n     wellbeing of our entire nation--especially children who are \n     the future of our country. We are better than this.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Sister Simone Campbell is somebody whom I greatly \nrespect. Sister Simone Campbell is executive director of NETWORK, a \nnational Catholic social justice lobby. She is also one of the \norganizers of Nuns on the Bus, Catholic nuns who have traveled all over \nthe United States speaking out on issues of social justice.\n  She has sent us a statement opposing the Ayotte amendment. It is a \nlengthy statement. I will not read it all, but I do want to read \nseveral parts that I think are important. Sister Simone Campbell says:\n\n       To set the record straight, children targeted by [the \n     Ayotte amendment] do exist and they do live in the U.S. Four \n     million of them are U.S. citizens and others are ``little \n     DREAMers,'' young children brought to this country by their \n     families. Under existing tax laws, their families may apply \n     for the child tax credit if they qualify financially. If \n     fraud is suspected, the solution is not to deny all eligible \n     children access to this critical antipoverty program. That is \n     cruel and ineffective.\n\n  Those are the words of Sister Simone Campbell in reference to this \nproposed amendment. She concludes by saying:\n\n       Responsible leaders in Congress should look into their \n     hearts and reject proposals like this one pushed by [Senator] \n     Ayotte. This political tactic is not good for our economy or \n     the wellbeing of our entire nation--especially children who \n     are the future of our country. We are better than this.\n\n  I agree with Sister Campbell. Why is it, week after week, from the \nother side of the aisle, from the other side of the Rotunda, we hear \nproposal after proposal to make it harder for working families, and \nparticularly lower income families, to get by in America?\n  When we talked about unemployment benefits for those who have lost \ntheir jobs so they can find additional work, only four Republicans \nSenators would step up and join us in that effort. When we talk about \nextending the minimum wage so that those who get up and go to work \nevery single day have a fighting chance, the opposition consistently \ncomes from the other side of the aisle.\n  Now we have before us this proposal to change the Tax Code to the \ndisadvantage of the poorest workers and the poorest families and the \npoorest children in America. We are better than this. Sister Campbell \nis right. I would say to my colleagues, if you believe in the DREAM \nAct--and many of you have said you do--you cannot vote for the Ayotte \namendment without realizing what it does to these children. To \nimpoverish these children on 1 day in the Senate, and before that say \nthat we think they should be citizens some day--we have to have a \nconsistent moral ethic when it comes to the way we treat children in \nAmerica.\n  Denying children the most basics in life, whether it is food stamps \nor assistance on the tax returns of their parents, is just not what \nAmerica should be about. This Ayotte amendment will really call into \nquestion our dedication to these kids and their families. These workers \nare stepping up, meeting their legal obligation to pay their taxes. All \nthey are asking for is to be treated like everyone else under the Tax \nCode. The Ayotte amendment will deny that to millions of these \nchildren. That is absolutely unacceptable.\n  Now, let me address a very real issue. Senator Ayotte has identified \nsome instances--I do not know how many--of fraud in the use of this \nchild tax credit. I stand with her in trying to fight back and end that \nfraud. But let's be honest. A person making barely minimum wage, filing \ntheir tax returns and claiming this credit, is not likely to set out to \ngame the system.\n  The people who are gaming the system are the tax preparers. They are \nthe ones who may be lying to the government and are guilty of fraud. I \nwill join with Senator Ayotte and any other colleague who wants to stop \nthat perpetration of fraud. I do not stand for fraud in any program. I \ndo not think any Senator would. But to take this out on the children \nand low-income taxpayers is just plain wrong.\n\n[[Page S863]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues, let's stand by the veterans and restore their \npensions. Let's do it as quickly as we can. But please do not help our \nveterans at the expense of children in America. This is an important \namendment. It is one that calls into question our values. I urge my \ncolleagues to look at this very carefully.\n  This is the last point I will make before I yield the floor; I see \nother colleagues here. I support comprehensive immigration reform. If \nthe Ayotte amendment is enacted into law, the cost of bringing the \nDREAMers into citizenship has just gone up by billions of dollars, \nwhich we will have to raise to undo the Ayotte amendment at a future \ntime. Let's not put ourselves in that position.\n  For the good of these children and their families and to put this \nNation in the right place by fixing our broken immigration system, I \nurge my colleagues to oppose the Ayotte amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a \ncolloquy with my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        IRS Political Targeting\n\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I rise today to bring attention to the \nlatest installment concerning political targeting by the IRS. Last \nspring we learned of the IRS's targeting of conservative groups that \nwere applying for 401(c)(4) tax exempt status, thanks to a report by \nthe IRS's inspector general. This report detailed how the IRS singled \nout conservative groups for excessive scrutiny, which caused some \napplications to lie pending for more than 3 years and another 28 \norganizations to actually give up on their unanswered application.\n  The President claimed the targeting was due solely to ``boneheaded \ndecisions.'' Unfortunately, with the head of the tax-exempt \norganizations unit at the agency, Lois Lerner, choosing to plead the \nFifth and resigning rather than answer questions before Congress, we \nmay find that the source of this problem is a little more troubling \nthan that.\n  Thankfully, multiple investigations are taking place to answer \nlingering questions such as this one. I look forward to their findings \nwherever they may lead. Uncovering who directed and participated in the \ninappropriate targeting and why will allow us to bring justice to the \ngroups affected and ensure that no such targeting like this occurs \nagain.\n  So imagine my surprise when over the Thanksgiving holiday I learned \nthat the IRS had diagnosed the problem and offered its regulatory \nsolution, despite the fact that multiple investigations are far from \ncomplete. On Friday, November 29, without warning, the IRS published a \nproposed rule that would restrict the activities of 501(c)(4) \norganizations, effectively limiting their speech and curtailing their \ncivic participation.\n  This brings a whole new meaning to the term ``Black Friday.'' This \nrule singles out the same conservative groups that were previously \ntargeted by the IRS and threatens to shut them down. It further \nattempts to legitimatize the targeting of organizations that hold \nideological views that are inconsistent with the administration's \nviews.\n  It should be no surprise, since critics of these conservative \norganizations have openly called for their extinction, that this is \noccurring. At the least, some would like to force 401(c)(4) \norganizations into ill-fitting structures devised more appropriately \nfor political committees in order to require the disclosure of \nconservative supporters.\n  The IRS and the White House claim innocently that the proposed rule \nis meant to clear up confusion about the process of applications for \n501(c)(4) organizations involved in political activities. Over the past \nseveral months, we have heard this administration tell the public \nmultiple times how confusing the applications are. Yet 501(c)(4) \napplications have been processed for years without excessive complaints \nof confusion that has occurred in recent months.\n  In fact, before the IRS began flagging the applications of \nconservative groups in February 2010, these types of applications were \nbeing processed within 3 months. Email traffic between IRS employees \nshows that the applications of conservative organizations were not \nflagged out of confusion but, rather, because of media attention and \npotential interest to Washington.\n  So let's call this rule what it is. It is an attempt to silence the \nvoices of conservative organizations. To be clear, 501(c)(4)s are \npermitted to engage in the political process and in political \ndiscourse, and they should continue to be allowed to do so. But this \nregulation seeks to limit their participation in a host of advocacy and \neducation activities, even nonpartisan voter registration and education \ndrives.\n  These activities have a clear role in promoting civic engagement and \nsocial welfare, the precise purpose of the 501(c)(4) structure. \nUnfortunately, the rule would suppress conservative voices by forcing \norganizations to quit these activities or to be shut down. In fact, \naccording to evidence collected by the House Ways and Means Committee \nand Chairman Dave Camp, the administration has been working on this \nrule since 2011.\n  Not surprisingly, the Treasury Department kept quiet of its plans. In \nfact, it neglected to mention consideration of this rule in the \nagency's 2011 or 2012 policy guidance plan. These are usually the ones \nthat detail upcoming projects. If it sounds suspicious, it is. Just 3 \nmonths after the IRS abuse surfaced, the Treasury Department listed in \nits 2013 plan the development of guidance related to the political \nactivities of 501(c)(4)s.\n  Conveniently, the publicity of the IRS abuse provided an opportunity \nto finally roll out the agency's rule as a solution to its ``boneheaded \ndecisions.'' But this administration is not fooling anyone. Over 20,000 \npeople have already submitted comments to the proposed rule. According \nto the new IRS Commissioner, this is the largest number of comments \never received by any agency. Clearly, the public sees through the \nadministration's veiled attempts to squash free speech and to shut down \nopposition to its priorities. This is not a way to win back trust.\n  Just this past December the IRS Commissioner, known for his ability \nto turn around organizations, was confirmed as the new IRS \nCommissioner. This is John Koskinen. He promised to work towards \nrestoring trust to the scandal-ridden agency. But he has yet to turn \nthings around and is allowing this politically charged rule to move \nahead.\n  So I come to the floor today, along with my friend from Kansas, \nSenator Roberts, and with the support of 37 additional Members of this \nbody, to introduce legislation to stop the rule's implementation. I see \nSenator Hatch from Utah and Senator Cornyn of Texas who will also speak \nto this in a moment.\n  The Stop Targeting of Political Beliefs by the IRS Act will prevent \nthis rule or any other that seeks to continue the targeting of groups \nbased on their ideology. It is time to end the intimidation and \nharassment. Let's preserve the First Amendment rights of all groups \nregardless of their ideology, especially those that commit themselves \nto improve our society. Let's restore the public's faith in the ability \nof the IRS to fairly administer our Nation's laws. I hope the rest of \nthe Senate will join us in this effort. I look forward to coming back \nto the floor later in the week to ask unanimous consent to pass this \nlegislation outright.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I would like first to thank my colleagues \nfor working with Senator Flake and myself to bring this proposal \nforward. This is a critical issue, one that really gets straight to the \nheart of our American democracy.\n  The current investigations of the IRS clearly show it is not an \noverreaction to say that the Internal Revenue Service did suppress \npolitical opposition. Now, to Kansans, to Arizonans, to Texans, to \nUtahns all across the country, and to my colleagues, this is not only a \nscandal but one that is egregious.\n  There is a great deal more than a ``smidgen'' at stake here. It gets \nright to the heart of our system of government. The government must be \nheld accountable for its actions and must\n\n[[Page S864]]\n\nnever be permitted to trample on the constitutional rights of our \ncitizens. The behavior of the IRS in singling out select groups at \ntheir discretion for extra scrutiny and harassment just because they \nhold views that differ from the administration is simply outrageous.\n  Worse, the IRS continues to target groups whose politics it does not \nlike even as we speak on the floor of the Senate. In fact, the proposed \nIRS 501(c)(4) regulations will even more directly prevent groups the \nIRS does not favor from really participating in the political process.\n  The proposed regulations would place much tougher controls on what \nwould be considered political activity, effectively blocking the normal \npractice of a wide range of not-for-profit organizations, not only \nconservatives. Under the proposed rules, healthy debate and discussion \nof political issues, political candidates, and Congressional actions \nwould be prohibited.\n  This is, in effect, suppression of free speech for these Americans. \nThe proposed regulations would result in continued sanction, \nintimidation and harassment to these groups, and permit the Federal \nGovernment to be used as a partisan tool. We recently learned that the \nproposed regulations have been under development for some time. Senator \nFlake has just mentioned this. This is nothing new, and perhaps it is \nas far back as 2011. Some say even 2010.\n  These proposed regulations until recently have been considered off-\nline--my colleagues, pay attention to this--off-line. Off-line means \nthat the regs are being considered outside the normal regulatory \nprocess, which, in my view, has been done in order to circumvent the \nAdministrative Procedures Act. There is no transparency here.\n  I cannot help but think that all of this, the targeting, the slow \nwalking of exemption applications, and the proposed regulations are \npart of a calculated plan to deny unfavored groups their First \nAmendment rights to participate in the political process of the Nation.\n  My colleagues, this is simple. What we are seeing is a deliberate \neffort to infringe the peoples' First Amendment rights. It is \nincredible. I never thought I would live to see the day that this would \nhappen in the United States and we would have to be debating this. This \nis a copy of the Constitution of the United States--the First Amendment \nby James Madison. This was given to me by Robert C. Byrd, the \ninstitutional flame of the Senate, who sat right over there to the left \nof the distinguished ranking member from Utah, and I know who is our \nRepublican lead in regards to the investigation of all of this in the \nFinance Committee.\n\n       Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of \n     religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or \n     abridging the freedom of speech.\n  The freedom of speech, my colleagues, or the press or the right of \nthe people peaceably to assemble and/or to petition the government for \na redress of grievances.\n  As former chair of the Intelligence Committee, I can say that the \narrogant response of the administration to the IRS actions, the \ndenials, the evasions, the attempts to downgrade the implications of \nthe IRS efforts, and now counteraccusations--they look like they came \nfrom some counterespionage handbook.\n  The real problem is that the IRS has proposed these regulations \nbefore Congress has even completed, as the Senator from Arizona pointed \nout, its investigation of the agency's actions in these matters. The \nmanner in which these regulations have come up raises questions about \nthe integrity of the rulemaking process--the exact opposite direction \nthe agency should be taking.\n  Even worse, the IRS proceeds with these rules when they have done as \nmuch as possible to slow down the Finance Committee's investigation--I \nam a member of that committee; Senator Hatch is leading the effort on \nthe Republican side--by responding to document requests at a glacial \npace at best and redacting large amounts of critical information.\n  Senator Flake and I have proposed a very straightforward, very \ncommonsense approach to this entire mess. We simply halt further action \non the proposed regulations until the Justice Department and the \ncongressional investigations by the House Ways and Means Committee and \nthe Senate Finance Committee into the IRS actions are completed. The \nbill freezes further IRS action for 1 year and would make it clear that \nthe IRS could only enforce the regulations that were in place before \nall this mess began.\n  It is no wonder, given the IRS's behavior, that Kansans and virtually \nevery American--with very good reason--doubt that the agency can in \ngood faith administer the Tax Code. Clearly, the IRS has no capacity to \nregulate any political activity without running roughshod over the \npeople's fundamental constitutional rights.\n  I have said this many times, but the scandal also shows that the IRS \nis too big, too intrusive, and too involved in taxpayers' business. The \ntime for us to scale it back is now. In fact, it is easily the most \ndistrusted agency in the Federal Government. That is a shame. The IRS \nhas become a four-letter word.\n  This growing lack of faith in the IRS is a very strong reason why \nCongress should consider a wholesale rewrite of the tax system by \nsimplifying tax collection and reducing the government's intrusion into \neconomic and other affairs of the public. This is the main reason I am \nsupporting legislation to scrap the Tax Code and move to a simplified, \nsingle-rate tax system. We do not need the IRS regulating \nconstitutionally guaranteed free speech and muzzling lawful activity in \nregard to politics and taking part as a partner in government.\n  Will Rogers once said, ``The difference between death and taxes is \ndeath doesn't get worse every time Congress meets.'' Today, Will Rogers \nis wrong. It is not Congress that is making things worse, it is the \nIRS.\n  So let's pass this bill and work to get the IRS out of Americans' \nlives and their freedom of speech.\n  I thank Senator Flake again for being a cosponsor of the legislation.\n  Mr. FLAKE. I thank the Senator from Kansas.\n  I yield to the Senator from Utah, the ranking minority member on the \nFinance Committee.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague from Arizona and my colleague from \nKansas as well.\n  I rise today in support of the Stop Targeting of Political Beliefs by \nthe IRS Act, the bill introduced today by our Senator from Arizona and \nthe senior Senator from Kansas. This is a Senate companion to the bill \nbeing marked up today in the House Ways and Means Committee. This is an \nimportant piece of legislation that will protect free speech and \nensure--at least for the time being--that the Internal Revenue Service \nis not used as yet another political arm of this administration.\n  As we all know, last November the IRS unveiled proposed regulations \nthat would fundamentally alter the nature of the activities tax-exempt \n501(c)(4) organizations can engage in. Under current regulations, \n501(c)(4) organizations--or social welfare groups--can engage in \npolitical activities on a limited basis so long as their primary \nactivity is the promotion of social welfare. However, they remain free \nto educate the public on important issues--even those that may be \npolitically charged--because that falls within the exempt purpose of \npromoting social welfare. They can also conduct voter registration \ndrives and distribute voter guides outlining candidates' priorities on \nissues important to the organization.\n  Under the proposed regulation, virtually all of these activities \nwould be considered political activity and would be considered \ninconsistent with various groups' exemptions under 501(c)(4) of the \nInternal Revenue Code. As a practical matter, this would mean that \ngrassroots organizations all over the country would be forced to shut \ndown--or, to put it more bluntly, conservative grassroots organizations \nall over this country would be forced to shut down.\n  That is precisely the point. The Obama administration does not want \ngrassroots organizations--even those that are legitimately \nnonpartisan--educating the public on the issues of the day. They don't \nwant tax-exempt organizations to be able to tell voters where \ncandidates and politicians stand on the issues. And they certainly \ndon't want these types of groups participating in the political process \nin any\n\n[[Page S865]]\n\nmeaningful way. That is why we are seeing these regulations, that is \nwhy they were drafted in the first place, and that is why the \nadministration seems set to finalize them right before the 2014 midterm \nelections or, at the very latest, before the 2016 Presidential \nelection.\n  We need to call this what it is.\n  This is an affront to free speech and the right of all American \ncitizens to participate in the democratic process. This is an attempt \nby the Obama administration to further marginalize its critics and keep \nthem on the sidelines. It is a blatant attempt to continue the \nharassment and intimidation that has already been taking place at the \nIRS over the past few years.\n  This regulation is just one of many problems we see at the IRS. \nIndeed, the American people have ample reason to doubt the credibility \nof the IRS, particularly when it comes to dealing with organizations \nthat might be critical of the President and his policies. The IRS is \ncurrently under investigation on three separate congressional \ncommittees for its targeting of conservative organizations during the \nrun-up to the 2010 and 2012 elections.\n  On top of that, the agency recently came under widespread \ncondemnation when, in the midst of these ongoing investigations, they \nannounced they were reinstating bonuses that had been canceled in \nresponse to the targeting scandal. It is almost as if they believe \nthere was no scandal at all. Of course, if you have been listening to \nother people in the Obama administration, that type of thinking appears \nto be the predominant view. Several weeks ago, for example, leaks from \nthe Justice Department indicated that no criminal charges were likely \nto be filed in the targeting scandal, even though this scandal is still \nunder investigation. Talk about politics. Talk about political control. \nTalk about ignoring what is going on.\n\n  On Super Bowl Sunday, President Obama said in an interview that there \nwas not a ``smidgen'' of corruption at the IRS. Well, when it comes to \nsuppressing free speech, there is far more than a smidgen of corruption \nat the IRS. If anything, these proposed regulations on 501(c)(4)s are \nadditional proof. It is one side trying to one-up the other in all \ncases because they happen to control the Presidency and one House of \nCongress.\n  When the proposed rule was first made public, the IRS said it was \ndrafted in response to the 2013 TIGTA report that revealed all the \nissues the agency was having with regard to 501(c)(4) applications. \nHowever, as we learned in a Ways and Means Committee hearing last week, \nthose regulations were under consideration for 2 years before the \nreport was issued--2 years.\n  On top of that, the regulations were pursued outside of the normal \nchannels for IRS and Treasury Department regulatory efforts in a manner \nthat some IRS officials labeled ``off-plan.'' ``Off-plan'' in this case \nmeans hidden--h-i-d-d-e-n--from the public. Why does the IRS need to \nhide a draft regulation from the public when a regulation project is \nnormally listed on a public Treasury guidance plan? I suppose we can \nonly speculate, but I think it is fair to assume they didn't want the \npublic to know these regulations were in the works. And they expect the \nAmerican people to believe there is no political motivation for these \nregulations? Give me a break.\n  The fact is that these proposed regulations demonstrate that the IRS \nis willing and able to carry the President's political water even when \nthe agency is, by law, supposed to be an independent and nonpartisan \nagency. That is why this legislation that has been introduced today by \nthe two distinguished Senators who preceded me in their remarks is so \nimportant. We need to send a message to the administration that it \ncannot tamper with the rules of free speech just because it doesn't \nlike what is being said.\n  If enacted, this legislation would delay the implementation of these \nrules for a year. This is the least we can do to protect free speech. \nPeople from all across the political spectrum--from the ACLU, to the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce, to the unions--have recognized just how \negregious this proposed rule is. It needs to be stopped, and our bill \nwould stop it.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Indeed, everyone \nwho supports the right of American citizens to participate in the \npolitical process, whether they are Republican or Democrat, should \nsupport this bill.\n  I say to our new IRS Commissioner--whom I fought to get confirmed, \nwho I believe is sincere, who I believe is a person who can clean up \nthis mess over there, this nest of partisan people who are in the IRS, \nwhere there should not be any partisanship--Mr. Koskinen, you have the \npower to stop this regulation from becoming final.\n  The Commissioner should stop this. All he has to do is just not sign \nit.\n  I have to say that I will be watching very carefully because I am \nsick and tired of the IRS being used for political purposes. I don't \nwant to be used for Republican purposes, Democratic purposes, liberal \npurposes, or conservative purposes. I want freedom in this country, and \nI want people to be able to express themselves freely.\n  What they are trying to do is outrageous, and it shows an \nadministration that can't win fair and square with all of the \nadvantages that it has.\n  We know that many of the 501(c)(4)s are basically organizations that \nhave a conservative tilt. The 501(c)(5)s are the unions that we know \nalmost 100 percent support Democrats, even though 40 percent of union \nmembers are Republicans. I know; I used to be a skilled tradesman. I \nlearned a skilled trade, went through a formal apprenticeship, worked \nfor 10 years in a building construction trade union, and I am proud of \nthat, and I was proud to be a union member. Forty percent of union \nmembers are Republicans. Yet almost 100 percent of their effort goes to \nelect Democrats. The uptick in 501(c)(5) applications was just as high \nas the uptick for conservative organizations in 501(c)(4)s. We didn't \nsee any of this--neither the targeting nor the regulations--being used \nagainst 501(c)(5)s. The only conclusion is that there is a group of \npeople who basically want to support only one side of the equation.\n  We have to get politics out of the IRS. I don't know what that means. \nIt may mean--like other agencies where we don't want any politics \ninvolved--getting rid of any partisan controls. That might include the \nunion. Because we have people who were partisan and did wrong things--\nour investigation is not complete, but it is a matter of great concern \nto us--and then to come up with this type of stuff, it is enough to \njust make you want to cry or, should I say, throw up.\n  I am a Republican. The Presiding Officer is a Democrat. We are \nfriends. We don't agree on a lot of things. That is what makes this \ncountry great. But when one side tries to stifle the free speech of the \nother side, we both have to stand together. I hope Mr. Koskinen, the \nnew Commissioner, will do what is right and get rid of these \nregulations. My gosh, let's not have regulations that give a tilt to \none side or the other. Let's have the IRS be down the middle, \nstraightforward, decent, and honest, which it has not been in the last \nnumber of years. We are going to show that.\n\n  All I can say is I commend my two colleagues for their leadership in \nintroducing this bill. It is long overdue, and I hope every Senator in \nthis Senate will support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FLAKE. I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Utah and his \nrecitation of the chronology and how this happened.\n  These regulations are supposedly in response to the scandal that came \nup, although the President is not calling it a scandal. He says there \nis not any evidence there was any wrongdoing. But these plans were \nactually being developed a couple years ago--long before we knew the \nIRS was targeting conservative organizations. So the notion this is in \nresponse to what just occurred is wrong.\n  What is equally troubling--or more troubling--as the Senator from \nUtah noted, these plans were described, in an internal memo, as \n``offplan,'' around the process--that were hidden. So that is what we \nare asking for in this legislation. Let's not do any rulemaking until \nthe results of the investigations that are going on come back to us. \nThat is a prudent thing to do, and I hope we will follow through.\n  I now yield to the minority whip, Senator Cornyn.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I will be brief, but I just wanted to \ncommend\n\n[[Page S866]]\n\nthe Senators from Arizona, Kansas, and my friend and colleague from \nUtah, Senator Hatch, for their comments and for their support for \ngetting the IRS out of the speech police business.\n  As if the IRS doesn't have its hands full already with the addition \nof the implementation of ObamaCare, on top of all of its other \nproblems. I don't know anybody who thinks they need more to do, \nparticularly when it comes to discriminating against people based upon \ntheir political affiliations and their desire to engage in debate and \nadvocate their views in the arena. This is a politically neutral issue \nbecause we know this legislation will protect people on the left as \nmuch as on the right.\n  I have to agree with my colleagues that it appears there has been a \ndisproportionate amount of attention given to people on the right under \nthis administration. I know my colleague from Arizona has heard of \nCatherine Engelbrecht of Houston, TX, with the King Street Patriots and \nTrue the Vote. She founded two organizations dedicated to improving \nelections and furthering the ideals of our Founding Fathers. She led a \ncoalition of citizen volunteers to work as election monitors who \nprovide resources for voter registration and to root out election \nfraud.\n  One would think those would be commendable actions, not a reason for \ngovernment discrimination and investigation. But for 3 years the IRS \ndenied her organization tax-exempt status while comparable \norganizations--as I think the Senator from Arizona pointed out--had \nreceived expedited or fairly routine treatment. In the meantime, she \nwas subjected to over-the-top inquiries by the IRS and even by the ATF \nand other government organizations. The IRS wanted to subpoena every \none of her tweets on her Twitter account as well as entries made on her \nFacebook account.\n  You can't make up this stuff. It is extraordinarily offensive.\n  What these proposed rules are going to do is to institutionalize the \nrole of the IRS as the speech police, something we ought to avoid like \nthe plague. We ought to make sure people of all ideological and \npolitical affiliations are free to engage in their constitutional \nrights of association and of political speech.\n  I wish to point out, in conclusion, that 60 years ago the Supreme \nCourt of the United States handed down a very important decision. It is \ncalled the NAACP v. Alabama. The question there was whether the \ngovernment could compel the disclosure of the membership list of the \nNAACP when the NAACP felt its members would then be targeted by the \ngovernment in a negative sort of way. The Supreme Court said the \nConstitution of the United States and the First Amendment guarantees \nthe right of free association in addition to a right of free speech and \nthat was constitutionally protected activity. Given the importance of \nthat right under the Constitution and also given the likelihood of \nnegative attention by the government, they said the NAACP could keep \nits membership list confidential.\n  So at a time when the American people have taxes on their minds--I \nknow my wife and I have a deadline in our family that by the end of \nFebruary we like to get everything to the people who help us prepare \nour tax returns--and with a midterm election looming, the last thing we \nneed to do is to support the IRS becoming the speech police and \nsuppressing the constitutionally protected rights of the American \npeople.\n  I would particularly say to my friend from Arizona that I pulled out \na Gallup poll report, dated January 15, 2014, where government was \ncited as the top problem. That report shows that 21 percent of people \nin the poll said they were dissatisfied with the government, Congress, \npoliticians, poor leadership, corruption, and abuse of power. What \ngreater abuse of power could there be than to confer upon the IRS the \nlegitimacy to intimidate and suppress people exercising their \nconstitutionally protected rights of free speech.\n  So I commend the Senator from Arizona and others who are working on \nthis. They can count on me to lend my voice and support to their \nefforts.\n  Mr. FLAKE. I thank the Senator from Texas and my other colleagues who \nhave participated in this colloquy. I hope we can speedily bring the \nStop Targeting of Political Beliefs by the IRS Act to the floor. When \nthe Senator from Texas talks about his constituents and what they \nendured at the hands of the IRS, how anybody can say there is nothing \namiss there or there is nothing wrong, especially when somebody is \nasked, upon application for a 501(c)(4), to give up their Facebook \nposts and tweets and let the IRS review them to see if they are worthy \nof receiving such status, there is something wrong. I think Americans \nknow that.\n  I appreciate the support of my colleagues on this legislation and I \nappreciate the Senator from Kansas, my partner in this effort.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Nominations\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of notifying my \ncolleagues that later today or tomorrow I intend to ask unanimous \nconsent for two of my judge nominees to be voted on this week. Both are \nnoncontroversial, both have been heartily endorsed by Senator Boozman, \nmy colleague from Arkansas, and basically everybody else who has looked \nat this. These two judges came out of the Judiciary Committee, one of \nthem on October 31 and the other on November 14.\n  These two judges are completely noncontroversial, but we have a sense \nof urgency, not only because we have two vacancies on the Federal bench \nin Arkansas, which is in and of itself a problem, but we have a real \nsense of urgency because one of these judges is an elected judge. In \nArkansas, those are nonpartisan elections. One of these judges is an \nelected judge and the filing period for his seat opens on February 24 \nand closes on March 3.\n  We find ourselves in a situation where we are here this week, then we \nwill be in recess next week. We will then come back on the evening of \nFebruary 24, presumably for 5:30 p.m. votes, if things work on that day \nas they typically do around here. We would presumably have a 5:30 p.m. \nvote, and at that point the filing would be open, with other lawyers \nand judges interested in that position, and there is a domino effect \nthat happens in Arkansas because of that.\n  So I am not going to ask unanimous consent right now, but I wanted to \nput all my colleagues on notice that I intend to do that either later \ntoday or tomorrow.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, first, I wish to thank Senator Pryor. \nSenator Pryor and a group of us have introduced a piece of legislation \nthat rights a wrong; that makes sure our military continues to receive \ntheir COLA in full course and in the full amount.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, we had a budget issue we worked \nthrough, and in that process the COLA for our active retired military \nwas reduced by 1 percent. We all knew we would take the time, because \nwe had the time after the budget passed, to fix this problem. We have \nalready done it for our disabled retired veterans and now we need to \nfulfill the final and full promise of their COLA in total.\n  I spoke last night about this issue, and then we had the vote on \ncloture, with the result being 94 to 0--94 to 0. If that isn't an \nindication of how much support there is to make sure the COLA comes \nback in full force, I don't know what is.\n  I do know starting right after that vote we began hearing from people \nalready coming up with, well, I voted for cloture, but I have a caveat. \nI have some qualifications I want to add on that vote. I want to have \nthese things in Washington that are called pay-fors.\n  Let me make it very clear to the veterans in my State--and there are \n77,000 veterans who live in my State. The highest per capita in the \nNation is in Alaska. They have paid the bill. They paid the bill time \nand time again.\n  This is a perfect photo to use as an example of our military who have \nserved in combat, who served on the\n\n[[Page S867]]\n\nfrontlines. Think about those who have already paid the ultimate bill--\nalmost 6,800 servicemembers have died in Iraq and Afghanistan; from \nAlaska alone, 22, and I will read some of those names in a second.\n  First, I wish to make it very clear we are going to hear these \nconvoluted reasons as to why we should have this pay-for. I wasn't here \nwhen they paid for these wars--no, I am sorry, they didn't pay for \nthese wars. They didn't pay the $2 trillion-plus for the wars, but now \nthat it is time to pay the bill for those who committed to serve our \ncountry, to go to the frontlines when called upon and ensure we have \nthe freedom we enjoy in this country, some are saying: Well, yes, we \nwant to give them that retirement COLA, but--there should be no ``but'' \nhere. A promise made is a promise we need to keep.\n  My view is we should have their backs every single day, and this is \nthe day to do it. Let me make it very clear to those who are going to \nhave this convoluted reason for this pay-for: This is a vote for vets \nor a vote against vets. You can have all the gobbledygook, all the \nconvoluted arguments, but at the end of the day if you vote against \nthis bill, without all this stuff added to it--just a clean and simple \ngiving the COLA back and then let's move on, give them their full \nCOLA--you are voting against vets.\n  I don't care how they try to press-release it, spin it, or what \namendments they want to add to create a political situation for other \nMembers on other issues unrelated to vets. A promise made is a promise \nwe need to keep. We need to have their backs. They have our backs every \nsingle day to make sure this country is safe, no matter where American \ncitizens are in this country or in this world. It is our time to do \nwhat is right for veterans.\n  I shared some stories last night about Alaskans who are struggling \nwith this issue and the commitment they thought they had. One gentleman \nserved 18 years in the military and is close to retirement. He is \nwondering what did he sign up for. He has had enormous pressures on his \nfamily. He has moved six different times. He has two children, one \ndisabled, and a variety of personal issues. But he continues to serve \nthis country. And for us to play politics and start talking about \nimmigration, child tax credits, forget it. It is time to do what is \nright for our veterans, to put this COLA back in full force.\n  Over 30 veterans organizations support this bill with no pay-for, \nclean and simple. Senator Pryor and I were on a phone call last week \nand talked to many--the Air Force Association, Army Aviation \nAssociation, the Fleet Reserves, Gold Star Wives--I can go through the \nlist of 30-plus organizations who work with our veterans every single \nday and want us to pass this bill--not an amended bill but this bill: \nGet it done and give peace of mind to our veterans and retirees and \nactive military.\n  To some degree this puts our readiness at risk. If someone is \nthinking about joining the military, they are looking at the benefits. \nThey know at some point they may be called to duty and put their life \non the line. So they are looking at the benefits: What can they provide \nfor themselves and their families? What is the retirement if they \nbecome a career officer or a career enlisted member? And now they are \nquestioning if they should.\n  I received emails from some parents whose sons and daughters are \ncurrently enlisted and are now wondering, what did they get into when \nat a moment's notice the commitments, the promises we--Congress--made \ncan change overnight.\n  Our readiness is at risk, and the promises and commitments we make to \nour military are in question. Today is the start to make sure our \ncommitments are there. We cannot say to our veterans: Sign up; we will \npromise you these things, and tomorrow we might change them. That \ndoesn't help our readiness and commitment.\n  I get that there is going to be a lot of policy wonk conversation by \nsome Members because they want to confuse the issue and make it hard \nfor people to understand what is really going on in Washington. But it \nis simple. The chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee knows this \nissue is simple. It is about our vets. If you vote yes, you are for our \nvets; if you vote no, you are against our vets. That is it. They can \nput in all the spin and all the amendments to make it sound good. But \nin reality, they are trying to cover an activity they are struggling \nwith; that is, they don't necessarily like some of us who are sponsors. \nI get that. But let's put aside our politics. Let's do what is right \nfor the vets, let's have their backs, let's keep the promise we made to \nthem.\n  Again, this bill is simple. It is so simple it is 1 page. It just \nsays: Repeal that action.\n  I hope my colleagues on the other side who are wondering about what \nthey should do will vote for the vets. Vote yes. Don't mess with \namendments, don't try to have this pay-for convoluted argument. The \nvets at home who will be watching don't care about that. They just want \nto make sure their COLA is there. Let's give them the peace of mind \nthey deserve.\n  I will read a few of the names who have paid the ultimate sacrifice. \nI read some of these last night: GySgt Christopher Eastman, Marines, \nage 28, from Moose Pass, AK; SGT Joel Clarkson, Army, age 23, \nFairbanks; LCpl Grant Fraser, Marine Reserves, age 22, Anchorage; SPC \nShane Woods, Army, age 23, Palmer.\n  These are just a few of the 22 Alaskans who have lost their lives. I \ndon't know if they would have been long-term career if they stayed in \nthe Army or Air Force, but they sacrificed their lives. They put their \nlives on the line to make sure we do the right thing here. It is time \nwe do it. Today is the opportunity. Don't convolute it with all kinds \nof amendments. Vote up or down. You are either for vets or against \nvets.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I rise in full support of the legislation \non the floor.\n  I think most Members understand, as part of the 2013 bipartisan \nbudget agreement, language was included which cut COLAs for military \nretirees. I think most Members here in the Senate and the House \nunderstand that was a mistake, an oversight, and is something that \nshould be rectified and it should be rectified now. Promises made to \npeople in the military should be kept, and our job is to do that.\n  This morning, as the chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, I wish to say a word on broader issues impacting the \nveterans community.\n  Shortly after this legislation is disposed of, we are going to move \non to a comprehensive piece of legislation which addresses many of the \nvery serious problems facing our veterans community. I will give a \nbrief overview of what the legislation does. The legislation is the \nComprehensive Veterans Health and Benefits and Military Retirement Pay \nRestoration Act of 2014--S. 1982.\n  The first point I will make is I honestly believe, in terms of the \nveterans issues, there is widespread bipartisan support. On the \nVeterans Committee, every Member of our committee--Democrat, \nRepublican, or in my case Independent--believes very much that we owe \nour veterans more than we can provide them. Their sacrifices are too \ndeep, the pains are great. But all Members of the committee in a \nbipartisan way are doing their best to protect the interests of our \nveterans, and I thank all of them for their hard work.\n  To as great a degree as possible, the bill which will be on the \nfloor--the comprehensive veterans bill--is a bipartisan bill. It \ncontains many provisions brought forth by my Republican colleagues. \nThis bill consists of two omnibus bills unanimously passed by the \nSenate Veterans' Affairs Committee, supported by Democrats and \nRepublicans. It also includes other provisions which had strong \nbipartisan support.\n  This legislation also contains two new provisions, both of which have \nbipartisan support. The first new addition addresses the restoration of \ncuts made to military retiree COLAs as a result of the 2013 bipartisan \nagreement, the exact same issue being debated on the floor right now. \nWe also have that language in our bill. Promises made to veterans have \ngot to be kept. We have to restore those cuts to COLAs for military \nretirees.\n  The second new provision not discussed, frankly, by the committee \nalso has widespread bipartisan support, and\n\n[[Page S868]]\n\nauthorizes the VA to enter into 27 major medical facility leases in 18 \nStates and Puerto Rico.\n  Interestingly, the legislation which will soon be on the floor \ncontains two major provisions already passed by House Republicans. So \nto as great a degree as possible, in terms of language in the bill, in \nterms of working with our Republican colleagues in the House, this is a \nbipartisan bill and should have the support of every Member of the \nSenate who believes in protecting the interests of veterans. And I hope \nthat is the vast majority of the people here.\n  As Senator Begich mentioned a moment ago, our veterans have paid a \nvery heavy price. What I have learned in the little bit more than the \nyear in which I have been chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee \nis I think most Americans, including myself, were not fully aware of \nwhat that sacrifice was. And what that sacrifice was in recent years \nwas not just the loss of over 6,700 Americans who lost their lives in \nAfghanistan and Iraq but the impact of those wars on hundreds and \nhundreds of thousands of veterans who came home either wounded in \nbody--loss of arms, loss of legs, loss of hearing, or loss of sight--or \nthe more invisible wounds of war.\n  What most Americans don't know is a rather shocking number, but we \nare now dealing with hundreds of thousands of men and women who came \nhome from Iraq and Afghanistan who are doing their best to cope with \npost-traumatic stress disorder, which has a terrible impact on their \nlives, on their families' lives, and on their ability to get a job and \nkeep a job; and traumatic brain injury, the result of being in the \npresence of IEDs and the explosions in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  We are also dealing in this rough economy, this struggling economy, \nthis high unemployment economy, with many young veterans coming home \nunable to find jobs. Some in the National Guard left decent jobs and \ncame home to find those jobs are not there.\n  I think virtually every Member in the Senate understands that at a \ntime when the VA went from paper to digital and made the transformation \nwhich was necessary to deal with the claims process, the claims process \ntoday remains too long. The backlog is too great. We have to deal with \nthat issue.\n  We are dealing with a situation where young men and women were \nwounded in war who had hopes and dreams of starting their own families, \nbut as a result of injuries sustained in those wars, for whatever \nreason, lost their reproductive capabilities and they still want to \nhave families.\n  We are dealing with issues of sexual assault--a scandal, an outrage I \nknow every Member of the Senate feels strongly about. Women and men who \nwere sexually assaulted are coming home in need of treatment and are \nunable to get that treatment.\n  We are dealing with a situation today above and beyond the wars in \nAfghanistan and Iraq, where there are people--often women, wives and \nsisters--who are under great stress taking care of disabled veterans \nwho have no arms and no legs. They have devoted their lives to those \npeople and they are hurting as well. As chairman of the veterans' \ncommittee, what I have done is listened as carefully as I could to what \nthe veterans community--representing some 22 million veterans--had to \nsay about the problems veterans are facing.\n\n  My very fine staff and I--along with my Republican colleagues and \ntheir very fine staffs--worked together. We said: These are the \nproblems facing our veterans. We all know that on Veterans Day and \nMemorial Day every Member of the Senate goes out and gives a great \nspeech about how much they love and respect veterans and how much they \nappreciate the sacrifices made by veterans.\n  Now is the time to stand and go beyond words and rhetoric. Now is the \ntime to, in fact, address the real and serious problems facing those \nmen and women whose families experienced the ultimate sacrifice and \nthose men and women who came home wounded in body and spirit.\n  We cannot solve all of the problems facing veterans. We cannot bring \nback loved ones lost in Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam, and the other wars. \nWe cannot bring them back to their wives, their mothers, their dads, \nand their kids. We cannot do that. We cannot magically replace the arms \nand the legs or eyesight lost in war, but we do have the moral \nobligation to do everything humanly possible to protect and defend \nthose men and women who protected and defended us. We can do that and \nthat we must.\n  I am very proud the legislation that will soon be on the floor has \nthe strong support of virtually every veteran and military organization \nin this country, and that includes all of the major organizations \nrepresenting millions and millions of veterans.\n  I thank the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the VFW, \nthe Disabled American Veterans, also known as DAV, Vietnam Veterans of \nAmerica, the Military Officers Association of America, the Iraq and \nAfghanistan Veterans of America, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, the \nGold Star Wives, and dozens and dozens of other veterans and military \norganizations that are supporting this legislation.\n  The Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs has received letters of \nsupport from virtually all of these organizations, and if Members want \nto check out why these organizations that are representing millions of \nveterans are supporting this bill, they will find those letters on our \nWeb site.\n  I will quote from one of the letters. This letter is from the \nDisabled American Veterans, DAV.\n\n       This . . . bill, unprecedented in our modern experience, \n     would create, expand, advance, and extend a number of VA \n     benefits, services and programs that are important to DAV and \n     to our members.\n\n  They see it--as do many of the other veterans organizations--as one \nof the most comprehensive pieces of veterans legislation brought forth \nin the modern history of Congress. I am proud of it. I thank the \nveterans organizations not just for their support of this legislation \nbut for the help they gave us in drafting this legislation.\n  This legislation did not come from Bernie Sanders or from anybody \nelse on the committee. It came from the veterans community itself. It \ncame from representatives of veterans organizations who came before us \nin hearings, who came before us in private meetings, and said: Senator, \nhere are the problems facing our veterans. If you are serious about \ngoing beyond rhetoric and speeches and truly want to help veterans and \ntheir families, this is what needs to be done.\n  We listened. We could not do everything, but we did put many of the \nmajor concerns facing the veterans community in this bill. Again, I \nthank the veterans organizations for being our partner in drafting this \nlegislation.\n  I also wish to take this opportunity to thank those people who have \ncurrently cosponsored this legislation, and that includes Senator \nLandrieu, Senator Begich, the Presiding Officer Senator Schatz, Senator \nBrown, Senator Blumenthal, Senator Hirono, Senator Boxer, Senator \nCasey, Senator Gillibrand, Senator Heinrich, Senator Heitkamp, Senator \nMerkley, Senator Murray, Senator Reed, Senator Shaheen, Senator \nWhitehouse, Senator Rockefeller, Senator Tester, and Senator Cantwell. \nI thank all of them for their strong support.\n  I will take a few minutes to touch on some of the areas this \ncomprehensive bill covers. As I return to the floor in the coming days, \nI will go into greater length about each of these provisions. Each of \nthese provisions, unto themselves, is enormously important in terms of \nthe needs of our veterans.\n  As I mentioned earlier, our comprehensive veterans bill--consistent \nwith the Pryor bill--will restore the cuts made in the Bipartisan \nBudget Act of 2013 to military retirees. We address that issue in our \nbill.\n  This comprehensive veterans legislation deals with another issue--not \nnecessarily a sexy issue--that in fact impacts a large number of \nveterans in communities all over America, and that is that it will \nallow the VA to enter into 27 major medical facility leases in 18 \nStates and Puerto Rico. That means--for a variety of reasons too \ncomplicated to get into right now--we have CBOC, community-based \noutpatient clinics, and other veterans facilities that are ready to go. \nThey are on the drawing board.\n  Actually, it is beyond the drawing board, but we have not been able \nto pull the plug on it. This is very important to veterans all over \nthis country.\n\n[[Page S869]]\n\nIt is important to Republicans, it is important to Democrats, and it is \ntime to get this done. By the way, this has been passed in the House of \nRepresentatives. We need to do it and that is part of this legislation.\n  This legislation includes groundbreaking provisions that would expand \naccess to VA health care. In my view and in the view of veterans all \nover this country, the VA provides high-quality, cost-effective care to \nmillions and millions of our veterans. There are approximately 6.2 \nmillion veterans accessing VA health care today. About 8 million are \nsigned up for VA care.\n  This legislation expands access to VA health care, allows more \nveterans to come in, and ends a very complicated priority 8 \neligibility. Priority 8 is a situation where there are hundreds and \nhundreds of different eligibility levels all over the country, and it \nmakes it very confusing for priority 8 veterans to determine whether \nthey are eligible. We ended that and simplified it. The result is that \nmore veterans will be able to access VA health care. We have also \nexpanded complementary and alternative medicine within the VA. The \ntruth is the VA is now doing a good job in providing complementary and \nalternative medicine, and that means meditation, acupuncture, yoga, and \nother treatments to veterans who are concerned about not being \ndependent on medication. One of the great problems we have nationally \nand in the VA is overmedication of people who have problems associated \nwith pain and other ailments. The VA has done a good job. We are going \nto expand that opportunity.\n\n  My experience--having gone around the country--is that both within \nthe Department of Defense hospitals and the VA, more and more veterans \nare looking at these alternative-type treatments and want to break \ntheir dependence on overmedication.\n  What we also do in this legislation is something that is terribly \nimportant. It is my strong belief that dental care must be considered a \npart of health care. The fact is that in this country there are \nmillions of people--above and beyond the veterans community--who cannot \nfind affordable dental care. Right now within the VA, dental care--with \nthe exception of service-connected problems and homeless veterans--is \nnot open to veterans, and we begin the process to do a significant \npilot program to bring dental care into the VA. That is extremely \nimportant for the veterans community.\n  I think all of us remember not so many months ago the Government of \nthe United States was shut down and caused all kinds of problems for \nall kinds of people. What is not widely known is that disabled veterans \nand veterans receiving their pension were 7 to 10 days away from not \ngetting their checks. We have disabled veterans all over this country \nwho live from month to month through those checks, and they were 7 to \n10 days away from not getting those checks. This legislation provides \nfor advanced appropriations for mandatory VA benefits. By passing that \nprovision, we will never again put disabled vets or veterans who are \ndependent on their pensions in the position of not getting their checks \nwhen they need it.\n  One of the issues that has been discussed a great deal is the issue \nof benefits backlog. There is no disagreement in this Senate--whether \none is a Republican, Democrat, Independent--that it is not acceptable \nfor veterans who applied for benefits to have to wait for years to get \nthose benefits. In my view, what the VA is now doing is undergoing a \nmassive transformation of their benefit system, going from paper--which \nwas incomprehensible to me. In 2008 their system was paper. They are \ngoing from paper to digital. They are making progress, but I want to \nsee them make more progress. This legislation includes some important \nprovisions to make sure we end this unacceptable backlog of VA \nbenefits.\n  One of the issues that has also received some attention is the issue \nof instate tuition assistance for post-9/11 veterans. A number of years \nago we passed very significant legislation which enabled some 900,000 \npost-9/11 veterans and family members to get higher education \nthroughout this country. This legislation would give our transitioning \nservicemembers a fair shot at attaining their educational goals without \nincurring an additional financial burden.\n  We deal with the issue of somebody from out of State moving into \nanother State and making sure that veteran is paying no more than what \nthe instate tuition is for that State. This is a very important \nprovision and, by the way, a provision that was passed in the House of \nRepresentatives. The language is pretty much the same in this bill.\n  We promised veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan that they \nwould have 5 years of free VA health care when they came home. For a \nvariety of reasons, people have not taken advantage of that. We think \nit is important to extend--from 5 to 10 years--unfettered access to VA \nhealth care for recently separated veterans, and that is what this \nlegislation does.\n  I don't have to mention to anybody that our economy--while slowly \nimproving--still has many challenges. Unemployment is much too high. \nWhat this legislation would do is reauthorize provisions from the VOW \nto Hire Heroes Act of 2011, including a 2-year extension for the \nVeterans Retraining Assistance Program, otherwise known as the VRAP \nprogram. In other words, what we are saying to our veterans is when \nthey come home, we want a job to be there for them. We want them to get \nintegrated back into civilian life, so we have some very important \nprovisions in here for employment opportunities for our veterans.\n  As I mentioned earlier, sexual assault is a scandal. The numbers are \nappallingly high. What this legislation does is enable those women and \nmen who were sexually assaulted to come into the VA to get the quality \nof care their situations require and deserve.\n  This provision was inspired by Ruth Moore, who struggled for 23 years \nto receive VA disability compensation. So we have language making sure \nthose who suffered sexual assault will get the care within the VA they \nabsolutely are entitled to.\n  I mentioned earlier, also, that several thousand men and women who \nserved in Iraq and Afghanistan were wounded in ways that make it \nimpossible for them to have babies. These are people who really want \nfamilies, and some of them are now spending a very significant amount \nof money in the private sector through a number of approaches in order \nto be able to have babies. We have language, a provision in this bill, \nwhich would help female and male veterans who have suffered significant \nspinal cord, reproductive, and urinary tract injuries to start a \nfamily. I think that is absolutely the right thing to do.\n  Several years ago this Congress did the right thing by establishing a \nCaregivers Act, which said to those people who were caring for disabled \nvets that we understand how difficult--how difficult--that work is, \nthat you are taking care of people who need constant attention, loved \nones who need constant attention, and we are going to help you do what \nyou have been doing.\n  The good news is we passed that legislation. The bad news is it only \napplied to post-9/11 veterans. I think there was a general \nunderstanding, an assumption, that we were going to expand that program \nto all veterans--Vietnam, World War II, Korea--so those people, mostly \nwomen who are staying home, taking care of veterans, get the support \nthey need. So the extension of the Caregivers Act is also included in \nthis legislation.\n  Those are some of the provisions. This is a 400-page bill, and I just \ntouched on some of them. But let me end in the way I began. There is no \nway we can ever fully repay the debt we owe to the men and women who \nput their lives on the line defending this country. That is just the \nsimple nature of things. We are not going to bring back the husbands \nwho were lost in war, the wives who came back without any legs. We are \nnot going to bring fathers and mothers back to children who lost their \ndad or their mom. We are not going to restore eyesight to people who \nare blind. We cannot do that.\n  But if this country means anything, it means that we have to keep the \npromises we made to veterans and their families; that while we cannot \ndo everything, we have to do as much as we can to make the lives of our \nveterans and their families, their loved ones, as happy and productive \nas we possibly can.\n  So this legislation is from Senators who listened to our veterans, \nheard\n\n[[Page S870]]\n\ntheir concerns, worked with them, and developed this comprehensive \nbill.\n  Let me conclude once again by thanking all of the veterans \norganizations. We have virtually every veterans organization in \nAmerica--not all but almost all--supporting this legislation. We thank \nthem for the work they do every day on behalf of our veterans. I thank \nthem very much for all the help they have provided me and the committee \nin writing this legislation.\n  Speeches on Veterans Day or Memorial Day are great. That is good. It \nis important we all do it. But now is the time to go beyond speeches. \nNow is the time to address the problems facing the veterans community. \nThis legislation does this in a very comprehensive way, and I ask for \nthe support of all my colleagues in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, before my colleague, the chairman of the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee, leaves the floor, I say thank you to him \nfor his passion and advocacy. The legislation he spoke of this morning \nis incredibly important. I say to Senator Sanders, if I am not yet on \nthat bill, I need to be and will be. Please sign me up.\n  It is absolutely true we need to do more than just make speeches. We \nneed to put our commitment, our resources, and keep our promises to our \nveterans. That is what this bill does, and we thank the Senator very \nmuch.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank the Senator.\n  Ms. STABENOW. We also, Mr. President, have a bill in front of us that \nis about our veterans. This bill is about our veterans, and the \nquestion is on a ``yes'' or ``no'' on this final bill. If we support \nour veterans, we vote yes. If we do not support our veterans, if we \nwant to play political games with it, find some other excuse not to \nsupport veterans, then you vote no. It is very simple. To keep our \npromise, vote yes. If you do not care about keeping our promise, vote \nno.\n  We had a vote last night in the Senate to end the filibuster. I think \nit was embarrassing we had to have the vote. I thank our friend and \ncolleague, the senior Senator from Arkansas Mr. Pryor for putting this \nbill forward, along with a number of colleagues. But we should not even \nhave had to have a vote to end a filibuster to move forward on this \nbill. This is something that everyone should want to do as quickly as \npossible. It should not be controversial.\n  Unfortunately, instead of moving it forward and getting this done, we \nare seeing Republican colleagues who are arguing about amendments, \namazingly, that would increase taxes on families in order to ``pay \nfor'' helping our veterans.\n  Now, I think every veteran in America should find this absolutely \noutrageous. I know I do. These men and women have sacrificed for our \nNation. Some did not come home. Some came home without an arm or a leg \nor a closed head injury. They have paid in full for this bill. ``Paid \nin Full'' is what we stamp on this piece of legislation.\n  I am proud to represent nearly 700,000 veterans who are living in \nMichigan--veterans and their families. That is my pay-for for this \nbill. They have paid in full to make sure they get their veterans \nbenefits, their pensions, the health care we promised them.\n  I would like to read just a very few of the names of people in \nMichigan who are the pay-for I offer today on the floor of the Senate:\n  Richard Belisle from Saint Joseph, MI, who retired from the Coast \nGuard after 21 years of service--twenty-one years of service--has paid \nin full for this bill.\n  Bill Garlinghouse of Holland spent 22 years in the Navy--I am partial \nto the Navy; my dad was in the Navy--and then 5 years working for the \nNavy as a civilian. With twenty-two years in the Navy; 5 years working \nfor the Navy as a civilian, he has paid in full for this bill.\n  Richard Eversole of Sumner spent 22 years in the Air Force and \nretired as a master sergeant. Richard has paid in full for this bill.\n  Frank Bell from Kalamazoo retired 10 years ago as a senior master \nsergeant in the U.S. Air Force. He is 51 years old, so he will see his \npension cut by 1 percent every year for the next 11 years.\n  This needs to be fixed now--no games, no debating about amendments--\nyes or no on making sure Frank Bell gets his full pension because he \nhas paid in full for this bill.\n  David Lord of Cheboygan retired from the Navy after 20 years of \nservice. Again, he has paid in full.\n  John Frollo of Saint Charles spent 20 years in the Navy before \nretiring in 2006.\n  Joseph Boogren of Gwinn, MI, spent 32 years--32 years--in the Navy. \nHe served in Iraq and Afghanistan. He flew 177 combat missions \ndefending our country, putting himself in harm's way on behalf of all \nof us. I believe Joseph Boogren has paid in full for his pension and \nthe other benefits we have promised him and his family.\n  Debbie Rasmussen from Sheridan, MI, wrote in on behalf of her \nmilitary family. Debbie and her husband are both Navy veterans, and \ntheir son Matt is an Active Duty sailor with over 15 years of service, \nincluding service in Afghanistan. They believe--and I believe--the \nRasmussens have paid in full for this benefit.\n  Karen Ruedisueli is the wife of an Active Duty Army major currently \nstationed at the Pentagon. Kurt and Karen have been a military family \nfor 12 years. The Ruedisuelis have paid in full.\n  I could go on and on with so many similar letters. Every service is \nrepresented in these letters because veterans from every part of our \narmed services would be hurt by what has been put in place.\n  We know this needs to be addressed and needs to be fixed. We have all \nsaid that--that this needs to be fixed, we need to honor the commitment \nwe have made to the men and women who have served us, and continue to \nserve us. This bill will restore the cost-of-living adjustments for all \nmilitary retirees.\n  We need to act now so our veterans have the certainty and the peace \nof mind they need to move forward with their lives. We should not be \ninvolved in wrangling, in folks trying to find political advantage, and \ntake political hostages, score points in some way. We need to just get \nthis done--no amendments, no jockeying here, just vote for this bill \nand get this done.\n  This bill is about keeping our promise to the men and women who have \nserved us and continue to serve us. A ``yes'' vote says we have your \nback. A ``yes'' vote says we honor and support you. A ``no'' vote or \nother votes that confuse the situation and play political games are \nreally votes that turn your back on our veterans. Very simply, vote yes \nto get this done--no distractions, no extraneous issues. No matter how \npeople feel about other things, bringing them into this is not right. \nIt is not fair. This is about yes for veterans or no for veterans.\n  I hope we will all stand together and understand the ``paid for'' are \nthe people who have served in our States and continue to serve us \ntoday. They have paid in full. We need to vote yes and get this done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I come to the floor today to discuss the \nstagnant Obama economy and how ObamaCare is making it worse. This \nMonday marks the fifth anniversary of the day the President signed his \ntrillion-dollar stimulus bill into law. In remarks he gave in Denver \nthat very day he signed the bill, the President stated that the \nlegislation marked ``the beginning of the end'' of the Nation's \n``economic troubles.''\n  Five years later, however, the end of the Nation's economic troubles \nis nowhere in sight. The headlines of the jobs report released Friday \nsay it all. The headlines from the Associated Press said, ``U.S. \nEconomy May Be Stuck in Slow Lane for Long Run.''\n  The New York Times headline: ``Weakness Continues as 113,000 Jobs Are \nAdded in January.''\n  From CBS News: ``Another month of weak job growth raises slowdown \nfears.''\n  From the Wall Street Journal: ``U.S. Adds 113,000 Jobs, in Latest \nWorrying Sign on Growth.''\n  From Reuters: ``U.S. employment fails to rebound strongly from winter \nchill.''\n  Well before passage of the stimulus, Presidential adviser Christina \nRomer predicted that the stimulus bill would reduce the unemployment \nrate to 5 percent by the year 2014. In fact, over the\n\n[[Page S871]]\n\npast 5 years, the unemployment rate has never come close to falling \nthat low. Last month's unemployment rate was 6.6 percent. If so many \npeople had not dropped out of the labor force over the past several \nyears, that number would be even higher.\n  If the labor force participation rate were the same as it was when \nPresident Obama took office, our current unemployment rate would be a \nstaggering 10.5 percent. Despite the fact that the recession \ntechnically ended 55 months ago, we are still nowhere near where we \nneed to be in terms of economic recovery.\n  CBS News reported on Friday that the economy would have to gain an \naverage of 285,000 jobs per month for the next 3 years just to get us \nback to where we were before the recession. Yet job creation for the \npast year has not even come close to that. In fact, our economy has \nadded just 180,000 new jobs per month, approximately, over the past \nyear. If we continue at that same rate, it will take us over 5 years to \nreturn to where we were before the recession.\n  President Obama's economic policies have left our economy mired in \nstagnation. His health care law is making things even worse. Last week \nthe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released a new report on \nObamaCare. It found that ObamaCare will result in the equivalent of 2.5 \nmillion fewer full-time jobs over the next 10 years--2.5 million fewer \njobs. Our economy is millions of jobs away from where it needs to be.\n  Our labor force participation rate is near a 35-year low. The \nPresident's health care law is going to result in 2.5 million fewer \nfull-time jobs. How will that work? Well, the CBO report made it clear \nthat ObamaCare provides disincentives to work, particularly for those \nat the low income end of the spectrum.\n  An individual receiving ObamaCare subsidies to pay for his or her \nhealth insurance may decide not to accept more hours or a higher paying \njob so that she or he does not exceed the income caps for receiving \nsubsidies. At the higher end of the wage spectrum, workers may decide \nnot to rise too far up the ladder so their income does not reach the \npoint at which it would be subject to ObamaCare taxes. Thus, ObamaCare \nessentially traps workers in lower paying jobs, putting a de facto \nlimit on the prosperity of literally millions of Americans.\n  The CBO reinforces that notion, not just by projecting that 2.5 \nmillion people will drop out of the workforce but also by projecting \nthat those who stay in the workforce will earn less.\n  According to one analysis of the CBO report, ObamaCare will reduce \ntotal wages by an estimated $70 billion per year. Without question, \nmost of this burden will be placed on lower and middle-income families \nwho already are struggling to make ends meet. Furthermore, by providing \nAmericans with disincentives to work, ObamaCare will limit our economic \ngrowth.\n  As the editors of the National Review put it, ``The depth of the \nObamacare crater in the labor force isn't some abstract unemployment \nrate, but the lost value of the work those Americans would have done.''\n  Americans working creates economic growth. It is as simple as that. \nEncouraging Americans to work less or quit work altogether will \nundermine American prosperity and American families' security. Those \nwho find work and are willing and able to fulfill their jobs deserve \nwages that are unhindered by a government takeover of health care.\n  Combine the CBO report with our experience of ObamaCare so far and \nthe future does not look promising: lower income Americans living off \nmeager salaries and government health care subsidies just to get by; \nmiddle-income Americans struggling to pay higher health insurance \npremiums and deductibles; and upper income Americans and small business \nowners too reluctant to create jobs and wealth for fear that they will \nbe subjected to ObamaCare's burdensome taxes and regulations.\n  That is not the kind of future any American desires, but that is \nexactly the future ObamaCare is bringing us. In fact, for too many \nAmericans, that future is already here. With ObamaCare's full \nimplementation this year, Americans are facing huge premium increases \nand steep hikes in their out-of-pocket costs. They are losing access to \ntheir doctors and hospitals. All too often they are facing fewer hours \nwith fewer benefits at their jobs as their employers struggle to comply \nwith ObamaCare's taxes and mandates.\n  Even the President has tacitly acknowledged the burdens his health \ncare law places on employers by once again delaying one of the law's \njob-destroying mandates. While I am glad some businesses will get \nrelief until 2016, Congress should go further, much further, and ensure \nthat every single American is protected from this disastrous law.\n  We can do better than ObamaCare and the President's economic \npolicies. The President has called for 2014 to be a year of action. \nRepublicans could not agree more. It is past time to take action to \nstart reversing ObamaCare's damage and finally get our economic \nrecovery off the ground.\n  Almost 2 weeks ago, the Obama State Department released its fifth \nenvironmental review showing that the Keystone XL Pipeline would have \nno significant impact on global carbon emissions. There is strong \nbipartisan support in both Houses of Congress for approving that \npipeline and the 42,000 jobs it will support. The President needs to \nstop pandering to far-left environmentalists and immediately approve \nthe pipeline and the good-paying jobs it will open for Americans.\n  Next, the President should pick up that phone he keeps talking about \nto call the Senate majority leader and tell him to bring the bipartisan \ntrade promotion authority legislation to the floor. Passing trade \npromotion authority will help U.S. farmers, ranchers, entrepreneurs, \nand job creators gain access to 1 billion consumers around the globe. \nThe majority leader needs to stop obstructing the jobs this bill would \ncreate and join Members of both parties to pass this important \nlegislation.\n  Finally, the President should throw his support behind a repeal of \nthe medical device tax in his health care law. This tax on lifesaving \nmedical technology such as pacemakers and insulin pumps is forcing \nmedical device companies to send American jobs overseas. There is \nstrong bipartisan support for repealing the tax, and the President \nshould add his.\n  Far too many Americans have spent the past 5\\1/2\\ years of the Obama \nPresidency struggling to get by. Household income has fallen. Health \ncare costs have risen. Jobs and opportunity have been few and far \nbetween. For many Americans, the possibility of a secure economic \nfuture seems further and further out of reach. It does not have to be \nthis way. We can turn our economy around by abandoning the President's \nfailed economic proposals and embracing the kind of legislation that \nwill open up new jobs and opportunities for the American people.\n  The three proposals I have outlined above are a good place to start. \nI hope the President will join Republicans and Democrats to get these \npriorities done.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT.

I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, there is overwhelming bipartisan support \nto repeal the COLA reduction for military retirees that was enacted \nlast December in the budget bill. The debate now is whether and how to \npay for the cost of this repeal. I agree with my friend Senator Mark \nBegich of Alaska that our veterans have already paid for this repeal \nwith their service to this country. However, there are some Senators \nwho take a different view and have offered what we refer to as pay-for \namendments.\n  Today I rise in strong opposition to the Ayotte pay-for amendment. \nThe bill before us, S. 1963, the Military Retirement Pay Restoration \nAct, would repeal the COLA reduction for military retirees. This bill \nis sponsored by Senators Pryor, Hagan, and Begich, and I applaud their \nleadership on this issue.\n  Cutting military pensions was a bad idea. An even worse idea is to \nset up a contest between providing pensions to veterans and providing \nantipoverty assistance to children. That is the choice Republicans want \nus to make. I wish I could honestly say this so-called choice is hard \nto believe, but I can't. It is like choosing between cutting off an arm \nor a leg from the body politic. Vets or poor children--aren't they both \nin need of fair treatment?\n  Again, there is bipartisan support to restore the COLA cuts for \nveterans, but I am told that my Republican colleagues won't allow us to \nhave an up-or-down vote on the Military Retirement Pay Restoration Act \nunless we also vote on the Ayotte amendment No. 2732.\n  What does this amendment do? The Ayotte amendment would deny \nantipoverty assistance to the children of undocumented immigrants who \nare working and paying billions of dollars in taxes. It would cut this \nchild poverty program by more than $18 billion over 10 years to pay for \nthe restoration of COLAs for military retirees, which would cost about \n$6 billion over 10 years. In other words, the Ayotte amendment would \ndeny $3 of antipoverty assistance to children in order to restore $1 of \nretirement pay to our veterans. That is unconscionable. We should not \ntake the benefits we provide to veterans by hurting children in the \nprocess. Hurting children does no honor to our veterans' service.\n  The children targeted by the Ayotte amendment did not decide on their \nown to come to this country illegally. They were brought here by their \nparents. These children are DREAMers--our DREAMers. We should not \npunish them for their parents' decisions. We should help these children \nto succeed so they can contribute to this great country. Their parents \nare doing their part by working and paying more than $16 billion in \ntaxes each year, more than $160 billion over 10 years. We should not \ndeny them this small measure of help.\n  Let me acknowledge that it is politically difficult to vote against \nthe offset in the Ayotte amendment. Why? Because the amendment targets \npeople who have no political power. These are children of parents who \ncannot vote. These are children of parents who are very poor, who \nthemselves live on the edge of poverty or far into the depths of it. \nTheir parents work one, two, or even three jobs and pay the taxes they \nowe, but they are barely making ends meet. They are far removed from \nthe level of wealth that too often today translates into political \npower. These are children of parents who came to this country the same \nway many of our ancestors came to this country 100 or 200 years ago and \nfor the same reasons--to escape poverty, to seek opportunity, and to \ngive their children a better life than they had. Their parents are \nworking and paying billions of dollars in taxes each year, which is \nextending the lives of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, as \nexamples. Their parents are working and paying taxes, but they came \nhere illegally, and therefore they must live in the shadows and live in \nfear.\n  Put simply, these are children of families who have no political \npower--none. They are the easiest to go after, and that is what this \nAyotte amendment does. But we should help these families. We should \nhelp these DREAMers. It is an ancient and universal principle that we \nshould help the least among us. To paraphrase the Book of Matthew, we \nshould treat the least among us as we would treat the mightiest among \nus. That is why the U.S. Council of Catholic Bishops opposes the Ayotte \namendment. We should not hurt the least among us in order to help our \nveterans.\n  How much money would the Ayotte amendment deny to these children? The \nmaximum child tax credit is $1,000 per child, which is about $2.74 per \nday per child. To many of us, $2.74 per day seems like a small amount, \nbut to a child in poverty it is literally the difference between eating \nand not eating.\n  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2011 the average cost \nof one meal for one person was $2.67. That was the average cost, which \nmeans that a lot of people spent less than $2.67 on each meal. By way \nof comparison, SNAP benefits average about $4 per person per day--$4 \nfor three meals, not just one. So our own food program is less than \nwhat our own Bureau of Labor Statistics says is the average cost of a \nmeal.\n  So for a low-income child, the $2.74 per day she gets from the child \ntax credit is equivalent to about one meal. If a child is very poor, it \nprobably means two meals. Put simply, if she gets the child tax credit, \nshe eats. If she doesn't, she doesn't.\n  Of course, not every child receives the maximum refundable credit. \nThe amount of the refund is determined, in part, on a family's income, \nso poor families receive even less. The average income for the families \nwho would be affected by the Ayotte amendment is about $21,000 per \nyear. They have to be working and paying taxes to get even one dime \nfrom the child tax credit program. Their average child tax credit \nrefund is about $1,800, which is about $5 a day. That may not be much \nmoney to the Senators in this body, but that $5 pays for a meal for the \nwhole family. It is about 8 percent of their income.\n\n  We should not be denying this basic level of assistance to any child \nin this country, no matter who their parents are or how they came here. \nWe should not deny children this assistance when their parents--and I \nam going to repeat it--will pay over $160 billion in taxes in the 10 \nyears during which this provision is cutting $18 billion. The way the \nchild tax credit is structured, only working families who are paying \nthese kinds of taxes can claim the refundable portion. It is not fair \nthat families work and pay taxes but are then denied help--$2.74 per \nday per child.\n  We should not deny children this assistance under the guise of \ncombating fraud. Imposing a Social Security number requirement on \nqualifying children will not end the fraud the proponents of this \namendment have cited. We should go after the fraud, but it should\n\n[[Page S873]]\n\nbe obvious that any criminal willing to commit the fraud described by \nthe proponents will not be deterred by having to fill in a 9-digit \nSocial Security number. This does not solve the fraud problem.\n  The fraud we have heard about involves undocumented immigrants who \nare falsifying where they live and where their children live in order \nto claim their tax credit. We are told about four immigrants using a \nsingle address, and yet we hear nothing about the 18,000 corporations \nthat use one address in the Cayman Islands to avoid paying their fair \nshare of corporate tax. Instead of going after working families who are \npaying taxes, we should close the loophole that allows these \ncorporations to evade their taxes.\n  How many groups in this country is this Congress going to hurt? We \nhurt women when we don't raise the minimum wage. We hurt people who are \nout of work through no fault of their own when we don't extend \nunemployment benefits. Now we are hurting DREAMers. We should not do \nthis.

The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Remembering Willard Hackerman\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, there is an epitaph on the wall above \nwhere Sir Christopher Wren--one of England's greatest architects--is \nburied. The epitaph reads in part:\n\n       Here . . . lies . . . Christopher Wren, who lived beyond \n     ninety years, not for his own profit but for the public good. \n     Reader, if you seek his monument, look around you.\n\n  A similar epitaph would be entirely suitable for my dear friend, the \ngreat businessman, engineer, philanthropist, and devoted Baltimorean \nWillard Hackerman, who died yesterday at the age of 95.\n  In 1938, Willard was a 19-year-old civil engineer who had just \ngraduated from Johns Hopkins University. He went to work for the \nWhiting-Turner Contracting Company in his native Baltimore. G.W.C. \nWhiting and LeBaron Turner had started the construction firm in 1909. \nIn 1955, Whiting promoted Willard to be the president and chief \nexecutive officer of the firm, and he served in that capacity until his \nrecent death.\n  Whiting-Turner issued a press release which stated:\n\n       Mr. Hackerman led Whiting-Turner from a modest-sized local \n     and regional contractor to a highly-ranked nationwide \n     construction manager and general contractor working in all \n     major commercial, industrial, and institutional sectors.\n\n  Last year--Willard's 75th year with the firm--it reported $5 billion \nin revenue. The firm, which has 33 regional offices and more than 2,100 \nemployees, is ranked fourth in domestic general building by Engineering \nNews Record and ranked 117th on the list of America's largest private \ncompanies.\n  As the Baltimore Sun noted, Whiting-Turner Contracting Company built \nthe new University of Baltimore School of Law last year, the Joseph \nMeyerhoff Symphony Hall, the National Aquarium, and the M Bank \nStadium. The firm's clients included Yale and Stanford universities, \nthe Cleveland Clinic, Target, IBM, and Unilever, and the Hippodrome \nTheater. If you seek his monument, look around you.\n  Through Whiting-Turner, Willard teamed with then-mayor William Donald \nSchaefer to help transform Baltimore by building the Convention Center, \nHarborplace, and the Aquarium. These statistics and lists attest to \nWillard's incredible skills as an engineer and businessman, but they \ndon't begin to capture the magnitude of his accomplishments, his \ncharitable contributions, or his generous spirit.\n  Willard and his beloved wife Lillian have been lifelong supporters of \nJohns Hopkins University. He helped to reestablish the university's \nstand-alone engineering school in 1979, and secured the school-naming \ngift from the estate of his mentor, G.W.C. Whiting.\n  Other activities include funding the Willard and Lillian Hackerman \nChair in Radiation Oncology at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, \nconstruction of the Hackerman-Patz Patient and Family Pavilion, and the \nHackerman Research Laboratories at the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive \nCancer Center. He and his wife also provided major support for the \nRobert H. and Clarice Smith Building at the Wilmer Eye Institute.\n  In 1984, Willard and Lillian donated a mansion on Mount Vernon Place \nadjacent to the Walters Art Gallery to the city of Baltimore, which in \nturn entrusted the property to the gallery--now known as the Walters \nArt Museum--to house its collection of Asian art.\n  In December 2001, Mr. Hackerman gave the largest gift in the history \nof the Baltimore City Community College Foundation to establish the \nLillian and Willard Hackerman Student Emergency Loan Program, which \nprovides no-interest loans to BCCC students. If you seek his monument, \nlook around you.\n  Timothy Regan, the Whiting-Turner executive vice president who will \nsucceed Willard as the firm's third president in its 105-year history, \nnoted:\n\n       He is a legend for his good works, and the irony is that \n     most of his good works are not even known.\n\n  The Sun recounted a story Baltimore architect Adam Gross told about \naccompanying Willard through a newly completed project at the Bryn Mawr \nSchool. According to Mr. Gross, Willard asked the school's headmistress \nhow many women were graduating with engineering degrees. Then, a few \ndays later, he sent a sizable check to the school to provide \nscholarships for women in engineering. ``He was like that. He did deeds \nthat nobody knew about,'' Mr. Gross said.\n  Willard was a man of quiet strength who professionally and charitably \nenriched his beloved Baltimore. He was an active alumnus of Johns \nHopkins University who gave back to the school and its hospital in \ncountless ways. He was a humble man and rarely stood still to take \ncredit for his many successes because he had already begun to tackle \nthe next challenge. Despite being at the helm of one of the largest \ngeneral building companies in America, Willard never outgrew his city \nor his fellow citizens. The Meyerhoff, the National Aquarium, and M \nBank Stadium all stand as enduring monuments to a great man. His \nbenevolent legacy extended to the synagogue where my family and I \nworship, Beth Tfiloh Congregation, where he will be missed as a man of \ngreat faith. Willard Hackerman was a true son of Baltimore.\n  My thoughts and prayers go out to his wife Lillian, their daughter \nNancy, their son Steven Mordecai, their five grandchildren and 23 \ngreat-grandchildren, and his extended family at Whiting-Turner, all of \nwhom loved him deeply.\n  I encourage my fellow colleagues, my fellow Baltimoreans and \nMarylanders, and all Americans to celebrate Willard Hackerman ``who \nlived beyond ninety years, not for his own profit but for the public \ngood. If you seek his monument, look around you.''\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 10 minutes \nas if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I come to the floor week after week \nand talk about the President's health care\n\n[[Page S874]]\n\nlaw. As a physician who has practiced medicine in Wyoming for 25 years, \nI am here to give a doctor's second opinion about the law. As we \ncontinue to learn more and more and see more and more, I am concerned \nabout how the law affects my former patients, the doctors and nurses \nwho take care of those patients, and the taxpayers who, of course, have \nbeen impacted as well.\n  It has been clear for a long time that this health care law is not \nworking. It has been obvious from the beginning that this law would not \nwork out the way the Democrats had promised the American people it \nwould work out. Republicans had warned that it was a terrible idea, and \neven some Democrats have admitted this law has been a train wreck.\n  The Obama administration has been desperate to talk about anything \nbut the failure of the health care law, and they have been desperate to \nhide some of the biggest problems with the law. The President has \nunilaterally made one change after another--sometimes with, in my \nopinion, no legal authority to do so--and tried to do this in a way \nthat, perhaps, nobody would even notice.\n  Late yesterday the administration leaked word that it would delay \nagain the law's unpopular employer mandate. It was the second time the \nObama administration had changed the health care law in just a few \ndays.\n  On the front page of USA Today, above the fold: ``Health law faces \nnew delay.''\n  The Wall Street Journal: ``Health-Law Mandate Put Off Again.''\n  The Washington Post reported on modifications over the weekend. This \nis from Saturday: ``Administration to allow some changes to health-care \nplans.'' That article says:\n\n       The Obama administration has quietly reworked rules and \n     computer code for HealthCare.gov to try to stem an outpouring \n     of discontent--\n  ``an outpouring of discontent''--\n\n     by . . . Americans who have discovered that the health plans \n     they bought do not include their old doctors or allow them to \n     add new babies or spouses.\n\n  So the administration then sent out a 14-page memo to insurance \ncompanies with changes to how its Web site works and new rules for how \npeople can buy coverage.\n  The Washington Post article goes on to say:\n\n       The changes reflect recent work--still underway--to improve \n     the computer system for the marketplace, as well as fresh \n     thinking about the needs of people who are buying the \n     coverage.\n\n  ``Fresh thinking about the needs of people who are buying the \ncoverage''? Did the administration not think of these people before \nthey wrote all of these things? The Obama administration has been \nworking on this Web site for 4 years. Do they not talk to people and \nthink about people and lives? I know a lot of these folks who work for \nthe administration have gone right from college to graduate or law \nschool and then right into some cubicle on the administration's \npayroll. Do they have no clue about how the real world works?\n  It is worse than that. On Super Bowl Sunday, President Obama sat down \nfor an interview, and he was asked about the failure of his health care \nWeb site, healthcare.gov--the Web site. This is what he said:\n\n       It got fixed within a month and half, it was up and running \n     and now it's working the way it's supposed to.\n\n  I do not think many people around the country who have gone on this \nWeb site even today believe it is working the way it is supposed to.\n  The President was with Bill Clinton in September at the Clinton \nForum, and President Obama said: Easier to use than Amazon, cheaper to \nbuy than your cell phone bill. I assume the President actually believed \nthat. I assume the President believes it is working the way it is \nsupposed to today. But I think that is the reason the President's poll \nnumbers are so low--because the American people say the President is \nout of touch with what the American people are seeing in their own \nhomes and in their own communities, and the President in the White \nHouse has very little realization of what is happening in America. So \naccording to the President, healthcare.gov is now working the way it is \nsupposed to work.\n  Well, if that is true, why did we learn a week later that there are \nanother 14 pages of rules changes and changes to the Web site? Did the \nPresident not have a clue that they were even coming? Why do we learn \nnow that their work is ``still underway,'' trying to think about the \nneeds of people who have been forced to buy insurance through this Web \nsite?\n  Back in December the press gave President Obama the lie of the year \naward for his statement that if you like your health care plan, you can \nkeep it. Well, when the President says that his Web site is working the \nway it is supposed to, either he continues to be in denial or he has \nanother entry for this year's lie of the year.\n  On Sunday, Bob Schieffer on ``Face the Nation'' asked about the \nlatest rules changes. Those were the rules changes that were before \nSunday, not the ones that came out yesterday. The President has changed \nthese rules now over two dozen times.\n  Bob Schieffer said: ``Things just seem, in every day and every way, \nto be more confused.'' This is Bob Schieffer, who for years, as the \nface of ``Face the Nation,'' has become a trusted person whom people \nturn to. As he says in a reasonable way, things just seem, in every day \nand every way, to be more confused. He then asked: ``Is there any hope \nof getting it straightened out?'' That is what Bob Schieffer asked--\n``any hope of getting it straightened out?''\n  Well, the majority party whip was on the show. The Democratic Senator \nwas on the show, and instead of answering the question, he avoided it. \nHe tried to change the subject, and he repeated an old Democratic \ntalking point. This time that Senator claimed that ``10 million \nAmericans have health insurance today who would not have had it''--this \nis the Democratic Senator--without the President's law--not actually \nresponding to the question from Bob Schieffer about whether we can get \nthings straightened out--no, not at all, not answering whether there is \nany hope of getting the law straightened out, just the same old talking \npoints, and the talking points are not even true.\n  The Washington Post Fact Checker said the statement was so wrong, it \ndeserved four Pinocchios--the most you can get. Well, that is the \nhighest number possible--four Pinocchios. The Washington Post called \nthe Democratic Senator's claim ``simply ridiculous.''\n  The reality is that the overwhelming majority of the American people \nsigning up under the Obama health care law already had health \ninsurance, so they are actually not getting new insurance or are newly \ninsured because of the law. These are people who got cancellation \nletters and then said: Uh-oh, I need to get insurance. So then they \nwent to the Web site to buy something--often much more expensive, \nrequiring higher copays, higher deductibles. The law forced them to \nlose the coverage they had and the coverage that actually had worked \nfor them.\n  Many people are paying far more now than they were for worse \ncoverage, and it is not the right fit for their families. They are \noften paying for insurance which they are not going to use, do not \nwant, which is more than they would ever need, and they are paying more \nthan they ever had intended. That is what I hear when I talk to people \nin Wyoming. I was in Wyoming--in Cheyenne and Casper--this weekend. \nThat is what I hear at home. The administration does not want to talk \nabout that. Democrats in Washington do not want to talk about it at \nall. They just want to repeat their talking points even though they are \ncompletely false and have been proven to be false. Democrats want to \navoid the tough questions about how the law has failed. They rely on \ndenial and deception.\n\n  The Web site still is not working in spite of what the President may \nhave said on Super Bowl Sunday. The law is not working. The answer to \nthe question is, No, there is no hope of getting it straightened out. \nThe Web site problems we have seen are just the tip of the iceberg.\n  People are paying higher premiums. Coverages are canceled. People \ncannot keep their doctors. Fraud and identity theft are going to \ncontinue to be a plague of this health care Web site. People are paying \nhigher copays and deductibles.\n  It has been reported, interestingly enough, that in California, with \nthe so-\n\n[[Page S875]]\n\ncalled navigators--the people who are the certified navigators--over 40 \nof them are convicted criminals. Forty convicted criminals were hired \nand certified--certified--to be navigators in California in spite of \nthe fact that people are being asked to give personal information, \nhealth information, financial information to these navigators. So it is \nno surprise that we are going to continue to see issues of fraud and \nidentity theft.\n  Another interesting thing we learned recently: The Congressional \nBudget Office came out with its new estimates about the health care law \nand its effect on parts of the economy and on jobs. It also talked \nabout the number of people who do not have insurance. It said that in \nthe year 2024--10 years from now--there will be 31 million Americans \nwho will be uninsured: Ten years from now, 31 million Americans \nuninsured.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for an additional 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Let's think about the speech the President gave in \n2009. He came to Congress. He wanted to talk about health care reform. \nHe talked about why it was so urgent that the Congress pass health care \nreform. He said: ``There are now more than 30 million American citizens \nwho cannot get coverage.'' So in 2009 the President said 30 million \nAmericans could not get coverage.\n  The Congressional Budget Office just comes out and says: Ten years in \nthe future--15 years after the President gives his speech--31 million \nAmericans with no insurance. Yet we will have spent trillions of \ndollars, and yet it will not fix so big of a problem that we know we \nneed to deal with--health care in America--and this present law, this \nenormous law, this 2,700-page law, has completely failed to deal with \nthe reason the President said we had to deal with this in 2009. Fifteen \nyears later, the same numbers--30 million; over 30 million in 2024. How \nis that a victory for uninsured Americans? How can the President say \nthis law has succeeded? How is it a sign that the health care law is \nworking in the way it is supposed to work?\n  On top of that, middle-class people all across the country are paying \nmore because of the health care law. Their premiums have gone up. Their \ndeductibles have gone up. Their copayments have gone up. Millions of \nhard-working Americans have had their insurance policies canceled \nbecause of the law. And the administration is still working on the Web \nsite, in spite of what the President may say about it.\n  The President says it is working as it is supposed to. On this and so \nmany issues, the President continues to be wrong, and the American \npeople see it. The Web site is not working. The health care law clearly \nis not working. It is not working the way he promised. It is not \nworking the way the American people need health care to work for them \nin this country.\n  It is time for the administration to stop sneaking out these changes \nunder the cover of darkness, in blog posts. If the President is going \nto make a change, why doesn't he come and tell the American people what \nhe is going to do?\n  It is time for the Democrats to stop the four-Pinocchio talking \npoints. It is time for folks to be honest about the failings of the \nhealth care law. It is time to eliminate this terrible health care law \nand replace it with real reform that gives people better access to \nquality, affordable health care--the care they need, from a doctor they \nchoose, at lower cost.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, we have reached a historic moment in the \nhistory of our Republic when the President of the United States claims \nthe unilateral power to waive, delay, or just simply ignore the law of \nthe land.\n  One of the most frequent questions I get back home in Texas is, How \ncan the President do that? How can he do that? They remember when he \nwas sworn in and put his hand on the Bible and swore to uphold the \nConstitution and laws of the United States, and now how can he simply \nignore what those laws are? How can that contradiction exist?\n  Usually what I find myself doing is saying: Well, Congress has the \nauthority to pass the laws, and it is the executive branch--the \nPresident--that has the authority to enforce the law. That is why he \nhas the authority to appoint the head of the Department of Justice, the \nAttorney General of the United States, Attorney General Eric Holder.\n  But when the President and, by extension, his own Department of \nJustice refuse to enforce the law of the land, what have we become? \nWell, we certainly cannot claim in good conscience to believe in the \nrule of law, where the law applies to all of us no matter whether you \nare the President of the United States or you are the most humble of \nour citizens. That is the promise over the top of the Supreme Court of \nthe United States. All you have to do is look out the window here. It \nsays: Equal Justice Under The Law.\n  Quite simply, the President has no legal authority under our \nConstitution or under any law in America to pick and choose which laws \nhe is going to enforce or not enforce based on political expediency. \nAnd the fact that he claimed to do so again, for perhaps the two-\ndozenth time, does not change anything.\n  So my constituents at home ask me--they say: Well, Senator Cornyn, \nwhat are you going to do about it? I said: Well, I am going to support \nprivate litigation to challenge the President. Indeed, that is the \nnature of the litigation that originally challenged the Affordable Care \nAct, or ObamaCare. There was private litigation that challenged the \nPresident's claimed authority to make a recess appointment and bypass \nthe advice and consent function in the Constitution for the Congress to \nthe National Labor Relations Board, which has now been held \nunconstitutional by the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, and now the \nSupreme Court of the United States is considering an appeal from that \ncourt.\n  So there is a way to challenge the President, although it takes time \nand it is not exactly very satisfying because people say: Well, months, \nif not years, will go by before we will ultimately get a decision. But \njust think about the implications of what the President is doing. How \nwould our Democratic friends feel if a Republican President decided not \nto enforce certain laws--let's say as they pertained to the \nenvironment?\n  They would be outraged. You know what. They would be right; it is \nwrong. I do not care whether you are a Democratic President or you are \na Republican President or an Independent or whatever. It is wrong for \nthe President to put his hand on the Bible, to take an oath to uphold \nthe law of the land and then refuse to do so and to have no \nembarrassment, no sense of regret, but just the hubris and the \narrogance to say: I am going to do it until somebody stops me.\n  I have said it before, and I will say it again. The issues here go \nfar beyond the health care policy and ObamaCare. Checks and balances \nare not optional. They are the very fundamental structure of our \nConstitution. James Madison and the authors of the Federalist Papers, \nwho wrote so eloquently about the new Constitution, at the time said \nthat the concentration of power in a single branch of government is the \nvery definition of tyranny. If the Obama administration continues to \nundermine checks and balances, it will not only undermine respect for \nthe rule of law but also will create even greater distrust of the \nFederal Government and Congress itself, not to mention the office of \nthe Presidency.\n  Make no mistake. We all understand why the President is going down \nthis path. It is because ObamaCare has proved to be even more \nunworkable than its biggest critics might have imagined. The entire law \nneeds--well, we need a do over. Let me put it that way. This side of \nthe aisle has repeatedly encouraged the President and his allies to \nwork with us to try to replace ObamaCare with patient-centered reforms \nwhich would bring down the cost and make sure that we as patients and \nour families get to make decisions in consultation with our family, and \nnot outsource those to the Federal Government.\n  We could come up with some ideas, and we actually have ideas that \nwould lower costs, expand coverage, and improve access to care. \nUnfortunately, the President has shown zero intention in addressing \nthose. I know I heard him say, even at the latest State of the\n\n[[Page S876]]\n\nUnion: If my Republican friends have some good ideas, bring them to me.\n  We have been bringing them to him since 2009 and he simply has \nignored or affirmatively rejected any other idea because he is so wed \nto this signature piece of legislation. I cannot help but think that \none reason why the President claimed the authority to unilaterally \nwaive the employer mandates until after the election is because he is \nfocused on--you guessed it--the November elections, and he realizes \nwhat an albatross this is around the necks of those people who are \ngoing to be going to the voters and asking for them to reelect them.\n  But if he is wondering why Americans have grown so cynical about \nWashington, DC, all he needs to do is to look at his own \nadministration's handling of this signature piece of legislation, a \nprogram that has come to symbolize big government overreach, and--I \nhate to say it, but it is true--contempt for the rule of law.\n  I want to say just a few more words in conclusion about America's \nfiscal health. As you know, Members of Congress have once again been \nasked to raise the debt ceiling, even though the national debt is in \nexcess of $17 trillion. The President likes to boast about short-term \ndeficit reduction. That is the difference between what the government \nbrings in on an annual basis and what it spends.\n  It is true that on an annual basis the last couple of years the \nnumber has gone down a little bit, primarily because the President \nraised taxes by $1.7 trillion, coupled together with the caps on \ndiscretionary spending in the Budget Control Act. But the long-term \ntrajectory remains just as bad as it ever was, and America continues to \nspend money that it does not have.\n  We are waiting for the President. He is the Commander in Chief. He is \nthe leader of the free world. We are waiting for the President to put \nout a serious plan to address this problem. Many of us held out hope in \nDecember 2010 when the Simpson-Bowles bipartisan fiscal commission got \ntogether and made some bipartisan recommendations for doing exactly \nthat. Unfortunately, they were ignored by the President. He demanded, \nin exchange for the so-called ``grand bargain'' that he wanted $1 \ntrillion more in revenue, more taxes.\n  Imagine what a body slam that would have been to the American \neconomy. The American economy is still so weak that unemployment is at \na historic high, particularly compared to recoveries following \nrecessions. But $1 trillion of additional taxes would have been \ncatastrophic in terms of people looking for work and not being able to \nfind work.\n  But since the President took office in 2009, our national debt has \nincreased by $6.6 trillion. It is now larger than our entire economy. I \nwonder who the President thinks will have to pay that back. Probably \nnot our generation; we will not be around. But this generation will be \naround. They will be left holding the bag as a result of our \nirresponsibility and unwillingness to deal with this important problem.\n  Even though interest rates are at a very low point now, and, yes, the \ninterest we have to pay the Chinese government and our other creditors \nis at a relatively low rate, imagine what will happen, as the \nCongressional Budget Office has, when interest rates start to tick back \nup to their historic norms. We will see that more and more of the tax \ndollars of the American people are used to pay interest on the debt. \nWhether you are concerned about safety net programs that our most \nvulnerable citizens need or our national security, we will not be able \nto do either the way we want to and need to.\n  According to the CBO's baseline projections, the annual deficit will \nsteadily rise after 2015 and exceed $1 trillion in 2022, at which time \nthe Federal Government will be spending $755 billion a year on net \ninterest payments alone. To put that in another perspective, net \ninterest payments in 2014 are estimated to be $233 billion. That is not \nmoney that helps the most vulnerable in our society. That is not money \nthat helps the warfighter keep us safe. That is money we are paying on \nthe debt to our creditors, to the Chinese and other creditor nations as \ninterest for all of this money we are borrowing that eventually \nsomebody some day is going to have to pay back.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has consistently reminded us that \neven a small change in U.S. economic growth or interest rates or \ninflation could dramatically affect the Federal budget outlook. In \nfact, if interest rates were to rise just 1 percentage point above the \nCBO baseline each year over the next decade, our cumulative deficit \nwill increase by $1.5 trillion. That shows you how fragile the \ncondition of our fiscal house is.\n  On multiple occasions back in the mid 1990s, this Chamber came within \none vote--one vote--of passing a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution. Since the vote in March of 1997, our national debt has \ngone from $5.3 trillion to $17.2 trillion. It has more than tripled. \nYet even as the debt problem has gotten massively worse, the number of \nfolks on the other side of the aisle who are willing to acknowledge \nthat we cannot continue to spend money that we do not have and that the \ndebt is a threat to our national security and our ability to do the \nthings we know we want to do and need to do, continue to seem to ignore \nit.\n  I am proud to say that everyone on this side of the aisle has \ncosponsored a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution that would \nforce Washington, whether led by Democrats or Republicans--it would \nforce Washington to live within our means and meet the same type of \nfiscal requirements that virtually all State governments have to meet.\n  To those who think that a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution is not the answer, I ask: Where is your plan? I realize \nthat there are some who think that we can raise taxes. Let's raise \ntaxes some more. But even they must understand that we simply cannot \ntax away our long-term debt problem. The only way we can solve that is \nby controlling our spending and reforming our programs like Social \nSecurity and Medicare. Sooner or later, even the President will have to \nacknowledge that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about S. 1963, which \nis supported by well over 30 veterans organizations. I want to thank my \ncolleagues for their help and their support of the military retirement \npay restoration bill that repeals section 403 of the budget agreement, \nwhich unfairly singled out our brave men and women in uniform.\n  I could spend a long time here, but I do not intend to because I know \nwe have other colleagues who are on the way to speak. But I do want to \nthank my colleagues for their support. We got a huge vote the other \nnight to move to this measure. I do not think there were any dissenting \nvotes. I appreciate my colleagues voting to move to it.\n  The bottom line is this bill is about honoring the commitments we \nhave made to our servicemembers. My State is the home of nearly 255,000 \nveterans--255,000 veterans. We only have a population of 3 million. So \nif you do the math, per capita we have a lot of veterans in my State--a \nvery patriotic State. These brave men and women have put their lives on \nthe line, and they have also put their lives on hold to serve their \ncountry, oftentimes in faraway places, far away from their homes and \ntheir families and from their beloved country to protect our Nation and \ndefend our way of life.\n  They have fulfilled their obligations, and we need to fulfill ours. \nDay after day we get emails and letters and phone calls from Arkansas \nveterans and their families. They talk about what the Senate is talking \nabout today; that is, whether we should fix this cost of living \nadjustment or not and even down to the details of whether we should pay \nfor this or not.\n  Let me just read a few. I have eight Arkansans here who have written \nin recent weeks.\n  MAJ Adam Smith of Sherwood said:\n\n       When I signed on twelve years ago, I swore an oath to \n     defend my country, one that I have upheld through four combat \n     deployments in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Horn of Africa. It \n     pains me to see that my government is not keeping its faith \n     in my oath. I have served and will continue to serve \n     faithfully, but I want my government to properly compensate \n     me for all the times I nearly made my wife a young widow.\n\n  The second one is from Therese Wikoff of North Little Rock. She is an \nemployee of the VA, and she is married to someone in the military. She \nsays:\n\n\n[[Page S877]]\n\n\n       I see [our veterans] every day struggling. They served and \n     it is our duty to respect and take care of them.\n\n  John Barnwell of Fort Smith says:\n\n       I spent a career in the U.S. Air Force defending this great \n     country from all enemies . . . How could [Congress] even \n     consider cutting veterans benefits when our sacrifices are \n     the reason we are even able to live in a free country?\n\n  SMSgt John W. Smith of Cabot writes:\n\n       I served my country for 28 years with the promise that once \n     I completed my part, I would be given a retirement for the \n     rest of my life to include the cost of living increases. \n     However, it appears the government has decided to change the \n     promise made and not honor their part of the bargain.\n\n  Sam Garland of Jacksonville says:\n\n       When I enlisted I was told if I did my time that I would \n     receive retirement . . . [Don't take away] this hard worked \n     promise.\n\n  Marshall Harmon of Vilonia wrote:\n\n       This is a military retirement that I worked extremely hard \n     for and in fact earned! The documents I was provided at the \n     time of retirement assured me that my buying power would \n     remain strong and consistent . . . It seems that is just not \n     the case.\n\n  Chadwick Cagle of Sherwood wrote to say:\n\n       I am a military veteran of almost 15 years, including two \n     deployments to Iraq. I was an Infantryman in the Marine Corps \n     . . . I find it very frustrating that the reductions in \n     benefits were taken from the very men and women who have \n     served and protected this country.\n\n  The next will be the last one. I could go on for a long time. As \npeople can tell, I have a lot more where these came from.\n  Bill Patrick of Mountain Home says:\n\n       As a veteran of the U.S. Army, I am saddened by the \n     provision in this bill that in essence penalizes those that \n     have given the most for this great country of ours. Although \n     I do realize the importance of keeping the government funded \n     and running, I am opposed to the fact that we are doing it on \n     the backs of those who have served honorably, and long.\n\n  I want those words to sink in for my colleagues in the Senate today. \nThese are men and women from my State. The Senators have the same types \nof folks in their States. They put on the uniform and they serve our \ncountry. This is not how we should repay them.\n  I know that on this floor and out in press conferences and in press \nreleases and all of that, people say: Well, we need to pay for this.\n  This bill, S. 1963, has no pay-for. The way I feel about it is this \ncut to their benefits, this cut in their COLA, the 1 percent adjusted \ndownward, doesn't take effect until 2015. We have all of this year to \nfind a pay-for if that is what we decide we are going to do.\n  But the way I feel about this is they have already paid. They have \npaid for this with their service. This was something that was added to \na budget deal, and it is something I think probably came in and was put \nin by the House Republicans. In effect, we are trying to solve this \nproblem for them.\n  But, regardless, I have a list that I did not fabricate for this \nspeech. This stands in my office in Washington every day. I have a \nsimilar poster identical to this poster in Little Rock. It is there \nevery day in our lobby, in our entryway for anyone and everyone who \ncomes to the office to see the sacrifice that Arkansans have made to \nthis country. These men and women--there are over 100 listed.\n  As much as I hate to say it, this list grows all the time. We change \nthis list out frequently. There are over 100 listed. In fact, there are \nover 110 listed. These are troops from Arkansas or based in Arkansas \nwho paid the ultimate sacrifice in Iraq and Afghanistan. These people \npaid for this benefit.\n  All of the veterans who will receive this benefit were in the exact \nsame situation that these men and women were, but by the grace of God \nthey made it home. We need to honor the commitments we have made to our \nveterans.\n  This is no laughing matter. This isn't politics, this isn't a \nDemocratic thing or a Republican thing, this is an American thing.\n  Do you know what. When we make commitments to our veterans, if we \ncannot honor those commitments, we never should have made them in the \nfirst place.\n  I know a lot of people in Washington make all kinds of promises, but \nwe have made these commitments to our veterans. Some of them mentioned \nwhen they signed on in the very beginning or when they take their \nretirement in the very end, it is very clear the type of retirement \nbenefits they will get. Just because it is hard now, because it is \nexpensive, doesn't mean we back out on the commitments we have made to \nour men and women in uniform. We don't back out on the commitments we \nhave made to our veterans.\n  But now what we have is we have people in Washington who are saying: \nWe like our veterans, but they need to pay for this. They need to pay \nfor this. I disagree. We have all this year. If we make that decision \nlater to find a way to pay for this change, we have time to find the \npay-for later.\n  I am always reminded when I think of our folks who served this Nation \nin the military, of this one verse that is found in John 15:13. It \nsays: ``Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his \nlife for his friends.''\n  I have been to a number of funerals, and I have made a number of \ncalls to these families. I don't know how many people I have talked to \nwho have lost a loved one in Iraq or Afghanistan--or in some other \nmilitary operation somehow, some way--and that is the verse I always \nremember because they laid down their lives for their country.\n  Everyone else who puts on that uniform, by the very nature of them \nputting on that uniform, has made the commitment that they are willing \nto lay down their lives too. They are in harm's way for us.\n  I think it is wrong for us to try to lower their benefits. I think it \nis wrong for us to be having a debate about finding a way to pay for \nthis. We have time to pay for this over the course of this year. I am \ntotally open to talking to people about how to pay for this as we go.\n  But let's, for crying out loud, not send the message to our men and \nwomen in uniform, to our veterans, that we are going to balance the \nbudget on their backs. They are the ones who have made the commitment. \nThey are the ones who have traveled and served overseas.\n  When it comes to government spending--I just heard a couple of \nspeeches by my friends on the other side of the aisle--everybody who is \npaying attention knows we can cut unnecessary government programs. We \ncan eliminate duplicative policies. We can do good in the regulatory \nworld to make government more efficient, more effective. We can do \nthat, but we should not use these folks to balance our budget.\n  I see my colleague from Florida has stepped in. I know he would like \nto say a few words.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. I am here to support Senator Pryor's bill. I am a \ncosponsor. We were about to have a press conference, and the bottom \nline is there is no way to fully repay someone who puts their life on \nthe line for our country, but we can do what we can, and this \nlegislation ensures that we continue to do all we can. That is a \nsummary of the whole thing.\n  I have the privilege of being a senior member of the Armed Services \nCommittee, and from day one one of the things we recognize is that we \nwant to keep our promises to the men and women of our military. The \nstrength of the military will always be the people, and they commit \ntheir lives to the service of the country. During that commitment there \nis a lot of sacrifice: overseas deployments, they miss births, \nbirthdays, and countless other hardships.\n  A retiree has spent years earning the benefits they looked forward to \nand those were some of the reasons they made the sacrifices when they \ntook the oath of office and put on the uniform.\n  When that servicemember joins the military, they look at the \nretirement system in place at the time, and they began to build their \nlife and their plans around those specific retirement benefits. Those \nwho choose to devote long years and the retirement period of 20 years \nof service--and then happen to retire and pursue a second career--it \ngives them the flexibility to move back to a location where they can \nhelp out a family member or finally become a full-time part of a family \nbusiness, whatever it is. Those folks shouldn't be penalized because \nthey are not yet 62 years old. They have already done 20 years of \nservice, if not more.\n  They are choosing to innovate to serve their community or to finally\n\n[[Page S878]]\n\nstart that small business they had always dreamed about, and so it is \nunfair to penalize them when others are not. Why in the world would we \nwant to make a difference between those who had retired from the \nmilitary?\n  So safeguarding the benefits servicemembers have earned not only \nprotects the all-volunteer force, but it also attracts and will \ncontinue to attract the best talent and encourage somebody to make the \nmilitary a career. For the career soldier, sailor, airman or marine, \nwhat they give back over those 20-plus years is immeasurable.\n  We have bipartisan agreement that restricting military benefits in \nthis way is not the correct path to address defense cuts and the debt. \nWe must restore this full cost-of-living adjustment for military \nretirees.\n  With that vote yesterday, zero against it, why are we out here having \nto spend all this time? Why don't we just take it up and pass it, \nbecause the votes are obviously here. I am hoping that is what the \nSenate is going to do in the next few hours.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I come to the floor to talk about an amendment I have \npending to the bill pending on the floor to fix the unfair cuts to our \nmilitary retirees.\n  Let me remind everyone of how we got to this point. It was right \nbefore the holidays and there was a budget agreement that was reached \nbetween the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee and the chairman of \nthe House Budget Committee.\n  Let me remind everyone in this Chamber that I serve on the Senate \nBudget Committee. No one on the Senate Budget Committee--at least \nmyself, I wasn't included, I guess I missed it--brought to our \nattention the budget agreement before it was brought as a fait accompli \nto the floor, and that is one of the problems that brought us to where \nwe are today. Only in Washington could you serve on the actual Budget \nCommittee, they come up with a budget agreement and actually never show \nit to you--even though you are on the Budget Committee.\n  Had they shown it to me in advance, I can tell you what I would have \ntold them, that this idea to single out our military retirees is \ntotally unfair. It is the wrong priority for America to single out \nthose who have taken the bullets for us when, if we look at the changes \nthat were made in the budget agreement to the contributions for Federal \nemployees, they were prospective. Only new hires had to pay additional \ncontributions.\n  But for our men and women in uniform, those working-age retirees \nunder 62--and originally our wounded warriors were included in that as \nwell--took the cut. So when I did find out about it--and I see my \ncolleague from South Carolina, who also serves on the Senate Budget \nCommittee, is here--when we and others found out about it--also my \ncolleague Senator Wicker from Mississippi--we pointed out from the \nbeginning, before this body even voted on the budget agreement, that \nthe cuts to military retirees were unfair; that of all the people we \nwere going to single out, why would we single out the people who have \ntaken the bullets for us? What kind of message does that send to those \nwho have served us and sacrificed so much for our country?\n\n  So I remember it. We came down here before Christmas, before the \nholidays. Senator Graham, my colleague from South Carolina, came down \nhere, Senator Wicker from Mississippi, and we said to our colleagues \nthen: Let's fix this. Let's fix this unfair cut now before we actually \npass this budget into law, because we have time to do it. Do you know \nthe response we got? We are in a rush. We have to get home to our \nfamilies before the holidays, rather than fix what was wrong from the \nbeginning.\n  Right now I hear so many of our colleagues coming to the floor and \nsaying: We have to fix this, even though they voted for this budget \nagreement.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Yes, I yield for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Chair.\n  Does the Senator agree with me, if the budget deal had not been paid \nfor it would never have passed?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I would agree with that.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Most Republicans, and I am sure some Democrats, would not \nhave voted for a budget deal unless it was deficit-neutral and paid \nfor. I know it wouldn't have passed the House. So now, after the fact, \nif you fix the COLA problem without paying for it, haven't you \nbasically blown the budget deal apart?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Well, that is the irony of where we find ourselves. We \nhave people who came to the floor, even though we warned them and said \nthis is really unfair, why are we doing this to military retirees, we \nshould fix this now and we can find other ways to cut spending--\n  Mr. GRAHAM. And their response was: We can fix it later. Our response \nwas: Well, will you pay for it later? And everybody said yes.\n  So here we are. I appreciate Senator Pryor and Senator Hagan from \nNorth Carolina wanting to fix it. The good news is everyone in the body \nwants to undo the damage done to our military retirees. That is the \ngood news. The bad news is we are doing it in a fashion that would \nbreak the budget agreement, and I don't think that should be our \nchoice.\n  In order to right a wrong done to the military retirement community--\nwhich was a $6 billion taking from them, unlike anybody else in the \ncountry--can we not find $6 billion over the next 10 years to make up \nfor it? Because if we don't, we have broken the budget agreement and \nput a burden on the next generation. So, really, to help the military \nretiree, do you have to turn around and screw future generations by \nadding $6 billion of debt on top of the $16 trillion? I guess that is \nthe question. And I would say no. That is why I appreciate the \nSenator's offset.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. The answer is no. Of course we don't. We don't have to \nburden the next generation to fix what we should have fixed from the \nbeginning, which was unfair from the beginning. That said, I have an \noffset----\n  Mr. GRAHAM. What is the Senator proposing here?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I have an offset that is pretty straightforward. We have \ntwo major refundable tax credits in our Tax Code, the earned income tax \ncredit and the additional child tax credit, both of which, when you \nclaim them, you actually get money back under the Tax Code. My \namendment is pretty straightforward. When you file for the earned \nincome tax credit, you actually have to put a Social Security number \nwhen you file for it as the tax filer. Also, if you have a dependent, \nyou have to put a Social Security number. For the additional child tax \ncredit, there was a Treasury IG report done under this administration \nin 2011 and it raised real concerns about the way this tax refund was \nbeing administered, because when you filed for it, you didn't have to \nput a Social Security number. Also, for any child for whom you were \nseeking a refund, you didn't have to put a Social Security number.\n  My fix is very straightforward: All I am asking is, if you want to \nseek that tax refund for your child, you list a Social Security number \nfor the child. Why is that important? It is important because the \nTreasury IG found with this tax refund billions and billions of dollars \ngoing out the door. In fact, with the amendment I just mentioned, we \ncan save $20 billion over the next 10 years.\n  There were investigations done of this tax refund, and guess what \nthey found. Massive examples of fraud, which I will go through in \ndetail, of people claiming kids who may not even live in this country; \nof people claiming kids who might live in Mexico, because there are \nabsolutely no parameters on the way this is being interpreted right \nnow.\n  So here is the question: Should we fix fraud in our Tax Code and \nreally address this issue, still allowing American children and \nchildren who the President has said are eligible--certain DREAMer \nchildren--to get this tax refund--real children in this country--or \nshould we let this fraud continue and also add to our debt and not \naddress the underlying problems facing our Nation?\n  I don't understand why we can't pass something commonsense like this.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Let me see if I have this right. There is an earned \nincome\n\n[[Page S879]]\n\ntax credit you can receive based on need; is that right?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Exactly.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. We are not going to get it. You are not going to get it \nfor your kids because you make too much money.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Right.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I think this is a Ronald Reagan idea. If you are working, \neven though you may not have any income tax liability, we are going to \ngive you an earned income tax credit. I think it is $500 per child; is \nthat right?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. This is the earned income we are talking about.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes, I know. But under the earned income tax credit----\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I don't know the amount.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I think it is $500. But the point is, do you have to have \na Social Security number?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Ok. If the argument is that by adding a Social Security \nnumber requirement to the additional credit you are somehow burdening \npeople, why isn't that an argument made against the EITC? Because to \nget the earned income tax credit you have to have a Social Security \nnumber.\n  This new additional tax credit, on top of the earned income tax \ncredit, doesn't have the same requirements. So those who come to the \nfloor to say we are destroying families, why wouldn't you come down \nhere and propose to do away with the Social Security number on the \nearned income tax credit? That would make perfect sense to me.\n  If requiring a Social Security number is a bad thing for families, \nwhy do you tolerate it for the EITC? The reason you wouldn't propose \nthat change is because people in Treasury would say you would be crazy, \nbecause now you have an additional tax credit, something new on top of \nthe EITC, that Senator Ayotte has found without a Social Security \nnumber you have $19 billion in fraud.\n  So I am curious. If you think requiring a Social Security number for \na child to get an additional tax credit is destroying the family, why \ndon't you come down here and suggest changing the law for the EITC? If \nyou did that, you would get blistered by the auditor saying you are \nopening a new line of fraud.\n  So could the Senator tell us what would happen to the American \ntaxpayer, what benefit would inure to the American taxpayer if we \nfollowed the Senator's proposal and accepted her amendment of requiring \na Social Security number?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. The American taxpayer would save $20 billion over the \nnext 10 years. This is about protecting the American taxpayer. Let me \ntalk about some of the fraud that was found.\n  In Indiana, they found 4 workers were claiming 20 children living \ninside 1 residence. The IRS sent these illegal immigrants tax refunds \nof a total of $29,000-plus. They also found many people were claiming \nthe tax credit for kids who live in Mexico. These are our taxpayer \ndollars going out the door in this way.\n  An Indiana tax preparer, who acted as a whistleblower, said: We have \nseen sometimes 10 or 12 dependents, most times nieces and nephews, on \nthese tax forms. The more you put on there, the more you get back, even \nthough they are not verifying that any of these children live here or \nexist. That is our tax money going out the door. The whistleblower had \nthousands of examples.\n  Another example from a whistleblower: We have over $10,000 in refunds \nfor nine nieces and nephews, he said. It is so easy. I can bring out \nstacks and stacks. It is so easy, it is ridiculous.\n  In North Carolina, investigators tied at least 17 tax returns \ntotaling more than $62,000 in returns to a Charlotte, NC, apartment \nthat 1 woman leased. At another apartment nearby, investigators \ndiscovered 153 returns valued at over $700,000 in refunds. Another \naddress in the same apartment complex had 236 returns worth over $1 \nmillion in returns.\n  This is money taken into our treasury and turned back in. All I am \nsaying with this amendment is if you can put a Social Security number \nfor the child you are claiming the credit for, you can get this credit. \nThat is all this is, making this consistent with the earned income tax \ncredit. And in fact, the filer can be an undocumented worker in this \ncountry and have a child who legitimately has a Social Security number \nand get the credit for it. So I have modified my amendment to address \nthat issue.\n  What I am saying is this: Let us end fraud and let us take that money \nthat is being taken from the American taxpayer--$20 billion--and take \n$6 billion of it to be used to restore these military cuts. This will \nmake sure we do not burden the next generation and we fix a wrong that \nshould be righted.\n  Let me talk about some other examples of what we have seen. In \nTennessee, a search warrant was prepared by the IRS for a tax company \nthat was encouraging undocumented workers to lie on their tax returns \nby claiming children who live in Mexico as dependents. Why can this tax \npreparer even encourage that? Because right now, when the refund for \nthe additional child tax credit is filed for, you don't have to put \nanything about the child to prove the child even exists. So simply \nrequiring a Social Security number for the child you are getting money \nback for would end that fraud.\n  The IRS says the Tennessee tax preparer has filed 6,000 tax returns \nover the last 3 years, and although his--listen to this--although his \nclients only paid $3.3 million in taxes, they were able to receive back \n$17 million in refunds. Imagine that: $3.3 million in taxes his clients \nas a whole claim they have paid, and they received $17 million in \nrefunds back. Pretty good deal, isn't it. Well, it is a bad deal for \nthe American taxpayer.\n  This amendment makes so much common sense I just hope I can get a \nvote on it on the floor of the Senate. In the past, when I have tried \nto bring this amendment forward, I have been denied a vote on many \noccasions.\n  I hope the people of this country understand what the vote on the \nfloor is. The vote on the floor is straightforward. This amendment \nfixes the unfair cuts to our military retirees and ensures we aren't \nbreaking the budget agreement that was just passed or burdening the \nnext generation with debt. In fact, my amendment will further reduce \nthe debt because it saves more money than just paying for this fix. We \ncan also fix this tax fraud and do the right thing by the American \ntaxpayer.\n  What worries me most is that because this is Washington, and this \nmakes so much sense, I fear I won't get a vote and that my colleagues \nwill use excuses to say: We shouldn't vote for this because--as I heard \nmy colleague from Illinois on the floor this morning saying--we are \ngoing to harm children. Well, children will still be able to get this \nrefund. Put a Social Security number down and American children will \nget this refund. Also children the President has already deemed \neligible--so-called DREAMers. In fact, my colleague from Illinois who \ncame to the floor this morning admitted already \\1/2\\ million of them \nhave filed for a Social Security number, and they too could receive \nthis tax refund.\n  If we don't pass this amendment, there are two groups that lose: the \nveterans, but also, most importantly, all of us--the American taxpayer.\n  Before I conclude, I wanted to mention the groups endorsing my \namendment: the American Legion, American Veterans--AMVETs--Concerned \nVeterans for America, the Military Officers Association of America, the \nNational Guard Association of the United States, the National Military \nFamily Association, the Naval Enlisted Reserve Association, the Retired \nEnlisted Association, the U.S. Army Warrant Officers Association, the \nU.S. Coast Guard Chief Petty Officers Association, and the U.S. Coast \nGuard Enlisted Association.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote for this commonsense amendment, so we \ncan fix this unfair cut to our military retirees and pay for it and \nmake sure we aren't also adding to our debt and burdening future \ngenerations.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to yield to the \nmajority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I would say to my friend from South \nCarolina that we have received some disturbing news today; that is, the \nPresident of Afghanistan, President Karzai, has made a decision to \nrelease 65 of the 88 detainees at Parwan prison in Afghanistan.\n  The Senator from South Carolina and I have known the President of \nAfghanistan for many years. We have had many meetings with the \nPresident of Afghanistan, and I believe we had established a rather \ncordial relationship over these last 13 years.\n  Many of my colleagues may not know that the Senator from South \nCarolina, in his capacity as a Colonel in the U.S. Air Force Reserve, a \nlawyer, has spent a great deal of his active-duty time in Afghanistan \non Active Duty primarily focusing on the whole issue of detainees, how \nthey are tried, how they are incarcerated, and steps for release and \ndetention. In other words, there is no one that I know who has more \nindepth knowledge of this issue than the Senator from South Carolina. I \ndon't believe anybody has ever worked as hard as he has on this issue, \nand there have been significant accomplishments as a result of his and \nother wonderful Americans' work.\n  I think facts are stubborn things; and I would ask my friend from \nSouth Carolina, isn't it true the release of these detainees poses a \ndirect threat to the lives of our service men and women who are serving \nin Afghanistan? Is it true that 25 of these individuals are linked to \nthe production and/or emplacement of IEDs; that 33 tested positive for \nexplosive residue when processed after capture; that 40 percent are \nassociated with direct attacks, killing or wounding 57 Afghan citizens \nand allied forces; that 30 percent are associated with direct attacks, \nkilling or wounding 60 U.S. or coalition force members; that 32 were \ncaptured after the ANSF assumed responsibility?\n  So isn't it clear, I ask my colleague, after all these years of work \ntrying to get this whole system of detainees and trials and \nincarceration, that we are now seeing--sadly--this result of \nindividuals who can be traced to attacks on or directly responsible for \nthe deaths of brave Americans?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Senator McCain is absolutely right.\n  I thank him for showing such an interest in this topic. He has been \nso helpful in making sure we get this detention issue right. Having \nbeen incarcerated in a war, I think Senator McCain knows the difference \nbetween a system that works and one that doesn't. It has always been \nhelpful to have Senator McCain travel with me and make a point to the \nAfghans that he knows what doesn't work.\n  General Dunford called this morning with a lot of sadness and, quite \nfrankly, anger in his voice. We have captured thousands of Afghans and \nsome third-country nationals during the 12-year war in Afghanistan. Our \nconfinement facility at Bagram Air Base has improved a thousand \npercent. We have made our fair share of mistakes, but the prison now \ncalled Parwan I would put up against any prison in West Virginia, South \nCarolina or Arizona. It is a state-of-the-art prison. It is being \ntransferred over to the Afghans.\n  As we take this prisoner population and turn it over to the Afghans \nwith a collaborative process where we work together to determine what \nforce to take, they have what is called an Accountability Review Board, \nwhich is an Afghan board looking at the disposition of this prison \npopulation. They were about ready to release about 88 about whom our \ncommander felt the evidence in question deserved criminal court \ndisposition.\n  The Afghan criminal court at the prison, which is attached right to \nthe prison--the JSAF--has heard 6,000 cases with a 70-percent \nconviction rate. I am very proud of the judges and lawyers who run that \nfacility.\n  All we are asking is that they not let 65 of the 88 walk out the door \nbecause of an administrative review board which is not recognized under \nAfghan law. The guy in charge of it is openly against the Bilateral \nSecurity Agreement. I think he is a corrupt individual.\n  General Dunford has basically said: You are going too far here. I \ncannot in good conscience not object.\n  We have lodged our objections, and we thought this would be fixed, \nand they were going to turn these cases over to the attorney general. I \nreceived a phone call Sunday night. There was a caveat which nobody \ntold us about. They turned the 88 files over to the attorney general we \nthought for prosecution, but apparently President Karzai told the \nattorney general to release 65 of the 88.\n  If you believe in the rule of law, the President of the country does \nnot have the authority under Afghan law to tell the judiciary or the \nattorney general what cases to dispose of. This is an extrajudicial \nexercise of legal authority by the President of Afghanistan. The people \nin question, the 88, are responsible for killing 60 Americans and \ncoalition forces and 57 Afghans, and the Afghan population does not \nlike the idea that these people are going to walk out of the jail.\n  I will read the statement issued by our commander in Afghanistan \nright after the phone call:\n\n       United States Forces-Afghanistan has learned that 65 \n     dangerous individuals from a group of 88 detainees under \n     dispute have been ordered released from the Afghan National \n     Detention Facility at Parwan.\n       The U.S. has, on several occasions, provided extensive \n     information and evidence on each of the 88 detainees to the \n     Afghan Review Board, the Afghan National Directorate of \n     Security and the Attorney General's office.\n       This release violates the agreements between the U.S. and \n     Afghanistan.\n\n  The agreement is called the Memorandum of Understanding, and this \nviolates the spirit and the letter of the agreement we have negotiated.\n\n       We have made clear our judgment that these individuals \n     should be prosecuted under Afghan law. We requested that the \n     cases be carefully reviewed. But the evidence against them \n     was never seriously considered, including by the Attorney \n     General, given the short time since the decision was made to \n     transfer these cases to the Afghan legal system.\n  So within 24 hours they decided to let 65 people go. Clearly, they \ndidn't spend much time.\n\n       The release of the 65 detainees is a legitimate force \n     protection concern for the lives of both coalition troops and \n     Afghan National Security Forces.\n\n  It goes to Senator McCain's question, and I have spent a lot of time \nlooking at every file. This is our own ground commander, General \nDunford, who I think is doing a great job, telling us: If you let these \npeople go, it represents a force protection problem.\n  He further goes on to say:\n\n       The primary weapon of choice for these primary individuals \n     is the improvised explosive device, widely recognized as the \n     primary cause of civilian casualties in Afghanistan.\n\n  And quite frankly, the death of our own troops. Senator McCain made a \ngood point. Twenty-five of the 65 are directly linked to planting IEDs \nagainst our forces. We have fingerprints on these people. I have \nliterally seen the evidence where there is biometric identification, \nwhere we can look at the pressure plate and the tape and all the \nmaterial around the making of the IED and pick up fingerprints. When we \ndo that, they match to the biometric data. We have identified the \nperson by fingerprint, and they are going to let that person go. Some \nof\n\n[[Page S881]]\n\nthese people have been captured previously. The recidivism rate is \ngrowing in Afghanistan.\n  This is the final paragraph:\n\n       The release of these detainees is a major step backward for \n     the rule of law in Afghanistan. Some previously-released \n     individuals have already returned to the fight, and this \n     subsequent release will allow dangerous insurgents back into \n     Afghan cities and villages.\n\n  Back into the Afghan cities and villages to kill our troops and kill \ninnocent Afghans.\n  I thank Senator McCain so much for his interest in this subject \nmatter.\n  We are drafting a resolution condemning the actions of the Afghan \ngovernment, President Karzai, in the strongest terms possible. We are \nsuggesting that, in light of the breach of this agreement, putting our \ntroops at risk, letting killers go, that we suspend all economic aid \nuntil after the election.\n  I want to let this body know that the troops are watching this. Can \nyou imagine being one of the soldiers--Afghan and American--who risked \ntheir life to capture these people to have them walk right out the door \nand never face justice for killing one of your comrades? They are \nwatching us. We have to prove to the troops on the ground in \nAfghanistan--both Afghan and American and coalition forces--that the \nCongress of the United States will not accept this; that we have their \nback; and that we should push back as hard as humanly possible to make \nthe message clear to President Karzai and the Afghan government how \nmuch this displeases us. They are due to walk out of the jail Thursday.\n  I hope I don't have to come back on the floor of the Senate and read \nabout the death of an American caused by one of the people President \nKarzai released.\n  Senator McCain and I have been to Afghanistan more times than I can \nthink of. I have not found anybody more attuned to the idea that we \nneed a sustaining permanent relationship with the Afghan people than \nthe Senator from Arizona. He understands a follow-on force is \nnecessary, and that we can win this conflict and end it well with honor \nif we have a follow-on force, and the Senator from Arizona wants to \nstay involved.\n  But does Senator McCain agree with me that the actions of President \nKarzai defying our commander, his own judges, his own legal system has \ndone enormous damage to public support for this war effort--which is \nalready low--and has hurt the relationship between the Congress and the \nAfghan government?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from South Carolina, and I hope my \ncolleagues will understand the in-depth knowledge which he has about \nthis issue. No one understands it as well or has been more involved, to \nthe point of being involved with each of the individual cases.\n  Before I respond to the question, I think it important for our \ncolleagues to understand some of these specific cases. I am not going \nto submit for the record all 65 because it is long. But let me just \nmention a couple of examples of people who are about to be released \ninto Afghanistan while our men and women are still there in harm's way.\n  Habibulla Abdul Hady is a Taliban member, emplaced IEDs used in \nattacks against ANSF and ISAF forces in Kandahar province which took \nAmerican lives, and was biometrically matched to an IED incident in \nDaman, Kandahar, where pressure plate IEDs and components which took \nAmerican lives were seized by coalition forces.\n  Nek Mohammad facilitated rocket attacks against our forces in \nKandahar province, is an IED expert, and transferred money to Al Qaeda.\n  The list goes on.\n  Akhtar Mohammad is a suspected Taliban commander who conducts \nattacks, provides lethal aid and supports Taliban leaders in operations \nagainst ANSF and ISAF in Nangarhar and Kunar province. He acted as a \ntrusted courier for the former Ghaziabad Taliban shadow governor. The \nlist goes on and on. These are not random arrests. These are not \nmisdemeanors. These are serious, hard-core professional terrorists who \nhave already committed these acts, and that is what is so disappointing \nabout it.\n\n  Again, I say to my friend from South Carolina, we have been there \noften, and being around these brave young Americans who are serving and \nsacrificed has probably been the best part of our lives. Some of them \nhave had three, four, five, six tours of duty in Afghanistan and Iraq. \nIt seems to me that we owe them at least the security of not releasing \nthese trained killers--they are not amateurs--into the fight again. We \nalready know that the ones we released voluntarily--I think it was 27 \nor 30 percent--reentered the fight.\n  I say to my friend in response: Isn't it almost totally predictable \nthat these hard-core individuals will quickly reenter the fight? They \nare talented, professional, trained zealots, and it would obviously put \nAmerican lives in danger.\n  Finally, in answer to my colleague's question, again, I am saddened \nbecause President Karzai, my friend from South Carolina, Senator \nLieberman, and I have developed a relationship over many years of \ncooperation and assistance. There are reasons for some of his behavior. \nIt has been terribly mishandled by this administration. We still don't \nknow the number of troops they want to leave behind.\n  Having said all of that, and the sadness I feel, I think it has been \nreplaced a bit by anger because this kind of action cannot be excused \nwhen we have an obligation to do everything we can to protect the lives \nof the young men and women who are serving. To let this go without a \nresponse is an abrogation of our responsibility to these young men and \nwomen.\n  I still have hopes for the agreement. I would point out to my \ncolleagues that it was first raised a couple of years ago by Senator \nGraham when he and I were over there. The overwhelming majority of \nAfghans support this agreement. But when we have people such as this \nrunning around, it is not just Americans and our allies who are in \ndanger but the lives of the Afghan people, whom President Karzai was \nelected to represent, are in danger.\n  I ask my colleague again how many times he has been through this \ndrill with President Karzai where they were about to release these \npeople and we managed to pull them back from the brink? Apparently they \nhave finally stepped over the line.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. We are not asking to bring these people back to the \nUnited States for trial. We are asking that they go through the \ncriminal process under Afghan law where Afghan judges will decide their \nfate. Afghan prosecutors and defense attorneys will take over the case, \nnot us. We agreed to 550 people being released under this \nadministrative review board, but these 88--according to General \nDunford, and my own review--represent a different case of detainee.\n  The evidence in some cases is overwhelming. With some investigation, \nI think a case could be made against all of them. Many of the people \nwho are part of the NDS, which is basically their FBI and CIA rolled \ninto one, lost their lives capturing these folks.\n  All we ever asked the Afghans to do is basically follow their own \nrule of law. The accountability review board was never meant to be a \nrelease mechanism. General Dunford did the right thing by lodging a \ncomplaint.\n  I talked to the President of Afghanistan personally about how this is \nagainst the letter and spirit of the memorandum of understanding we \nhave regarding detainees and how this will play back in America. \nApparently what we think doesn't matter to him anymore. I understand \nbeing upset with this administration for the uncertainty and a lot of \nmistakes they made.\n  We may be the last two in the whole Senate who understand that we \nneed a relationship with Afghanistan post Karzai. I believe a lot of my \ncolleagues understand that too.\n  I hope every U.S. Senate Member will agree, no matter what they may \nthink about what we should be doing in the future in Afghanistan, that \nwe need to make a clear statement and agree to this resolution. If \nthere are any Members who have any ideas to enhance it, I welcome those \nideas.\n  I want this body to speak with a single voice--Republicans and \nDemocrats--and stand behind our general and tell the President of \nAfghanistan that we will not let this happen without a push-back. We \nowe it to those who have died, we owe it to those who are in harm's \nway, we owe it to our own value system, and now is the time\n\n[[Page S882]]\n\nfor the Congress--and particularly the Senate--to speak with one voice \nand let President Karzai know that he doesn't understand what is going \non in America. He is detached from reality when it comes to Afghanistan \nand America. No President of Afghanistan who understood this issue at \nall would ever do this. He is making it impossible for an American \npolitical leader and an American general to not respond forcefully.\n  I look forward to working with Senator McCain on this resolution.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will emphasize one point that my friend from South \nCarolina has already made. We are not giving up on Afghanistan. We \nbelieve that we can't afford to see the movie that we saw in Iraq in \nwhich the total withdrawal of American forces caused the chaos and the \nsituation in Iraq today.\n  In the second battle of Fallujah, 96 soldiers and marines were killed \nand 600 were wounded. Today the black flags of al-Qaida fly over the \ncity of Fallujah. There is no greater metaphor for the failure of this \nadministration in Iraq.\n  We are saying that we will make a new deal with Karzai's successor. \nWe will provide the economic assistance and we will provide the follow-\non force. But right now we cannot stand by without responding to this \nact which directly puts the lives of Americans and Afghans in danger. \nThese are professional killers. They are terrorists. They are good at \ntheir work, and we cannot expose our allies, our friends, and our men \nand women to this kind of danger without a response.\n  I will finally say again that no one understands this issue better \nthan Colonel Graham. Colonel Graham has been through every single one \nof these cases. He has fought this battle many times before, and if \nanybody has any question about the severity and the consequences of the \nact being taken today by President Karzai, I suggest they talk with him \nsince he has all the information.\n  I thank my colleague for his many years of service in Afghanistan and \nIraq on behalf of the men and women who are serving and have served \nwith him.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator from Arizona.\n  To conclude, this is not Lindsey Graham or Colonel Graham saying \nthis. This is what General Dunford is saying. I know he is right. I \nclearly understand what he is telling us. I have seen it firsthand.\n  To the folks at 435, who are in charge of the detainee population--\nthey lost two yesterday. An IED killed two of our civilian contractors, \nPaul and Michael, who were working out of the Pul-i-Charkhi prison. I \nknow them well. I met them a bunch of times. They have been over there \nas civilian contractors for years trying to improve the Afghan \ndetention facilities and legal system, and they gave their lives for a \nvery worthy cause.\n  All I am saying is we need to suspend aid. We are taking hundreds of \nmillions of dollars of American taxpayer money and investing it in \nAfghanistan in a way that is inappropriate.\n  After President Karzai's decision to release these detainees, we \nshould cut off the money. Not a dime should go to economic development. \nNo more money. I can't go to a taxpayer in South Carolina and say that \nthey should write a check to a government that is being led by Karzai. \nHopefully, as Senator McCain said, when somebody new comes along, \nreason will prevail.\n  I thank my colleagues and need their support. I urge every Member of \nthis body to speak out with one voice.\n  I will conclude with recognizing my good friend from Connecticut. His \nson is a marine who served in Afghanistan, and he has been there many \ntimes. I want Senator Blumenthal to know that we are doing this today \nto let our marines know that their sacrifice will not go unnoticed, and \nwe will not let these guys walk out of jail without a fight.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I want to also recognize that the Senator has a son in \nthe Navy as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I thank my distinguished colleagues for recognizing \nmy sons' service. One is a marine reservist deployed to Afghanistan and \nthe other is a Navy officer currently in further training.\n  I thank them and offer my support to the goals they have articulated \ntoday. I look forward to the resolution they are offering and talking \nfurther about the specifics of it. I again thank them for recognizing \nthe urgent need for this body to take action at this point in \nsupporting those goals. I look forward to continuing my work with them. \nAgain, my gratitude to them for their courage and determination, and I \noffer my thanks and support.\n  I am here today to talk about a bill that undoes an injustice, and \nfrequently the work of this body is to undo injustices, and sometimes \neven mistakes, such as the repeal of the cost-of-living adjustment \nreduction for certain military retirees.\n  I have spoken before in this Chamber and at home in Connecticut about \nmy opposition to the pension cost-of-living adjustment reduction \ncontained in the budget agreement approved by this body. I firmly \nbelieve there is no just way to balance the budget on the backs of our \nmilitary retirees. It was a mistake then, and we can undo it now \nwithout a so-called pay-for. Their sacrifice and service has been paid \nin full. With their sacrifices, military retirees deserve to be paid in \nfull for the promises we have made to them. We made those promises to \nthem for their service and sacrifice that they have given us already, \nand we should not break that promise.\n  The reduction in these cost-of-living adjustments impacts both the \nbrave veterans who served for 20 years in the military and those who \nearned their retirements because of a service-connected medical \ndisability. We should keep our promises to both.\n  Last month I discussed this problem with about 25 veterans in \nAmerican Legion Post 96 in West Hartford with Commander Ken Hungerford. \nOur brave patriots who served and sacrificed for our country \nunderstandably agreed they should receive the full benefit of present \ncost-of-living adjustments. This is a promise we have made and a \npromise we must keep.\n  To fix this issue, Senator Shaheen of New Hampshire and I first \nintroduced the Military Retirement Pay Restoration Act. I continue to \nsupport it. I also support Chairman Sanders' comprehensive veterans \nlegislation that would restore this cut to military retiree pensions, \nalong with improving access to health care and tackling benefits \nbacklogs for veterans.\n  I am very proud to have helped draft the omnibus bill, known as the \nmega bill, that has already been offered on the floor.\n  There is a very simple, straightforward solution that we should adopt \nbefore either of those two options. It is S. 1856, which would repeal \nsection 403 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. S. 1856 meets this \ncriteria of paid in full. It is simple and straightforward. It has no \npay-for because there is no need for an offset when we are talking \nabout fulfilling our promises to our brave and dedicated veterans, who \nhave given on the battlefield their all, who have given us, in service \nand sacrifice--even before they reach combat or even if they had no \ncombat--the kind of contribution to our national security and our \nnational defense that merits these cost-of-living adjustments.\n\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I listened to the \ntestimony of Acting Deputy Secretary of Defense Christine Fox that it \nwas not consulted in the drafting of the cuts in COLA--the cost-of-\nliving adjustments--and does not support the reduction in military \nretiree benefits enacted through section 403 of the Bipartisan Budget \nAct of 2013.\n  If there is a need to combat fraud in any of our programs, let the \nDepartment of Justice increase the vigor and effectiveness of \nenforcement efforts. If there is a need to repair a statute, to prevent \nwaste or fraud or corruption, we should deal with that issue separately \nand distinctly. If there is a need to reduce the debt and the deficit--\nand I agree we should be mindful of fiscal responsibility--we ought to \ndo it without breaking our promises to veterans. We ought to keep those \npromises without worrying about the debt that could be cut by other \nmeasures. And we should adopt those other measures rather than \ndemanding a payback or an offset or whatever the terminology may be.\n  In the next 5 years, we will see 1 million Americans leave the U.S. \nmilitary.\n\n[[Page S883]]\n\nAs troops come home from Afghanistan, as the military downsizes, the \nMarines and the Army reduce the number of men and women serving in \nuniform, 1 million Americans will leave the military. That number \nconsists of individuals' lives--it is not just a statistic--individual \nstories of heroism and bravery on the battlefield, of invisible wounds, \nas well as horrific visible injuries; invisible wounds involving the \nissues of post-traumatic stress and chronic brain injury. More than \none-third of them, perhaps as many as a half of all of those young men \nand women leaving the military, will bear those invisible wounds of \nwar.\n  We need to provide them with the health care, job counseling, skill \ntraining, jobs, and treatment for those invisible wounds of war they \ndeserve and they have earned. That is the purpose of the bill I have \nhelped to draft with Senator Sanders' leadership, the omnibus bill that \nwill address those issues.\n  I am hopeful, also, we will adopt the VOW to Hire Heroes Act, to \nextend tax credits for employers who hire those veterans, tax credits \nthat expired at the end of last year. My bill would restore them.\n  But let us now urgently and immediately adopt S. 1856--a simple and \nstraightforward measure to restore justice to the Federal pension \nsystem for military retirees. Let us not balance our budget on the \nbacks of our brave veterans. Let us restore those pensions to the level \nwe promised and keep our promises as a nation to the military veterans \nwho have kept our freedoms strong.\n  Mr. President, that is the end of my remarks. I thank you. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Blumenthal for his \nremarks, and I am going to utilize the same chart he had in a moment \nbecause I think it says it all. It was my colleague Mark Begich who \nfirst used this terminology--that our soldiers have paid for this \nbenefit already and to get distracted by a discussion on how much to \nhurt children in order to restore these benefits is not worthy, in my \nopinion, of the men and women in uniform. So I am proud to stand up in \nsupport of Senator Pryor's commonsense bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to proceed \nfor 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Senator Pryor's bill is a restoration bill. It restores \nfairness and justice to our military veterans. It repeals the cuts to \ncost-of-living adjustments--we call them COLAs--for military retirees \nunder the age of 62.\n  I see the Senator from Alaska just came in the Chamber, and I want to \nreiterate how much I appreciate his leadership. I say to Senator \nBegich, his analysis of this important restoration bill--restoring \nfairness and justice--was so right when he said our veterans have paid \nin full, and to get into some conversation of who do we hurt in order \nto pay these veterans is not worthy of our men and women in uniform. I \nwant to thank him for his leadership.\n  Repealing these COLA cuts, well, that is the right thing to do. We \nare talking about men and women in uniform who have served our Nation \nbravely for more than 20 years. I have to say, as I stand up in strong \nsupport of the Pryor amendment in restoring these benefits to our \nveterans, I adamantly oppose the Ayotte amendment, which is hurtful to \nchildren, very hurtful to children, and I will get into that later.\n  When these veterans first put on the uniform and they promised to \nprotect and defend our Nation, we made them a solemn promise to provide \nthem with the care and benefits they earned. These men and women have \nsacrificed so much for us and, tragically, too many of them made the \nultimate sacrifice.\n  In my State of California, we lost 892 service men and women in Iraq, \nand we have lost 411 in Afghanistan. We cannot break faith with those \nwho put their lives on the line for our Nation. We hear about people \nwho have served 4 deployments, 5 deployments, 6 deployments--I have \nheard of 10 deployments.\n  When this benefit was diminished as part of the budget deal, everyone \nknew we would have to move quickly and change it. We knew right away. \nThat is what we are trying to do. We are not offering a slew of \namendments on unrelated matters that hurt children and risk losing this \nvery simple premise: that we honor our men and women in uniform.\n  We want a simple vote. Either you are for the vets or you are not for \nthe vets. It is pretty simple. Thirty-five organizations are supporting \nthis. We must recognize that when you attach unrelated amendments that \nhave nothing to do with veterans, you slow down the bill. We all know \nthat. It is a way to derail things.\n  Look what my friends tried to do on unemployment compensation--get us \noff on some discussion of how to pay for all that in an emergency \nsituation with the long-term unemployed; and that rate is so high \nhistorically. Then we said: OK, we will play on your turf. We will \nagree. We will find a pay-for. We found a pay-for they said they liked. \nNo. It was not good enough for them. We only got 59 votes. We needed \n60. If anyone thinks that was not planned, I have a plot of land to \nsell you in a dump somewhere. Come on. We know how it goes around here. \nDon't tell me 59 and no more. Please. Those are games. This is not an \nissue we should be playing games about--restoring veterans' benefits.\n  So what we have in the Ayotte amendment is an amendment which demeans \nan entire population--an entire population. The amendment is \nantichildren, it is anti-immigrant, and it does not do one thing to \nhelp our veterans. But it will hurt some of our young DREAMers. We know \nthe DREAMers. We have met the DREAMers--those children who came to the \nUnited States through no fault of their own, but now they want to \ncontribute to our great society by staying in school and staying out of \ntrouble. But yet the Ayotte amendment attacks the childcare tax credit, \nwhich impacts some of these DREAMers and which protects 1.5 million \nchildren from falling into poverty every year.\n  Honestly, this Ayotte amendment is so mean-spirited, so unnecessary, \nI just hope it is defeated soundly. The U.S. poverty rate is now the \nhighest it has been in 20 years, with 22 percent of children living in \npoverty. Why would someone come down to the floor and attack children? \nTwenty-two percent of children live in poverty.\n  Low-income immigrant families who claim the child tax credit earn an \naverage of $23,000 a year, and they use this tax benefit to provide for \ntheir children's basic needs, including food, rent, and clothing.\n  This tax credit, which Senator Ayotte would essentially take away \nfrom a whole group of people, is an incentive to do the right thing. \nThese low-income families are working hard. They are earning money. But \nthey need a tax break to help care for their children.\n  My Republican friends are always fighting for tax breaks for the top, \ntop, top--for the top. What about the people struggling, who are \nworking and earning $23,000 a year? Where are my friends on raising the \nminimum wage? So far I have not heard of their support. I hope they \nwill change their mind. Where are my friends on giving unemployment \ninsurance to those who through no fault of their own cannot find a job \nand who paid into that insurance system? Where are they? They are \nabsent. They offer amendments they know are going to get us off track, \ndistract us, and bring the bill down. But we are not doing it this \ntime, I hope. I hope we will say no to the Ayotte amendment because it \nis an amendment that guts a very important tax break.\n  So let's be clear. To claim the child tax credit, which is what \nSenator Ayotte's amendment wants to weaken, families have to file \ntaxes. So we are talking about tax-paying families. The child tax \ncredit only goes to working people who earn money and pay payroll \ntaxes, who pay State and local taxes, and any other taxes they may owe.\n  This Ayotte amendment is an outrageously disproportionate response to \na problem the Internal Revenue Service is addressing. The IRS has \nimplemented changes to improve enforcement. They are working with the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to make sure fake documents do not slip \nthrough the cracks.\n  Let me be clear. If a person commits fraud in this program, as in any \nother\n\n[[Page S884]]\n\nprogram, we should go after that person. The law is on the books. I ask \nSenator Ayotte, look at the law. The law says: If you commit in any way \nfraud in the filing of this credit, and you are found guilty of a \nfelony, you will be fined not more than $100,000--$500,000 in the case \nof a corporation--or imprisoned for not more than 3 years, or both.\n  So here we have a situation where if fraud is committed by anyone \nclaiming this child tax credit, they can go to jail for 3 years and be \nfined $100,000.\n  But what does Senator Ayotte do? She takes a brush and she paints it \nall across America to immigrant families with children and says: We do \nnot trust you. I think it is so offensive. It is not fair for law-\nabiding, tax-paying families to lose their child tax credit because of \nfraud that might be committed by a few.\n  I have worked with a number of my colleagues. They have identified \nbillions and billions of dollars of tax-avoidance schemes in this \ncountry. We have corporations that use tricks so that they pay zero in \ntaxes. I do not see Senator Ayotte--and I hope she will do this in the \nfuture--come down to the floor and rail against these wealthy \nindividuals and corporations. No. She just goes after the weakest \nconstituency--children. Children. Why should any of us attack children, \nliterally take food out of the mouths of children? Why?\n  We need to keep our promise to the veterans, but we should keep our \npromise to the children. You do not say: I will restore one promise, \nbut I will break another promise. We already have a law on the books: \nIf anyone is guilty of fraud in this program, they go to jail for 3 \nyears; they could be fined up to $100,000.\n  I just think it is so wrong. It is so wrong.\n  We can do this.\n  I wish to close by reading from Sister Simone Campbell, executive \ndirector of NETWORK, a national Catholic social justice lobby. I know \nSenator Durbin has quoted this. I hope I am not being too repetitive, \nbut her words ring to my heart.\n  Some of you know about Nuns on the Bus. These were nuns who saw the \ninjustice in some of the budgets that came before the Congress. They \nwent on a bus and they said: Please do not cut funds for the most \nvulnerable people. That is not America. We are already losing the \nmiddle class.\n  The Presiding Officer knows that 400 families are worth more in this \ncountry than 150 million Americans. I want us to think about that--400 \nAmerican families are worth more than 150 million Americans. Surely we \ncan do better than hurt our most vulnerable children as we aim to \nrestore benefits to our veterans.\n  This is what Sister Simone Campbell says about the Ayotte amendment:\n\n       For a while now, kids--particularly those in immigrant \n     families--have been unfairly under attack in the Senate, and \n     the only plausible explanation is unconscionable: to score \n     political points.\n\n  This is Sister Simone:\n\n       Sen. Kelly Ayotte recently proposed variations of a plan to \n     strip away the refundable Child Tax Credit that now goes to \n     millions of children of taxpaying immigrant workers in low-\n     wage jobs. The proposal is misguided and antithetical to the \n     Gospel call to care for children and those at the margins of \n     society. It violates our long-held values as a nation, and it \n     should be rejected.\n\n  I have such respect for Sister Simone Campbell and the work of \nNETWORK because they do not just read the gospel and go to church and \npractice their religion, they live it. They live it. When they see \nthings happening on this floor that hurt the most vulnerable people, \nthey speak out. That is what Nuns on the Bus did. That is what Sister \nSimone Campbell says.\n  This is what she says further:\n\n       Ayotte says she understands families' needs, yet she wants \n     to deny a child tax credit to taxpaying immigrant families. \n     Actions speak louder than words, and her proposal hurts \n     families. Our political leaders should never place poor \n     children in the condition of competing with other vulnerable \n     populations for funds that help pay for food and other basic \n     needs.\n       Deliberately harming immigrant families goes against the \n     fundamental goodwill of Americans, including thousands of \n     people we met last year as our ``Nuns on the Bus'' traveled \n     6,500 miles across the U.S. to speak out for justice. \n     Throughout our journey, we stood with, prayed with, and heard \n     the stories of hundreds of immigrants who have long served \n     the needs of our nation.\n       Responsible leaders in Congress should look into their \n     hearts and reject proposals like this one . . . The political \n     tactic is not good for our economy or the wellbeing of our \n     entire nation--especially children who are the future of our \n     country. We are better than this.\n\n  As I sum up, let's go back to our other chart. Senator Pryor, Senator \nBegich, and a group of Senators, I believe including Senator Shaheen, \nSenator Hagan, and Senator Landrieu--I believe they are all on this \nproposal.\n  With their sacrifice, military retirees paid in full. They paid in \nfull. And to offer amendments that have nothing to do with the subject \nmatter but open an entire battle on immigrant families, who are working \nso hard, because there are some examples of fraud, just as there are \nexamples of fraud in corporate America--unfortunately, there are \nexamples of fraud all across America, including in politics. But I have \nto say that to go after the most vulnerable children and the most \nvulnerable families and try to convince this Senate that is something \nfair--I think it is off the mark. I hope we will reject the Ayotte \namendment. I hope everyone will read what Sister Simone says:\n\n       The proposal to go after children is misguided and \n     antithetical to the gospel call to care for children and \n     those at the margins of society. It violates our long-held \n     values as a nation and it should be rejected.\n\n  I want to remind everyone that if anyone commits fraud in this \nsociety, I will be the first one on the floor saying: Go after them. We \nalready have a law that is very clear. Anyone who commits fraud in \nconnection with the child credit, the refundable credit, shall be \nguilty of a felony and upon conviction thereof shall be fined not more \nthan $100,000--$500,000 in the case of a corporation--or imprisonment \nof not more than 3 years or both.\n  If the Justice Department or the IRS is not doing enough to go after \nthis fraud, I have to say, let's call the folks in charge and let's \ntell them we want to make sure there is an effort. Write a letter. But \ndo not say--because a few people are doing a bad thing and should go to \njail for it, do not take your paint brush and paint every immigrant \nfamily who has dreams with this. This is an outrageous thing to do, \nespecially to claim that you are not doing anything to hurt children \nand you are doing it to help the veterans. The veterans have paid in \nfull.\n  Let's vote for the veterans--for the veterans and for the children. \nYou vote for the veterans by voting for Pryor. You vote for the \nchildren by voting no on the mean-spirited Ayotte amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I come to the floor today in support of \nS. 1963, a bill to restore the 1 percent COLA cut for military \nretirees.\n  We must honor the sacrifices our military men and women--and their \nfamilies--have made at home and abroad. We can do this by making sure \nthat they have a government on their side and that promises made are \npromises kept.\n  Our men and women in uniform face specific challenges when it comes \nto their own financial security. It can be difficult to save for \nretirement while serving abroad or to build equity in a home when \nrelocating every few years. Having a COLA you can depend on and plan \nfor is crucial to building financial security.\n  That is why I fully support restoring the 1 percent COLA for all \nmilitary retirees. As chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, I \nincluded a provision in the fiscal year 2014 omnibus spending bill to \ncancel the COLA cut for working-age disabled veterans and survivors of \ndeparted members. This provision was an important downpayment toward \nrestoring COLA for all military retirees.\n  Today we must finish the job to ensure that no military retiree has \nhis or her COLA reduced. There are smarter and fairer ways to save \nmoney than reducing COLAs for men and women who served in uniform. We \ncan start by closing tax loopholes for businesses sending jobs overseas \nor canceling outdated Dust-Bowl farm subsidies.\n  Rather than targeting veterans for budget savings, we should be \nworking together to make sure they and their families are supported \nmedically, financially, and emotionally.\n  Today is the day to right this wrong, and I encourage my colleagues \nto support this legislation.\n\n[[Page S885]]\n\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I come to the floor to talk about three highly \nqualified nominees for very significant posts at the Department of \nState.\n  The Foreign Relations Committee, which I am privileged to chair, has \nmoved 48 nominees through the committee this year alone. I am pleased \nthese three will move, but I would like to express my concern about the \nremaining nominees. They are critical to us promoting our foreign \npolicy and our national interests and security interests abroad. I urge \nmy colleagues to support movement of these nominees to the floor as \nquickly as possible.\n  There are three today.\n  Richard Stengel has more than 30 years of experience as an author and \njournalist. He brings a very unique perspective to his role as Under \nSecretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs, on which we will be \nvoting.\n  He has served as the managing editor of Time magazine during the past \n7 years, demonstrating his impressive managerial capabilities.\n  As president and CEO he led the National Constitution Center in \nPhiladelphia, where he led public education efforts to raise awareness \nabout our Nation's founding charter and the values enshrined in it.\n  This public diplomacy role is incredibly important in a world that is \nconstantly getting closer and smaller by virtue of the mass media, the \nInternet, and all of the different forms of communication. Our advocacy \nin public diplomacy is incredibly important to get our message out as \nthe United States in terms of our bilateral and multilateral pursuits.\n  Dr. Sarah Sewall has been nominated to serve as Under Secretary for \nCivilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights. She comes to this \nposition with significant relevant experience. She taught at the Naval \nWar College and served as a director of Harvard's Carr Center for Human \nRights Policy. She is highly regarded as an expert on mass-atrocity \nprevention and response. She is now a senior lecturer in public policy \nat the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.\n  Her large portfolio includes a range of issues, including challenges \nto civilian security in Latin America; Syria's growing refugee problem, \nwhich is a concern for us in terms of the entire region and our good \nally--Jordan, for example; counterterrorism; counternarcotics; human \ntrafficking; and women's issues. These are all incredibly important in \nthe pursuit of our foreign policy.\n  I am confident Dr. Sewall will be an excellent Under Secretary, and I \nurge my colleagues to support her nomination.\n  Finally, we have Ambassador Charles Rivkin's deep experience in the \nprivate sector and clear talent for managing large organizations which \nposition him well to take on the position of Assistant Secretary of \nState for Economic and Business Affairs.\n  At a time when our country is pursuing the most ambitious trade \nagenda in generations and our companies and workers are facing tougher \nand more aggressive competition than ever before, Ambassador Rivkin has \ndemonstrated the skill and the experience needed to lead the State \nDepartment's participation in formulating and implementing \ninternational economic policies aimed at protecting and advancing U.S. \neconomic, political, and security interests.\n  Particularly at a time in which we are seeking to create more jobs \nhere at home, our advocacy abroad to open markets, to have \ntransparency, to have the rule of law for our companies that do invest \nabroad, to ultimately ensure that when they make such decisions, if \nthere is a violation of their contracts, they have a transparent \njudicial process in which they can litigate their judicial issues are \nnot only incredibly important to our companies' investments abroad but \nto the jobs created at home that promote the products and services we \ngenerate across the globe.\n  I urge my colleagues to support these nominations in pursuit of the \nnational interest and security of the United States.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I ask unanimous consent to yield back all time on both \nsides, including the 2 minutes prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Richard Stengel, of New York, to be Under Secretary of State for \nPublic Diplomacy?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ.

Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form prior to a vote on \nthe Gibson nomination.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, today I wish to speak in strong support \nof the nomination of Sloan Gibson to serve as Deputy Secretary at the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs.\n  Before I speak about Mr. Gibson's qualifications, I believe it is \nimportant that my colleagues understand the realities that Mr. Gibson \nwill face if confirmed. He would be responsible for the day-to-day \nmanagement of the Department charged with operating the Nation's \nlargest integrated health care system and providing a variety of \nbenefits and services to America's veterans, as well as their \ndependents and survivors.\n  It is also no secret the Department of Veterans Affairs faces a \nnumber of challenges. We know it takes VA too long to issue claims \ndecisions. We know it takes the Board of Veterans' Appeals too long to \ndecide appeals. We know VA and the Department of Defense have spent \nyears on an integrated electronic health record with very little to \nshow for their efforts. We know VA has difficulty managing major \nconstruction projects; and we know far too many veterans still do not \nknow about the benefits and health care for which they are entitled. \nThese are the just some of the challenges awaiting Mr. Gibson and \nhighlight the need for this body to move quickly to confirm Mr. Gibson \nfor this important vacancy.\n  All too often, VA's challenges can cast a large shadow over the \nthings\n\n[[Page S887]]\n\nthat VA does well. I think it is also important to acknowledge the \namazing things VA is accomplishing each and every day. For instance, \npatient satisfaction at VA medical centers remains high throughout the \ncountry as does the quality of care veterans receive. VA has taken an \naggressive stance on homelessness by pursuing the ambitious goal of \neliminating veteran homelessness by 2015 and continues to make \nsignificant progress in reducing the number of veterans living on the \nstreet. Finally, the VA continues to make significant advances in \nhealth care through its world-class research programs.\n  These are the realities and the challenges facing any nominee for a \nleadership position at the Department. I firmly believe Sloan Gibson is \nuniquely qualified to address these challenges. Mr. Gibson has a \nhistory of service to this Nation that has provided unique insights \ninto the challenges confronting the servicemember and veteran \ncommunities. Mr. Gibson began his service as a cadet at the U.S. \nMilitary Academy at West Point. He graduated in 1975 and went on to \nserve as an infantry officer, earning airborne and ranger \nqualifications during his military service. His service to this \ncountry, however, did not end when Mr. Gibson left military service. He \ncontinues this tradition of service today by leading the United Service \nOrganizations, commonly known as the USO, which has the important \nmission of lifting the spirits of America's troops and their families.\n  I feel the relationships Mr. Gibson has developed with the Congress \nand senior leaders within the Department of Defense during his tenure \nat the USO will serve him well as Deputy Secretary. Collaborative \nefforts between VA and DOD such as the Integrated Electronic Health \nRecord and Integrated Disability Evaluation System have the potential \nto make the delivery of benefits and services much more efficient and \nto provide servicemembers with a smooth transition to civilian life. \nYet, these efforts continue to face significant challenges. VA needs a \nDeputy Secretary like Sloan Gibson who will be able to provide the \nleadership attention necessary to ensure continued and meaningful \ncollaboration between the Departments.\n  Sloan Gibson also has the business experience, gained from service in \nboth the for-profit and not-for-profit sectors, necessary to serve as \nDeputy Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Following \nmilitary service, Mr. Gibson spent 20 years serving in a number of \npositions within the banking industry. This service included 11 years \nas an executive at AmSouth Bancorporation. He retired from AmSouth in \n2004 as vice chairman and chief financial officer.\n  Sloan Gibson's tradition of service, business experience, and \neducational qualifications make him well suited to manage the day-to-\nday operations of one of this Nation's largest Cabinet Departments. I \nam confident that if confirmed Mr. Gibson's service as Deputy Secretary \nwould improve the lives of America's veterans and their families and as \nchairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee I look forward to working \nwith Mr. Gibson to do just that.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting today to confirm the \nnomination of Sloan Gibson to serve as Deputy Secretary at the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I yield back all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Sloan D. Gibson, of the District of \nColumbia, to be Deputy Secretary of Veterans Affairs?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, today the Atlantic Council's Adrienne \nArsht Latin American Center released a new, bipartisan public opinion \nsurvey on Americans' views about U.S. policy toward Cuba which should \nbe read by every Member of Congress. The findings of this thorough and \nwide-ranging poll will surprise many. For instance, not only do \nFloridians--and Cuban-Americans in Florida--favor new policy \napproaches, but they do so in even larger numbers than do Americans in \nother regions of the Nation.\n  It is time--past time--to modernize our policies and the frozen-in-\ntime embargo on Americans' travel and trade with Cuba that have \naccomplished nothing but to give the Cuban regime a scapegoat for the \nfailures of the Cuban economy. Change will come to Cuba, but our \npolicies have delayed and impeded change. It is time to elevate the \nvoice of a crucial stakeholder: the American people. Thanks to this \npoll, they are silent no longer.\n  It is time to recognize that U.S. policy toward Cuba has been \nunsuccessful in achieving any of its objectives. There is no \ndisagreement among Americans on both sides of the issue about the \ndesire for a government in Cuba that respects individual liberties. We \nwant to see freedom of expression Cuba, just as we want to see American \ncitizen Alan Gross, who has been imprisoned there for more than 4 \nyears, come home. The disagreement is over how best to achieve that.\n  Just about the only beneficiary of our embargo has been Cuba's \ncurrent regime.\n  The poll shows that a solid majority of Americans, including Cuban-\nAmericans, favor a different course.\n  Trade with Latin America is the fastest growing part of our \ninternational commerce. Rather than isolate Cuba with outdated \npolicies, we have isolated ourselves. Our Latin, European and Canadian \nfriends engage with Cuba all that time. Meanwhile, U.S. companies are \nprohibited from any economic activity on the island.\n  This new detailed survey paves the way for a policy toward Cuba that \nis in the national interest of the United States as a whole. That is \nwhat the country needs, it is what the American people have made clear \nthey want, and it is the responsibility of the White House and the \nCongress to act.\n  Let us have the common sense, and the courage, to finally put an end \nto the Cold War in our own hemisphere.\n  In this same spirit of bipartisanship as this public opinion poll, \nSenator Jeff Flake and I joined together in writing a guest column \nabout the compelling reasons to change these antiquated policies. Our \npiece appeared today in the Miami Herald. I call it to the attention of \nthe Senate, and I invite other Senators to join in re-examining and \nchanging our self-defeating approach in our relationship with Cuba and \nthe Cuban people. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Miami Herald, Feb. 11, 2014]\n\n                     Time for a New Policy on Cuba\n\n                   (By Patrick Leahy and Jeff Flake)\n\n       We are in the fifth decade--more than half a century--of \n     our country's embargo toward Cuba. During that time the \n     Soviet Union has ceased to exist. Apartheid in South Africa \n     has ended. We have re-established diplomatic relations with \n     the communist governments of China and Vietnam. Still, the \n     United States has refused to reexamine the political and \n     economic embargo on Cuba.\n       A majority of Americans, including Cuban-Americans, wants \n     to change course. So do we.\n       A new public opinion poll commissioned by the Atlantic \n     Council's Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center and carried out \n     by a team of highly respected pollsters from both sides of \n     the aisle shows a stark contrast between current American \n     attitudes and the archaic U.S. embargo.\n       A solid majority of Americans from every region and across \n     party lines supports normalizing relations with Cuba. When \n     asked about specific elements of the policy--such as undoing \n     the ban on travel by Americans to Cuba, facilitating \n     financial transactions,\n\n[[Page S888]]\n\n     meeting with the Cuban government on bilateral issues like \n     fighting drugs and smuggling--the margin is more than 61 \n     percent.\n       Challenging conventional wisdom that Floridians--and \n     especially the state's large Cuban-American population--are \n     in lockstep with the embargo, the poll finds stronger support \n     for normalization in Florida (63 percent) than in the country \n     overall (56 percent). A full 67 percent of Floridians support \n     removing all restrictions for Americans to travel to Cuba, \n     and 82 percent favor meetings with the Cuban government on \n     issues of mutual concern.\n       Simply put: The state that reportedly once had the greatest \n     reluctance to re-engage has reversed its position.\n       Having jailed political opponents, Cuba has a political \n     climate that is far from free. The Cuban government continues \n     to hold former USAID subcontractor Alan Gross in prison. The \n     Cuban government has inched toward loosening its grip on the \n     island's economy. Despite that, however, the Cuban people \n     continue to live under a repressive regime.\n       However, it would appear that a standard of 100 percent \n     political alignment with the United States before allowing \n     freedom of travel or economic activity with another country \n     is only applied to Cuba. For instance, U.S.-China trade \n     topped $500 billion in 2011, and we granted permanent \n     normalized trade relations to Russia in 2012. American \n     tourists visit both countries without restriction. It is easy \n     to see why most Americans now oppose our frozen-in-time \n     policies toward Cuba.\n       Trade with Latin America is the fastest growing part of our \n     international commerce. In 2014, economic growth in Latin \n     America is expected to continue to outpace U.S. growth. \n     Rather than isolate Cuba with outdated policies, we have \n     isolated ourselves.\n       For example, the presidents of our Latin American partners, \n     including close allies such as Colombia and Mexico, recently \n     traveled to Cuba alongside the U.N. secretary general. In \n     January, Brazil joined Cuba in inaugurating a huge new \n     shipping terminal on the island. And our European and \n     Canadian friends engage with Cuba. Meanwhile, U.S. companies \n     are prohibited from any economic activity on the island.\n       Just about the only beneficiary of our embargo has been \n     Cuba's current regime. The embargo actually has helped the \n     Castros maintain their grip on power by providing a reliable \n     and convenient scapegoat for Cuba's failing economy. Change \n     will come to Cuba. These counterproductive U.S. policies have \n     delayed it.\n       President Obama has already relaxed some facets of our Cuba \n     policy, lifting restrictions on Cuban-American travel and \n     remittances, which have had positive effects. Anecdotally, \n     U.S. remittances have been crucial in allowing Cuban \n     entrepreneurs to take full advantage of economic openings \n     that the Castro regime has been forced to allow. This not \n     only improves Cubans' lives but will make future economic \n     contractions by the Cuban government difficult for the regime \n     to attempt. Current policy boxes U.S. entrepreneurs and \n     companies out of taking part in any of this burgeoning Cuban \n     private sector.\n       Further, there is simply no legitimate justification for \n     restricting any American travel to Cuba. The travel ban, like \n     the rest of the embargo, only bolsters the Cuban government's \n     control over information and civil society. Instead of \n     willingly restricting the liberty of our own citizens, we \n     should be taking every opportunity to flood Cubans with \n     American interaction, with our ideas, with our young people.\n       Americans want a change in our Cuba policy. The president \n     should heed the majority of those across the country who \n     recognize that we have much to gain by jettisoning this Cold \n     War relic.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/11/senate-section/article/S888-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         LITTLE COUNTRY THEATRE\n\n Ms. HEITKAMP.

Today, \nthe Little Country Theatre is well recognized and respected for its \ndiverse programming and for bringing the gift of theater to the public.\n  Over the last 100 years, the Little Country Theatre has presented \nhundreds of plays throughout North Dakota.

Madam President, today I wish to celebrate an \nexciting and significant victory for local veterans in southern West \nVirginia and to recognize the unwavering dedication of the people who \nhave worked tirelessly to bring the first-ever mobile veterans health \nclinic to Mercer County.\n  Today, the Beckley VA Medical Center will debut the long-awaited \nmobile health clinic in Bluefield, WV. This facility will improve \naccess to primary and mental health-care to the growing number of \nveterans in the region.\n  This is wonderful news for our brave heroes who have been without \naccessible health care for far too long. Until now, our veterans' only \noption for receiving health care has been to drive over an hour to the \nclosest clinic or hospital. Expecting our veterans to commute this far \nafter these courageous men and women have already risked their lives in \nthe defense of this country is simply unacceptable.\n  I have always said that West Virginia is one of the most patriotic \nstates in this great Nation, and we are so proud of the number of \nveterans and Active-Duty members who have served with honor and \ndistinction. Upon returning home, they truly deserve the absolute best \ncare and treatment that is available. That is why we have made it our \ntop priority to bring this clinic to serve the veterans in Mercer \nCounty and the surrounding communities with quality care.\n  The mobile health clinic will be an extension of the Beckley VA \nMedical Center, and it will be initially stationed in Bluefield, WV. As \nlong it is utilized by area veterans, we can count on this facility to \nstay in southern West Virginia for years to come.\n  I especially want to emphasize the efforts of one very special West \nVirginian who has dedicated the past 18 years to helping the veterans \nof southern West Virginia--Al Hancock. His leadership and commitment to \nthe betterment of the veteran community is truly why this mobile clinic \nwill open its doors today.\n  Throughout his life and still today, Al has answered the call of \nservice--whether it was serving our great Nation or helping the people \nof West Virginia. He is a retired teacher and a retired Air Force \nveteran who served two tours in Vietnam.\n  A proud and passionate leader, he was the chairman of the retired \nmilitary support group and he led discussions among over 250 veterans \nabout the issues concerning them most. He talked with fellow veterans, \ntheir spouses, and their families regularly.\n  One issue that continued to arise was the need for more accessible \nhealth care. After more than 150 letters sent to the local newspaper \nand issuing a petition containing more than 3,000 resident signatures, \nhe provided a voice to the veteran community. Despite the many \nobstacles and hurdles, Al never gave up--he worked passionately and \ntirelessly to bring this issue to light. And finally, that voice \nresonated loud and clear. Because of Al's perseverance and determined \nvision, I am proud to have worked closely with Al to help bring people \ntogether to make his vision a reality.\n  With the hard work and partnership of the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, the Beckley VA, and the West Virginia delegation, we have been \nable to make a difference for Al and for all of the veterans who reside \nthroughout southern West Virginia.\n  We owe our veterans more than a debt of gratitude. Showing our \nappreciation to the brave men and women who have served is something we \nshould do each and every day. By delivering this mobile health clinic, \nwe are\n\n[[Page S889]]\n\npaying tribute to those who have answered America's call of duty.\n  I thank Al, the VA, the Beckley VA Center, and all those who have \nworked to bring this much needed health care access to Mercer County.\n  This clinic will greatly benefit communities that have a need for \nhealth care resources, and it will help ensure all of our veterans and \ntheir families have access to the care they need and truly \ndeserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/11/senate-section/article/S889-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING J. SMITH LANIER II\n\n Mr. SESSIIONS. Madam President. I would like to take a moment \nto recognize the passing of a great American patriot, J. Smith Lanier \nII. Smith Lanier was an entrepreneur, business leader, philanthropist, \ncommunity leader, national leader, and friend.\n  He was a native of Georgia, attended Auburn University then \ntransferred to the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy where he earned a \ndegree in mechanical engineering and a commission into the U.S. Navy.\n  In 1950, he joined his aunt's insurance agency, Lanier Insurance \nAgency, based in West Point, GA. His career was interrupted by 2 years \nof active duty aboard the USS Ault DD698 during the Korean war. When he \nreturned from that service, he purchased the agency under the name J. \nSmith Lanier & Co. He began with a single office and five employees and \ngrew to have offices throughout Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Florida, \nand Kentucky. Today the company is one of the oldest and largest \ninsurance brokerage firms in the United States. He served as its \nchairman and CEO until 1998 and was chairman emeritus until his death.\n  During his life, he helped launch many other companies including \nAsync, Inc.; SouthernNet; Interface, Inc., NASDAQ; Valley Realty \nCompany, Inc.; ITC Holding Co., Inc.; Avdata, Inc.; National Vision \nAssociates, Inc.; Cookbook Brands, Inc., now Beverage House; Powertel, \nInc., formerly Intercel, Inc. and now TMobile; and ITC DeltaCom, \nNASDAQ. A remarkably successful entrepreneurial career indeed.\n  He was a strong advocate for education at all levels, both public and \nprivate, founding Springwood School in Lanett, AL and serving on the \nboards of trustees of several colleges and universities. He was a \nstrong advocate for fair treatment for hospitals in the area, an issue \nthat I worked with him to address.\n  Mr. Lanier was very close to Auburn University. He served on many \nboards for the university and in 2010 was presented the Auburn \nUniversity Alumni Association Lifetime Achievement Award.\n  Smith was also active in local, regional and national politics \nserving the Republican Party in many ways, including being a delegate \nto two Republican National Conventions.

Madam President, I note the passing at age 90 of \na truly outstanding American citizen, Yetta Glenn Samford, Jr., a \nlifelong resident of Opelika, AL. Opelika Mayor Gary Fuller rightly \ncalled him an icon. The product of a distinguished Alabama family, he \nwas successful in law and business, all the while giving of himself for \nhis Nation and community.\n  That such characteristics, such cast of mind and heart, have provided \nthe unique values that have made America great is without doubt. The \ndeeply held concept of neighbor helping neighbor has been the glory of \nthe Republic. A member of the ``greatest generation'', Yetta Samford \nserved his country and was consistently successful in his undertakings. \nHe flourished in law and business. But, he was focused on giving back. \nHe loved his country, State and community and was a strong believer in \neducation. During World War II, he piloted B-17 bombers being stationed \nin England in 1944 and 1945--a calling that placed his very life at \nrisk. Returning from the war, grateful for his survival, he declared, \n``I thank the Lord for letting me come back.'' Then he married his \nwonderful lifetime partner, Mary Austill, got his degree at Auburn \nUniversity and his law degree at the University of Alabama.\n  From then on success followed him and he lived a life of generosity. \nHow many today will reach his level of service? Are we still producing \nsuch people? Perhaps so, but in the same numbers?\n  Yetta Samford was supportive of a host of positive activities. He was \nactive in many local organizations, donated the land for the Opelika \nSportsplex and Aquatics Center, and was a member of the board of \ndeacons for the First Baptist Church of Opelika for 60 years. He served \non the prestigious board of trustees of the University of Alabama, \nserving a 3-year-term as president pro tempore. He was, in addition, a \nfounding trustee for the University of Mobile, a fine Baptist \naffiliated liberal arts college.\n  Mr. Samford was respected and loved throughout the Opelika area. He \nset a high standard for a life well lived. I was honored to have his \nfriendship. Professionally accomplished, a man of high character and \ngenerous with his time, talents and resources, Yetta Samford's life \nreflected the highest qualities of American citizenship. It is fitting \nthat this Senate take note of such a life.\n  He took great joy in his exceptional wife, Mary Austill Samford, and \ndaughters Mary Austill Samford Lott and Katherine Park Samford Alford, \nfive grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. They reflect these \nsame qualities and can take solace in the heritage that he has left \nthem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/11/senate-section/article/S889-3", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:22 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2431.

A bill to amend the Controlled Substances Act to more \neffectively regulate anabolic steroids; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join Senator \nHatch once again in introducing the bipartisan Designer Anabolic \nSteroid Control Act. Like the legislation we introduced in 2012, this \nmeasure will help keep American children and families safe from \ndangerous designer drugs that masquerade as healthy dietary \nsupplements.\n  Doctors and scientists have long recognized the health hazards of \nnon-medical use of anabolic steroids. For that reason, Congress has \npreviously acted to ensure that these drugs are listed as controlled \nsubstances. Nonetheless, according to investigative reporting and \nCongressional testimony, a loophole in current law allows for designer \nanabolic steroids to easily be found on the Internet, in gyms, and even \nin retail stores.\n  Designer steroids are produced by reverse engineering existing \nillegal steroids and then slightly modifying the chemical composition, \nso that the resulting product is not on the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration's, DEA, list of controlled substances. When taken by \nconsumers, designer steroids can cause serious medical consequences, \nincluding liver injury and\n\n[[Page S892]]\n\nincreased risk of heart attack and stroke. They may also lead to \npsychological effects such as aggression, hostility, and addiction.\n  These designer products can be even more dangerous than traditional \nsteroids because they are often untested, produced from overseas raw \nmaterials, and manufactured without quality controls. As one witness \ntestified at a Crime Subcommittee hearing on the issue, ``all it takes \nto cash in on the storefront steroid craze is a credit card to import \nraw products from China or India where most of the raw ingredients come \nfrom, the ability to pour powders into a bottle or pill and a printer \nto create shiny, glossy labels.''\n  The unscrupulous actors responsible for manufacturing and selling \nthese products often market them with misleading and inaccurate labels. \nThat can cause consumers who are looking for a healthy supplement--not \njust elite athletes, but also high school students, law enforcement \npersonnel, and mainstream Americans--to be deceived into taking these \ndangerous products. While the world's top athletes competing in the \nWinter Olympics are subjected to strict guidelines and rigorous testing \nto prevent the use of steroids, as they should be, many Americans may \nbe unknowingly dosing themselves with these harmful substances.\n  Loopholes in existing law allow these dangerous designer steroids to \nevade regulation. Under current law, in order to classify new \nsubstances as steroids, the DEA must complete a burdensome and time-\nconsuming series of chemical and pharmacological testing. As a DEA \nofficial testified before Congress: ``in the time that it takes DEA to \nadministratively schedule an anabolic steroid used in a dietary \nsupplement product, several new products can enter the market to take \nthe place of those products.''\n  The Designer Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2014 would quickly \nprotect consumers from these dangerous products. First, it would \nimmediately place 27 known designer anabolic steroids on the list of \ncontrolled substances. Second, it would grant the DEA authority to \ntemporarily schedule new designer steroids on the controlled substances \nlist, so that if bad actors develop new variations, these products can \nbe removed from the market. Third, it would create new penalties for \nimporting, manufacturing, or distributing anabolic steroids under false \nlabels.\n  Senator Hatch and I worked closely with a range of consumer and \nindustry organizations to ensure that this legislation would not \ninterfere with consumers' access to legitimate dietary supplements. I \nthank these organizations for their support, and look forward to \nworking with them, with Senator Hatch, and with colleagues from both \nsides of the aisle to enact this common sense measure into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 2014.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior, the \nSecretary of Commerce, and the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency to take actions to provide additional water supplies \nand disaster assistance to the State of California due to drought, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of myself and \nSenators Boxer, Wyden and Merkley to introduce legislation to respond \nto California's devastating drought conditions.\n  This weekend's storm in Northern California was more than a year in \ncoming, and there are some encouraging signs that came from it: \nRainfall in the Sacramento Valley averaged 2 to 3 inches. North of San \nFrancisco Bay, precipitation averaged 4 to 7 inches. Between Friday and \nMonday, about 7 inches of precipitation fell in the Northern Sierra. \nThe Southern Sierra saw more than 3 inches. Over the same period, the \nwater contained in Northern Sierra snow increased by 3 inches; Central \nSierra by 4 inches; and Southern Sierra by an inch.\n  But one storm in the North will not end this historic drought. In the \nSan Joaquin Valley, precipitation over the weekend was less than an \ninch, while San Diego and Los Angeles saw only about a quarter-inch of \nrain. Also, the snowpack in the Sierra remains very troubling. \nStatewide, the snowpack is at 29 percent of normal for this date. The \nNorthern California mountains are at 18 percent, and the Central Sierra \nis 36 percent.\n  State officials have confirmed that this weekend's rain and snow will \nhave very little effect on the amount of water available for \nCalifornia. Even after this storm, California faces some of the driest \nconditions in modern times, leading to last month's declaration by \nGovernor Brown of a drought emergency.\n  As of the beginning of February, at least 10 communities are in \ndanger of running out of drinking water within 2 months. Without \nrelief, more communities may face similar difficulties.\n  California's State Water Project helps supply water to 25 million \nCalifornians and 750,000 acres of farmland. For the first time in its \n54-year history, it will not be providing any water to its water \nagencies.\n  The Central Valley Project irrigates about 3 million acres of \nfarmland, supplies water to millions of Californians and supports \ncrucial environmental habitats. This year, it will likely not be able \nto provide water to many farmers in the Central Valley.\n  As of February 9, Lake Shasta, California's largest reservoir, and \nLake Oroville, the State Water Project's principal reservoir, are both \nat only 37 percent of capacity. San Luis Reservoir, crucial to farmers \nsouth of the Delta, is at only 30 percent of capacity.\n  Without water, farmers north and south of the Delta have lost crops, \ntrees, workers, and income. Businesses, factories, schools, hospitals, \nfire departments, and other social services facilities will have \ntrouble carrying out their work.\n  Let me put this in perspective: According to the State, to reach \naverage annual rain and snowfall levels, this past weekend's rainfall \nmust be repeated very frequently from now until May. And even then, \nCalifornia would still remain in drought conditions.\n  We need a forceful and immediate response to help those who are \nsuffering. That is why I am introducing the California Emergency \nDrought Relief Act of 2014 along with Senators Boxer, Wyden and \nMerkley. Representative Jim Costa will introduce this bill in the \nHouse.\n  This bill focuses on measures that can provide water supplies to \nCalifornia this year. It would cut red tape and free up federal \nagencies to operate with maximum flexibility and speed so they can move \nwater to those who need it. When we have more water to move from storms \nlike we saw this weekend, this bill will make an even greater \ndifference.\n  Let me sum up how this bill would help. First, the bill would \nincrease\n\n[[Page S893]]\n\nwater supplies. By being smarter about how we manage water projects, we \ncan free up more water. For example: This bill directs Federal agencies \nto open water gates on the Sacramento River for as long as possible \nwhen few salmon are migrating. This should allow thousands of acre feet \nof water to be pumped without harming the species.\n  It also directs agencies to find ways to control turbid waters so \nendangered Delta smelt that are attracted to these waters do not swim \nnear the water pumps. Less risk to fish means more water can be pumped. \nAnd the bill mandates agencies to use the maximum authority allowed \nunder the Endangered Species Act to provide as much water as possible \nfrom Delta pumping while staying within the law.\n  The bill would also reduce bureaucracy. During this emergency \nsituation, the federal government must work as quickly and as \nefficiently as possible. Relying on emergency authorities that already \nexist, the bill directs Federal agencies to complete environmental \nreviews under shortened timeframes so water supply measures such as \nwater transfers and fallowing of land can be carried out with minimal \ndelay.\n  The bill would also provide emergency funding and disaster \nassistance. It authorizes additional expenditures to fund measures that \ncan make a difference now, especially for the communities that are at \nrisk of running out of drinking water soon.\n  They include $100 million to carry out projects to maximize water \nsupplies. There is also $200 million for disaster relief to help \nfarmers and rural communities. That includes $100 million for emergency \nconservation measures so farmers can carry out projects to protect \nlands, crops and watersheds; $25 million in grants for rural \ncommunities to take action to upgrade, repair or secure water systems; \n$25 million in pre-disaster hazard mitigation grants so communities and \nthe State can complete projects to lessen the effects of the drought; \n$25 million in grant funding for public and nonprofit organizations to \nprovide emergency assistance to low-income migrant and seasonal \nfarmworkers affected by the drought; and $25 million in grants to \nprivate forest landowners for conservation measures related to drought \nand wildfire. The bill would also direct Federal agencies to prioritize \ngrant funding for water projects that can yield water supplies and \nalleviate the drought's effects now.\n  The bill also amends the Stafford Act. The 1988 Stafford Act was \nmeant to provide a comprehensive framework for how the country responds \nto major disasters, including droughts. However, because the Act has \nbeen interpreted very narrowly since its passage, eight drought-\nstricken States have applied for a major disaster declaration, and all \neight have been denied: California in 2009; Georgia in 2008; Virginia \nin 2003; Maine in 2002; Texas and Oklahoma in 1998; and Minnesota and \nNorth Dakota in 1988.\n  To correct this, the bill amends the Stafford Act. These changes will \nprovide States with greater flexibility to access Federal disaster \nassistance programs. These programs help individuals affected by \ndrought conditions with disaster unemployment assistance and crisis \ncounseling.\n  Let me be clear: this bill does not create new Federal assistance \nprograms. It is an effort to clarify the intent of Congress regarding \nthe Stafford Act, and to make the Stafford Act work better for \ndroughts. When major disasters like a severe drought occur, communities \nshould be eligible for Federal assistance.\n  During these emergency times, I also strongly believe some \nrequirements should be relaxed to relieve the pressures faced by water \nusers. To that effect, my bill proposes giving North-of-Delta water \ncontractors more time to take delivery of water they were allocated in \n2013, so they have more flexibility with their 2014 supplies. It also \ndelays some water contract payments that Central Valley Project \ncontractors must pay the Federal Government to lessen financial stress \nas they confront and recover from the drought.\n  I want to be clear: the success of some of these measures will depend \non how much rain we get and how much water is available to be moved. \nThis bill is not a replacement for rain, but it will give us tools to \nmake water available when we have storms like the one over the weekend. \nMy goal is to make sure we are maximizing every drop of water in the \nsystem and we are doing everything as quickly as possible to offer some \nmeasure of relief.\n  Finally, there are important lessons to learn. Southern California is \nbetter prepared than the rest of the State to cope with this drought \nthanks to decades of work to build storage and improve water \nconservation. Metropolitan Water District, I understand, has enough \nwater supplies for 19 million customers through voluntary water use \nreductions.\n  Were it not for the more than 2 million acre-feet of water reserves, \nincluding 600,000 acre feet in Diamond Valley Lake, Southern California \nwater users would be facing up to 50 percent mandatory water use \nrestrictions.\n  The message is clear: For the long term, we must build additional \nstorage if we are to be prepared for the next drought which is sure to \ncome.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and our counterparts \nin the House, to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2016\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
