Mr. President, many years ago I came to Washington, DC, to \ngo to law school. I came back here because Nevada did not have a law \nschool. Although I had opportunities to go other places, I came back \nhere because it was kind of the thing Nevadans did. I got a job through \nmy Nevada Congressman--we only had one at the time--Walter S. Baring. I \nhad what was called a patronage job. I was a Capitol police officer. I \nwas assigned here to the Capitol, assigned to the House side. That is \nwhat I did. My badge is still in my conference room. I worked the \nevening shift--from 3 to 11, as I recall.\n  When I was a member of the Capitol Police Force, as I have said here \non the floor, I did not do anything that was very dangerous. The most \ndangerous thing I did was direct traffic out on Constitution Avenue. At \nthat time they had subway tracks in the road, and cars would bounce \naround. I did not do anything that was very dangerous; but I was a \npolice officer. I am very proud of that.\n  In this Senate Chamber, as we speak, there are people who are \nassigned to take care of us, staff, and all of the tourists who come \nin. We have tourists in the galleries. The police officers are assigned \neveryplace. Some have uniforms; most of them do not. Their job\n\n[[Page S4852]]\n\nis to do everything they can to make sure this magnificent Capitol \nComplex is safe. Every day there are people who, if they could, would \ndo damage to this Capitol and to the people who work here.\n  In 1998 two of our Capitol police officers were on duty. A crazed \nman--16 years ago--came into the Capitol and shot Jacob Chestnut cold \ndead, right there at what we call the Memorial Door. John Gibson heard \nthis commotion and saved many tourists and staff from this crazed man, \nbut in the process he was also killed. Both officers died that day. \nThey had served a combined 36 years on the force protecting all of us \nand all of the many people who come to this Capitol Complex.\n  I know the families of these two officers. I have met with them on a \nyearly basis. I know nothing can make up for the loss of these two fine \nmen 16 years ago, but I hope their families and friends take comfort in \nknowing that those of us who were here that day hold them in our \nmemories and in our hearts.\n  While it is little solace to their families, the tragedy that day \nmade the Capitol a safer place. It was because of them that we finally \nwere able to make this a safer place. We had worked on it for well more \nthan 10 years. We now have a visitor center. You walk outside; you see \na beautiful lawn. Under that is a visitor center. There is as much \nunderground there as on top of the ground.\n  Now people can come into the Capitol. They can be safe and secure. \nThere are places to go to the bathroom. There is food and wonderful \nviewing in that complex. So because of these two men, we were able to \nget that done and make the Capitol a safer place. We have a Capitol \nvisitor center now which prevents a madman like the one who shot these \ntwo police officers from entering the Capitol. We are grateful for \ntheir sacrifice. We are grateful every day to the devoted men and women \nlike them who guard these hallowed halls.\n  As I remember, we had a Senate retreat in southern Virginia. My wife \nbecame ill. As I have said a number of times before, Agent Gibson \nrushed to her side. He had to run a long way from where they were. I \ncan remember how he was perspiring when he came in. So I have fond \nmemories of these two police officers and recognize the sacrifice they \nmade for us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/24/senate-section/article/S4852-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today I would like to begin by \nremembering two men to whom we owe so much: Officer J.J. Chestnut and \nDetective John Gibson. Exactly 16 years ago these Capitol policemen \nwere shot in the line of duty, paying a terrible price in defense of \nevery one of us--Senators, staffers, pages, fellow officers, and every \nAmerican citizen who passes through these hallowed halls. These men \nknew the grave risk that came with the job. Yet they chose to wear the \nbadge anyway. They made the decision to stand in defense of the \ndemocratic ideal this building symbolizes.\n  We owe these men a debt that can never be repaid. So let's never \nforget their lives or their final act of heroism. We are reminded every \ntime we pass the Capitol Police headquarters, which bears both of their \nnames. We are reminded every time we notice the plaque in the Capitol \nthat commemorates them. We are reminded by observing today's men and \nwomen of the U.S. Capitol Police as they continue to protect this \ninstitution, honorably continuing the watch of these two fallen \nofficers.\n  Today the Senate honors Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson for \ntheir sacrifice. We send our sincere condolences to the family and \nfriends left behind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/24/senate-section/article/S4852-3", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             AMERICAN JOBS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if Senate Democrats were half as \nconcerned about American jobs as they are about saving their own jobs \nthis November, there would be almost no limit to what we could \naccomplish. Yet, rather than work with us to get anything serious \naccomplished for our constituents, we see the majority leader once \nagain bowing to the whims of his campaign consultants and the Senate \nbecoming little more than a campaign studio this week.\n  The majority leader can spend all of his time fighting for the \nconsultant class if he wants, but that will not stop Republicans from \noffering commonsense, job-saving ideas that both sides should be able \nto support. For example, the senior Senator from Utah will offer an \namendment that would repeal a Democratic tax that helped push \nmanufacturing overseas and could kill as many as 165,000 American jobs. \nIt is a measure that would likely pass if the majority leader would \nonly allow a vote. I know some of our friends on the other side plan to \noffer amendments too. The question is, Will those Senators join us to \ndemand that their amendments be considered too or will they allow the \nmajority leader to shut down the legislative process one more time, \nsilencing their constituents. I hope they will make the right decision.\n  Since the majority leader seems so determined to convince everyone \nthat he cares about protecting American jobs this week, I am going to \noffer an opportunity to prove he is serious about it. He can do it by \nallowing a vote or even voting himself for an amendment of mine called \nthe Saving Coal Jobs Act. He has already blocked this bill once before, \nbut I will give him a chance to reconsider.\n  Everyone knows the administration's war on coal jobs is little more \nthan an elitist crusade that threatens to undermine Kentucky's \ntraditionally low utility rates, splinter our manufacturing base, and \nship well-paying jobs overseas. My amendment seeks to push back against \nthis war on coal, this war on ordinary American livelihoods, and it \nseeks to help protect the administration's targets too--Kentucky coal \nfamilies who want little more than to put food on the table and give \ntheir children a better life. It is really not too much to ask. So the \nmajority leader has a choice. Is he in favor of shipping Kentucky jobs \noverseas or will he help me protect the middle class by supporting this \namendment?\n  Regardless of what he decides, though, I am going to keep fighting \nagainst this administration's unfair regulations. Yesterday the EPA \nAdministrator came to Capitol Hill to defend the administration's \nextreme proposed energy regulations. She tried to assure legislators \nthat the administration wanted input from the public as it went about \ndeveloping and implementing its job-killing agenda. But it is hard to \ntake her seriously because earlier this week I met with her in person \nand urged her to hold at least one listening session in coal country, \nthe region most likely to be affected by the administration's \nregulations. She was unmoved. Apparently the Obama administration isn't \nall that interested in what Kentucky thinks. Well, if Washington \nofficials won't come to Kentucky, then Kentuckians will come to \nWashington. Beginning next week, the administration plans to hold one \nof its listening sessions in Washington. I plan to testify and so do \nseveral of my constituents. Even though they will have to travel \nhundreds of miles to get here, these Kentuckians will make Washington \nunderstand they are more than just some statistic. They are our \nneighbors, they are moms and dads, and they refuse to be collateral \ndamage in some elitist war dreamed up in a bureaucratic boardroom in \nWashington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/24/senate-section/article/S4852-4", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4852-S4853]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                       Lt. Col. John Darin Loftis\n\n  Mr. President, today I celebrate the life of a Kentucky airman who \nlost his life while wearing our country's uniform. Lt. Col. John Darin \nLoftis of Paducah, KY, a 17-year veteran of the Air Force, was killed \non February 25, 2012, in an attack on the Interior Ministry in Kabul, \nAfghanistan. He was 44 years old.\n  For his service in uniform, Lieutenant Colonel Loftis received \nseveral awards, medals, and decorations, including the Bronze Star, the \nPurple Heart, the Meritorious Service Medal with oak leaf cluster, the \nAir Force Commendation Medal, the Army Achievement Medal, and the Air \nForce Combat Action Medal.\n\n[[Page S4853]]\n\n  Darin, as his friends called him, was working in the ministry as an \nadviser to a program that developed a team of U.S. service personnel \nskilled in Afghan and Pakistani culture and language. Darin himself \nspoke the Pashto language fluently and also was proficient in Dari and \nArabic, enabling him to relate to the local Afghans. Darin was a \nliaison officer with top Afghan National Police officials in Pashto.\n  Darin's work was so important that after his death he was praised by \nthe Governor of Afghanistan's Zabul Province. The Governor said this \nabout Darin:\n\n       When the Afghan people see that an American is speaking \n     Pashto, they're more inclined to open up to him, and that's \n     the reason why he's so successful. He can go among the local \n     population and get their impression of U.S. forces. He can do \n     this better than any other soldier because he speaks their \n     language and knows their culture.\n\n  Darin's commander, Lt. Gen. Eric Fiel of the Air Force Special \nOperations Command, said this about Darin: Lieutenant Colonel Loftis \n``embodies the first Special Operations Forces truth that humans are \nmore valuable than hardware, and through his work with the Afghan \npeople, he was undoubtedly bettering their society.''\n  Darin's wife Holly agrees with these kind words but has one more \nimportant point to add: ``Darin was a great American, but more \nimportantly he was a devoted father to our two daughters, a loving \nhusband, and caring son.''\n  Born on February 22, 1968, in Indiana, Darin's family moved to \nKentucky when he was 3 years old. He attended Calloway County schools \nfrom kindergarten through his senior year in high school, from where he \ngraduated in 1986. Described as a high school whiz kid by some, Darin \nreceived excellent grades and drove a black Studebaker with plain, \ncream-colored tires.\n  Jerry Ainley, former principal of Calloway County High School, said:\n\n       He was such a fine young man. I remember his smile when \n     he'd greet me in the hallways. He was very polite, a young \n     man of high morals and high integrity, I guess everything \n     you'd think of in an airman.\n\n  Darin went on to study engineering at Vanderbilt. While there, he met \na girl named Holly while working for a university service that arranged \nsecurity for anyone requesting it rather than walking on campus alone.\n  Darin and Holly got married, and in 1992 the couple joined the Peace \nCorps. Together they served 2 years in Papua, New Guinea, with the Duna \ntribe, where Darin spoke Melanesian pidgin. He clearly had a gift for \nlanguages.\n  Loftis entered the Air Force in 1996 and received his commission \nthrough officer training school. Originally classified as a space and \nmissile officer, he became a regional affairs strategist in 2008.\n  By his first tour in Afghanistan in 2009, he had become a major \nserving in special operations forces. He deployed to Afghanistan for \nhis second deployment with the 866th Air Expeditionary Squadron in \n2011.\n  Darin continued to be an excellent student, earning three master's \ndegrees over the course of his Air Force career. His wife Holly \nrecalls: ``He loved learning . . . he loved going to school.''\n  Family was especially important to Darin. John M. Loftis, Darin's \nfather, said:\n\n       He lived for his kids and his family, I can tell you that. \n     When he was home, he fooled with those kids all the time. \n     He'd take them to school. They are going to miss him.\n\n  G24JY6.Darin was so skilled in communicating and respected for \ncementing relationships with the Afghans he worked with in Kabul that \nduring his tour in 2009 he was given a Pashto name--Esan--which \ntranslates to mean generous. Darin explained the nickname to his \ndaughters by saying: ``It's an honorable sense of duty to help \nothers.''\n  In Darin's memory, the U.S. Air Force Special Operations School in \nFlorida dedicated the school's auditorium in his name--an auditorium \nDarin himself had previously taught and lectured in. The class of 1986 \nat Darin's alma mater, Calloway County High School, organized an annual \nscholarship fund in his name, beginning with two $1,000 scholarships to \nmembers of the Class of 2014.\n  We are thinking of Darin's family today as I share his story with my \nSenate colleagues. He leaves behind his wife Holly, his two daughters \nAlison and Camille, his mother Chris Janne, his father John M. Loftis, \nhis brother-in-law Brian Brewer, and many other beloved family members \nand friends.\n  The Airman's Creed, learned by every American airmen, reads in part \nas follows:\n\n     I am an American Airman. . . .\n     Guardian of Freedom and Justice,\n     My Nation's Sword and Shield,\n     Its Sentry and Avenger.\n     I defend my Country with my Life.\n\n  I hope the family of Lt. Col. John Darin Loftis knows this Senate \nbelieves his life and his service fulfilled every word of this sacred \nmotto. That is why we pause today to remember his life, recognize his \nservice, and stand grateful for his sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/24/senate-section/article/S4853-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4853]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  For 3 weeks we have seen fighting going on in Israel and the Gaza \nStrip carried on between the Israeli military and Hamas. In both Gaza \nand Israel lives, unfortunately, are being lost, homes are destroyed, \nfamilies are devastated, security is threatened, and daily life is \npolluted by this war.\n  Since the fighting began, Hamas has made it abundantly clear it is \nunwilling to behave in any responsible manner. The organization is \nusing civilian areas such as schools and hospitals, mosques and \nplaygrounds, as rocket-launching sites. Caches of rockets have been \ndiscovered inside two Gaza schools sponsored by the United Nations. A \nchance for peace emerged when Egypt put forward a cease-fire plan that \nIsrael agreed to. Hamas refused to cease hostilities. Later Israel \nagreed to a temporary truce, the pause requested by Hamas to facilitate \nthe delivery of humanitarian supplies to Gaza. Despite the Israeli \ncooperation, Hamas quickly violated the cease-fire, resuming rocket \nlaunches into Israeli territory.\n  Hamas's actions seek to kill and terrorize those across the Israeli \nborder while they also do great harm to the people of Gaza. Ending the \nrocket attacks would hasten an end to the current violence and \nbloodshed that has taken a disproportionate toll on Gazan lives.\n  On July 17, the Senate unanimously passed a resolution to express \nAmerican support for Israeli self-defense efforts and called for an \nimmediate cessation of Hamas's attacks against Israel. S. Res. 498 also \nserves as a reminder to anyone ascribing legitimacy to Hamas's deadly \naggression toward Israel; despite any governing agreement with Fatah \nand the Palestinian Authority, Hamas's violence is not legitimate in \nthe eyes of the United States of America. Since 1997, Hamas has been \nincluded on the U.S. State Department's list of designated foreign \nterrorist organizations. The group's ongoing attack on civilian targets \nfurther justifies this designation.\n  Hamas's participation in a unity government limits improvements to \nlife in Gaza as American law restricts U.S. aid to Palestinian groups \naligned with terrorist organizations such as Hamas. Gaza's poor \neconomic state, which is cited by Hamas as justification for their \nattacks on Israel, is not at all improved by Hamas's belligerence. \nInstead, Hamas's strategy of violence only worsens Gaza's economic \noutlook. Hamas's actions compound the consequences of funding weapons \nand\n\n[[Page S4854]]\n\nsmuggling tunnels rather than investing in the future of Gaza and its \npeople, the point being that what Hamas is doing is damaging to the \npeople of not only Israel but to the folks who live in Gaza.\n  This reality begs observers to question Hamas's commitment to the \npeople it supposedly represents. Since the beginning of the current \nconflict, Hamas's commitment to violence against Israel appears to be \ntheir primary mission, not the care and well-being of their people. \nUnless cessation of hostilities becomes Hamas's priority, Israel will \nretain and must retain the right to defend its people and the welfare \nof those living in Gaza will regretfully continue to deteriorate.\n  Americans would not tolerate this. We would not. Our constituents \nwould be insistent that we not tolerate the threat of terrorism that \nIsrael faces on a daily basis. Since 1947, attacks from its neighboring \nArab States have repeatedly forced Israel to defend its people.\n  This Senate has and will continue to demonstrate that the United \nStates stands with Israel, especially during these turbulent times as \nIsrael takes necessary action to reduce Hamas's means of terror, to \ndisarm those who stand firmly in the way of a real and lasting peace.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                       Honoring Federal Employees\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to call attention to the important \nefforts made each day by our public servants. We often forget that our \npublic servants are Federal employees who go to work every day with the \nsole mission to make this country a better and safer place to live. Day \nafter day they go about their work receiving little recognition for the \ngreat work they do, and many times, unfortunately, they are actually \nberated rather than acclaimed for what they do during difficult times.\n  Since 2010 I have come to the Senate floor on a regular basis to \nhonor exemplary Federal employees, a tradition that was begun by my \nfriend from Delaware Senator Ted Kaufman.\n  Today I wish to take this opportunity to recognize another \nextraordinary public servant who has served in the U.S. Department of \nTreasury for 41 years. Forty-one years. That is not a typo. Mr. Richard \nL. Gregg has dedicated more than four decades to Federal service. He \nmost recently served as the Fiscal Assistant Secretary at the U.S. \nDepartment of the Treasury.\n\n  Mr. Gregg began his Federal civilian service in 1970 at Treasury's \nFinancial Management Service. During his 10 years at Treasury, he \nserved as the Commissioner of Treasury's Financial Management Service \nand as the Commissioner of the Bureau of Public Debt.\n  Mr. Gregg retired--for the first time--in June 2006 and was asked to \nreturn to Treasury in 2009 to serve as Fiscal Assistant Secretary. Mr. \nGregg retired again this month, and in honor of his second retirement I \nwanted to highlight a couple of his noteworthy accomplishments.\n  During his long tenure at Treasury, Mr. Gregg was well known for his \ninnovative thinking, the ability to make hard decisions, and the desire \nto make government more efficient, more open, and, very importantly, \nless costly.\n  Mr. Gregg led the Treasury into the 21st century by modernizing \nFederal payment operations. He moved Treasury from paper-based benefits \npayments toward the more sensible, secure, and reliable electronic \npayment system. We should have done that a lot earlier. This is a \nreally big deal since Treasury makes more than 1 billion payments per \nyear--think about that, more than 1 billion separate payments per \nyear--including all Social Security benefit payments as well as others. \nHis work will help save taxpayers $1 billion over the next decade. That \nis a pretty great value.\n  Mr. Gregg also helped achieve one of the more rare feats in the \nFederal Government--the actual consolidation of Federal programs. Mr. \nGregg recognized that operations could be improved if Treasury \nconsolidated two complementary Treasury agencies into one. By merging \nTreasury's Financial Management Service, which makes government \npayments, with Treasury's Bureau of Public Debt, which borrows the \nmoney to fund government, taxpayers will save tens of millions over the \nnext decade.\n  This isn't going to clear up our $17 trillion in debt that goes up $3 \nbillion a night, but these are the kinds of commonsense steps in the \nright direction we need to see more often.\n  I am also proud that Mr. Gregg is not only an inspiring public \nservant, but he is also a Virginian. He resides in Springfield, VA.\n  I thank Mr. Richard L. Gregg for his leadership at the Department of \nTreasury and for being a tireless advocate for the American people. His \nwork in support of a more efficient, responsive, and accountable \ngovernment will continue to make government work better for all \nAmericans for many years to come.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence after \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate is postcloture on the \nmotion to proceed.\n  Mr. TESTER. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                             VA Health Care\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I have come to realize that we are never \ngoing to get politics completely out of the legislative process. In the \nsystem we have today, there is always another election and there is \nalways another campaign. This political posturing must be addressed. It \nis hurting our democracy, and it is a prime reason Congress's approval \nrating is in the single digits.\n  Today politics is hurting the men and women who bravely served our \nNation. It is hurting our veterans.\n  When the news about the problems at the VA became public, lawmakers \nran to the press and slammed the VA. They called for reform and \naccountability. They even dragged good men through the mud to score \npolitical points.\n  Members from both sides of the aisle said politics needed to be set \naside because if there is just one thing that should cause our \npoliticians to look past political games, it is our veterans. It is our \ncommitment to our veterans,\n\n[[Page S4855]]\n\nour commitment to making sure they get the care they have earned. But \ntoday some lawmakers decided to forgo the hard work of compromise. \nInstead of putting veterans first, they have made improving veterans \ncare political.\n  We have been working for 6 weeks to find a compromise bill that \nimproves veterans' access to care, that holds the VA more accountable, \nand that hires more medical professionals so veterans can get the care \nthey need when they need it. But for 6 weeks Members on the other side \nof the aisle in both the House and the Senate have balked at the cost \nof taking care of our veterans. Many of these lawmakers are the same \nones--the same ones--who put our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan on a \ncredit card. Many of them didn't blink twice when we sent hundreds of \ntroops into Iraq earlier this month. Way back when, when the Iraq war \nwas authorized, Congress spent less than 3 weeks debating Iraq. But now \nwhen it comes to taking care of our men and women who served--many in \nthe same wars they put on a credit card--they worry about the cost.\n\n  Well, I have news for them: Taking care of our veterans is a cost of \nwar. We do not send young Americans to war and then not take care of \nthem. And it should not be the case that we rush to war but drag our \nfeet when it comes to our vets.\n  Republicans today will announce they are forgoing the veterans \nconference committee and introducing a bill of their own. It is not a \nproposal aimed at benefiting our veterans. It is not. It is not a bill \nthat takes the best ideas of veterans organizations, experts, or VA \nofficials and moves the ball forward. It is a proposal that is meant to \ngain political favor. It is a proposal that sheds the responsibility of \ngoverning, of honoring our commitment to veterans. It is a proposal \nthat is aimed at the November election.\n  Chairman Sanders has been working hard to bridge the divide and \nproduce a bill that gets veterans the support they need and can pass in \nCongress, but Chairman Sanders can't do it himself, and neither can \njust one-half of the conference committee.\n  I am incredibly disappointed by what is taking place today. I had \nreal hopes that this conference committee could rise above the \npolitical process and get something done for our veterans.\n  I have been holding listening sessions with Montana's veterans since \nearly June. They didn't have much faith. Those veterans did not have \nmuch faith in Washington politicians solving the problem, but I told \nthem it could be done. If we don't change course, if we don't leave \npolitics at the door as we promised, then it is going to be hard for me \nto go back to Montana and look those veterans in the eye.\n  We can do better, and we must do better.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Booker). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, on June 11--a month and a half ago--in a \nvery strong bipartisan way, the Senate voted 93 to 3--an overwhelming \nvote--to pass legislation written by Senator John McCain, a Republican, \nand myself to address crises facing our veterans community and the VA \nand to protect and defend the men and women who have put their lives on \nthe line to defend us. I wish to take this opportunity again to thank \nSenator McCain for his very strong efforts on getting that legislation \npassed.\n  As you know, the legislation we passed was estimated by the \nCongressional Budget Office, the CBO, to cost about $35 billion. At \njust about the same time, the House of Representatives passed \nlegislation dealing with, more or less, the same issues, and the bill \nthey passed in the House was estimated by CBO to cost $44 billion--$9 \nbillion more than what we passed in the Senate.\n  In the last 6 weeks, my staff, my colleagues, and I have been working \nvery hard to refine this legislation, to come up with a more reasonable \npricetag, and to address the needs of our veterans community in a \nsignificant way. In that process, I have been accused by some of \n``moving the goalposts.'' I guess I have. I have moved the goalposts so \nthe legislation we are introducing today is substantially lower--\nsubstantially lower--than what passed the Senate and what passed the \nHouse. If that is called moving the goalposts, I suspect in this case \nit is moving the goalposts in a positive direction. In fact, the bill \nwe are presenting would cost less than $25 billion--a lot of money, no \ndoubt--but that is some $10 billion less than what we passed on the \nSenate floor, and it is $19 billion less than what the House passed.\n  Our proposal is a commonsense proposal which deals in a significant \nway with the needs of the veterans community. What it does is provide \nemergency funding for contract services so veterans can, when they find \nthemselves in long waiting periods--as in fact is the case in a number \nof locations around the country--they can go outside of the VA and get \nprivate health care or care at a community health center or whatever. \nThey no longer have to wait during this emergency period for long \nperiods of time to get into the VA. I think that is a very important \npart of this proposal. It is something we have to do.\n  In addition, what we also say is if a veteran is living more than 40 \nmiles from a VA facility--and there are veterans who in some cases are \nliving hundreds of miles away--they do not have to, when they are ill, \nget in their car and travel for 3 or 4 hours to get health care at a VA \nfacility. They will be able to go to a non-VA facility, a private \nphysician, if they live more than 40 miles away from a VA facility. I \nthink that is a significant step forward.\n  But what our legislation also does is address an issue of huge \nconcern to the veterans community. Just yesterday--just yesterday--I \nreceived, and many members in the Veterans' Committee received, a \nletter from 16 major veterans organizations. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave the letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 23, 2014.\n     Chairman Bernie Sanders,\n     Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Ranking Member Richard Burr,\n     Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Chairman Jeff Miller,\n     House Committee on Veterans' Affairs,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Ranking Member Mike Michaud,\n     House Committee on Veterans' Affairs,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Chairman Sanders, Chairman Miller, Ranking Member Burr, \n     Ranking Member Michaud: Last week, Acting Secretary Sloan \n     Gibson appeared before the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee \n     to discuss the progress made by the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs (VA) over the past two months to address the health \n     care access crisis for thousands of veterans. Secretary \n     Gibson testified that after re-examining VA's resource needs \n     in light of the revelations about secret waiting lists and \n     hidden demand, VA required supplemental resources totaling \n     $17.6 billion for the remainder of this fiscal year through \n     the end of FY 2017.\n       As the leaders of organizations representing millions of \n     veterans, we agree with Secretary Gibson that there is a need \n     to provide VA with additional resources now to ensure that \n     veterans can access the health care they have earned, either \n     from VA providers or through non-VA purchased care. We urge \n     Congress to expeditiously approve supplemental funding that \n     fully addresses the critical needs outlined by Secretary \n     Gibson either prior to, or at the same time as, any \n     compromise legislation that may be reported out of the House-\n     Senate Conference Committee. Whether it costs $17 billion or \n     $50 billion over the next three years, Congress has a sacred \n     obligation to provide VA with the funds it requires to meet \n     both immediate needs through non-VA care and future needs by \n     expanding VA's internal capacity.\n       Last month, we wrote to you to outlining the principles and \n     priorities essential to addressing the access crisis, a copy \n     of which is attached. The first priority ``. . . must be to \n     ensure that all veterans currently waiting for treatment must \n     be provided access to timely, convenient health care as \n     quickly as medically indicated.'' Second, when VA is unable \n     to provide that care directly, ``. . . VA must be involved in \n     the timely coordination of and fully responsible for prompt \n     payment for all authorized non-VA care.'' Third, Congress \n     must provide supplemental funding for this year and \n     additional funding for next year to pay for the temporary \n     expansion of non-VA purchased care. Finally, whatever actions \n     VA or Congress takes to address the current access crisis \n     must also ``. . . protect, preserve and strengthen the VA \n     health care\n\n[[Page S4856]]\n\n     system so that it remains capable of providing a full \n     continuum of high-quality, timely health care to all enrolled \n     veterans.''\n       In his testimony to the Senate, Secretary Gibson stated \n     that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has already \n     reached out to over 160,000 veterans to get them off wait \n     lists and into clinics. He said that VHA accomplished this by \n     adding more clinic hours, aggressively recruiting to fill \n     physician vacancies, deploying mobile medical units, using \n     temporary staffing resources, and expanding the use of \n     private sector care. Gibson also testified that VHA made over \n     543,000 referrals for veterans to receive non-VA care in the \n     private sector--91,000 more than in the comparable period a \n     year ago. In a subsequent press release, VA stated that it \n     had reduced the New Enrollee Appointment Report (NEAR) from \n     its peak of 46,000 on June 1, 2014 to 2,000 as of July 1, \n     2014, and that there was also a reduction of over 17,000 \n     veterans on the Electronic Waiting List since May 15, 2014. \n     We appreciate this progress, but more must be done to ensure \n     that every enrolled veteran has access to timely care.\n       The majority of the supplemental funding required by VA, \n     approximately $8.1 billion, would be used to expand access to \n     VA health care over the next three fiscal years by hiring up \n     to 10,000 new clinical staff, including 1,500 new doctors, \n     nurses and other direct care providers. That funding would \n     also be used to cover the cost of expanded non-VA purchased \n     care, with the focus shifting over the three years from non-\n     VA purchased care to VA-provided care as internal capacity \n     increased. The next biggest portion would be $6 billion for \n     VA's physical infrastructure, which according to Secretary \n     Gibson would include 77 lease projects for outpatient clinics \n     that would add about two million square feet, as well as \n     eight major construction projects and 700 minor construction \n     and non-recurring maintenance projects that together could \n     add roughly four million appointment slots at VA facilities. \n     The remainder of the funding would go to IT enhancements, \n     including scheduling, purchased care and project coordination \n     systems, as well as a modest increase of $400 million for \n     additional ``VBA staff to address the claims and appeals \n     backlogs.\n       In reviewing the additional resource requirements \n     identified by Secretary Gibson, the undersigned find them to \n     be commensurate with the historical funding shortfalls \n     identified in recent years by many of our organizations, \n     including The Independent Budget (IB), which is authored and \n     endorsed by many of our organizations. For example, in the \n     prior ten VA budgets, the amount of funding for medical care \n     requested by the Administration and ultimately provided to VA \n     by Congress was more than $7.8 billion less than what was \n     recommended by the IB. Over just the past five years, the IB \n     recommended $4 billion more than VA requested or Congress \n     approved and for next year, FY 2015, the IB has recommended \n     over $2 billion more than VA requested. Further corroboration \n     of the shortfall in VA's medical care funding came two weeks \n     ago from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), which issued \n     a revised report on H.R. 3230 estimating that, ``. . . under \n     current law for 2015 and CBO's baseline projections for 2016, \n     VA's appropriations for health care are not projected to keep \n     pace with growth in the patient population or growth in per \n     capita spending for health care--meaning that waiting times \n     will tend to increase. . .''\n       Similarly, over the past decade the amount of funding \n     requested by VA for major and minor construction, and the \n     final amount appropriated by Congress, has been more than $9 \n     billion less than what the IB estimated was needed to allow \n     VA sufficient space to deliver timely, high-quality care. \n     Over the past five years alone, that shortfall is more than \n     $6.6 billion and for next year the VA budget request is more \n     than $2.5 billion less than the IB recommendation. Funding \n     for nonrecurring maintenance (NRM) has also been woefully \n     inadequate. Importantly, the IB recommendations closely \n     mirror VA's Strategic Capital Investment Plan (SCIP), which \n     VA uses to determine infrastructure needs. According to SCIP, \n     VA should invest between $56 to $69 billion in facility \n     improvements over the next ten years, which would require \n     somewhere between $5 to $7 billion annually. However, the \n     Administration's budget requests over the past four years \n     have averaged less than $2 billion annually for major and \n     minor construction and for NRM, and Congress has not \n     significantly increased those funding requests in the final \n     appropriations.\n       Taking into account the progress achieved by VA over the \n     past two months, and considering the funding shortfalls our \n     organizations have identified over the past decade and in \n     next year's budget, the undersigned believe that Congress \n     must quickly approve supplemental funding that fully meets \n     the critical needs identified by Secretary Gibson, and which \n     fulfills the principles and priorities we laid out a month \n     ago. Such an approach would be a reasonable and practical way \n     to expand access now, while building internal capacity to \n     avoid future access crises in the future. In contrast to the \n     legislative proposals in the Conference Committee which would \n     require months to promulgate new regulations, establish new \n     procedures and set up new offices, the VA proposal could have \n     an immediate impact on increasing access to care for veterans \n     today by building upon VA's ongoing expanded access \n     initiatives and sustaining them over the next three years. \n     Furthermore, by investing in new staff and treatment space, \n     VA would be able to continue providing this expanded level of \n     care, even while increasing its use of purchased care when \n     and where it is needed.\n       In our jointly signed letter last month, we applauded both \n     the House and Senate for working expeditiously and in a \n     bipartisan manner to move legislation designed to address the \n     access crisis, and we understand you are continuing to work \n     towards a compromise bill. As leaders of the nation's major \n     veterans organization, we now ask that you work in the same \n     bipartisan spirit to provide VA supplemental funding \n     addressing the needs outlined by Secretary Gibson to the \n     floor as quickly as feasible, approve it and send it to the \n     President so that he can enact it to help ensure that no \n     veteran waits too long to get the care they earned through \n     their service. We look forward to your response.\n           Respectfully,\n         Garry J.

Mr. President, 16 major veterans organizations, \nincluding the Disabled American Veterans, the Veterans of Foreign \nWars--the VFW--Paralyzed Veterans of America, the Vietnam Veterans of \nAmerica, the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, the Military \nOfficers Association of America, and many others--wonderful veterans \norganizations that have worked for years representing the needs of \nmillions and millions of veterans--what these organizations say in this \nletter is that while we must address the immediate crisis of doing away \nwith these long waiting lines and allowing veterans to get private \ncare, what they also say--loudly and clearly--is that the VA must have \nthe doctors, the nurses, and the space capacity that it needs so that \nin the future it will be able to permanently eliminate these long \nwaiting lines so that 2 years from now, 3 years from now, when veterans \ncome into the VA, they will get quality care, they will get timely \ncare. That is what the veterans organizations have said.\n  I will quote to you one small paragraph of a long letter. They say \nthat the charge of the conference committee should be ``to ensure that \nall veterans currently waiting for treatment must be provided access to \ntimely, convenient health care as quickly as medically indicated,'' and \nat the same time ``protect, preserve and strengthen the VA health care \nsystem so that it remains capable of providing a full continuum of \nhigh-quality, timely health care to all enrolled veterans.''\n  Last week, in a Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee meeting, Sloan \nGibson, the Acting Secretary of the VA, stated that the VA needed over \n$16 billion in order to hire thousands and thousands of doctors, \nnurses, other medical providers. In many VA facilities doctors do not \nhave the examining rooms they need. There are space problems all over \nthis country. What the veterans organizations--16 of them--said loudly \nand clearly is that Sloan Gibson, the new Acting Secretary of the VA--\napproved with wide Republican support--they said we support his \nproposal.\n  Our legislation does not give the VA all that Mr. Gibson would like, \nbut we do provide them with the doctors and the nurses and the medical \nstaff they need so we do not continue to have\n\n[[Page S4857]]\n\nlong waiting lines at VA hospitals all over this country, so we do not \ncome back 2 years from now in the same position, with veterans not \nbeing able to get timely care.\n  I have worked for a month and a half with my House Republican \ncolleagues, led by the Veterans' Affairs chairman there, Jeff Miller, \nto find a compromise. Everybody knows the House looks at the world \ndifferently than the Senate--we all know that--and if we go forward, we \nneed a compromise.\n  We have put good-faith offers on the table time and time again and we \nhave tried to meet our Republican colleagues more than halfway, but I \nam very sad to say that at this point--and I hope this changes--but at \nthis point I can only conclude, with great reluctance, that the good \nfaith we have shown is simply not being reciprocated by the other side.\n  Standing here and saying this is the last thing I want to be doing. \nOur veterans deserve a responsible solution to this crisis.\n  Last night--this is an example of what has happened--somewhere around \n10 o'clock in the night, the cochairman of the veterans conference \ncommittee, Mr. Miller in the House, announced unilaterally, without my \nknowledge or without my concurrence, that he was going to hold a so-\ncalled conference committee meeting in order to introduce his \nproposals.\n  Needless to say, his proposal is something I have yet to see. I do \nnot know what it is. This is a proposal nobody on our side has seen. My \nunderstanding is he then wants to take this to the House on Monday to \ncome up with a vote. In other words, his idea of negotiation is: We \nhave a proposal. Take it or leave it. Any sixth grader in a school in \nthe United States understands this is not negotiation, this is not what \ndemocracy is about.\n  I note the presence on the floor of the coauthor of the bill passed \nin the Senate, Senator McCain, and I am happy to yield the floor for \nSenator McCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, could I say that I understand the \nfrustration the chairman of the committee feels, and this has been, for \neveryone involved, a very frustrating process. I think to some degree \nthe real effort has been diverted on this whole issue of the pay-fors, \nthe cost of this legislation. I fully understand the frustration of the \nSenator from Vermont, the distinguished chairman of the committee. I \nwould hope we could maybe, all of us, cool down some and maybe go to \nthis meeting at noon, and ahead of time--as far ahead of time as is \npossible--tell the chairman what their proposal is and also a \ncounterproposal of Senator Sanders' would be fully considered by the \nconference as well.\n  It is the proper process to go to a conference. Unfortunately, we \nonly did that once, and that was largely a pro forma kind of activity.\n  Again, I fully appreciate Senator Sanders, who has worked very hard \non this very terrible issue. But I hope all of my colleagues recognize \nthat for us to not come to agreement on legislation which is not that \ndissimilar, which passed this body 93 to 3, and over on the House side \nI believe it was unanimous, is a gross disservice to those who deserve \nour consideration most.\n  There is no group of citizens in this country who deserve our help in \nthis time of crisis more than our veterans, the men and women who have \nserved. So may I say to my friend from Vermont, who, like me, is very \ngiven to calm deliberation of all issues, we are very similar in that \nrespect. I say, with some humor, I hope, that I hope we can go to this \nconference at noon today and sit down together, and listen to the \nvarious proposals.\n  I believe the fundamentals, as were passed by this body on a 93-to-3 \nvote, should be a basis for largely the final legislation we reach. The \nother body's legislation is strikingly similar. It seems to me where we \nhave a difference is how much additional funding to the fundamentals of \nthe legislation we are considering.\n  I was watching my friend from Vermont on the floor here. I want to \nsay to him, I fully understand his frustration. I hope we will be able \nto sit down at noon with both Republicans and Democrats, both sides of \nthe aisle, with the overriding priority of not leaving and going out \ninto an August recess without acting on this issue. Veterans are dying. \nThere are allegations that 40 veterans in my State at the Phoenix VA \nhospital died because they did not receive care. There is not a policy/\nacademic issue here. This is the very lives of the men and women who \nare serving.\n  I guess for the third time I would say to my colleague, and I will \nyield to him in just a second: I would be more than happy to look at \nwhat we have proposed and what has passed through this body, as \ncompared to what the other side of the Capitol is proposing. Perhaps we \ncan come to some agreement and compromise, which is the way we are \nsupposed to pass laws in this body.\n  I ask unanimous consent to yield to Senator Sanders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. First of all, I want to thank Senator McCain again for \nall of his hard work on this issue.\n  Let me ask a few questions. The Senator and I have been talking the \nlast few days. Does the Senator not think--he has been here for 1 or 2 \nyears--that the best way to go forward is for people to sit down at a \ntable and knock out their differences? And then the idea of presenting \nit to a conference is absolutely right. But the Senator knows, and I \nknow, that what conference committees are largely about are 5-minute \nspeeches.\n  I have been disappointed that I have not--I think the Senator will \nagree with me, maybe not, that the best way forward is for people to \nsit down in a room and work out their differences, not to go forward \nwith unilateral statements. Does that make sense?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Well, could I say to my friend from Vermont, I believe it \nis a matter of simple courtesy, that the Senator, as the chairman of a \ncommittee, should be asked to come to a meeting with the other major \nchairmen and ranking members of the committees. I hope that kind of \nthing does not happen again.\n  What I would like to see--and I beg my colleagues to sit down and \nlet's work this out. It is a matter of money. It is not a matter of the \nprovisions of the bill. That cannot be the reason for us not to reach \nsome agreement. I intend at noon to attend. I intend to make a strong \ncase that we would be glad to hear any proposal by the chairmen and \nranking members on the other side of the Capitol, and that we would \nhave a counterproposal and maybe could start a discussion and dialog \nwhich could lead to an agreement.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Let me ask Senator McCain one more question. I thank the \nSenator very much. He is not on, at this moment, the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, but he has jumped into this with both feet and is playing a \nvery big role. Would the Senator be prepared if, generally speaking, \nwhat happens is the chairmen and ranking members of the Senate and the \nHouse get together--you are not the chairman, you are not the ranking \nmember, but I think you could play a good role. Would the Senator be \nprepared to sit down with the other four members, myself, the other \nthree, and help us reach a compromise?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would be more than glad to do that, I would say to my \nfriend from Vermont. I would also like to say I hope the participation \nof a number of people would lead us to some agreement today. Because \nonce we reach an agreement, then, of course, we have to go through the \nnormal votes and all of the things that require some period of time.\n\n  I want to say to my friends who are deeply concerned about the costs \nhere of some of these provisions: My argument is that, yes, we should \nseek ways to pay for as much as we can. I believe we can compromise on \nsome areas of spending. But we cannot allow that alone to prevent us \nfrom acting.\n  I thank my friend from Vermont. I look forward to engaging with him. \nI think maybe it is important that we show courtesy to all Members who \nare involved in this, including the chairman of the committee. I thank \nthe Senator.\n  Mr. SANDERS. One more second. I wanted to paraphrase. Tell me if I am \nmisquoting. I do not have it in front of me, but when we were debating \nthis bill on the floor, the Senator said--we were talking about \nemergency funding--something to the effect of if this is not an \nemergency, I do not know\n\n[[Page S4858]]\n\nwhat an emergency is. Is that a correct paraphrase?\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is absolutely my conviction, that the reason why we \nhave emergency funding from time to time in times of crisis is for when \nthere is an emergency. I will repeat: I do not know of a greater \ndomestic emergency than the care we owe the men and women who have \nserved this country.\n  I thank my colleague. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank Senator McCain very much for his statements and \nfor his hard work on this and would reiterate what he said; that is, my \nbelief that what we have here on the Senate floor, that if taking care \nof the men and women who have put their lives on the line to defend us \nand who came home without arms or legs, or without their eyesight or \n500,000 of them who came home with post-traumatic stress disorder or \ntraumatic brain injury--if that is not an emergency, taking care of \nthose brave men and women, I agree with Senator McCain, I do not know \nwhat an emergency is.\n  I am happy to yield the floor for my colleague from Alaska, Senator \nBegich.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I say to my chairman on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, \nwe talked very briefly on the phone. I wanted to come down here because \nI find this amazing. I am new around here. I know it has been almost 6 \nyears. I still consider myself new in the process. But late last night, \nearly this morning, I get a notice of a supposed conference committee \nmeeting, which I was totally unaware of, was unaware of the proposals \nthey are putting on the other side. I would like to have time--I know \non the other side they talk a lot about transparency and timeliness and \nmaking sure the public is aware of what they are doing. But, lo and \nbehold, they just kind of snap together a meeting because they have an \nidea that they want to move forward.\n  I am all game for more ideas on how to solve the problems with our \nveterans. But the public demands--demands--us to solve this problem, \nand also demands it to be done in a transparent way, not in the dark of \nthe night a meeting is called. The chairman of the other side, in this \ncase the Senator from Vermont, the chairman of the Senate committee, is \nnot even notified.\n  I recognize Senator McCain's comments about the courtesy. It should \nbe a courtesy. But on top of it, the basic understanding of compromise \nand working with each other--that is what has to happen. We are not \nseeing that. We had a conference committee. We all made 5-minute \nspeeches, grand statements about how to help veterans. We all want to \ndo that. But it also means sitting down, working with each other, \nputting proposals out. I think the way the chairman described it best \nis: Roll up your sleeves and solve this problem.\n  Think about this: What is the real issue here? You heard it from \nSenator McCain, that we pretty much have agreement on a lot of the \nbasic issues. It is the money.\n  What is so amazing to me--I was not here when the wars were decided \nto be funded or, excuse me, not funded--two trillion dollars, \nAfghanistan even more. But even if you use that $2 trillion number, \nwhat we are talking about today is about 1 percent, 1 percent to take \ncare of the veterans and their families who put their lives on the \nline, have come back, some missing limbs, some having mental issues, a \nvariety of services they need, they earned, they deserve.\n\n  You know, when you think about it, my simple statement--the chairman \nhas heard me say this before: You are for veterans or you are not.\n  We are going to quibble and nickel-and-dime our veterans. I \nappreciate what the chairman has done trying to lower the costs, trying \nto find compromise. But this is, as Senator McCain said, an emergency. \nWe need to take care of these veterans. For the House to nickel-and-\ndime our veterans is absolutely obscene. It is outrageous. They served \nour country. We need to do what we can to take care of them. It does \nnot mean having midnight emails to tell us about a meeting that is \ngoing to occur on a day 12 hours later when I have no idea what their \nproposal is. They have not shared it with me. It would be nice. They \nare all about transparency. Let's do it. Let's have transparency. Let's \nhave a debate.\n  I know the chairman has been working on this for the last 6 weeks. \nMany of us met, as the chairman in the last week did, talking about--\nwith the new potential Secretary, which I am very excited for. He \nalready has a 90-day idea, a plan, which I was amazed to see that he is \nalready moving forward. I met with him yesterday. I told him: Be bold. \nStart doing things. Get nominated, get approved, let's get some stuff \ngoing.\n  But for this body on the other side to just out of the blue decide \nthey are going to have a conference--usually the way it works--maybe I \nam wrong--a conference committee usually means Senate and House. The \ntwo chairmen talk to each other, pick a time, everyone tells their \nMembers, and we all attend. We see proposals. We see paperwork \nbeforehand. It is transparent. The press is aware of it, the public is \naware of it. It is open to the people.\n  This is like a midnight ride to, in my view, potentially \nshortchanging our veterans. I am outraged. The chairman probably got \nthat sense when I sent an email to the chairman this morning. Within \nseconds we were on the phone, because this is not how we need to do \nthis business. The veterans deserve the care; they earned it; we owe it \nto them. The bill is due. It is time to pay up and quit nickel-and-\ndiming our veterans. Prepare the services they need. Give the VA the \ncapacity they need in order to perform the many different services, \nfrom hiring people--the chairman is right--nurses, doctors, mental \nhealth providers. We need them all.\n  I am very proud of some of the work--you heard me talk about it \nbefore--in Alaska. But we are one State. There are 49 other States. We \nneed to do everything we can. I came down here--I had something else \ngoing on right now, but I was very frustrated and outraged by this lack \nof transparency on the body that proclaims to always talk about \ntransparency.\n  But again, I can go on a rant here. I am going to stop. I am going to \nsay the last thing I will say is: This is an emergency. We know it. The \nAmerican people know it. Quit nickel-and-diming our veterans. Quit \ncomplaining about: Is it $25 or $26 billion. It is an emergency. We did \nnot complain about one dime when they wanted all of the money for the \nwars: $2 trillion, $3 trillion. Actually, as some remember those \nphotos, we put cash on pallets--cash on pallets--and shipped it over \nthere. Now it is time to take care of our veterans. It is time to put \nup or shut up. It is time to get the work done. You are for veterans or \nyou are against veterans. It is a simple equation.\n  It is a simple equation.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank Senator Begich.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n\n\n                               Humane Act\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, there is no question that immigration is \none of the toughest, most divisive issues we talk about in Washington, \nDC, perhaps because it is an economic issue, it involves cultural \nconsiderations, and it also includes security concerns. It is not just \nany one of those things; it is basically all of those wrapped into one.\n  At the same time, I have been impressed by the fact that the ongoing \nborder crisis that is now occurring in South Texas has produced a \nmoment of bipartisan consensus and clarity, which are rare when we talk \nabout immigration. For example, we all agree that the United States \nmust continue to uphold the rule of law, with which all of us are \nbetter off--including the people who want to come to the United States \nas immigrants, if they can come through a legal system in an orderly \nway and not as a flood of humanity who have surrendered themselves to \nthe tender mercies of the criminal organizations that funnel children \nand other immigrants from Central America through Mexico into South \nTexas.\n  We all agree that our policies should be one of not encouraging \nCentral American children, and particularly their parents putting their \nlives at risk in the hands of these criminal organizations. We all \nagree that the present levels of chaos and confusion on our southern \nborder are totally unacceptable. No one is arguing for the status quo, \nto my knowledge. They are unacceptable from both a security perspective \nand from a humanitarian perspective.\n\n[[Page S4859]]\n\n  I said just a moment ago that no one is arguing that the status quo \nis acceptable, but I fear that unless we sit down and reason together, \nwe are going to end with a status quo before we leave for the August \nrecess. Unless we are successful in passing the needed policy changes \nthat will actually address some of the causes of the current crisis--as \nwell as appropriate money that is needed on an emergency basis to help \nbuild capacity to deal with it--the status quo is what we are going to \nget. That would be disappointing and it would be tragic.\n  So people may have good ideas, and I would love to hear them. But \nworking together with my colleague Henry Cuellar from the House--Henry \nlikes to call himself a Blue Dog Democrat, but he is from Laredo, TX, \nlives on the border and understands it very well--he and I have come up \nwith a bipartisan, bicameral proposal that would discourage illegal \nimmigration from Central America and elsewhere by ending the de facto \npolicy of catch-and-release.\n  What I mean by that is when people are coming into the country \nillegally, they are detained by the Border Patrol. But we know there is \na policy of de facto release once they are detained because many of \nthem are given a notice to appear for a future court hearing and they \nnever show up.\n  I had one former head of the Drug Enforcement Administration who \nsaid: Everybody knows that a notice to appear should really be retitled \na ``notice to disappear'' because that is what happens.\n  If people are successful in navigating this glitch in our enforcement \nsystem, then they are going to keep coming and the cartels and the \npeople who make money off of transporting people through this perilous \njourney will continue--as I have spoken about numerous times--from \nCentral America through Mexico--a journey in which women are routinely \nsexually assaulted, the migrants are routinely kidnapped and held for \nransom, and some never make it because they die of injuries or \nexposure.\n  If we don't fix that by the time we leave for our August recess, we \nwill have failed in some of our more basic responsibilities. But more \nspecifically, our bill would reform a 2008 human trafficking law that \nactually passed, essentially, by unanimous consent. Nobody dreamed that \nit would be exploited as it has been in a way that weakened U.S. \nimmigration enforcement and incentivized Central American children to \nrisk everything they have to make this perilous journey from Central \nAmerica to Mexico.\n  I have said earlier what I believe to be the fact--the cartels are \nsmart. I mean, these are rich, wealthy criminal organizations with a \nlot of shrewd and inventive people. What they have figured out is a \nbusiness model to exploit this vulnerability in the 2008 law that we \nneed to address before we leave.\n  I will give one sense of the problem. On Tuesday of this week, 20 \nunaccompanied minors from Central America had hearings scheduled before \na Federal immigration court in Dallas--20 scheduled; 18 failed to show \nup. So roughly 10 percent showed up, and the other 18 didn't show up. \nWe currently don't have the resources through Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement to locate those children and make sure they actually do \nappear. What happens is they are part of that 40 percent of illegal \nimmigration, people who enter the country, just simply melt into the \nlandscape, and we don't hear from them again, but they are still here.\n  Given how few unaccompanied minors actually appear for their \nhearings, Members of both parties have expressed their view that the \n2008 law needs to be changed.\n  The Secretary of Homeland Security, whom I talked to as recently as \nyesterday, said on Tuesday: The administration has asked for a change \nin the law, and we are in active discussions with Congress right now \nabout doing that.\n  That is a little bit mysterious to me because the majority leader has \nsaid the border is secure and he is not interested in taking up any \nreforms such as the HUMANE Act Congressman Cuellar and I have \nsponsored.\n  I would say to the majority leader, if you don't think that is the \nright solution, then where is yours? Are there other ideas that people \nhave that are better ideas? I am game.\n  I think we ought to have that discussion, and we ought to be focused \non trying to fix it as Secretary Johnson said is needed. I am sure \nthere will be some differences, but that is what this place is for, to \nwork out those differences and come up with the 80 percent solution, \nhopefully, and then get the job done.\n  But the irony of what Secretary Johnson has said is that the \nadministration acknowledges that change is needed. But is any change \nforthcoming from the majority leader?\n\n  Well, apparently it is not, because he is in the process of having us \nvote on a so-called clean emergency appropriations bill without any \nreforms attached to it. I have called this a blank check, and indeed I \nbelieve it is, because it is not responsible just to spend the money \nwithout trying to fix the problem. Indeed, if history is any guide--and \nI think it is--we are seeing these numbers go up every year.\n  In other words, it is estimated that of the 57,000 unaccompanied \nminors that have been detained at our southwestern border since August, \nthat number could grow as high as 90,000 this year. Next year, the \nestimate is it could be as many as 145,000.\n  I know the Presiding Officer has read, as I have, stories in the \nWashington Post, the New York Times, and elsewhere about the backlash \nthat is occurring around the country as these children are being \ntransported and warehoused in different locations around the country. \nThis is going to do nothing but get worse, in my view, as the numbers \ncontinue to escalate and as we don't deal with the source of the \nproblem.\n  This is a very dangerous situation where the American people are \ndemanding we act on our best judgment, trying to work together in a \nbicameral, bipartisan way. But so far at least, the majority leader, \nthe Democratic leader has rejected any changes in the 2008 law--even \nalong the lines that Secretary Johnson, Secretary of Homeland Security, \nhas suggested.\n  I have actually heard there are proposals, legislative language that \nhas been floated among our Democratic colleagues in the Senate. But \nunder orders of the White House, none of that has been shared with \nanyone on this side of the aisle. I hope that changes because we need \nto be sharing ideas. We need to be working toward a consensus here \nbecause we have basically the rest of this week and next week, then we \nare out of here, and the problem is not going to get better. It is only \ngoing to get worse. We could use some help from the President, using \nsome of his political capital--the power and the authority that only \nthe resident of the White House has--to try to work together with \nCongress to get something done.\n  Seven weeks ago he called this an urgent, humanitarian crisis, but \nfor some reason unknown to me, the President has still refused to go to \nthe border himself to witness what is happening there. I worry he is \nliving in a bubble--which I think all Presidents are prone to do unless \nthey are careful and fight against it--that does not allow him to \nappreciate the seriousness of this situation and how bad it will \ncontinue to grow.\n  I was in McAllen, TX, last Friday, and I was pleased to see a number \nof our colleagues had traveled down to the border: Senator Murkowski of \nAlaska, Senator Hirono of Hawaii, Senator Blumenthal of Connecticut, \nand other Members of the House--from California, Colorado, and Texas. I \nam grateful to them for coming down to the site of this huge crisis and \ntrying to help work with us to try to figure out what needs to be done \nin order to resolve it.\n  I wish the President would take the same opportunity to see with his \nown eyes what his fellow Democrats saw. When I was in McAllen and then \nin Mission, TX--which is close to McAllen--last Friday, they made \ncrystal clear to me and Congressman Cuellar that they didn't care if we \nwere Republicans or Democrats. As a matter of fact, that part of our \nState is heavily Democratic. What they cared about is whether we were \nserious about offering a meaningful solution to this crisis.\n  Can you imagine what impact there is on the local communities and on \nthe State of Texas? I mean, this isn't broadly spread along the entire \nborder,\n\n[[Page S4860]]\n\nthis is concentrated on the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas. It is \noverwhelming the capacity of those local communities and of our State \nto deal with it.\n  This is why our Governor, in the absence of any Federal response, \nthought it was important to get more boots on the ground in the form of \nthe National Guard. That is not a permanent solution by any means, but \nat least Governor Perry is willing to do something when the President \nis apparently not willing to use any political capital to get a \nmeaningful response from Washington, DC.\n  I would say that it is obvious to any fairminded observer that the \nstatus quo along the border is unacceptable and unsustainable. But the \nresponse of the majority leader appears to be: Let's just spend some \nmore money on an emergency basis. But I dare to say that if the \nmajority leader wants us to spend $2.7 billion on an emergency basis \nnow, we are going to be back at the end of the year doing it again. We \nare going to be back in 6 months doing it again. We are going to be \nback in another 6 months doing it again.\n  In other words, unless you are dealing with the source of the \nproblem, we are going to continue to hemorrhage money to try to deal \nwith this crisis when we should be all about deterring people from \ncoming into our country when they have no realistic hope of being able \nto stay under our current laws.\n  As former Border Patrol Deputy Chief Ron Coburn recently reported: \nNot only has the Border Patrol's morale been lower than ever--we have \nBorder Patrol who are being diverted from their law enforcement \nresponsibilities in order to change diapers and to feed children. You \ncan imagine what advantage the cartels and drug are taking when the \nBorder Patrol is being relieved of their duties at the border and is \nbusy trying to process these immigrant children through these various \ncenters.\n  Well, they are having a field day. They are laughing at the Federal \nGovernment's ineptitude. Our current policies are emboldening \ntransnational gangs, jeopardizing public safety, and making a mockery \nof United States sovereignty.\n  By contrast, the HUMANE Act that Congressman Cuellar and I have \noffered would accelerate the removal process for unaccompanied minors \nwho have no valid basis for staying. It would give those who have a \nvalid basis for staying a timely hearing in front of an immigration \njudge so they can make their case. And if they can make their case \nunder current law, then they will be able to stay. But it would \nstrongly deter and discourage illegal migration, and it would help \nrestore something that is sorely needed, which is some order in the \nrule of law in a situation that is characterized now by sheer chaos.\n  Just to clarify, this isn't about comprehensive immigration reform. \nWe still have a lot of work we need to do beyond this. This is what we \ncan do now together on a bipartisan basis that needs to be done on a \ntimely basis. It is a narrowly targeted measure designed to alleviate a \nnational crisis--nothing more, nothing less. I would think that would \nbe something we would all agree is worth doing.\n  I would point out that some of the cosponsors of the HUMANE Act \ninclude Members who voted for the Gang of 8 immigration bill coming out \nof the Senate and Members who voted against it. So this is one of those \nrare points of bipartisanship and clarity as to what the problem is and \nwhat we need to do to fix it that is bringing people together on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  Our legislation transcends the typical left-right, Democratic-\nRepublican immigration debate. It is a genuine bipartisan solution to a \ngenuine emergency, and it deserves a vote. I hope the majority leader \nwill reconsider his earlier position that all he wants us to do is \nwrite a blank check without any real reform.\n  The majority leader may not particularly like the legislation \nCongressman Cuellar and I have introduced, but if he doesn't like it, \ndoesn't it make sense that he would offer something different, \nsomething he thinks maybe would be a better solution? I would be glad \nto take a look at it.\n  If you don't like our plan, fine. But I would ask, Where is your \nplan? Because if you don't offer one and if you block a vote on \nsensible reforms, all you are doing is guaranteeing that the current \nborder crisis will continue.\n  Again, I urge the President and the majority leader to come down to \nSouth Texas, like so many of our other colleagues have done, and take a \nlook for themselves. The very least they could do is say thank you to \nthe Border Patrol and other Federal officers, such as FEMA, who are \ntrying to deal with this crisis. Unless we take action here in \nWashington, the problems are only going to get worse.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the current bill \nbefore this body, the Bring Jobs Home Act.\n  At a time when Washington is stuck in political gridlock, I believe \nDemocrats and Republicans should work together on policies that will \ncreate jobs not only in Nevada but, of course, across this country.\n  I have filed five amendments on policies I have been working on here \nin the Senate this Congress that will spur natural resources jobs \nthroughout the West, and I stand before this body today to urge action \non what I consider to be commonsense proposals.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, roughly 85 percent of the land in \nNevada is controlled by the Federal Government. Other Western States \nrange somewhere between 50 percent and 80 percent. This situation \npresents our local and State governments with a lot of unique \nchallenges.\n  Our communities' economic vitality is directly tied to the way the \nFederal Government manages our Federal lands. As a result, one of my \ntop priorities in the Senate is to implement reforms that streamline \nbureaucratic redtape that gets in the way of natural resources job \ncreation.\n  I have five amendments I have filed to deal with public land issues \nthat specifically directly affect rural Nevada and rural America. I \nencourage my colleagues across the aisle to work with me so we can \nconsider my amendments and other job-related amendments. If given the \nopportunity, we could spur natural resources-related economic \ndevelopment across this country and especially across the West.\n  My first amendment, the Lyon County Economic Development and \nConservation Act, is a Nevada-centric jobs bill which I have been \nfocusing on for years which, to the disappointment of my constituents, \nhas been held up through Senate gridlock.\n  The Lyon County Economic Development and Conservation Act could \ntransform the local economy of the county in my State that is \nstruggling the most during this current recession. The bill allows the \ncity of Yerington to partner with Nevada Copper to develop roughly \n12,500 acres of land surrounding the Nevada Copper Pumpkin Hollow \nproject site. The intent of this legislation is economic growth, and \nthe land purchased by the city will be used for mining activities, \nindustrial and renewable energy development, recreation, and open \nspace. Enactment of this legislation is the last obstacle in the way of \nthe company moving forward in the creation of over 1,000 jobs. For a \nrural county such as Lyon County, 1,000 jobs truly is a game changer.\n  My second amendment, the Public Lands Job Creation Act, will create \njobs by streamlining the bureaucratic process, cutting redtape, and \nensuring that the BLM reviews Federal Register notices in a timely \nmanner.\n  The permitting and approval process for energy and mining projects on \nFederal lands takes several years, largely because of unnecessary \ndelays, which costs businesses valuable time, resources, and jobs.\n  This amendment, which I have also introduced as stand-alone \nlegislation, streamlines the process by holding these agencies \naccountable to work effectively and timely to limit the negative \neffects of bureaucratic delays. Specifically, if BLM does not review a \nFederal Register notice by 45 days, the notice will be considered to be \napproved and the State BLM office will immediately forward the notice \nto be published in the Federal Register. This type of work is basically \nthe transfer of paperwork but a transfer that is consistently holding \nup important job-creating projects.\n  Earlier this year I facilitated a meeting between a local company \ngoing\n\n[[Page S4861]]\n\nthrough the process to start a large hard rock mineral mine in Elko \nCounty and the local BLM to break this bureaucratic logjam. This mine \nwill create hundreds of new jobs. While we were able to get the ball \nrolling in this particular instance--and I greatly appreciated the \nagency's work to move forward--it also shouldn't require congressional \ninteraction to spur prompt action.\n  My legislation will provide certainty to our local job creators.\n  My third amendment, the Public Lands Renewable Energy Development \nAct, is an initiative we have been working on for many years. This \nlegislation is a strong bipartisan proposal that will help create jobs, \nprogress toward energy independence, and preserve our Nation's natural \nwonders by spurring renewable energy development on public lands.\n  Energy is one of Nevada's greatest assets, and I believe continuing \nto develop renewable and alternative sources is important for Nevada's \neconomic future. Geothermal and solar production in my State is a major \npart of the U.S. ``all the above'' energy strategy. In 2013 Nevada \nranked second in the Nation for geothermal energy production and third \nfor solar production. Eighteen percent of our total electricity \ngenerated came from renewable, compared to the national average of 13 \npercent.\n  Our Nation's public lands can play a critical role in that mission, \nbut uncertainty in the permitting process impedes or delays our ability \nto harness the renewable energy potential. Under current law, permits \nfor wind and solar development are completed under the same process for \nother surface uses, such as pipelines, roads, and power lines. The BLM \nand Forest Service need a permitting process tailored to the unique \ncharacteristics and impacts of renewable energy projects. This \ninitiative develops a straightforward process that will drive \ninvestment toward the highest quality renewable sources.\n  In addition, the legislation ensures a fair return for public lands \ncommunities. Since Federal lands are not taxable, State and local \ngovernments deserve a share of the revenues from the sales of energy \nproduction on public lands that are within their county or State \nborders. These resources will help local governments deliver critical \nservices and develop much needed capital improvement projects--projects \nsuch as roadways, public safety, and, of course, law enforcement.\n  In my opinion, this proposal is a win-win situation. It is good for \neconomic development while at the same time protecting the natural \ntreasures out West that all of us value most.\n  My fourth amendment, the Energy Consumers Relief Act, gets the \ngovernment out of the way of our private sector natural resources job \ncreators.\n  Instead of advocating for policies that will put people back to work, \nthis administration's EPA continues to develop rules that will increase \nAmericans' utility bills, cause companies to lay off employees, and \nstifle economic growth.\n  My amendment will specifically require the EPA to be transparent when \nproposing and issuing energy-related regulations with an economic \nimpact of more than $1 billion. Additionally, it prohibits the EPA from \nfinalizing a rule if the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with \nother relevant agencies, determines the rule would cause significant \nadverse effects to the economy.\n  Finally, my final amendment, the Emergency Fuel Reduction Act, \ntackles a major problem many of our communities out West are facing \nright now; that is, catastrophic wildfires.\n  One of the greatest challenges facing our western forests and \nrangelands is the growing severity and length of the fire season. \nNevada is one of a handful of Western States that seemingly keeps \nenduring recordbreaking fire seasons year after year. We are always \ngoing to have fires out West, but we must be proactive in treating our \nforests and rangelands so that we can reduce the size, the frequency, \nand the intensity of these forest fires.\n\n  My amendment streamlines the bureaucratic process for fire prevention \nprojects, where a dangerous density of fuels threatens critical \ninfrastructure such as power lines, schools, and water delivery canals, \nprivate property owners who live adjacent to Federal lands, and areas \nthat threaten endangered species candidates such as the greater sage-\ngrouse.\n  Every year I hear from ranchers who live in northern Nevada's rural \ncounties, such as Humboldt County, where, through no fault of their \nown, fires on Federal lands spread onto their private property. The \nFederal agencies have to prioritize proactive preventive work in these \nareas. My constituents should not have to suffer because the Federal \nGovernment is simply not doing their job to properly manage our own \nlands.\n  I think nearly everyone can agree on a commonsense proposal such as \nthe Emergency Fuel Reduction Act.\n  If this body adopts my five amendments, Congress could go a long way \ntoward spurring economic development and job creation within the \nmining, energy development, ranching, timber, and outdoor recreational \nindustries. These types of jobs are the bedrock of our Western way of \nlife, and concurrently these fields are struggling the most under this \nadministration's restrictive Federal land management policies. It is no \ncoincidence that our western rural communities are suffering from \nunemployment rates well above the national average. Let's get the \ngovernment off their backs and allow them to do what they do best; that \nis, create jobs.\n  At a time when the American public continues to lose faith in \nCongress, I hope the Senate can put partisan politics aside and restore \norder to the traditional amendment process this deliberative body has \nbeen known for over time. We should break through the political \ngridlock and have an open amendment process in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                           HARRIS Nomination\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, shortly we will have the opportunity to \nvote on a cloture motion on Pamela Harris for confirmation to the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which includes Maryland. I \nurge my colleagues not only to support the cloture motion but to \nsupport her confirmation as a judge in the Fourth Circuit.\n  Senator Mikulski and I have a process--and I thank the senior Senator \nfrom Maryland for that process--we use in screening recommendations to \nthe President for judgeships. I am very proud of that process. It is \nvery open. We think we have recruited the very best in the legal \nprofession to serve as our judges, and I am proud to be part of it with \nSenator Mikulski.\n  Of all of the candidates I have interviewed for the appellate court, \nPamela Harris has stood out as one of the most qualified individuals we \nhave in the legal community to sit on our appellate court. She is \nexceptional in her qualifications, well qualified. She is an excellent \nSupreme Court litigator, has clerked at the Federal appellate court, \nsupervised policy initiatives at the Department of Justice, and she has \ndedicated her career and professional life to improving the \nadministration of justice as a public servant.\n  A little bit of background about her--particularly her family. Her \ngrandmother was a Polish Jewish immigrant to the United States who \nvalued education and worked hard to overcome personal adversity. Her \nmom put herself through law school, with young children, after a \ndivorce, and died from cancer a few years later. Ms. Harris relied in \npart on Pell grants to attend college at Yale. Her story represents the \nAmerican dream and the American experience and the opportunity in this \ncountry coming from an immigrant family.\n\n  After graduating from public high school in Montgomery County, Walt \nWhitman High School, Ms. Harris received a B.A. summa cum laude from \nYale College in 1985 and a J.D. from Yale Law School in 1990. After her \ngraduation from law school, she clerked for Judge Harry T. Edwards of \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and \nlater clerked with Justice John Paul Stevens of the Supreme Court of \nthe United States between 1992 and 1993.\n  She became associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law \nSchool. Beginning in 2007, while she was still in private practice, Ms. \nHarris codirected Harvard Law School's Supreme Court and Appellate \nPractice Clinic and was a visiting professor at Georgetown University \nLaw Center.\n\n[[Page S4862]]\n\n  In 2009 Ms. Harris was named the executive director of the Supreme \nCourt Institute at Georgetown, serving until 2010. Ms. Harris joined \nthe Justice Department's Office of Legal Policy, where she served as \nPrincipal Deputy Assistant Attorney General until returning to \nGeorgetown in 2012.\n  Ms. Harris is currently a visiting professor at Georgetown University \nLaw Center and a senior advisor to the Supreme Court Institute.\n  It is not surprising that the American Bar Association has given her \nthe highest rating of unanimously ``well qualified'' for this \nappointment. She has appeared as counsel or cocounsel in approximately \n100 cases before the Federal courts of appeals and the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. Her practice has been pretty evenly divided between criminal \ncases and civil cases.\n  When it comes to Supreme Court litigation, I must tell you I don't \nthink Ms. Harris has an equal as far as her qualifications. Her clinic \nat Georgetown which she supervises prepares litigants for the Supreme \nCourt. In other words, she provides experience for those who are going \nto be before the Supreme Court as to how to properly litigate those \ncases, and she takes them on a first-come, first-served basis. It is \nnot ideological at all. It is to make sure the highest quality \npresentations are made in the highest Court of our land so we get the \nbest decisions made by the highest Court of our land, the Supreme Court \nof the United States. That is the type of person we need on our court \nof appeals.\n  As I said, I don't know of a person whom I have interviewed who is \nmore qualified to be an appellate court judge than Ms. Harris. She \nunderstands the different role of an advocate or someone writing an \nopinion or commentary column and a judge. I want to emphasize this. She \nis a person who brings--we all bring our views and our passion to life, \nbut she understands what the judiciary is all about.\n  As is the practice of the Judiciary Committee--and I serve on the \nJudiciary Committee and I am proud of my service--I thank Senator Leahy \nfor his credible leadership. As you know, after the committee there are \nquestions for the record that are submitted by the Senators. That is \ncertainly true in Ms. Harris's case, and I have those answers here. I \nwould like my colleagues to read these answers because I can imagine \nthe people in the White House going through all the legal cites that \nMs. Harris gave in each of the answers to the questions our colleagues \nrequested. It is one of the most thorough answers I have ever seen and \nthoroughly vetted by the Supreme Court decisions. I mention that \nbecause it is exactly why I believe what she has told us is what she \nwill do. She understands the role of a judge in our system.\n\n  Quoting from her answer:\n\n       I fully recognize that the role of a judge is entirely \n     different from the role of an advocate. If confirmed as a \n     judge, my role would be to apply governing law and precedent \n     impartially to the facts of a particular case.\n\n  Pam Harris went on to state:\n\n       It is inappropriate for any judge or Justice to base his or \n     her decision on their own personal views or on public opinion \n     . . . If confirmed as a circuit judge, I would faithfully \n     follow the methodological precedence of the Supreme Court and \n     the Fourth Circuit, applying the interpretive approaches and \n     only the interpretive approaches used by those courts.\n\n  Don't take my word for it. Don't take her qualifications for it. Look \nat the record. Look at the letters that have been sent in support of \nMs. Harris to the Judiciary Committee. There are numerous letters.\n  I will quote from one that was signed by more than 80 of her \nprofessional peers, and I will tell you it includes individuals who \nwere appointed by Republican Presidents to key positions, including \nGregory Garre, the former Solicitor General for George W. Bush, but it \nincludes many in that category, and I am reading from that letter. This \nletter is part of the record. It was made part of the record in the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  I would ask unanimous consent it and another letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    June 20, 2014.\n       Re Nomination of Pamela Harris as Circuit Judge, United \n     States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\n\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman.\n     Hon. Chuck Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate,\n     Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: We write \n     in enthusiastic support of the nomination of Pamela Harris to \n     the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. We are \n     lawyers from diverse backgrounds and varying affiliations, \n     but we are united in our admiration for Pam's skills as a \n     lawyer and our respect for her integrity, her intellect, her \n     judgment, and her fair-mindedness.\n       Many of us have had the opportunity to work with Pam on \n     appellate matters. She has been co-counsel to some of us, \n     opposing counsel to others, and a valuable colleague to all. \n     In her appellate work, Pam has demonstrated extraordinary \n     skill. She is a quick study, careful listener, and acute \n     judge of legal arguments. She knows the value of clarity, \n     candor, vigor, and responsiveness. Of equal importance, she \n     has always conducted herself with consummate professionalism, \n     grace, and collegiality, and has a humble and down-to-earth \n     approach to her work.\n       After 20-plus years devoted largely to federal appellate \n     practice, Pam is naturally suited to serve as a federal \n     appellate judge. She clerked, first, on the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit for Judge Harry Edwards \n     and then on the U.S. Supreme Court for Associate Justice John \n     Paul Stevens. In private practice, she represented a wide \n     range of clients (both corporate and individual) before the \n     U.S. Supreme Court and in the U.S. Courts of Appeals. She was \n     Lecturer and Co-Director of the Supreme Court and Appellate \n     Practice Clinic at Harvard Law School. She was then appointed \n     as Executive Director of the highly regarded Supreme Court \n     Institute at the Georgetown University Law Center, which is \n     heavily involved in preparing advocates for their appearances \n     before the United States Supreme Court. She served as \n     Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Office of \n     Legal Policy at the United States Department of Justice. And \n     she has taught Constitutional Law and Criminal Procedure at \n     the University of Pennsylvania and at Georgetown. Her well-\n     rounded experience makes her well prepared for the docket of \n     a federal appellate court. Pam's substantive knowledge, \n     intellect, and low-key temperament will be great assets for \n     the position for which she has been nominated.\n       We expect that the Senate, after full inquiry, will see the \n     strengths we know from firsthand experience with Pam. Pamela \n     Harris has exceptional legal ability and personal character, \n     and we urge the Senate to confirm her to be a Circuit Judge.\n           Sincerely,\n         Gregory G.

Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: We write \n     in strong support of Pamela Harris' nomination to the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. As current \n     and former partners in the Washington, D.C., office of \n     O'Melveny & Myers LLP, each of us practiced law with Pam and \n     has witnessed firsthand her outstanding legal talent. \n     Moreover, as former colleagues with Pam, we can attest to her \n     collegiality, temperament, and judgment. We are confident \n     that she possesses the professional and personal \n     qualifications to be an excellent judge.\n       As a member of the firm's appellate practice, Pam enjoyed a \n     reputation as one of the best brief writers and strategists \n     in the firm. She was the principal author of well-written and \n     important briefs on behalf of a range of clients.\n       On behalf of Circuit City, for example, Pam argued for \n     enforcement of its employment arbitration agreements. On \n     behalf of Mobil Corporation, Pam wrote a petition challenging \n     the constitutionality of efforts to try thousands of \n     individual asbestos cases through mass aggregation in state \n     courts. Pam's brief argued that the contemplated mass \n     adjudication of thousands of different claims against \n     hundreds of defendants would violate the Due Process Clause \n     by unduly hindering Mobil's right to defend itself. The brief \n     also argued that pre-trial review was necessary because the \n     potential for enormous liability imposed by unfair \n     proceedings would pressure defendants like Mobil to settle \n     even meritless claims, rendering post-trial review an \n     impossibility.\n       Pam was also the primary author of an amicus brief on \n     behalf of a bipartisan group of House members (Members \n     Dingell and Tauzin were the lead amici) in defense of the \n     Federal Trade Commission's ``do not call'' rule. And in \n     Schaeffer v. Weast, 546 U.S. 49 (2005), Pam authored an \n     amicus brief in the United States Supreme Court supporting \n     the Montgomery County, Maryland, public school system. The \n     case arose under the Individuals with Disabilities Education \n     Act and concerned the status of the ``individualized \n     education programs'' developed by public schools for each \n     covered student. The Supreme Court agreed with Pam's position \n     and ruled for the Montgomery County schools.\n       Appreciation for Pam's work extended beyond the firm's \n     appellate practice and appellate clients. In fact, she was \n     regularly sought after by partners across practice groups to \n     think through briefing strategy and argument presentation in \n     a range of cases, at earlier stages in litigation. Pam's work \n     on behalf of Merck in class action litigation involving a \n     former painkiller drug highlights this range in her practice \n     beyond traditional appellate work. Working with trial teams \n     from O'Melveny's D.C. and L.A. offices, Pam was active in \n     pre-trial briefing and strategy on a range of discovery and \n     evidentiary issues. Pam often found herself engaged in this \n     type of cross-practice and inter-office collaboration, and \n     the firm's clients were especially appreciative of the \n     opportunity to have an appellate lawyer of Pam's caliber work \n     on some of their most difficult problems.\n       Pam also found the time throughout her tenure at O'Melveny \n     to maintain an active pro bono practice. As Co-Chair of the \n     National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL) \n     Amicus Committee, Pam helped to provide the Supreme Court and \n     countless indigent defendants with high-quality briefing on \n     issues affecting the administration of criminal justice \n     throughout the country. Given the disparity in the quality of \n     representation afforded to many defendants in criminal cases, \n     Justices from across the ideological spectrum have come to \n     rely on the excellent lawyering provided by NACDL. Pam also \n     helped to establish and supervise a partnership between \n     O'Melveny and the Maryland Office of the Public Defender, \n     Appellate Division, under which the firm's lawyers handled \n     appeals for the Public Defender on a pro bono basis. This \n     program, which continues today, provides many of the firm's \n     younger lawyers with an opportunity to get courtroom \n     experience.\n       Pam approached all of her work with the utmost level of \n     professionalism, objectivity, and dedication, and we believe \n     she would bring these same qualities to the federal bench. \n     Whether she was working on a brief for a criminal defendant \n     or a major oil company, Pam's singular focus was ensuring \n     that her client received first-rate legal representation. And \n     she did so while also demonstrating many of the qualities \n     that made her such an extraordinary colleague--from her \n     willingness to mentor and support younger lawyers to her \n     openness to helping her law partners with a section of their \n     brief or mooting them for an upcoming argument.\n       We conclude by noting that the signatories of this letter \n     span the political and jurisprudential spectrum. Some of us \n     have served in Republican Administrations or worked for \n     Republican Senators, while others have served in Democratic \n     Administrations or worked for Democratic Senators. Some of us \n     are members of the Federalist Society, while others are \n     members of the American Constitution Society. Our ranks \n     include a former White House Counsel to President Ronald \n     Reagan, top Commerce Department and Justice Department \n     officials to Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, and \n     senior aides to President Barack Obama. Although we may not \n     all share Pam's views on a range of legal and political \n     issues, we are united in the belief that Pam possesses the \n     intellect, fair-mindedness, humility, and fundamental decency \n     to make an excellent federal judge.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n         Arthur B. Culvahouse, Jr., Walter Dellinger, K. Lee \n           Blalack II, Brian Boyle, Brian Brooks, Danielle C. \n           Gray, Jonathan Hacker, Theodore W. Kassinger, Jeffrey \n           W. Kilduff, Ron Klain, Greta Lichtenbaum, Richard \n           Parker.\n\n  It says in part:\n\n       We are lawyers from diverse backgrounds and varying \n     affiliations, but we are united in our admiration for Pam's \n     skills as a lawyer and our respect for her integrity, her \n     intellect, her judgment, and her fair-mindedness.\n\n  The letter continues:\n\n       Many of us have had the opportunity to work with Pam on \n     appellate matters. She has been co-counsel to some of us, \n     opposing counsel to others, and a valuable colleague to all. \n     In her appellate work, Pam has demonstrated extraordinary \n     skill. She is a quick study, careful listener, and acute \n     judge of legal arguments. She knows the value of clarity, \n     candor, vigor, and responsiveness. Of equal importance, she \n     has always conducted herself with consummate professionalism, \n     grace, and congeniality, and has a humble and down-to-earth \n     approach to her work.\n\n  The letter concludes:\n\n       Her well-rounded experience makes her well prepared for the \n     docket of a federal appellate court. Pam's substantive \n     knowledge, intellect, and low-key temperament will be great \n     assets for the position for which she has been nominated.\n\n  She has the whole package. She has intellectual ability. She has the \nability to communicate. She has the demeanor we would like to see on \nour Federal bench.\n  Let me just add one more characteristic before I yield the floor. I \nsee the distinguished Republican leader of the Judiciary Committee is \nhere and is going to be commenting.\n  She also has empathy for the importance of our legal system to all. \nShe has volunteered her time to pro bono work in order to help address \nthe growing access to the justice gap in our system for individuals who \ncould not afford legal assistance as we still strive to provide equal \njustice under law. While in private practice she established a pro bono \nprogram in which the law firm where she works worked with the Maryland \nOffice of the Public Defender to provide pro bono representation to \ndefendants appealing criminal convictions in State courts and she \nsupervised attorneys participating in the program, just another \nindication she understands the oath she takes to dispense justice \nwithout partiality to wealth, that everyone is entitled to access to \nour judicial system and our legal system and she has taken personal \ninterest in doing that.\n  Senator Mikulski and I are proud that she is a long-time resident of \nMontgomery County, MD, we take great pride in the fact that she is a \nMarylander, and we urge our colleagues to support this nomination.\n\n\n                           HARRIS Nomination\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, we will vote to end the filibuster \nagainst\n\n[[Page S4864]]\n\nthe nomination of Pamela Harris to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the Fourth Circuit. She is a highly accomplished lawyer with \nexcellent legal credentials and has the strong support of her home \nState Senators, Senator Mikulski and Senator Cardin. Her nomination \nreceived the American Bar Association's highest rating of unanimously \n``well qualified''.\n  Pam Harris is currently a visiting professor at my alma mater, \nGeorgetown University Law Center. In her diverse career she has served \nin the Office of Legal Policy at the Department of Justice, as a \npartner in private practice, as a professor at University of \nPennsylvania Law School, and the executive director of the Supreme \nCourt Institute at Georgetown. After graduating from Yale Law School, \nshe served as a law clerk to Judge Harry Edwards on the DC Circuit and \nJustice John Paul Stevens on the U.S. Supreme Court. She is beyond \nqualified--an experienced appellate practitioner with background in \nboth criminal and civil litigation and a command of the law that rivals \nthat of any lawyer in the United States.\n  Some partisans have tried to misrepresent her past statements in \norder to caricature her. This account of her record is simply \nunrecognizable to those individuals who actually know Pam Harris and \nwho know that as a judge she would be committed to the rule of law. \nMany lawyers who have practiced with Pam Harris have written in support \nof her nomination, including many prominent Republicans who are \nrespected in the legal community.\n  One letter, signed by more than 80 of her professional peers, \nincluding Gregory Garre, the former U.S. Solicitor General for \nPresident George W. Bush, reads, ``We are lawyers from diverse \nbackgrounds and varying affiliations, but we are united in our \nadmiration for Pam's skills as a lawyer and our respect for her \nintegrity, her intellect, her judgment, and her fair-mindedness.''\n  Another letter of support from a number of current and former \npartners at O'Melveny and Myers LLP, including A.B. Culvahouse, who \nserved as White House Counsel during the Reagan administration, and \nWalter Dellinger, who served as Assistant Attorney General of the \nOffice of Legal Counsel and Acting U.S. Solicitor General during the \nClinton administration, reads, ``Although we may not all share Pam's \nviews on a range of legal and political issues, we are united in the \nbelief that Pam possesses the intellect, fair-mindedness, humility, and \nfundamental decency to make an excellent federal judge.''\n  I ask that these and other letters of support received for Pam \nHarris' nomination be printed in the Record.\n  When asked about her judicial philosophy at her nomination hearing \nshe testified that ``the role of a judge is to decide cases through \nimpartial application of law and precedent. It is a limited role . . . \nthey decide the concrete disputes in front of them with attention to \nparticular facts, attention to the arguments of the parties and their \nbriefs, and by applying law and precedent to those facts.''\n  Both her testimony and the letters of bipartisan support for her \nnomination demonstrate that Pam Harris has a clear understanding of the \nrole of a judge and make clear her commitment to follow Supreme Court \nprecedent and to uphold the Constitution. I believe Pam Harris will be \nan outstanding judge, and she has my full support. I urge all Senators \nto vote to end this filibuster and confirm Pam Harris to serve on the \nFourth Circuit.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    June 20, 2014.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: We write \n     in strong support of the nomination of Pamela A. Harris to \n     the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and \n     urge prompt consideration and confirmation of her nomination.\n       As her classmates in the Yale Law School Class of 1990, we \n     have known Pam for more than 25 years. We all believe that \n     Pam would be a tremendous asset to the appellate bench.\n       In law school, Pam stood out for her keen intellect, her \n     grasp of legal issues, her intellectual curiosity, her \n     integrity and her fair-mindedness. Because of those \n     qualities, Pam was often able to forge bonds and build \n     consensus among classmates with very different views.\n       Many of us have kept in touch with Pam since law school and \n     are familiar with her outstanding legal career. Pam's breadth \n     of experience makes her exceptionally well-suited to serve as \n     a judge on the federal appeals court. After law school, Pam \n     clerked for two distinguished jurists, Judge Harry. T. \n     Edwards of the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     District of Columbia Circuit, and Justice John Paul Stevens \n     of the United States Supreme Court. Since then, Pam has \n     served in the United States Department of Justice, \n     represented businesses and other clients in private practice, \n     taught such subjects as constitutional law and appellate \n     practice as a law professor, and served on the boards of \n     directors of both national and local legal and educational \n     organizations.\n       Of particular relevance to the Court of Appeals, Pam is a \n     recognized national expert in appellate advocacy, having \n     served as Executive Director of the Georgetown Law Center's \n     Supreme Court Institute and Co-Director of Harvard Law \n     School's Supreme Court and Appellate Practice Clinic.\n       Pam has devoted a significant portion of her career to pro \n     bono work. She has represented numerous nonprofit and public \n     interest organizations as well as individuals. Pam served as \n     Co-Chair of the Amicus Committee of the National Association \n     of Criminal Defense Lawyers, and she established a pro bono \n     program at the law firm O'Melveny & Myers, focusing on \n     Maryland cases, where she handled cases herself and \n     supervised and mentored junior lawyers. Pam has mentored law \n     students and junior lawyers throughout her career. She \n     received a prestigious legal teaching award at the University \n     of Pennsylvania Law School and has been recognized as a \n     popular and highly respected professor at Penn, Georgetown \n     and Harvard Law Schools. Pam grew up in Bethesda, Maryland, \n     and graduated at the top of her class from Walt Whitman High \n     School there. For the last 15 years, Pam and her family have \n     lived in Potomac, Maryland, just a few miles away from her \n     childhood home. Pam is as invested in her community as she is \n     in appellate practice, serving in roles that range from \n     membership on the Board of Trustees at the Norwood School to \n     ``cookie mom'' for her daughter's Girl Scout troop.\n       We believe Pam to be exceptionally well-qualified and well-\n     suited to serve on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. We \n     urge the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate to promptly \n     review and confirm Pamela Harris for a position on that \n     Court.\n       Please do not hesitate to contact any of us if you have any \n     questions.\n           Sincerely,\n     (Signed by 82 Individuals)\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  National Women's Law Center,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 23, 2014.\n     Re Nomination of Pamela Harris to the United States Court of \n         Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\n\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Senator Charles Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Leahy and Grassley: on behalf of the National \n     Women's Law Center (the ``Center''), an organization that has \n     worked since 1972 to advance and protect women's legal \n     rights, we write in strong support of the nomination of \n     Pamela Harris to the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     Fourth Circuit.\n       Ms. Harris is exceedingly well-qualified to serve on this \n     important court. She graduated from Yale College and Yale Law \n     School. She clerked for Judge Harry T. Edwards on the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, \n     and for Associate Justice John Paul Stevens on the United \n     States Supreme Court. Following her clerkships, Ms. Harris \n     served as an Attorney-Advisor in the Office of Legal Counsel \n     at the United States Department of Justice for two years \n     before joining the faculty at the University of Pennsylvania \n     Law School, where she received the Harvey Levin Memorial \n     Teaching Award in 1998. Ms. Harris then joined the law firm \n     of O'Melveny & Myers LLP as counsel, becoming a partner in \n     2005. During her ten years with O'Melveny & Myers, Ms. Harris \n     served as the Co-Director of the Harvard Law School Supreme \n     Court and Appellate Practice Clinic, and taught at Georgetown \n     University Law Center as a visiting professor. In 2009, she \n     left O'Melveny & Myers and joined the Georgetown University \n     Law Center as the Executive Director of the Supreme Court \n     Institute. In 2010, she became the Principal Deputy to the \n     Assistant Attorney General in the Office of Legal Policy at \n     the United States Department of Justice. She rejoined the \n     Georgetown faculty as a visiting professor of law in 2012.\n       Ms. Harris' legal career reflects excellence, a dedication \n     to public service, and the best contributions of the legal \n     profession to the public interest. During her career, Ms. \n     Harris has appeared in over 100 federal appellate cases, and \n     argued before the Supreme Court. This record reflects her \n     considerable experience, and the brilliant advocacy for which \n     she is properly renowned. In addition to honing her skills as \n     an exceptionally talented litigator in the private sector, \n     Ms.\n\n[[Page S4865]]\n\n     Harris has spent a good part of her career in government \n     service and in teaching aspiring lawyers. Further, Ms. Harris \n     has shown her dedication to the public interest and to \n     improving the administration of justice throughout her \n     career. While at O'Melveny & Myers, she had a robust pro bono \n     practice and established a cooperative program between \n     O'Melveny and the Maryland Office of the Public Defender, \n     through which the firm represents indigent criminal \n     defendants appealing their convictions in state court. She \n     also has worked to improve the quality of appellate advocacy \n     as co-director of Harvard Law School's appellate advocacy \n     clinic and as Director of Georgetown's Supreme Court \n     Institute. In that latter capacity, she led the work of the \n     Institute, which provides pro bono assistance preparing \n     advocates for oral argument before the Supreme Court on a \n     first-come, first-served basis, to elevate the quality of \n     arguments heard by the Justices. In addition to her \n     contributions to the legal profession in private practice, \n     public service, and academia, Ms. Harris has served on the \n     boards of directors of several nonprofit organizations, \n     including the Norwood School in Potomac, Maryland. Ms. \n     Harris' many accomplishments are reflected by the unanimous \n     ``Well-Qualified'' rating she received from the ABA Standing \n     Committee on the Federal Judiciary.\n       The Center has had several opportunities to work with Ms. \n     Harris. In particular, Ms. Harris served as co-counsel with \n     the Center in representing Mr. Roderick Jackson before the \n     Supreme Court in 2005, in Jackson v. Birmingham Bd. of Ed., \n     544 U.S. 167 (2005). Mr. Jackson was a teacher and girls' \n     basketball coach in Birmingham, Alabama. He described \n     practice and game conditions for the girls' team that were \n     inferior to those provided to the boys' team, and complained \n     to school administrators. He was fired as a coach after doing \n     so, costing him his coaching salary and full retirement. Ms. \n     Harris was part of the legal team that litigated his case \n     before the Supreme Court, successfully arguing that Title IX \n     provided a cause of action for retaliation for those seeking \n     to secure compliance with the law. Working with Ms. Harris in \n     Jackson allows us to personally attest to her outstanding \n     legal skills, judgment, and analytical thinking, as well as \n     to her excellent temperament and collegiality.\n       Ms. Harris' litigation experience, commitment to improving \n     the administration of justice, and dedication to the public \n     interest make her exceedingly well-suited for the position to \n     which she has been nominated. In addition, Ms. Harris' \n     confirmation would increase the diversity on the Fourth \n     Circuit, making her only the sixth female judge to ever sit \n     on this court. For all of these reasons, the Center offers \n     its strong support of Pamela A. Harris to the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and urges you to \n     support her nomination. If you have questions or if we can be \n     of assistance, please contact us at (202) 588-5180.\n           Sincerely,\n     Nancy Duff Campbell,\n       Co-President.\n     Marcia D. Greenberger,\n       Co-President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    June 27, 2014.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: I write in \n     strong support of Pamela Harris's nomination to the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\n       I served as the Senior Vice President, General Counsel and \n     Secretary of The Hertz Corporation from 1998 to 2007. \n     Although it may seem surprising that a car and equipment \n     rental company would face issues with a constitutional \n     dimension, that did indeed occasionally happen. When it did, \n     I turned to Ms. Harris for advice and assistance. The views \n     expressed in this letter regarding her qualifications to \n     serve as a judge are informed by my interactions with her \n     while at Hertz; I hasten to add that those views are my own \n     and do not represent the views of my former employer, for \n     which I cannot speak.\n       In my dealings with Ms. Harris, I found her to be highly \n     intelligent, quick to grasp issues, creative in her approach \n     to problems, fair in her judgments, and direct in her advice. \n     When discussing legal matters, she was incisive, objective \n     and principled; it surely helped that she knew the law so \n     well and could speak with authority on the subjects at hand, \n     without a hint of defensiveness or dogmatism. She also was an \n     excellent writer, whose work exhibited the same clarity, \n     honesty and force that she showed in conversation. (She was, \n     moreover, able to write quickly and with little need for \n     revision; she seems to be one of those people who gets things \n     right the first time.) In short, Ms. Harris was a model of \n     professionalism as a practicing lawyer--someone who \n     engendered trust and respect. I note that all those qualities \n     are also vital for a judge, and especially for a judge on a \n     court as important as the Fourth Circuit.\n       Ms. Harris's academic achievements, meanwhile, speak for \n     themselves. After graduating from Yale Law School, she served \n     as a law clerk for Judge Harry T. Edwards on the D.C. Circuit \n     and for Justice John Paul Stevens on the Supreme Court. Ms. \n     Harris has also taught at Harvard Law School, the University \n     of Pennsylvania School of Law, and at the Georgetown \n     University Law Center, where she was the Executive Director \n     of the Supreme Court Institute, a unique and respected \n     project dedicated to improving advocacy before the Supreme \n     Court.\n       In sum, I believe that Ms. Harris is an ideal candidate for \n     an appellate court judge. As her academic credentials \n     demonstrate, she has a first-rate intellect. Equally \n     important, she is a mature and able lawyer with significant \n     experience in practice, no small part of which consisted of \n     high-quality advocacy for business enterprises. Beyond that, \n     she conveys a sense of fundamental decency, without which her \n     intellectual abilities and professional skills would be for \n     naught. I have no doubt that she would bring to the important \n     judicial seat for which she has been nominated the same \n     qualities that have made her an excellent lawyer, and that \n     she would instill confidence in all litigants that their \n     cases would be decided carefully and fairly. I urge you to \n     confirm her nomination.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n     Harold E. Rolfe.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         The leadership Conference\n\n\n                                     on Civil and Human Rights\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 23, 2014.\n\n   Confirm Pamela Harris to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth \n                                Circuit\n\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of The Leadership Conference on \n     Civil and Human Rights, we write to express our strong \n     support for the confirmation of Pamela Ann Harris to serve on \n     the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. At every \n     stage in her career, Pamela Harris has distinguished herself \n     through her outstanding intellectual credentials, her \n     independence of thought, and her strong respect for the rule \n     of law, establishing herself beyond question as qualified and \n     ready to serve on the court. In addition, she has \n     demonstrated an unwavering integrity and an outstanding \n     commitment to public service. We urge you to vote yes on \n     cloture and yes to confirm her.\n       The Leadership Conference believes Pamela Harris will be an \n     impartial, thoughtful, and highly-respected addition to the \n     court. She graduated summa cum laude from Yale College in \n     1985 and received her J.D. from Yale Law School in 1990. \n     After law school, she was a law clerk for Judge Harry T. \n     Edwards of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. \n     She spent one year as an associate at Shea & Gardner (now \n     Goodwin Proctor LLP) before clerking for Justice John Paul \n     Stevens of the Supreme Court. From 2010-2012, she served at \n     the Department of Justice as Principal Deputy Assistant \n     Attorney General in the Office of Legal Policy.\n       Ms. Harris has devoted her career largely to academia and \n     public service, excelling in both. She has demonstrated a \n     commitment to improving the fair administration of justice \n     and educating new lawyers. In 1996, she joined the faculty of \n     the University Of Pennsylvania Law School, where she taught \n     courses in criminal procedure and received the Harvey Levin \n     Memorial Teaching Award in 1998. At O'Melveny & Myers LLP, \n     where she was counsel, Harris specialized in appellate and \n     Supreme Court litigation and was named partner in 2005. \n     During her ten years in private practice, Harris has become a \n     renowned Supreme Court and appellate advocate, appearing in \n     approximately 100 federal appellate cases. In addition, \n     Harris established a cooperative program between O'Melveny \n     and the Maryland Office of Public Defender, through which the \n     firm provides pro bono representation to indigent criminal \n     defendants appealing their convictions in state court.\n       Notably, Harris has used her uniquely broad experience as \n     an appellate litigator to prepare the next generation of \n     legal advocates and improve the judiciary. She was a visiting \n     professor at Georgetown University Law Center and executive \n     director of the law school's Supreme Court Institute. As \n     executive director, she managed and participated in a moot \n     court program that prepares advocates for oral argument \n     before the Supreme Court. During her tenure, she worked with \n     lawyers representing a multitude of interests. For example \n     she assisted both the offices of state attorneys general and \n     lawyers for criminal defendants; helped to improve arguments \n     by lawyers bringing civil rights actions and those defending \n     against civil rights actions; and worked with attorneys \n     representing both plaintiffs and defendant corporations. She \n     has also served as lecturer and co-director of the Supreme \n     Court and Appellate Practice Clinic at Harvard Law School.\n       The Leadership Conference believes that Pamela Harris is an \n     extraordinarily gifted nominee, with the ability to make \n     objective decisions on the multifaceted and prominent cases \n     that will surely come before the court. Her impeccable \n     credentials have garnered her the support of a diverse group \n     of attorneys in the legal community and people across the \n     political spectrum. Harris' rich diversity of experience \n     makes her an excellent choice for the U.S. Court of Appeals \n     for the Fourth Circuit, and we urge you to vote yes on \n     cloture and yes to confirm her.\n       Thank you for your time and consideration.

Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: We are \n     writing on behalf of Constitutional Accountability Center, a \n     think tank, law firm, and action center dedicated to the \n     Constitution's text and history, to urge that Pamela Harris \n     be reported favorably out of Committee and confirmed promptly \n     to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\n       Pam is one of the country's leading appellate advocates, \n     and her exceptional qualifications to serve as a federal \n     judge are well known to us, as Pam has been a member of CAC's \n     Board of Directors since 2012. After growing up in Maryland, \n     Pam graduated summa cum laude from Yale College and received \n     her J.D. from Yale Law School. She then held two prestigious \n     clerkships, first for Judge Harry Edwards on the D.C. Circuit \n     and then for Justice John Paul Stevens on the Supreme Court. \n     Following her clerkships, Pam's distinguished legal career \n     has included broad experience in private practice, government \n     service, and teaching. Among other things, Pam has served as \n     the Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Office \n     of Legal Policy at the Department of Justice and practiced as \n     a partner at O'Melveny & Myers, where she focused on Supreme \n     Court and appellate litigation. Throughout her career, Pam \n     has dedicated herself to improving the quality of appellate \n     advocacy before our courts, believing that the courts are \n     best served when the advocates on both sides of a case \n     present the strongest possible arguments.\n       Pam is currently a Visiting Professor at Georgetown \n     University Law Center, where, in addition to teaching the \n     next generation of lawyers, she has also served as the \n     Executive Director of the Supreme Court Institute, working to \n     prepare counsel for oral argument before our Nation's highest \n     court. The Institute's ``moot court'' services are provided \n     without charge, as a public service, on a first-come, first-\n     served basis (the Institute will generally ``moot'' only one \n     side of a case), and without regard to the nature of the \n     case, the parties, the arguments being made, or the \n     affiliation or identity of the lawyers. The expert assistance \n     offered by Pam and her colleagues at the Institute to improve \n     advocacy before the Supreme Court is so helpful and sought-\n     after that the first call a lawyer often makes after learning \n     that the Court has agreed to review her client's case is to \n     the Institute, to reserve its moot court services before her \n     opponent does.\n       Pam's intellect, temperament, integrity, and the breadth of \n     her professional experience make her extremely well-qualified \n     to serve on the Fourth Circuit. This conclusion is \n     underscored by the ABA's rating of Pam as ``unanimously well \n     qualified,'' as well as by the diversity of voices supporting \n     Pam's confirmation. Those who have written to this Committee \n     to express their support include Greg Garre, who served as \n     Solicitor General in the George W. Bush Administration, Seth \n     Waxman, who held the same position during the Clinton \n     Administration, A.B. Culvahouse, White House Counsel for \n     President Reagan, and Walter Dellinger, Acting United States \n     Solicitor General during the Clinton Administration. Indeed, \n     the letter signed by Mr. Culvahouse, Mr. Dellinger, and other \n     ``current and former partners in the Washington, D.C. office \n     of O'Melveny & Myers''--lawyers who have practiced with Pam \n     and know her best--exemplifies the high praise she has \n     received. These attorneys have written:\n       [E]ach of us practiced law with Pam and has witnessed \n     firsthand her outstanding legal talent. Moreover, as former \n     colleagues with Pam, we can attest to her collegiality, \n     temperament, and judgment. We are confident that she \n     possesses the professional and personal qualifications to be \n     an excellent judge. . . .\n       [T]he signatories of this letter span the political and \n     jurisprudential spectrum. Some of us have served in \n     Republican Administrations or worked for Republican Senators, \n     while others have served in Democratic Administrations or \n     worked for Democratic Senators. Some of us are members of the \n     Federalist Society, while others are members of the American \n     Constitution Society. . . . Although we may not all share \n     Pam's views on a range of legal and political issues, we are \n     united in the belief that Pam possesses the intellect, fair-\n     mindedness, humility, and fundamental decency to make an \n     excellent federal judge.\n       In her testimony before this Committee on June 24, Pam \n     demonstrated that she understands clearly the difference \n     between the roles she has played in her career as an advocate \n     representing clients and as an academic and an expert \n     commentator on the courts, and the new role she would take on \n     if confirmed as a judge. In particular, pointing among other \n     things to her work ``running the Supreme Court Institute on \n     an entirely nonpartisan basis,'' Pam testified that ``I have \n     never let any personal views I have, political views I may \n     have, affect the discharge of my professional \n     responsibilities. And I would not do that if I were confirmed \n     as a judge.''\n       In sum, Pam Harris clearly has the qualifications, \n     experience, intellect and temperament to serve with great \n     distinction on the Fourth Circuit. We urge every Senator to \n     support her confirmation.\n           Respectfully,\n     Douglas T. Kendall,\n       President.\n     Judith E. Schaeffer,\n       Vice President.\n\n  With that, I would yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, similar to my colleague from Maryland, \nI come to the floor to discuss the nomination of Professor Pamela \nHarris to the Fourth Circuit. I come for another reason, to give my \nreasons for opposition.\n  Contemplating my vote on this nominee has been a particularly \nmemorable process. That is because as I reviewed the professor's \nwritings, statements, and legal briefs, it seemed as though I was \nreviewing the record of not one but two nominees. The size of those two \nnominees' records was rather unequal. On the one hand, there is the \nrecord of the pre-nomination Professor Harris. That is the record \nreaching all the way back to her graduation from law school in 1990, a \nrecord rich in public statements and writings. It is a record long \nenough to develop a distinct and stridently left-wing philosophy. That \nis one record.\n  Then, on the other hand, there is the record of the post-nomination \nProfessor Harris. It is a dramatically shorter record. That record only \nbegan a few weeks ago at the professor's confirmation hearing on June \n24. It is a record that consists of the professor's testimony before \nthe Judiciary Committee and of course her responses to questions for \nthe record from my colleagues and from this Senator. It is a record of \na jurist who will be faithful to the statutory text and constitutional \nprecedents, a record with comments that could be mistaken for those of \nJustice Scalia or Justice Thomas.\n  But what is so unbelievable to me is how totally at odds the record \nof the pre-nomination professor is with the record of the post-\nnomination professor. As I said before, it is as if there were two \nentirely distinct nominees vying for this single seat on the Fourth \nCircuit.\n  So for the next few minutes I would like to share with my colleagues \nsome excerpts from the record of the pre-nomination Professor Harris \nand some excerpts from the post-nomination professor. There is no \nquestion that the professor spent her entire legal career, \nbefore nomination to the Federal bench, that is, consistently and \naggressively advocating for a liberal interpretation of the \nConstitution that is well outside the mainstream of constitutional \njurisprudence. That is the pre-nomination record. But as I said, that \nall changed when she testified before the committee.\n\n  I would start with the professor's pre-nomination views on \nconstitutional interpretation. She has spoken with unusual clarity and \nforthrightness on the topic. That is in part because she served for \nmany years on the board of the left-wing American Constitution Society. \nThat ironically named group spends a lot of time developing theories of \ninterpretation that are designed to attack and redefine key \nconstitutional principles. The professor was at the forefront of those \ndiscussions in many years. So how exactly did the pre-nomination \nProfessor Harris view the sources of constitutional meaning?\n  Here is a statement she made before the American Constitution Society \nin 2008:\n\n       I just don't think that any account of the Constitution \n     that even seems to privilege the Constitution as it was \n     originally ratified is consistent with the way we should \n     think about the Constitution. Yes, the values, the \n     principles, on some level of generality, are there at the \n     beginning, but they take their meaning--and they should take \n     their meaning--from what comes after.\n\n  We should pause for a moment because she said a lot in that quote. \nFirst, we hear how the professor rejects out of hand the idea that the \nConstitution as originally ratified should guide its interpretation. \nInstead she sees only ambiguous principles. Those principles, according \nto the professor, are more or less empty and meaningless by themselves. \nThat is because those principles, as she formulates them, take their \nmeaning primarily from subsequent developments. Then the professor goes \non to specify exactly what subsequent developments she is talking \nabout.\n\n[[Page S4867]]\n\n  She explains that her interpretive ``source of legitimacy most \nparticularly,'' is ``what the People do'' at what she calls ``critical \njunctures,'' including ``the civil rights movement, the women's \nmovement, the gay rights movement.'' According to the professor, these \nmovements ``reconstitute what it is we're talking about when we talk \nabout American constitutional tradition, when we say words like \nequality and liberty, when we change what they mean.''\n\n  We need to pause and unpack that statement. First, the professor \nexplicitly identifies for herself ``a source of legitimacy'' to be used \nin constitutional interpretation. That source of legitimacy is not the \nConstitution's text, nor its structure, nor its history, nor its \noriginal intent, nor any other established interpretive method. It is \nsomething outside the law altogether, and that happens to be social and \npolitical movements.\n  I will put it this way: They are the social and political movements \nthat Professor Harris chooses for inspiration. They are the social and \npolitical movements Professor Harris has decided to raise all the way \nto constitutional status. It is these extralegal sources that she says \nchange the scope of the Constitution's guarantees of equality and \nliberty.\n  I am sure you are going to say this sounds as though I am making it \nup, but I am not. The professor literally said, ``We change what they \nmean.'' Who is the ``we'' the professor is talking about? I suspect it \nis the people in social movements that Professor Harris finds \nparticularly inspirational. I suspect it is also the people who share \nher view that the Constitution's original guarantees are merely empty \nvessels which can be filled with whatever political or social ideas a \njudge might ``privilege,'' as the professor puts it.\n  In other contexts, Professor Harris said the meaning of the \nConstitution changes based on things such as ``an evolving and changing \npublic understanding,'' ``the consequences of constitutional rulings,'' \nand ``the circumstances on the ground.'' Note the absence of any legal \nstandard on that list which seems to be the basis of the rule of law or \nthe basis of stare decisis.\n  I will finish up with the professor's quote.\n\n       I think that constitutional legitimacy comes, even in part, \n     from the fact that it does reflect these social movements and \n     what happens at these particular moments when the people come \n     together and force this kind of change in the way we think \n     about ourselves and what it means to be American. And I think \n     there's something about originalism at least as it's commonly \n     understood that's inconsistent with that. And that's why I'm \n     not an originalist, even now.\n\n  Let's recap. The Constitution derives some of its legitimacy, as the \nprofessor put it, from social movements at particular moments. Again, \nhow are we to know which particular moments rise to the level of \nconstitutional significance? We will have to ask Professor Harris \nbecause there is absolutely no principled or objective way of making \nthat kind of a decision. It is certainly not a legal decision. It \nhappens to be a matter of personal preference.\n  What else can we take away from that quote? Well, we also learned the \nprofessor is definitely not an originalist. She literally says: ``I'm \nnot an originalist.'' I want you to keep that in mind because what I \nhave to say shows how quickly she can change her views.\n  Let's turn now to what the post-nomination professor thinks about \nconstitutional interpretation. As I said before, the contrast is so \nstriking that it is almost as if we are dealing with two different \nnominees for the single seat on the Fourth Circuit. Does the post-\nnomination professor still think constitutional principles change with \nthe times?\n  In a response to my question for the record, Professor Harris wrote:\n\n       I do not believe that the Constitution's provisions and \n     principles change or evolve, other than by the amendment \n     process in Article V. They are fixed and enduring and judges \n     are not free to change them whether by incorporating public \n     preferences or their own policy views.\n\n  That is astounding. It is like a night-and-day difference with the \njudicial philosophy I have previously quoted from the pre-nomination \nProfessor Harris, and it is totally incompatible with the philosophy \nwhich Professor Harris has developed over the decades. Now we suddenly \nhear that the professor believes in unchanging and in fixed--dare I say \neternal--principles that cannot be changed except by an Article V \namendment.\n  All of a sudden there are no more social movements. All of a sudden \nthere are no more ``critical junctures.'' All of a sudden there is no \nmore ``what the people do.'' All of a sudden there is no more \n``privileging'' or ``reconstituting''--those are her words. So no more \n``privileging'' or ``reconstituting'' constitutional meaning. All of a \nsudden the meanings are now fixed in our Constitution. All that other \nstuff she previously said happens to be in the rearview mirror.\n\n  Now judges are forbidden from incorporating public preferences to \nchange constitutional principles. Public preferences as interpreted by \nthe judge, of course. But just a few years ago that was at the very \ncore of her interpretative philosophy.\n  I have another post-nomination quote.\n\n       I would never suggest that a justice of the Supreme Court, \n     or any judge, should change his or her opinions based on \n     public opinion. That is not the way I view the role of a \n     judge.\n\n  That happens to be the way I view the role of a judge, and now she \nsays that is the way she sees the role of a judge, but it is completely \ncontrary to what she had thought for decades before this nomination.\n  The post-nomination Professor Harris added that courts should be \n``especially cautious on social issues when the political branches and \npolitical institutions are deeply and rapidly engaged in those issues'' \nand ``leave as much to the democratic process.'' That statement is also \na massive sea-change.\n  For the pre-nomination professor, the democratic process went hand-\nin-glove with the judicial process. Now, however, with her confirmation \non the line, the post-nomination professor sees a wall between politics \nand the courts.\n  Let's return to the pre-nomination professor for another quote on \njudicial decisionmaking. Here is what she candidly told a gathering of \nthe American Constitution Society about that issue in 2009:\n\n       I always feel unapologetically, you know, left to my own \n     devices, my own best reading of the Constitution. It's pretty \n     close to where I am.\n\n  Where exactly is the Constitution, in her view? She tells us flatly: \n``I think the Constitution is a profoundly progressive document. I \nthink it's born of a progressive impulse.'' Well, if that is where the \nConstitution is, where then is the professor? Again, there is no \nmystery here because she is very upfront with that answer: ``I'm a \nprofoundly liberal person so we''--she is talking about herself and the \nConstitution as one--``we match up pretty well. I make no apologies for \nthat.''\n  Think for a moment about what the professor is saying. I frankly \ncannot recall a judicial nominee who has actually expressed her belief \nthat the Constitution embodies the nominee's personal political \nphilosophy, but that is exactly what Professor Harris does in that \nstatement.\n  Think about how she put it: The Constitution is pretty much where she \nis as a liberal. It is almost in sync with her views. That was a \ncrystal-clear explanation of how the pre-nomination Professor Harris \nviewed her beliefs and the Constitution.\n  But what does the post-nomination Professor Harris have to say? At \nher hearing, she told our Judiciary Committee:\n\n       I do not believe that it is the view of a judge ever to \n     import his or her personal values into judicial \n     decisionmaking.\n\n  Again, the post-nomination statement is strikingly at odds with the \npre-nomination views. Or, perhaps we should actually take the post-\nnomination statement at face value. After all, Professor Harris doesn't \nneed to import her own views when interpreting the Constitution. As she \nexplained, it just happens to be almost as liberal as she is. So that \nis a fortunate coincidence, I suppose.\n  What about the professor's views on a particular judicial philosophy? \nRemember earlier her pre-nomination criticism of originalism and her \nassertion that she is definitely not an originalist.\n  That happens to be out the window as well.\n  Here is her post-nomination testimony: ``I do not reject originalism \nas an interpretive method.''\n\n[[Page S4868]]\n\n  Those are just a few of the contradictory quotes from the pre- and \npost-nomination Professor Harris which strikingly illustrate almost \nunbelievable inconsistencies in her judicial philosophy and \nunderstanding of constitutional interpretation.\n  The quotations also point to issues that are deeply troubling about \nthis nominee, and I'll discuss a few of them. First, this nominee has \nmade many statements suggesting that if confirmed, she would pursue a \nresults-oriented, whatever-it-takes approach to deciding cases. From \nthis nominee's past commentary, we know that she is not only a devoted \nliberal, but she would also strive to move the courts leftward to suit \nher ideological preferences.\n  For example, in discussing the Warren Court, the professor said she \nwondered ``whether we almost have, by now, a stunted sense of what the \nlegal choices really are, what really is a liberal legal outcome.''\n  Just listen to that phrasing again: ``liberal legal outcome.'' Is \nthere any doubt this nominee views the courts as simply a third \npolitical branch?\n  I will quote again:\n\n       If Chief Justice Warren came out a certain way, that must \n     be as liberal as it gets. That's not right! I think that \n     we've stunted the spectrum of legal thought in a way that \n     removes the possibility that there could have been more \n     progressive readings of the Fourth Amendment and the Fifth \n     Amendment.\n\n  It seems Professor Harris doesn't think the Warren court was nearly \nliberal enough. That is a fairly astonishing view in itself.\n  I often hear liberals and some of our nominees talk about the so-\ncalled living Constitution. Well, it is clear to me this nominee sees \nnot a living Constitution but a profoundly political Constitution. She \nsaid so herself. She sees judges as proxies engaged in a tug-of-war who \nuse judicial power as an instrument of political control. Her \nstatements, as I explained a few minutes ago, also are a clear \nindication of her belief that the role of a judge is to reflect those \npolitical and social forces.\n  For example, speaking about Justice Kennedy's stance on gay marriage, \nthe professor said that the Justice ``should be changing the same way \nthe whole country is changing.''\n  That is the language of politics, not the language of law.\n  She has said so many things to this effect that I find myself asking \nthis question: Will this nominee even consider the law when deciding a \ncase or is it all progressive outcomes, social movements, and critical \njunctures?\n  So it is clear there are two Professor Harrises: the pre-nomination \nprofessor and the post-nomination professor.\n  Let's not be naive about which Professor Harris will sit on the \nFederal bench--for life--if confirmed, because no one else is being \nnaive about that question.\n  Take, for example, an article published last May in New Republic \ngushing that the professor is a ``champion of liberal jurisprudence'' \nand will be a ``sympathetic vote for liberal causes.'' We know that \nwill be the case from the pre-nomination professor's long record of \nimpassioned liberal advocacy.\n  The article also observes--accurately, in my view--that Professor \nHarris ``clearly has an interest in using her voice to project a \nliberal jurisprudence perspective.'' That quotation pretty much sums it \nup. All anyone needs to do to confirm that claim is to read the pre-\nnomination professor's public statements, because they are all out \nthere. It is not a secret what this nominee thinks about the law and \nwhat she thinks about the courts. And it is no secret what kind of a \njudge this nominee will be if she takes the bench.\n  So it seems pretty clear to me that the timing of the vote on this \nnominee is not purely coincidental. We know this because of this week's \nObamaCare decisions handed down by the DC Circuit and the Fourth \nCircuit.\n  Last November, when the majority changed the cloture rule on judicial \nnominees, I told my colleagues the decision was a blatant attempt to \nstack the DC circuit with judges who would view sympathetically the \nadministration's arguments in upcoming ObamaCare lawsuits.\n  The other side dismissed the notion that the rules change was \ndesigned to tilt the court in the President's direction and to salvage \nObamaCare. Well, as we all know, a three-judge panel of the DC Circuit \ndecided the Halbig case this week against the administration, and it \nonly took the administration about an hour to announce that it would \nseek a rehearing by the en banc DC Circuit, which now includes four of \nthe President's nominees.\n  As we all know, our distinguished majority leader rushed through \nthree of those four nominees immediately after the rules change. And \nyesterday the distinguished majority leader finally admitted that the \nupcoming en banc panel on the Halbig ruling vindicated his decision to \ngo nuclear. He said: ``I think if you look at simple math, it does.''\n  So the distinguished majority leader isn't even trying to disguise \nhis intent, and that is exactly what happened with this nominee on her \nway to the Fourth Circuit.\n  This nomination is being considered ahead of other circuit nominees \non the executive calendar. Why is this Fourth Circuit nomination being \nfast-tracked? Why fast-track one of the most liberal nominees we have \nconsidered to date? If history is any guide, the answer is simple. It \nis all about saving ObamaCare. The other side wants to stack the Fourth \nCircuit just like the DC Circuit, because the Fourth Circuit hears a \ndisproportionate number of significant cases involving Federal law and \nregulations, as does the DC Circuit.\n  So my colleagues should understand a vote for this nominee is also a \nsolid vote for the Affordable Care Act as the cases make their way \nthrough the court.\n  I am voting ``no'' on this nominee and I urge my colleagues to do the \nsame. I yield the floor.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nnotwithstanding rule XXII, following the cloture vote on Executive \nCalendar No. 777, Disbrow, the Senate consider and vote on calendar No. \n919, Mendez; No. 920, Rogoff; and No. 921, Andrews; further, that at a \ntime to be determined by me, in consultation with Senator McConnell, on \nMonday, July 28, the Senate consider Calendar Nos. 915, Kaye; 916, \nKaye; 913, Mohorovic; and 744 McKeon; that there be 2 minutes for \ndebate equally divided between the two leaders or their designees prior \nto each vote; that upon the use or yielding back of time the Senate \nproceed to vote without intervening action or debate on the \nnominations; further, if any nomination is confirmed, the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, with no \nintervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order to \nthe nominations; that any statements related to the nominations be \nprinted in the Record; that the President be immediately notified of \nthe Senate's action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. For the information of all Senators, we expect nominations \nconsidered today to be confirmed by voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                          Washington Wildfires\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I come to the floor today to speak for \na few minutes about the absolutely devastating wildfires currently \nburning through the farms, communities, and public lands of our home \nState of Washington.\n  As a lifelong resident of Washington State and the Pacific Northwest, \nI have always been aware of the annual risks and dangers that wildfires \npose to our region. Every summer, a combination of rising temperatures, \nmonths of dry weather, and our State's obvious abundance of forest and \nfields have resulted in wildfires capable of threatening homes and \nbusinesses across our State. Each summer we have worked to become \nbetter and better prepared to help protect our communities.\n  But one wildfire burning this year is the single largest we have seen \nin Washington State. Since last Tuesday, massive wildfires covering \nhundreds of thousands of acres have ravaged our farm lands, our \nagricultural areas, our cherished public lands, and, most importantly, \ncommunities throughout Chelan County, Okanogan County, and others \nacross eastern Washington.\n\n[[Page S4869]]\n\n  I am talking about a massive wave of flames that has burned an area \nnow four times the size of Seattle, which is our State's largest city. \nEven for those of us who have lived our entire lives with the reality \nof wildfires, this is unprecedented. So while I am here in what we call \n``the other Washington,'' today, my heart, my thoughts, and my prayers \nare in Central and Eastern Washington. Even here on the Senate floor, I \ncan't help but think of the firefighters and first responders and \neveryone who is neglecting sleep and rest to protect their communities. \nMost of all, I can't stop thinking about the families who lost their \nhomes and all they own to this horrific disaster.\n  If there is one thing I know about our State, it is that we don't \nturn away from hard times or hard work. Over the last several weeks I \nhave talked with a number of the local leaders in the communities that \nare facing these fires, including Sheriff Frank Rogers in Okanogan \nCounty, Sheriff Brian Burnett in Chelan County, and Mayor Libby \nHarrison in the small town of Pateros, where dozens of homes, including \nhers, have been lost to this fire. Every one of them told me that while \ntheir community is facing hard times, nobody is giving up. They have \nbeen doing everything they can to protect each and every person in \ntheir rural communities, and so far they have been able to do that.\n  I wish to share one story that speaks to what is happening in my home \nState right now. As I mentioned, this small town of Pateros has been \nhit very hard. They haven't lost any lives, but they have lost more \nthan 100 homes and buildings throughout their community. But one \nbuilding they did not lose was their school, which has always been to \nthem the central place of their community, and it is now the central \nstaging area as these fires rage on. As in many other small \ncommunities, the school in Pateros serves kids in grades K through 12, \nand last week that fire came within just a few feet of that school.\n  Firefighters and responders were working elsewhere. So the school \ncould easily have burned down, until a local man by the name of \nAugustine Morales decided to do something about it. He and a friend \nused hoses on the backs of their own trucks to fight back that fire and \nsave their kids' school.\n\n  Augustine was interviewed by a local TV station and here is what he \nsaid:\n\n       Everything was going through my mind because I have my kids \n     and I have to take care of my kids, and I [was] just thinking \n     . . . if you die, I don't know what's going to happen.\n\n  So that is what so many people just like Augustine are facing right \nnow in Central and Eastern Washington, and I know they will not be \ngiving up.\n  In addition to our thoughts and our prayers, we have to make sure we \nare working to have all of the Federal resources they need available. I \nam thrilled the Senate supplemental funding bill that was released \nyesterday actually includes $615 million for firefighting efforts in \nWestern States--money I requested along with my colleague Senator \nCantwell and 10 other colleagues. But we know there is a lot more work \nto be done. We have to get that funding passed through the Senate and \nthe House and to the President's desk right away.\n  I am really very pleased that early yesterday morning the President, \nin fact, made an emergency declaration that is going to help those \ncommunities fight these wildfires.\n  I know that I and Senator Cantwell and all of us are going to be \nworking with our local officials and Federal officials all the way up \nto the President to make sure those communities get what they need.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I join my colleague from Washington \nwho was just on the floor to take a moment to recognize the heroic \nefforts that are underway in the State of Washington, battling \nwildfires with individuals who are trying to protect their homes and \nproperty. Our hearts go out to the family and friends of Robert \nKoczewski, a retired State trooper and veteran who suffered a heart \nattack and died while trying to save his own home.\n  I thank the local, State, and Federal agencies that are working \ntogether to meet the logistical needs of extinguishing these multiple \nfires and for the efforts they have already made to help save lives and \nminimize damage in what is the largest wildfire in our State's history.\n  I thank all of the community organizing individuals who have done so \nmuch work in their individual communities to support the efforts of the \nfirefighters and to work with everybody in the community to make sure \nevery aspect of security and safety is there for the families who have \nlost their homes.\n  I thank the individuals who have been working to provide shelter and \nto help their neighbors no matter what it takes.\n  There is a huge spirit alive in the Okanogan people who are working \nvery hard to make sure they are also contributing. They have a great \ndeal of self-reliance, spirit, and they want to make sure that, as FEMA \nand others are moving in, they are also responsible in helping with \nfighting the fires and to work to make sure as many people as possible \nin the community can be saved from this devastation.\n  We are hearing many moving stories of Washingtonians donating their \ntime, volunteering goods, things everybody in the community needs.\n  So I thank the people of Washington and particularly in the central \npart of the State for everything they are doing to help battle this \nfire.\n\n\n                           Export-Import Bank\n\n  Madam President, I also come to the floor to talk about the Export-\nImport Bank and the fact that we still need to work out a deal on the \nSenate floor so we can move this legislation. Time is running out. We \nonly have a few days before the August recess and literally only a few \nlegislative days when we return to make sure we reauthorize this \nimportant credit agency that helps manufacturers export their products.\n  When you grow U.S. manufacturing, you grow U.S. jobs. What we want to \ndo is make sure our manufacturers have a fair shot at getting their \nproducts sold overseas. So it makes no sense to me that the fate of an \norganization that is such an important tool to businesses and comes at \nno cost to the taxpayers cannot get reauthorized. In fact, I am sure \nthere are colleagues in the House of Representatives who would, if they \nhad a chance, just outright kill the credit agency altogether.\n  Last week 31 Governors signed a letter that basically called for the \nreauthorization of the Export-Import Bank. That brings the total number \nof Governors to 37. I am proud my Governor, Jay Inslee, along with \nGovernor Robert Bentley from Alabama, led an effort to say to the \nCongress: This is important to do. They see the result in their States \nas it relates to jobs, and they want to make sure we get this \nreauthorized.\n  There are Governors from all over the political spectrum--liberal \nDemocrats, to moderate Democrats, to moderate Republicans, and even tea \nparty Republicans--so there are Governors out there from Neil \nAbercrombie of Hawaii, to Governor Paul LePage of Maine, who want to \nget this important tool reauthorized. Even though they are from many \ndifferent spectrums, they see that this creates jobs in their State.\n  I would like to point out that nine of those signatures come from \nRepublican Governors, plus five Republican Governors sent their own \nletter. So that is 14 Republican Governors who joined a chorus of \nvoices in the legislative body to make sure we are doing what is right \nfor the economy and renew this charter for the important Export-Import \nBank.\n  I wish to point out from the letter that it basically says that \nwithout the financing, U.S. firms would have lost sales to overseas \ncompetitors.\n  So this is what the Governors are trying to tell us. They are \nstewards in their States of jobs and the economy, and they are very \nconcerned about the Export-Import Bank. So we want to make sure we \ncontinue to listen to those Governors and get their help in making sure \ntheir Members of Congress from their individual States support this \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S4870]]\n\n  They also are talking to thousands of small business owners who are \nsaying that failing to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank would lead to \nfewer exports and a loss of jobs in all 50 States. They are out there \ntrying to make sure they are drumming up support in the congressional \ndelegations of their States. That is because trade is a critically \nimportant aspect to our economy.\n  I just talked to one of my colleagues today who was telling me how \nmuch their State was recovering, but in the areas where they were doing \nthe most exports, their State was really growing--that particular part.\n  In 2013, U.S. exports reached $2.3 trillion in goods and services. So \nexports across the Nation that are attributable to the Ex-Im Bank \nsupport about $37 billion worth of U.S. exports and about 205,000 \nrelated jobs. So you can see that the Export-Import Bank is a vital \ntool to creating jobs in our U.S. economy, and it does all of this \nreturning $1 billion to the Federal Treasury. To me, it is a win-win \nfor taxpayers and it is a good aspect for jobs. As I said, it is \n205,000 export-related jobs and $37 billion in exports. That supports \nover 2,000 small businesses throughout our country. That is actually \nthe direct impact of businesses that are exporting with the help of the \nExport-Import Bank. I say that because there are so many more people \nwho are involved in the supply chain, and we talked about that last \nweek.\n  I would like to address one issue today that I hear about from a lot \nof colleagues: Well, isn't this just something the private sector can \ndo?\n  I guarantee you, if the private sector could just do it and would do \nit, we would be very happy. I am here to debunk that myth. In fact, in \nthe words of the private sector, it is all about them needing the help \nof the bank to actually make deals work. Anyone who thinks they know \nwhat they are talking about, I want to make sure they understand.\n  First and foremost, in the bank's charter, it prohibits them from \ncompeting with private financing and requires that all financing have a \nreasonable chance of repayment. So literally in the bank's charter it \nsays they are not there to compete with these banks. Yet I hear so many \ntimes my colleagues on the other side trying to say: Oh, well, this is \njust something that we, the government, should not be involved in.\n  I just pointed out that we actually make money off of it. So that \npart is really good for us because it helps us pay down the Federal \ndeficit. And I just mentioned how banks want to partnership with this \ncredit agency because it helps them, but it is actually in their \ncharter that it prohibits them from doing so. Specifically, the charter \nsays, in section 2, that the bank should ``supplement and encourage, \nand not compete with, private capital''--``not compete with, private \ncapital.'' So there it is in their own charter, exactly how they are \nsupposed to operate. So this is not a bank that is somehow competing \nwith banks across America. They are partnering with financial \ninstitutions that see risks in overseas markets that they think are \nundeveloped and do not have the banking and financing institutions in \ntheir organization to help get these things done, and so they want to \npartner with the Export-Import Bank.\n  It is helping businesses all across our country. In fact, 98 percent \nof the Export-Import Bank's transactions were involved with banks \nthroughout 2013. So it is not taking business away from them; it is \nactually helping businesses throughout our country.\n  The Export-Import Bank is a leading indicator for U.S. companies in \nhow to get business done in these developing markets, and it is often \nin the national and local banking interest to have a partner such as \nthis because they see deals and opportunities that come through their \nlocal communities.\n  I know there are banks--the Presiding Officer's major banks in parts \nof the Midwest, KeyBank--and others have talked to me about how \nimportant it is because they have homegrown businesses that come to \nthem, and they see the opportunity but they also see the risk, and \nhaving this credit agency be a partner with that local bank helps them \nsecure the deal.\n  As we look at this chart, it basically shows that 98 percent of the \nEx-Im Bank transactions are involving commercial banks. So, again, \nthere is this notion that somehow this bank is competing with the \nprivate sector when, in fact, it is basically prohibited in their \ncharter, and 98 percent of the deals are actually done with an \nindividual bank, which shows that this is really a tool for our \ncommercial banking.\n\n  So these are banks everywhere, from the Alaska Commercial Fishing and \nAgriculture Bank in Anchorage, to the Wallis State Bank in Texas, as \nwell as national banks such as Wells Fargo and others. So they find it \na very viable tool and something that is important to do.\n  According to a recent statement by the Bankers Association for \nFinance and Trade and the Financial Services Roundtable, the Export-\nImport Bank of the United States plays a critical role ``in \ninternational trade and US job creation by providing export financing \nproducts that help fill gaps in trade financing otherwise not provided \nby the private sector.''\n  So we are hearing from these individual banks that are saying this \nand basically articulating that this is a tool. In fact, one CEO, John \nStumpf from Wells Fargo, recently talked about his work with a company \ncalled Air Tractor. Air Tractor is a Texas company that manufactures \nagricultural aircraft, with 50 percent of its business being overseas. \nHe said how important it was that the Export-Import--I am going to \nquote him: Air Tractor would not be where they are today without the \nExport-Import Bank and there are certain things that would not have \nbeen done without them.\n  I want to go back to the fact that the banking industry really does \nbelieve the Export-Import Bank is a necessary tool. ``The Ex-Im Bank \nremains a vital partner for the lending community,'' according to the \nbankers association.\n  I think this shows there are people who are just not educated on the \nstructure of the bank, how it works, how important it is to be an \nimportant tool for us. I want to make sure we understand why the \nprivate sector cannot do these loans.\n  If people understand how the bank works, some still want to come back \nand say: Well, they still should be doing it themselves.\n  I want to go to one chart that basically shows some of the challenges \nbankers face when they are dealing with this. They face bank balance \nsheet limitations; that is, the ability to hold all of those deals on \ntheir books over the period of the loan. They have the added risk of \nexporting to foreign markets, which can be challenging at best. And \nthey have the lack of the financial sector presence in those emerging \nmarkets.\n  So as to all of those things, if you are, as I just mentioned, one of \nthese banks--from the Wallis State Bank in Texas to the Alaska \nCommercial Fishing and Agriculture Bank--you can see that they want to \nhelp this business in their State export or like this company I \nmentioned--Air Tractor in Texas that manufactures aircraft for \nagricultural purposes. You can see they want to help them. But, again, \nis the Wallis State Bank going to be able to go out and assess all \nthese international marketplaces and assess whether that end customer \nis going to be able to continue to pay on the life of this purchase? \nNo. This bank is not figuring out how to do that. So basically they are \njust turning this business down. Yet we have a U.S. manufacturer that \nhas figured out a great product, figured out how to make it, figured \nout how to get customers overseas, figured out how to compete with \ninternational competitors, and we have people here strangling the one \ntool they need--the credit agency that helps the local bank in their \ncommunity finance the deal.\n  So I just want to say I hope we resolve this issue with the Export-\nImport Bank. I hope our colleagues on both sides of the aisle can come \nto terms with the amendments that are necessary to move this bill to \nthe Senate floor. I know last time we had a similar debate and a lot of \ndiscussion, but in the end there were about 79 votes for the Export-\nImport Bank.\n  I guess I would ask all of my colleagues now to think about our \neconomy and how much U.S. manufacturers need to sell in overseas \nmarkets. We are having an unbelievable growth in the middle class \naround the globe. It is going to double in the next 15 years. That is \n2.7 billion more middle-class\n\n[[Page S4871]]\n\nconsumers who could buy U.S. products and U.S. services, but they will \nnot if we hamstring the export-import credit agencies that help support \nbanks in the financing of U.S. manufacturers' goods sold overseas.\n  I hope my colleagues will help us get this bill to the floor, get it \nreauthorized, and not for a short term, not for 3 months, not for more \nmischief to be had, but to give predictability and certainty to people \nwho are actually growing jobs in the United States of America, our \nmanufacturers.\n\n\n             Unanimous Consent Agreement Executive Calendar\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the confirmation votes \non Mendez, Rogoff, and Andrews occur following the vote to confirm the \nDisbrow nomination, and with all other provisions of the previous order \nremaining in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Hirono.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                           Export-Import Bank\n\n  Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I have got a deal for you: Let's create \nAmerican jobs, let's help American businesses find customers abroad, \nand let's do it at no cost to the American taxpayer. I rise to speak \nabout exactly the point Chairwoman Cantwell just spoke about, the \nchairwoman of our Small Business Committee, the importance of the \nExport-Import Bank, which expires on September 30 of this year.\n  The Senate and House need to act to continue the job so we can \ncontinue the bank, so we can create hundreds of thousands of jobs, so \nwe can help American businesses find customers abroad, and do it at no \ncost to the American taxpayer. Chairwoman Cantwell did a good job of \nexplaining the bank and what it does. I will just spend a few minutes \non that.\n  It is an independent, self-sustaining Federal governmental agency. It \nis one of the most important tools that U.S. companies have to boost \nexports to all the countries and all the customers abroad who want \nhigh-quality products produced in the United States. The bank assumes \ncountry and credit risks that other private sector lenders are \nunwilling or unable to do, at a reasonable cost. It helps level the \nplaying field for U.S. businesses because so many of our global \ncompetitors have banks just like this that loan even more or support \neven more loans than we do. So this is about leveling the playing field \nfor American businesses.\n  In fiscal year 2013, the Ex-Im Bank approved an all-time high 3,842 \nloan authorizations, with a total estimated export value of $37.4 \nbillion. That is estimated to have created or sustained over 200,0000 \nexport-related jobs right here in the United States. Countries such as \nChina, France, Germany, Korea, and India are extending multiple times \nas much financing as our Export-Import Bank. This is not the time to \nlet international competitors eat our lunch. We have to be aggressive \nand we have to compete. That is why this bank needs to be reauthorized.\n  I am here today to talk about why it matters in Virginia, using \nVirginia as an example. I know the Presiding Officer will forgive me \nfor being partial to the Commonwealth. But anyone can get up here and \ndo exactly what I am going to do, talk about businesses in their \nStates, to whom the Export-Import Bank is incredibly important.\n  In Virginia generally since 2007, the Ex-Im Bank has supported 98 \ncompanies in every congressional district. Fifty-nine are small \nbusinesses, ten are minority-owned, three are women-owned, more than $1 \nbillion in exports supported in Virginia since 2007. I have heard from \neverybody in Virginia, from Governor McAuliffe to the Virginia Chamber \nof Commerce, to both the National and Virginia Association of \nManufacturers saying: Whatever you do, find an agreement to authorize \nthe continuation of this very important bank.\n\n  Let me tell you about four companies. They are very different \ncompanies: rockets, apples, compressors, and paper. It sounds like a \nrock-paper-scissors thing, right?\n  Orbital Sciences Corporation in Dulles, VA, right here close. Orbital \nmanufactures small and medium-class space systems, mostly satellites \nand rockets. Their headquarters is in Dulles, 3,600 employees, high-\npaying jobs. They launch rockets from all over the country, including \nWallops Island near Chincoteague on the eastern shore of Virginia. They \nbuild satellites for the U.S. Government but also sell commercial \ncommunications satellites to many international buyers.\n  This commercial business that Orbital has is faced with significant \ncompetition from European satellite manufacturers, EADS/Astrium and \nThales/Alenia. So Orbital relies on the Export-Import Bank to level the \nplaying field. These European manufacturers get assistance from their \ngovernments to go out and compete for this commercial business and \nOrbital does the same. This neutralizes the advantage that European \ngovernments try to give to their satellite industry. In the last few \nyears, since 2012, Orbital has produced 38 satellites. Six of them \nrelied on Export-Import Bank financing and would not have been done \nwithout the backstop the Ex-Im Bank provides.\n  For every commercial satellite that Orbital builds, 300 jobs are \nsupported, direct and indirect, within the company, and then there is a \nsupply chain, with suppliers all over the country. There are an \nadditional 300 jobs in the supply chain. So the story of Orbital, \nmanufacturing rockets and satellites, is illustrative of the \ncontribution the Ex-Im Bank makes to U.S. small and medium-sized \naerospace companies.\n  Let's switch from rockets and talk about apples for a minute. Turkey \nKnob Orchard in Timberville, VA. They grow apples on 3,500 acres in \nrural Virginia. It is a longstanding family-owned business that has \nproduced apples in the Commonwealth since 1918. This family-owned \nbusiness in Timberville uses the Export-Import Bank to protect deals \nmade with companies in rapidly expanding markets such as West Africa \nand India, where the risks are high, and conventional lenders may be a \nlittle skittish.\n  Then it gives their partners peace of mind and a credible system for \nevaluating buyers abroad. The credit insurance is one of the most \ncompetitive and user-friendly products in the market for small growers \nsuch as Turkey Knob, who do not have a large international office or \nlarge international export offices around the globe. Without Ex-Im \ncredit insurance, Turkey Knob would export less and their exports would \nbe exposed to more risk, more potential liability.\n  Additionally, with the credit insurance program, small exporters are \nable to build these deals so they can build long-term relationships and \nexpand business that otherwise would not be possible.\n  We want importers abroad to buy Virginia apples. We think our apples \nare every bit as good as Washington State's or any other State's \napples. We are proud to market them, and other products from Virginia \nas well, especially at a time when the economy needs to be stronger. \nBut we would not be able to find those clients for growers such as \nTurkey Knob without the Ex-Im Bank.\n  Compressors. Bristol Compressors in Bristol, VA, right on the border \nwith Tennessee in the State's far southwestern corner. This is a \nmanufacturing company, very cutting edge. They design and manufacture \ncompressors for residential and commercial applications--air \nconditioning, heat pump, refrigeration. It is one of the largest \ncompressor manufacturers in the world. They also serve manufacturers \nand distributors across six continents. I think Antarctica may be the \nexception. They have enough air conditioning there.\n  But Bristol has worked directly and indirectly with the Ex-Im Bank \nthrough their credit lenders for many years. Bristol would not be able \nto service the majority of its international business without the \nsupport of the Ex-Im Bank. I have been to this company. It is in a part \nof the State that needs more jobs, not less. Without the Ex-Im Bank, \nthey would not be able to service their customers on six continents.\n  Bristol has told us that without the support, jobs at Bristol would \nbe at risk, which would have a negative impact on the local economy. We \nwant to promote American manufacturing, not shrink it.\n  Finally, paper. Eagle Paper International in Virginia Beach. This is \nan international paper manufacturer and distributor, been around since \n1988. \n\n[[Page S4872]]\n\nVirginia Beach is an important place, because we have an active port in \nVirginia Beach, one of the busiest ports on the east coast of the \nUnited States. So it is a great place to find exports and ship exports \nfrom.\n\n  Eagle Paper has succeeded in its 25 years in business in exporting \npaper worldwide. Eagle has told us very plainly:\n\n       Ex-Im is a crucial part of our business. Without the export \n     credit insurance we would not be able to support the customer \n     base that we currently have. Without this customer base our \n     sales would decrease and in turn we would have to eliminate \n     employees in order to keep our business up and running.\n\n  Not often do we have such no-brainers present themselves on the \nfloor. I will end where I started: Let's create American jobs. Let's \nhelp businesses find customers around the world. Let's do it at no cost \nto the American taxpayer. We do not make general fund applications to \nthe Ex-Im Bank because they charge their customers for the services \nthey provide. Not only do they break even, they actually raised $2 \nbillion above the loans they put out in the last few years, which they \nthen used to make more loans to more American businesses to create more \njobs.\n  I have been heartened to see 50-plus months of private sector job \ngrowth. I know the Presiding Officer has as well. But we also know we \nare not where we need to be yet. GDP needs to be higher. More jobs need \nto be created. We need to create more skilled workers to fill those \njobs. The Ex-Im Bank is one of the best tools we have to help move the \neconomy forward. If it did not exist, we would have to create it. The \ngood news is, it does exist. All we have to do is vote to reauthorize \nit before September 30.\n  It is my hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and in \nboth Houses will join in this very important and completely logical \nmission.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I rise today to speak in opposition to \nthe legislation pending before the Senate, the so-called Bring Jobs \nHome Act. I oppose this bill because it is a political stunt designed \nas an election-year campaign ploy that will have no meaningful impact \non job creation or on economic growth. In fact, this bill is a carbon \ncopy of a bill the Senate rejected 2 years ago when it was offered by \nanother Democratic Senator who just happened to also be up for \nreelection.\n  Simply put, if there is a Democratic bill on the Senate floor \nsupposedly about outsourcing, you can rest assured it must be election \nseason. The bill before us purports to deal with the problem of \ncompanies relocating jobs from the United States to foreign countries \nby denying the deduction associated with doing so. This must be the tax \nbenefit for shipping jobs overseas that we heard so much about from the \nObama campaign in 2008 and again in 2012.\n  There is only one problem with repealing this special tax break for \ncompanies that ship jobs overseas. It does not exist. According to the \nJoint Committee on Taxation, ``Under present law, there are no targeted \ntax credits or disallowances of deductions related to relocating \nbusiness units inside or outside the United States.'' That is from the \nJoint Committee on Taxation.\n  This statement is not surprising, given that numerous independent \nfact checkers disputed the repeated claims in 2008 that companies were \nreceiving tax breaks for shipping jobs overseas. These fact checkers \ncalled that statement ``false'' and ``misleading.'' But I guess the \nfacts do not matter when it is an election year. What this bill will do \nis insert yet more complexity and uncertainty into our Tax Code.\n  The reality is the United States economy is a $17 trillion \nenterprise, with businesses all across this country constantly closing \nold operations and opening new ones. If this bill becomes law, \ncompanies that might want to close an old factory or open a new one \nwould now have to worry if they will have to pay a tax penalty, even if \ntheir decisions are totally unrelated to any business decisions they \nmight make outside of the United States.\n  The legislation also includes a new tax credit for companies that \neliminate a business operation in a foreign country and move that \noperation to the United States. Well, that sounds like a good idea. But \nconsider how this would tilt the playing field against companies here \nin America that have not opened operations overseas. A purely domestic \ncompany that opens a new factory in my State of South Dakota will not \nget a Federal tax credit for doing so, but a global company with jobs \noverseas will get a generous credit under this bill.\n  Consider what a coalition of leading business organizations made up \nof the Business Roundtable, the Information Technology Industry \nCouncil, the National Association of Manufacturers, the National \nForeign Trade Council, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce had to say \nrecently in a letter regarding the legislation that is pending before \nus.\n  Many of the major business organizations in this country said:\n\n       While intended to promote U.S. job creation, the \n     legislation actually would have the unintended consequence of \n     making it even more difficult for American worldwide \n     companies to compete at home and in world markets, thereby \n     placing at risk jobs of American workers.\n\n  This is a letter from some of the major business organizations in \nthis country.\n  If we want greater economic growth and more jobs, we need a Tax Code \nthat creates a level playing field, not one that picks winners and \nlosers based on the preferences of Members of Congress.\n  Even if we were to assume that a new tax credit for insourcing would \nbe a good thing, the official estimate of the bill from the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation tells us that this particular tax credit will \nhave essentially no impact on our economy. According to this new \nestimate, the new insourcing credit will provide a tax credit to U.S. \ncompanies of $35 million a year. That is $35 million out of a $17 \ntrillion economy or, put another way, this credit will equal .000002 \npercent of annual U.S. economic activity. Yes, that is a decimal point \nfollowed by five zeroes. This bill isn't a drop in the budget; it is \nmore like a drop in the Pacific Ocean.\n  Yet despite the fact this legislation won't help our economy or \ncreate jobs or make America more competitive in the global economy, I \nvoted with most of my colleagues to move forward with this debate \nbecause I believe we need to have a robust debate about those measures \nthat will energize our economy.\n  As such, I filed a number of amendments that would have a meaningful, \npositive impact on our economy--unlike, I might add, the underlying \nbill. For example, I filed an amendment to make the small business \nexpensing limits, which expired at the end of last year, permanent, \nsomething that I hear about consistently from farmers, ranchers, and \nsmall businesses in my State of South Dakota.\n  These limits allow small businesses, farmers, and ranchers to deduct \nup to $500,000 per year in expenses, making it easier for these \nbusinesses to grow and to hire new workers.\n  I filed an amendment to make the R tax credit permanent. This \namendment would also strengthen the credit by raising the credit rate \nfrom 14 percent to 20 percent, thus making this credit more competitive \nwith the research incentives offered by many European and Asian \nnations.\n  I have also filed an amendment to improve the tax treatment of S \ncorporations if they convert into a C corporation, thus making this \npopular form of business operation more easily accessible. This \namendment would also make it easier for S corporations to give \nappreciated property to charity.\n  I filed an amendment to make permanent the Internet Tax Freedom Act, \nwhich currently protects most Internet users in America from taxes on \ntheir Internet access. This law was first enacted in 1998. For more \nthan 15 years it has helped our economy grow, and it has helped the \ndigital economy flourish by keeping State and local taxes off of \nInternet access, regardless of consumers' access to the Internet via \ntheir home computers or by handheld device. Unfortunately, this law is \nscheduled to\n\n[[Page S4873]]\n\nexpire in just over 3 months on November 1 if we don't take action to \nprevent that.\n  Some may claim that my amendments are partisan amendments--that these \ntax relief measures are simply Republican priorities that can't muster \nsupport on the Democrat side of the aisle. The problem with this claim \nis that all the measures I have just mentioned have found Democratic \nsupport already--significant Democratic support.\n  Consider the R amendment I just mentioned. It is identical to the \nbill that passed the House of Representatives with 274 votes in favor, \nincluding 62 House Democrats. That is right, roughly one-third of House \nDemocrats have already voted for this exact amendment.\n  The same is true for the small business expensing amendment I \nmentioned. An identical measure passed the House in June with 272 \nvotes, including 53 House Democrats. Consider the S corporation \nimprovements, which were passed by the House with 263 votes, including \n42 House Democrats voting yes.\n  Consider my amendment to make the Internet tax moratorium permanent. \nMy bill, with Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden, to make this law \npermanent has 52 Senate supporters.\n  In fact, this bill has so much support that an identical bill in the \nHouse, just last week, passed by a voice vote. This measure, supported \nby a majority of Senators, sponsored by the Democratic chairman of the \nFinance Committee, and approved by the House of Representatives by a \nvoice vote isn't even scheduled for a vote in the Senate. What a shame.\n  Consider the medical device tax repeal, which is supported by 79 \nSenators, including 34 Democratic Senators.\n  Unlike the minuscule economic impact of the bill pending on the \nSenate floor before us now, repealing the medical device tax would \nremove an ObamaCare tax increase totaling $24 billion over 10 years on \nsome of the most innovative companies in America. According to a survey \nby the trade association AdvaMed, the medical device tax is estimated \nto destroy as many as 165,000 American jobs.\n  So let's be clear. It is not that there aren't reasonable measures to \nboost our economy that we could be considering. All of the measures I \nhave mentioned have broad bipartisan support. The problem is simply \nthat the Democratic majority refuses to allow their consideration.\n  The Senate majority would prefer we spend our time on inconsequential \nelection-year gimmicks rather than any of the job-creating measures I \nhave just mentioned.\n  In fact, Senate Democrats have chosen to block nearly all Republican \namendments rather than risk having to take difficult votes. Consider \nthat the Senate has had rollcall votes on only 12 Republican amendments \nsince last July. House Democrats--the minority in the House of \nRepresentatives--in contrast have had 189 amendments voted on during \nthat same period of time.\n\n  Put another way, House Democrats have been allowed, on average, more \nthan one vote for each legislative day the House has been in session \nover the past year. In the Senate, Senate Republicans have been allowed \njust one vote per month.\n  Let me repeat that. The minority in the House is being allowed one \nvote per legislative day. The minority in the Senate is being allowed \none vote per month.\n  The Senate used to be known as the world's greatest deliberative \nbody. That description now sounds like a cruel joke, considering how \nfew amendments we have been allowed to consider.\n  The other measure our economy desperately needs is comprehensive tax \nreform. If we really care about making America a more attractive place \nto do business so as to lure new business investment jobs, we need to \nhave a much simpler Tax Code with tax rates that are competitive with \nour global competitors.\n  Let's consider the facts. When President Reagan signed the Tax Reform \nAct of 1986 into law, the United States had a corporate tax rate that \nwas more than 5 percentage points below our major economic competitors.\n  The U.S. corporate tax rate has basically stayed the same since 1986. \nYet today our tax rate is the highest in the developed world and is \nmore than 14 percentage points higher than the average of developed \neconomies.\n  Why? Look at what has happened. Unlike the United States, other \nnations decided they needed to lower their tax rates to spur economic \ngrowth and job creation. Unfortunately, today we are reaping the \nnegative consequences of inaction as we see more and more investment \nand economic activities moving to those nations that have created a \nmore favorable business environment.\n  If we want to keep the best, highest-paying jobs at home, we don't \nneed new tax credits targeted at a narrow set of companies. We need a \ncomplete overhaul of our tax system with new, competitive tax rates and \na modernized system for taxing the global revenues of American \ncompanies. Yes, it is going to be a difficult lift, but it is far from \nimpossible.\n  Consider the United Kingdom, which as recently as 2010 had a 28 \npercent tax rate and an outdated system for taxing global income. The \nUK enacted tax reform that will result in a 20-percent tax rate by next \nyear and has already resulted in a modernized system for taxing the \nincome earned by global U.K. companies.\n  Over the past 5 years, Japan--another major economic competitor of \nthe United States--has done something similar. Japan cut its corporate \ntax rate by 5 percentage points and has moved to a more competitive \nsystem for taxing global income.\n  If the UK, Japan, and other nations can modernize their Tax Code for \ncompetition in the 21st century global marketplace, certainly we in the \nUnited States can do it as well.\n  In closing, I hope the Senate Democrats will change course and allow \nfor an open and robust amendment process to allow a wide variety of \njob-creating measures to be considered.\n  Our economy, still mired in the sluggish Obama economy, could \ncertainly use it. But, if not, I look forward to a future Congress \nwhere the Senate can get back to real debate and real solutions.\n  I hope that once the campaigning is done, once the election-year \nslogans have been retired, we can get back to real, substantive \nlegislating.\n  American families and workers deserve permanent tax and regulatory \nrelief. They deserve a better economy than they have today, and they \ndeserve a Senate that once again functions as the world's greatest \ndeliberative body and puts their interests first, and their futures, \ntheir quality of life, and their standard of living where they should \nbe.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Murphy). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n  Mr. REED. I request unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Highway Trust Fund\n\n  Mr. REED. I wish to support the short-term reauthorization of our \nnational surface transportation law. It is urgent that we keep the \nhighway trust fund solvent to avoid a shutdown of work on our highways, \nbridges, and transit systems.\n  A recent letter from 62 national organizations, including the \nAmerican Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, the \nAmerican Public Transportation Association, the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, and the Laborers' International Union, echoed the White \nHouse's warning: If we don't shore up the trust fund, we put at risk \n100,000 construction projects that support more than 700,000 jobs, \nincluding 3,500 jobs in my home State of Rhode Island.\n  We have to save these jobs, but I have to say that the legislation \nbefore us is inadequate on two fronts.\n  First, instead of a short-term bill, we should be undertaking a long-\nterm extension of transportation funding to provide certainty to the \nStates and create much-needed jobs.\n  Second, the House version of this bill uses the very offsets that \nHouse Republican leaders rejected when they were included as part of my \nbipartisan legislation to extend jobless benefits for the long-term \nunemployed. House leadership has used every excuse to deny\n\n[[Page S4874]]\n\nthese benefits to people who have been hurting for months, invoking \nincreasingly problematic conditions.\n  I, for one, will not stop working to help people who, despite their \nbest efforts, find themselves without the opportunity to find work.\n  We need this patch--even though it is not the preferred solution--to \navoid a virtual shutdown of construction throughout the country and \nprevent further job losses. But the mere fact that the trust fund is so \nclose to becoming bankrupt has already had an effect. Last month, \nMoody's downgraded the ratings on the GARVEE bonds for 26 \ntransportation agencies.\n  In Rhode Island our Department of Transportation has about $67 \nmillion of projects on hold because of the uncertainty about the trust \nfund. These are projects that could put people to work in a State that \nunfortunately is tied for the highest unemployment rate in the Nation. \nThere is more work the State wants to move forward on that would create \nmore needed jobs, but we can only do that with a long-term \nreauthorization bill.\n  With only a few months of funding under this so-called patch, Rhode \nIsland will be able to start little--if any--new construction. Instead, \nthe trickle of Federal funding will pay back debt from projects that \nhave already been finished and keep ongoing projects from stopping. It \nwill support some design work that could help keep contract designers \nfrom going out of business, but it won't get much new construction \nstarted.\n  So my State and others across the country are forced to wait in a \nvery costly holding pattern. Only a bill that invests significant \nresources over multiple years can provide this certainty for States and \nhelp get new projects underway.\n  That was the point made by Secretary Foxx and 11 former Secretaries \nof Transportation in a letter just a few days ago, noting that we are \nmore than a decade removed from the passage of the last long-term \ntransportation reauthorization bill.\n  Another point the Secretaries make is this: While long-term certainty \nis essential, greater Federal investment is needed to ensure our \ntransportation infrastructure meets the needs of our people.\n  As a nation, our transportation infrastructure system is in desperate \nneed of improvement. The most recent report card from the American \nSociety of Civil Engineers gave both our roads and transit systems a \ngrade of D.\n  Our aging infrastructure doesn't get as much attention in the media \nas other issues until the worst happens, such as the collapse of major \nbridges in Minnesota in 2007 and Washington State last year. But there \nare structurally deficient roads and bridges in every State, bridges \nthat millions of Americans drive across for work or travel, that \ncompanies use to transport products, and that our schoolbuses drive \nover with our children.\n  Aging infrastructure is a major challenge for Rhode Island, which has \nthe highest percentage of roads that are in poor condition and the \nhighest percentage of bridges that are deficient or obsolete according \nto the American Society of Civil Engineers and the U.S. Department of \nTransportation.\n  In the last 5 years, Rhode Island has had to act to replace two major \nbridges on the I-95 corridor. Luckily, the State has been able to take \naction to avert a disaster, but it hasn't been easy. One of these \nbridges, the Pawtucket River Bridge, was effectively closed to all \nlarge trucks for several years until it was replaced. The other, the \nProvidence Viaduct, which is currently being replaced, has required \nboards to be placed beneath it in order to protect traffic and \npassersby below from falling concrete.\n  Each year, these kinds of deficiencies cost American families $120 \nbillion in extra fuel and time, according to the White House. \nBusinesses pay $27 billion annually in extra freight costs, which then \nget passed on to consumers. In Rhode Island, the poor road conditions \ncost $496 million each year in added vehicle repair and operating \nexpenses, which is over $650 per year for each motorist.\n  To tackle the significant challenges to keep our roads, bridges, and \ntransit in a state of good repair, States such as Rhode Island will \nneed a strong Federal commitment. According to the American Society of \nCivil Engineers, we need to increase our surface transportation funding \nat all levels of government by $846 billion by 2020 to restore our \ntransportation system to a state of good repair and meet the demands \nfor our growing population and economy. Without more investment, we \nincrease the chance of another infrastructure failure and we create \ninefficiency in our economy.\n  Federal funding is critical for all our States in meeting that \nchallenge, but it is especially important for States such as Rhode \nIsland that struggle to generate their own funds for infrastructure. \nIndeed, stagnant Federal support will make it harder for States that \nare struggling economically to share in our national prosperity, \nrunning the risk of increasing economic inequality among States.\n  However, with added investments in infrastructure, we can improve \nfreight, roads, and transit systems, meaning commuters will make it to \ntheir destinations more quickly and safely while businesses save on \nshipping goods.\n  Too many times in the past, the Republican leadership in the House \nhas exploited deadlines like this to engage in brinkmanship, shutting \ndown the Federal Government and bringing the country to the edge of \ndefault. In part because we haven't had a manufactured crisis in the \nlast several months, we have seen some good signs in our economy, and \nso I am encouraged we will not see a shutdown of work on our roads and \nbridges this summer.\n  But again, averting disaster shouldn't be our goal. We need to press \nahead with a multiyear reauthorization bill to create jobs and improve \nour economy. Unfortunately, when it comes to helping American workers \nand our economy, Republican leaders, particularly in the House, have \nstalled progress.\n  Indeed, we have seen Republicans block several measures that would \nhelp strengthen our economic recovery. As I discussed earlier, House \nRepublicans refused to act on restoring emergency unemployment \ninsurance, despite the fact that the Congressional Budget Office \nestimates that a year-long extension would generate 200,000 new jobs. \nRepublicans have also blocked our efforts to raise the minimum wage, \nlet borrowers refinance their student loans, pass a paycheck fairness \nbill or an energy efficiency bill. We need long-term solutions to all \nof these issues.\n  In my view, we should make this extension--the one we are considering \nnow--as short as possible to increase the likelihood that we can pass a \nlong-term bill that increases our investment in our transportation \nsystem. Regardless of the duration of this short-term bill, we should \nbe working to address the issue before the end of the year. As \nSecretary Foxx and his predecessors admonished:\n\n       What America needs is to break this cycle of governing \n     crisis-to-crisis, only to enact a stopgap measure at the last \n     moment.\n\n  The Secretaries made another important point. They wrote this:\n\n       Until recently, Congress understood that, as America grows, \n     so must our investments in transportation. And for more than \n     half a century, they voted for that principle--and increased \n     funding--with broad, bipartisan majorities in both houses. We \n     believe they can, and should, do so again.\n\n  We should follow their advice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                             Border Crisis\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise again on the Senate floor to talk \nabout the crisis at our southern border, and it is a crisis. I don't \nuse that word lightly, but it is clearly a crisis on many levels.\n  This fiscal year alone, since October 1, 2013, over 381,000 illegal \naliens have entered our country through that border. Of course, a big \npart of that crisis is unaccompanied alien children--58,000 of them. \nThe Obama administration itself says that number will probably grow to \n85,000 or 90,000 in just the next few months, by the end of this fiscal \nyear.\n  We see on this chart that since 2008, sending these UACs back, \ndeporting them, effectively has plummeted--absolutely plummeted. This \nis a key part of the problem.\n  Since this crisis came into clear focus, I have been doing several \nthings. I have asked the administration, through a letter to the \nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh\n\n[[Page S4875]]\n\nJohnson, for facts, details about the impact of this crisis--the \nnumbers, the particulars, and specifically what impact it can have on \nLouisiana, my home State. I haven't gotten any response. That is very \ndisappointing. I am asking publicly again for a detailed response to \nthose legitimate straightforward questions.\n  I have agreed with many others in the House and Senate to partner \nwith the administration around strong action to change this trend, to \nchange our policy, to deport illegal aliens effectively, to send a very \nnew and different message to Central and South America to stem this \ngrowing crisis. Unfortunately, that plea has not gotten a positive \nresponse from the administration either.\n  In reaction to that, I have had to dig around wherever I can find \ncredible sources and find out key information myself, particularly as \nit affects Louisiana. I have been making calls to military leaders, \nlocal ICE officials, anyone else with significant credible information.\n  Again, this should be able to come directly from the Department of \nHomeland Security. It has not. But this is what I am finding out: The \nLouisiana ICE office has a backlog of juvenile cases--cases involving \nminors. First of all, it already had about 2,000 of those cases in \nLouisiana alone before this wave upon wave of minor illegal aliens \nreached crisis proportions. Adding on to those 2,000 cases--1,956 to be \nexact--there are now over 1,200 new juvenile cases in Louisiana. These \nare unaccompanied children coming into the country illegally and then \nbeing brought into Louisiana, in most cases turned over to the custody \nof a family member or a sponsor, and many of these family members are \nthemselves illegal.\n  We are not a border State. We are not Texas, we are not Arizona or \nNew Mexico. We are not one of the States most affected. Yet even \nLouisiana has this significant impact with very troubling numbers.\n  I talked to folks at the Hirsch Memorial Coliseum in Shreveport and \nfound out that the International Association of Fairs and Expositions--\na trade association for their sorts of facilities around the country--\nwas contacted by the Department of Homeland Security about locating \nmass space for housing of illegal alien UACs. The Hirsch Memorial \nColiseum in particular in Shreveport was contacted to see if they could \nbe part of that, and they said they couldn't. It was not practical at \nall. But that inquiry was made.\n  On the military side, I talked to leadership at Fort Pope. They were \ncontacted by the U.S. Army Installation Management Command Headquarters \nand asked if they could house between 400 and 500 unaccompanied alien \nchildren. They said they couldn't for very compelling practical reasons \nat Fort Pope.\n  Barksdale Air Force Base in Shreveport was asked via the Air Force \nGlobal Strike Command and the Department of Defense if they had \ncapacity for the same mass housing operation. Their response was as \nfollows:\n\n       Barksdale's answer has been consistent with our strategic \n     mission and supporting base infrastructure for the nation's \n     #1 mission (nuclear)--we would not support or participate.\n\n  But it is significant those inquiries were actively made.\n  Belle Chasse Naval Air Station in New Orleans, again on behalf of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, was contacted about their capacity for \nthis same sort of thing twice.\n  Again, it makes the point that even Louisiana--not a border State, \nnot a State most affected--is fielding many inquiries and significant \nimpacts--1,259 new juvenile cases being brought into the State, all of \nthese inquiries.\n  I wish I could get this information directly from the Department of \nHomeland Security. I have asked for it. They have not been forthcoming.\n  Unfortunately, the administration likewise has not been forthcoming \nabout real solutions, partnering with Congress to make changes in the \nlaw and anything else necessary to stem this tide and reverse the \npolicy that continues to encourage this tide. We have seen no \nleadership there either.\n  While the President spent the first 10 days of focus on this crisis \ntalking about various parts of Federal law that he said were tying his \nhands, when it came to sending a request to Congress, there was no \nrequest to change any of that law. There was no request to streamline \nany deportation procedures. There was no request to heighten the \nstandard for asylum or anything else. The only request was to send him \na huge amount of additional money, billions upon billions of dollars.\n  So in the absence of that leadership and partnership and information, \nI started to develop legislative ideas with many others myself, and I \nhave introduced a legislative solution--S. 2632--to address this \nspecific unaccompanied alien children crisis, and it has been \nintroduced in the House by my Louisiana colleague, Congressman Bill \nCassidy.\n  Fundamentally, this legislation would reverse the policy we have in \nplace which accepts these folks over and does nothing to quickly deport \nthem to their home country. It would reverse that policy so we would \nhave quick, effective, immediate deportations to send the message to \nCentral and South America that this has to stop and to stem that tide.\n  Specifically, the legislation would do nine things:\n  No. 1, it would mandate detention of all unaccompanied alien children \nupon apprehension. No catch and release. No catch and then, yes, here. \nWe will further the smuggling and give you to your family members or \nsponsors in this country.\n  No. 2, we would amend the law to bring parity between UACs from \ncontiguous and noncontiguous countries. All UACs, regardless of country \nof origin, will be given the option to voluntarily depart. That is a \npractical solution, in the case of those coming from Mexico and \nCanada--obviously many more from Mexico.\n  No. 3, those UACs who do not voluntarily depart will be immediately \nplaced in a streamlined removal process and detained by the Department \nof Homeland Security. Currently, they are transferred instead to Health \nand Human Service's Office of Refugee Resettlement, where they are \nbasically resettled.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have to object. I have no objection to having more time \nafter the vote, but I object before the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 5 minutes \nprior to the cloture vote on the Harris nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. I will consider objecting, but I would far prefer to \namend the unanimous consent request so that I get the additional minute \nI was just denied and the Senator from Maryland gets her time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, my unanimous consent request was for me to \nfinish my remarks in 1 minute and then have the Senator----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending unanimous consent request is from \nthe Senator from Maryland.\n  Is there objection?\n  Mr. VITTER. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I therefore call for the regular order. \nI ask unanimous consent that my full statement be included in the \nRecord, to yield back whatever time we have, and that we move \nexpeditiously to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                           Harris Nomination\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am so proud to be here today in \nsupport of the nomination of Pamela Harris--a brilliant litigator, \nprofessor, and public servant--to serve on the Fourth Circuit.\n  Senator Cardin and I recommended Ms. Harris to President Obama with\n\n[[Page S4876]]\n\nthe utmost confidence in her abilities, talent, and competence for the \njob. The ABA agreed--they gave her their highest rating of unanimously \nwell-qualified.\n  I thank Senator Reid for being so prompt in scheduling this vote. I \nalso thank Senator Leahy for his expeditious movement of her nomination \nthrough the Judiciary Committee.\n  I have had the opportunity to recommend several judicial nominees for \nour district and appellate courts. I take my ``advise and consent'' \nresponsibilities very seriously. When I consider nominees for the \nFederal bench, I have four criteria: absolute integrity; judicial \ncompetence and temperament; a commitment to core constitutional \nprinciples; and a history of civic engagement in Maryland. I expect our \nrecommendations to not only meet these criteria but to exceed them, as \nMs. Harris surely does. She has dedicated her career to the rule of \nlaw, achieving equal justice under the law and the perfection of \nappellate advocacy. She is truly an outstanding nominee.\n  Ms. Harris's career spans academia, private practice, and government. \nBut there has always been a common thread of public service. We are \nproud to say that she is ``home-grown''--although born in Connecticut, \nshe has called Maryland home since she was a child, eventually \ngraduating from Walt Whitman High School in Bethesda, MD. She went on \nto Yale where she received her bachelor's degree summa cum laude as \nwell as her law degree. After completing a clerkship on the D.C. \nCircuit, Ms. Harris went on to clerk for Justice Stevens on the Supreme \nCourt. She has served at the Department of Justice Office of Legal \nCounsel and at the Office of Legal Policy under two different \nadministrations. She also spent 10 years appearing regularly before the \nSupreme Court while counsel and then partner at O'Melveny & Myers, \ntaking on some of the most complex issues of our time.\n  Ms. Harris also has a distinguished career in academia as a Professor \nat the University of Pennsylvania Law School, co-director of the \nHarvard Appellate Practice Clinic, and later, at Georgetown, where she \nis today. At Georgetown she serves as executive director of the Supreme \nCourt Institute, preparing litigants--first come, first served--and \nregardless of their position--for arguments before the Court. But Ms. \nHarris remained connected to Maryland, whether it was a pro bono \nappellate clinic at O'Melveny to work with Maryland's public defender \nor an amicus brief in major litigation involving Montgomery County \nPublic Schools.\n  Ms. Harris has a commitment to the legal profession that is \nunmatched. It shows in the students that she has taught, the litigants \nthat she has prepared, the briefs that she has written, and the pro \nbono service that she has rendered. She has risen to the highest levels \nof her education and career. Yet she has seen people in her life \nconfront adversity and she knows the impact that the law has on \npeople's daily lives. I believe it is this which contributes to her \nvery humble nature. She believes that the Court is a place for justice \nand not a stepping stone. Ms. Harris continues to give back to the \ncommunity, serving on the board of trustees at her children's school, \nand also to legal scholarship, as a member of the board of directors \nfor the American Constitution Society and the Constitutional \nAccountability Center.\n  So I am so honored to be here today to support her nomination. I ask \nthat you all join me in doing the same. It is critical that we have \njudges with commitment to public service, civic engagement, and the \nrule of law. And we have that in none other than Pamela Harris.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I would just like to again ask unanimous \nconsent to be recognized for 1 additional minute following the Senator \nfrom Maryland being recognized for 4 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                          Wildfire Management\n\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Madam President, we have an opportunity to address an \nissue of concern to foresting communities in Wisconsin and across the \nNation in the emergency supplemental appropriations bill now pending \nbefore Congress.\n  The supplemental addresses a number of very urgent issues. The issue \nof unaccompanied minors who are crossing our southern border has \nrightly received much attention and there is, indeed, a crisis. I \nbelieve Congress must pass a supplemental appropriations bill to help \naddress this humanitarian crisis.\n  This afternoon I wish to call attention to another emergency that \nCongress must address: extreme wildfires and the dysfunctional way the \nFederal Government manages our firefighting operations.\n  Devastating wildfires are raging in Washington and Oregon States, and \nmany other States have felt the heartbreaking impact of major forest \nfire destruction. As I presided earlier today, I heard the two Senators \nfrom Washington State come to the floor and talk about the devastation \nthe wildfires in their State are causing and the bravery of citizens \nwho are facing these destructive fires. It is why I am pleased \nAppropriations Committee Chairwoman Mikulski has drafted an emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill that includes $615 million for \nwildfire suppression. I thank her for her tremendous leadership in \nputting together a strong bill, and I urge Congress to take up and pass \nthis legislation without delay to provide much needed support to these \nsuffering communities.\n  But it is not just Western States that feel the impact of wildfires. \nIn fact, a State such as Wisconsin is hurt very significantly by a \nbroken budget process called fire borrowing. It forces the U.S. Forest \nService to take funding intended to manage our forests and instead use \nit for wildfire suppression. In fact, fire borrowing is a misnomer. The \nmoney is never paid back. This cripples the U.S. Forest Service and \ndiverts critical funding from my home State and many others.\n  In Wisconsin, over 50,000 people are employed in the forest products \nindustry, from jobs in forestry and logging to paper makers in the \nState's many mills. The industry pays over $3 billion in wages into the \nState's economy and ships products worth over $17 billion each year.\n  Unfortunately, fire borrowing has led to long project delays that are \nimpacting this vital industry and jeopardizing the jobs which it \nsupports.\n  The practice of fire borrowing has increased in recent years, \ntriggered when we have a bad fire season and the Forest Service runs \nout of funds available for firefighting. When the firefighting funding \nis gone, the agency transfers funds from other parts of its budget and \nborrows them to pay for the fire suppression. When these funds are \ndiverted, agency work is simply put on hold.\n  No business owner would select a supplier who couldn't provide a \nclear delivery schedule or who would routinely delay delivery of \nproducts for undetermined amounts of time. Loggers and other local \nbusinesses that partner with the Forest Service have to deal with just \nsuch uncertainty because of fire borrowing. Government can work better \nthan this.\n  Fortunately, the Senate emergency supplemental appropriations bill \nwould solve this broken process by treating the largest fires as other \nnatural disasters such as hurricanes or tornadoes, and it would \nstabilize the rest of the Forest Service budget so that other essential \nwork, ranging from timber sales to the management of forest health, can \nbe completed on schedule.\n  Furthermore, the proposal is fiscally responsible, because it would \nhelp reduce long-term costs by allowing for increased fire prevention \nactivities and because it would not increase the amount that Congress \ncan spend on natural disasters.\n  Ending fire borrowing has strong bipartisan support. In fact, over \n120 Members of the House and Senate, and more than 200 groups ranging \nfrom the timber industry to conservation groups, to the National Rifle \nAssociation, support the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act--the bipartisan \nbill that contains the fire borrowing fix included in the supplemental. \nThe consensus is we need to get this fix done this year.\n  While there is strong bipartisan support for ending fire borrowing, \nit is unclear if the House of Representatives is going to support this \nfix in the supplemental appropriations bill that is being considered \nnow. In fact, my friend, the House Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan, \nhas consistently stood in the way of bipartisan solutions offered in \nboth the House and the Senate. He has ignored the fact that the current \nbudget structure is flawed and has resulted in the Forest Service \ntaking the forest management funding Wisconsin's forests rely upon and \ninstead using it to fight wildfires.\n\n  As his Republican House colleague Representative Mike Simpson \nrecently pointed out:\n\n       Unfortunately, continuing the status quo, as Chairman Ryan \n     advocates, prevents us\n\n[[Page S4878]]\n\n     from reducing the cost and severity of future fires by \n     forcing agencies to rob the money that Congress has \n     appropriated for these priorities to pay for increasingly \n     unpredictable and costly suppression needs.\n\n  I urge my friend and fellow Wisconsinite to join us and support \nending fire borrowing.\n  I thank Chairwoman Mikulski and subcommittee Chairman Reed for \nincluding this important provision in the supplemental bill. I wish to \nalso thank Senators Wyden and Crapo for their tireless leadership in \nthe fight to end fire borrowing.\n  The proposal included in the emergency appropriations supplemental is \na fiscally responsible solution to a devastating problem with wide-\nranging impacts. It will help us respond to wildfires and it will \nsupport businesses and thousands of jobs in the timber industry in \nWisconsin as well as throughout the country.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate and in the House to come together \nto solve this problem once and for all.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                            Unrest In Israel\n\n  Mr. HELLER. Madam President, last week the Washington Post ran an \nopinion piece titled ``Moral clarity in Gaza.'' The thesis of the \narticle states that Israel is not interested in cross-border violence; \nrather, the goal of the current military action is to establish peace. \nI believe the writer correctly suggests that Israel has been left with \nno choice but to act in order to defend herself from the terrorist \norganization Hamas.\n  The piece also made the important conclusion that Hamas wants to \nprovoke a fight with Israel and that this group is willing to sacrifice \ntheir own people in order to win international support and ultimately \nundermine Israel's legitimacy and right to defend itself.\n  There is no question regarding Israel's legitimacy, and there is also \nno question regarding Israel's right to defend itself. The \ninternational community has affirmed this principle. Further, this body \naffirmed Israel's right to defend itself when the Senate recently \npassed Senator Graham's resolution on this matter.\n  As a cosponsor, I believe this resolution speaks in clear terms: The \nSenate stands with Israel's right to defend itself, and it demands that \nHamas immediately--immediately--stop attacking Israel.\n  While the Senate has made its position on this issue clear, Israel \nhas been forced to take matters into its own hands. As we speak, \nIsraeli defense forces are engaged in Operation Protective Edge, \nworking to identify and destroy the infrastructure Hamas has used to \nexecute attacks and move artillery underneath Gaza City.\n  Recent reports have stated that the IDF has destroyed more than 20 \ntunnels and identified many more as ground troops moved from building \nto building. They are utilizing air, ground, and sea to strike \ndesignated targets and provide support as IDF works its way through \nGaza City.\n  The fighting will likely continue and more casualties on both sides \nwill increase until either a cease-fire can be negotiated or Israel \nbelieves the tunnel system has been successfully negated.\n  I believe Israel has been left with no choice but to defend herself. \nIsrael has faced a barrage of rocket attacks from Gaza Strip, and \naccording to Secretary of State Kerry Hamas has attempted to sedate and \nkidnap Israelis through the network of tunnels used to stage cross-\nborder raids.\n  Prime Minister Netanyahu cannot tolerate rocket attacks and cannot \ntolerate kidnappings aimed at Israelis. Their right to defend \nthemselves is without question. But through the process, innocent \nPalestinians are being killed. This tragic loss of innocent life must \nnot go unnoticed, but we must acknowledge Hamas's role in risking the \nlives of their own through their own actions.\n  Hamas stores and launches rockets from heavily populated areas. They \ndo this because they know it will draw return fire from Israel, and \neven if some Palestinians are killed, the coverage aired worldwide will \nbe favorable to Hamas and therefore well worth the loss. Hamas is \nsacrificing its own to win a media war against Israel. In contrast, in \nthe lead-up to military action, Israel dropped thousands of leaflets \nexplaining to Palestinians where they can go to be safe.\n  There is no clearer picture of right versus wrong than Israel \nfighting to protect its citizens against a terrorist operation \noperating underground and using Palestinians they live with as human \nshields.\n  Hamas is a terrorist organization willing to let women and children \ndie if there is a possibility it advances international sympathy for \nthem and underscores Israel in any way.\n  The footage of innocent Palestinians dying in Gaza is tragic, but the \nblame is not at the foot of Israel; it is on Hamas.\n  Over the next weeks and months, the military action in Gaza may \nescalate. If a cease-fire is not negotiated, the United States cannot \nturn its back on Israel. We must continue to stand with them and allow \nthem to eradicate this terrorist threat and shut down these underground \ntunnels. It is their right as a nation, and the United States must \nstand with them.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I wish to compliment the distinguished \nSenator from Nevada for his very cogent remarks. They are true, and I \nappreciate his leadership on this matter.\n\n\n                          Bring Jobs Home Act\n\n  Madam President, the Senate is currently debating the so-called Bring \nJobs Home Act--a bill supposedly aimed at preserving and creating jobs \nin the United States. However, as I noted here on the floor yesterday, \nthe Bring Jobs Home Act is little more than political posturing and \nelection-year messaging. It really does get old. We have gone through \nthat over and over while we do not do what we ought to do for this \ncountry.\n  The Senate Democrats want to portray the Republicans as the party of \noutsourcing, which is a joke. So they have crafted a bill that will do \nnothing to actually address the problem of outsourcing but will provide \nthem with a few days' worth of talking points on the subject. We went \nthrough precisely this same exercise in 2012. We voted on the exact \nsame bill during the last election cycle. It was meaningless then, and \nit is meaningless now.\n  As I said, I went over this yesterday. I talked at some length about \nthe shortcomings of this bill, and I do not want to rehash all of that \nagain today. Instead, I would like to take a few minutes to talk about \nsome things we could be doing to create and protect American jobs. I \nhave filed some amendments to this bill that I think would actually do \nsomething along those lines. If we get a chance to offer amendments to \nthis bill--which is, of course, doubtful under the way the Senate is \ncurrently being run--I think these are the types of amendments we \nshould consider.\n  One of my amendments is a four-part tax amendment that would help \nbusinesses create jobs in the United States. If enacted, it would \nprovide additional cash flow for businesses that would allow them to \nhire workers, increase wages, and invest in plant and equipment in the \nUnited States, among other things. It would do so by making four \nseparate temporary tax provisions permanent.\n  The first of these provisions relates to section 179, small business \nexpensing. My amendment would permanently increase the amount of \nequipment, certain real property, and software a business can deduct in \na year to $500,000 and index that amount to inflation. That makes \nsense.\n  The second provision would make bonus depreciation permanent, \nallowing businesses to permanently deduct 50 percent of the cost of \nqualified property in the first year that property is placed in \nservice.\n  My amendment would also make the research and development tax credit \npermanent, increasing the alternative simplified credit to 20 percent \nand eliminating the traditional research and development credit test.\n  Finally, the amendment would permanently provide for a full exclusion \nof capital gains income derived from the sale of stock of certain small \nsubchapter C corporations held on a long-term basis.\n  All of these would be tremendous amendments and would really create \njobs. They ought to be allowed on this\n\n[[Page S4879]]\n\nbill. Together, these four provisions would provide much needed \ncertainty for job-creating businesses and allow companies to more \neffectively plan for the future.\n  If we are going to amend the Tax Code in the name of creating jobs, \nthis is a far better approach, as it removes uncertainty and simplifies \nelements of the code. The Bring Jobs Home Act would actually do the \nopposite.\n  I have also filed two health-related amendments to this bill.\n  The first of these amendments would repeal the medical device tax \nthat was included as part of the so-called Affordable Care Act. \nObamaCare's $24 billion tax on lifesaving and life-improving medical \ndevices is reducing U.S. employment.\n  A recent study by industry group AdvaMed estimated that the tax has \ncost as many as 165,000 jobs. That is 165,000 American jobs eliminated \nby this misguided tax. Ten percent of respondents to that survey have \nrelocated manufacturing outside of the country or expanded \nmanufacturing abroad rather than in the United States.\n  This would help solve the inversion problem, but our colleagues on \nthe other side will not do anything about it. Yet they are trying to \nblame the Republicans for the inversion? Give me a break.\n  The tax is also curbing American innovation. Thirty percent of \nAdvaMed survey respondents have reduced their investments in research \nand development--30 percent.\n\n  If we really want to keep companies from moving American jobs \noffshore, this is a far better approach. It is far more substantial, \nand, as the survey data shows, it will have an immediate, real-world \nimpact on jobs in the United States.\n  It is bipartisan. Republicans and Democrats support repeal of the \nmedical device tax. Last year 79 Senators on this floor--including 34 \nDemocrats--voted to repeal the tax. It really is a no-brainer. I hope \nwe can finally get a vote on it. But sooner or later, we are going to \nget a vote on it, and it is going to be on a bill that will pass both \nHouses.\n  My other health care amendment would repeal ObamaCare's job-killing \nemployer mandate. As we all know, the so-called Affordable Care Act \nrequires employers with 50 or more employees to provide health coverage \nto their workers or pay a $2,000 tax per employee. This deters business \ngrowth as it discourages small businesses from hiring more than 50 \nemployees and has led many employers to cut workers' hours to keep from \ngoing over the mandate's threshold. How stupid can we be? Even the \nadministration has acknowledged that the employer mandate is harmful. \nThey have already delayed it several times in hopes of delaying its \nharmful impact during an election year. Isn't that nice?\n  If we really want to keep people in their jobs and encourage \nbusinesses to hire more American workers, repealing the employer \nmandate would go a long way.\n  My last amendment would advance U.S. trade policy by renewing trade \npromotion authority. Specifically, the amendment contains the text of \nthe Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities Act of 2014, a bill I \nintroduced in January along with Chairman Camp of the House Ways and \nMeans Committee and former chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator \nMax Baucus of Montana.\n  This bill establishes 21st-century congressional negotiating \nobjectives and rules for the administration to follow when engaged in \ntrade talks, including strict requirements for congressional \nconsultations and access to information. If the administration follows \nthese rules, the bill provides special procedures to more quickly move \na negotiated deal through Congress.\n  Renewing TPA, which expired in 2007, is necessary to successfully \nconclude ongoing trade negotiations, such as the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership, the TPP, negotiations as well as free-trade agreement \ntalks with the European Union, often referred as T-TIP, involving 28 \nnations, including ours. These are two landmark trade deals with the \npotential to greatly boost U.S. exports and create jobs here.\n  The TPP countries--which represent many of the fastest growing \neconomies in the world--accounted for 40 percent of total U.S. goods \nexports in 2012. Think of the jobs that would be created.\n  Another, the EU, the European Union, purchased close to $460 \nbillion--with a ``b''--in U.S. goods and services that same year, \nsupporting 2.4 million American jobs.\n  In addition, the United States is negotiating the Trade in Services \nAgreement, or TISA, with 50 countries, covering about 50 percent of \nglobal GDP and over 70 percent of global services trade. This agreement \nwould create many opportunities for U.S. jobs in this critical sector.\n  It is vital that we get these trade agreements over the finish line, \nand the only way we are going to be able to do that is to renew trade \npromotion authority. My amendment provides a reasonable, bipartisan \npath forward on renewing TPA and would do far more to create jobs and \ngrow our economy than the legislation before us today, which is \nminuscule in effort. As with other amendments, I hope we can vote on \nthis TPA amendment.\n  Of course, I am not the only Senator who has offered reasonable job-\ncreating amendments to the Bring Jobs Home Act. Numerous amendments \nhave already been offered, and I am sure more are on the way--or should \nI say filed because we have been prohibited from really offering \namendments on these bills and really having a robust debate for a long \ntime now because of the actions of the current leadership of the \nSenate. The Senate is hardly operating as the Senate always has in the \npast; that is, in an effective, let's-be-positive way.\n  Sadly, if the recent past is any indication, there will not be any \nvotes on amendments to this bill. The Bring Jobs Home Act is not \ndesigned to create jobs. It is not even designed to pass the Senate. \nOnce again, the entire purpose of this bill is to give Democrats some \npolitical talking points as the August recess approaches. Having an \nopen and fair debate on amendments would distract from this partisan \ngoal. We understand that everything is partisan around here. Everything \nis political right now. But my gosh, when are we going to start acting \nas the Senate?\n  That being the case, it is doubtful that any amendments are going to \nbe considered on this legislation, which is, of course, a crying shame. \nThe stated purpose of this bill is to create and protect American jobs. \nThe Republicans have amendments that would do just that and more. I \nmentioned a few such amendments that would have a far greater impact on \nAmerican workers and businesses than the bill before us today--most of \nwhich are bipartisan amendments.\n  That is what is amazing to me. This is just a game that is being \nplayed. It is really an irritating game to me. If we are serious about \nthe idea of creating jobs in the United States, let's have a real \ndebate about it. Let's discuss some alternative approaches. I know my \nfriends on the other side will have great ideas on some of these, if \nthey would be allowed to act like legislators for a change.\n  Let's talk about the real problems that are hampering job growth. \nLet's set votes on some of the ideas we have proposed. I hope we can do \nthat this time around. But of course I am not under any illusions that \nthe Democratic leadership here in the Senate is about to change course \nand let this body function the way it is supposed to. They are not \nabout to let the Senate be the Senate. They are not about to let both \nsides have a full-fledged opportunity to improve these bills. They are \nnot about to allow full and fair debate on both sides.\n  To me, it is mind-boggling in the case of this bill. I hope I am \nwrong. I hope we can get amendments up that would make this bill a real \nbill about jobs, instead of just politics. But, sadly, I do not think I \nam wrong. My experience has been that politics is triumphant around \nhere and getting the people's work done is secondary.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren.) The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S4880]]\n\n                          Child Refugee Crisis\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the child refugee crisis on America's \nborder is a human tragedy.\n  Two weeks ago in Chicago I met 70 of these children. It was a meeting \nI won't forget. These are children, some are infants. How they ever \nmade it to the United States is nothing short of a miracle, and many \nwho tried didn't.\n  Those who made it--some of them--come scarred from the journey--young \nwomen who were assaulted, children who were beaten. Some lost their \nlives on the way, but these were the survivors. They made it. They were \nin a transitional shelter in Chicago that has been there for 19 years, \nand 70 of them were getting physical exams and meals. As one person \nthere said, for the first time in their lives, many of them, were free \nto be children.\n  These children are in the United States and they are testing us. It \nis a test for the United States as to whether we care. I believe we are \na caring nation. We proved it over and over. How many times in far-\nflung places in the world have we rallied--politically to stand behind \n300 girls who were kidnapped in Nigeria, to be there during the Haitian \nearthquake to make sure the families and children would at least have \nshelter, medicine, and food. The list goes on and on for this caring \nnation.\n  But this is different. This is not about a problem over there. This \nis about a challenge here. What President Obama has said to us is we \nmust rise to this challenge. As we have in so many places in this \nworld, we must rise to the challenges at home. When it comes to these \nchildren, we can be humane and caring and do the right thing.\n  He sent us a bill to pay for the services they need. It is expensive. \nSome people argue it is too expensive. Well, we can argue about the \nexact amount of money, but I hope we aren't arguing about the value and \nthe principle that is being tested. I hope we are not arguing about \nwhether the United States is a caring and compassionate nation.\n  I just left a meeting with the Presidents from the three Central \nAmerican countries which are responsible for 80 percent of these \nrefugees: El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala. Yesterday we met with \ntheir Ambassadors.\n  It is easy to understand what is happening. It is easy to understand \nwhen the economies are so poor in this area that families cannot feed \ntheir children. It is easy to understand when the drug gangs are so \npowerful that these children are being threatened, exploited, raped, \nand killed. It is only then that in desperation some member of the \nfamily says: There is only one chance. We send you to the United \nStates--putting these children in the hands of coyotes and smugglers \nwho take them on a journey that doesn't last hours but days and is \n2,000 miles. Imagine. Imagine a mother taking her child to the freight \ntrain--this 12-year-old boy--watching him climb up the ladder on the \nside and hang on. She says: You will be there in 4 days.\n  Can you imagine that. Can you imagine the family in Honduras, who \nbefore they send their young girl on this journey with the coyote, \ngiving her birth control pills in anticipation that she will likely be \nsexually assaulted during the course of that journey? How desperate \nmust that family be? That is the reality of this human child refugee \ncrisis that we face.\n  The President has said we need to do several things. First, we need \nto tell these countries: Don't send these children. It is too \ndangerous, and when they have arrived, they have no special legal \nrights to be citizens or to stay. We need to get that message through \nloudly and clearly: Do not send your children. The countries involved--\nHonduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala--are joining us now in getting \nthat message out.\n  Secondly, we need to start apprehending and prosecuting these \ncoyotes, these smugglers. They extort from these families 1 year of \nwages to try to bring children into this country.\n  Some of these children are teenagers--most of them are--but many of \nthem are babies and infants.\n  Five women walked into the dining room at the shelter carrying \nnewborn babies. All of these women are from Honduras and all are \nvictims of rape. They had gone on these buses for 8 days to bring these \nnewborn infants to a safer place so that they might survive.\n  I am heartened by the fact that religious groups all around the \nUnited States have rallied behind these children. I am proud the \nCatholic Church--which I associate with; occasionally they associate \nwith me--I am proud the Catholic Church and the bishops have spoken. \nEvangelicals are one of the first groups to come forward and say: We \nhave to do something for these children.\n  Even some of the most conservative political commentators have said: \nFirst, America, show your heart that you care for these children.\n\n  That is what the President is asking us to do.\n  So let us take care, when we consider the supplemental appropriations \nbill, that we don't lose sight of our values. To those who politically \ndisagree and sometimes even despise the President, I urge them not to \ntry to show how tough they are with this President at the expense of \nthese small children. Let's show how big we are as a nation first. The \npolitical debate can be saved for another day.\n  I support this legislation. I think it is the right thing to do.\n  I want history to write this chapter about America, and I want it to \nbe a chapter of which we are proud. I want a future generation to look \nback to this year and say that in this year, when the United States was \npresented with this border crisis with children, America showed its \nheart; America stood and did what was right for these children, as we \nhave so many times in the past.\n\n\n                               Iron Dome\n\n  There are other parts of this bill. One of them is a section I have \nworked on in my capacity as chairman of the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee. This is called Iron Dome, and it is much different than a \ndebate about children or refugees.\n  Over the past 3 weeks, more than 2,000 rockets have been fired from \nGaza into Israel. According to press reports, civilian casualties have \nbeen limited--maybe even only 2 out of 2,000 rockets. There are two \nreasons for the low number of injuries from this barrage.\n  First, many of these rockets land in uninhabited areas. Second, these \nrockets are headed for cities and towns, but these rockets are stopped \nand destroyed before they strike their targets. The reason? The Iron \nDome missile defense system, a joint effort by the United States and \nIsrael to protect against just an attack. The United States and Israel \nhave deep ties on this program. Of the 10 Iron Dome batteries that have \nbeen fielded, the United States provided funding for 8 of them. I am \npleased we have because this system has saved innocent lives.\n  Our country has been asked for additional assistance to ensure that \nthe Israeli stockpile of Iron Dome interceptors is adequate to the \nchallenge. We don't know when this crisis will end. Secretary of \nDefense Chuck Hagel endorsed an additional $225 million in funding for \nIron Dome in a recent letter.\n  The requested funds are in addition to next year's appropriations. It \nmay be some time before the appropriations bills are enacted, and that \nis why the President has asked to include in this supplemental \nappropriation $225 million to speed up the production of Iron Dome \nmissiles.\n  The Senate simply has too little time. There is next week, and then \nwe are gone for 5 or 6 weeks, return for perhaps 2, and then we are \ngone until November. So we have to act and act now.\n  This supplemental appropriations bill with the Iron Dome money needs \nto pass. I am going to be supporting it. This is an emergency which is \nfront and center.\n  The Ambassador from Israel to the United States came to see me last \nweek. He said at one time two-thirds of the population of Israel was in \nbomb shelters during these attacks. It is a serious threat to them.\n  Let me add too that all of us are praying this violence and war \nbetween Gaza and Israel will come to an end soon, that they will \ninstitute a cease-fire, sit at a table and resolve their differences.\n  But we cannot expect any country--not Israel, not the United States--\nany country--to sit and take 2,000 incoming rockets and not respond. \nThis saves lives--the Iron Dome.\n  But now we need to take the next step, bringing peace to this region \nso\n\n[[Page S4881]]\n\nthat innocent people on both sides of the border are going to be \nspared.\n  Hamas, a group which we have characterized as terrorist since the \nlate 1990s, is leading this attack on Israel. This terrorist group is \npolitically popular in some parts of Gaza. How do they protect their \nrocket launchers? They place them in homes, they put them in crowded \nareas, and they build tunnels under Gaza streets for their weapons and \nto escape when they are attacked.\n  The latest report is they were building these tunnels under \nhospitals, knowing that Israel and other countries would spare these \nhospitals. Meanwhile, the hospitals are covering tunnels, which is just \nthe source of much more violence in the area.\n\n\n                          Child Refugee Crisis\n\n  I wish to close on the issue about the child refugees. I see Senator \nPortman of Ohio is on the floor. I will close and yield in a moment for \nhim.\n  One of the questions I asked of the Ambassadors from Honduras, El \nSalvador, and Guatemala was this: We believe the children who come into \nthe United States once given a chance to state why they are here--we \nbelieve that half of them or maybe more will be returned to their \ncountries.\n  I asked the Ambassadors from these countries: Can we have confidence \nthat if these children, who have come to our border, are returned back \nto their countries, they will be safe. A simple question, Will they be \nsafe. Do you have people, charities, agencies of government to \nguarantee that when they return, when they get off the plane or the \nbus, they will be safe?\n\n  The Ambassador from Guatemala said: Yes, we do. The Ambassador from \nHonduras said: No, we don't. The Ambassador from El Salvador said: \nNeither do we.\n  Let us think about this for a moment. Let us reflect on this for a \nmoment. Let us make sure we do everything in our power to hand these \nchildren over to a safe situation.\n  Let us work with these countries to stop the flow into this country, \nbut to make certain that when they return, they are returned to a safe \nsetting.\n  Can you believe that in Chicago a brother and a sister--a 6 year-old \nand a 3-year-old brother and sister--came to one of these shelters? I \ncould see from the bruises on their bodies they had been through \nsomething on their way here. It took 2 months before these children--\nthe 6-year-old--finally talked about what she can remember from this \nhorrendous journey. I won't recount the details, but it is \nheartbreaking to think that a child of 6 years would have endured this \nexperience.\n  Let's do right by these children. Let's make sure at the end of the \nday America has proven again we are a caring nation and that for those \nchildren who come to our shores, come to our borders, we will treat \nthem humanely and compassionately, as we would want our own children to \nbe treated if they were ever in such a desperate circumstance.\n  Let's set the politics aside. Let's put these children front and \ncenter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                          Bring Jobs Home Act\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, earlier today the Senate voted to \nproceed to debate on legislation called the Bring Jobs Home Act. It is \nabout tax reform. It is about the tax system in this country.\n  I am glad we are having the debate. I voted to proceed to the debate. \nI think it is important we talk about it.\n  I had a reporter come to me earlier today who said: I hear that \nDemocrats are going to talk about inversions. That means when a company \nof the United States goes overseas and buys a company--usually smaller \nthan they are--and then inverts, they become a foreign corporation.\n  They said: Are you concerned about that?\n  I said: No. I think that is great. I think we need to talk about it. \nI think it is a hidden problem that no one is talking about, and I \nthink it is terrific that we are talking about it.\n  So I hope what will happen over the next week on the floor of the \nSenate is we will have an honest conversation about what is happening \nin our great country, where we have more and more American companies \nsaying, because of the Tax Code they are saddled with, they cannot \ncompete around the globe.\n  So what do they do? Having a responsibility to their shareholders, \nthey go and find either a foreign company to become part of and become \nforeign--or they make themselves a foreign company by being acquired by \na foreign company. Some of them are simply not growing because they \ncan't compete with other companies from other countries that are buying \nsome of their assets.\n  A company recently came to me from Ohio, my home State, and said: We \ndo work in Korea. We were in South Korea. We wanted to buy this \nsubsidiary there so we could expand what we are doing in Korea and push \nmore of our product there, more of our exports there. We finished the \nnegotiation with the Korean company, and a company from Germany stepped \nup and said: Do you know what. Whatever you guys have negotiated, we \nwill take it, but we will pay 18 percent more.\n  The reason the German company could pay 18 percent more is their \nafter-tax profits were higher, because the German tax code treats the \nGerman company better than the American Tax Code treats the American \ncompany. That is the reality, and it is happening.\n  Over the last 5 years, they say there have been 35 American companies \nthat have gone overseas through these inversions, but there are also a \nlot of American companies that have become foreign entities.\n  I am a beer drinker, and it is hard to find an American company that \ncan sell you a beer these days. Why? Because they are almost all \nforeign companies. The two largest American beer companies each have \nabout a 1.4-percent market share--Sam Adams and Yuengling. Great beers, \nby the way. But this is sad to me.\n  It doesn't mean these companies have all left the United States. A \nlot of them still have production here, breweries here, and so on. But \nby headquartering somewhere else for tax purposes we lose something as \nAmericans. We lose executive jobs over time, but we lose this \nintangible thing--which is, companies that are willing to invest in our \ncommunities--in hometowns, like in my hometown, probably everything we \nare involved with on the charitable side, some local company has been \ninvolved with and helped with. A lot of them tend to be international \ncompanies that do a lot to help make our cities a better place to live \nand to work. But they do it partly because it is where their \nheadquarters is. This is where their towns are. If they are not here--\nif they are in Dublin, Ireland, or if they are in London, England, or \nif they are in Beijing or in Rio, Brazil, or somewhere else, they are \nnot going to be making those investments. So this is a big deal.\n  It is also a big deal because it is not just about the inversion. I \nsee that as kind of the tip of the iceberg. It is also about all these \ncompanies that are losing right now in foreign competition because, \nagain, they can't compete. They have to pay more in terms of taxes than \ntheir foreign competitors. So their foreign competitors can afford to \nbroaden their market share, get more customers, can afford to buy a \ncompany when one comes up for acquisition.\n  I had a fellow come up recently from the Boston area. Boston does a \nlot of biopharmaceutical research, as the Presiding Officer knows. It \nis very exciting what is going on there, and throughout our country. We \nare still doing top-notch research. They showed me the list of \ncompanies that have been purchased in the last 4 or 5 years. \nUnfortunately, the majority of those companies were purchased by a \nforeign company. It wasn't by a U.S. company coming in and \nconsolidating. It was by a company under different tax laws--a Swiss \ncompany, a French company, a German company, or a Japanese company--\nthat had bought an American company, the majority of them--by far the \nmajority. This is happening all over the country, and it is happening \nunder our noses.\n  We are sitting here in Washington, allowing this to happen because we \nare abdicating our responsibility to reform the Tax Code so that it is \ncompetitive.\n  By the way, we are the only country that is not waking up to this. \nEvery single one of the other developed countries in the world--the \ncountries that are members of what is called the\n\n[[Page S4882]]\n\nOECD, which is all the developed countries--every single one of them is \nreforming their tax code, except us.\n  In the 1980s, we established the rate we have now, which is 35 now--\nthen it was 34 percent. When we add the State tax rates for the \ncompanies, it is about 39 percent on average in America. We are the \nhighest rate in the world.\n  So at the time we set our rate in the mid-thirties, that was just \nbelow the average. It was done deliberately, and it was done as part of \nthe 1986 tax reform. We said: Let's set the business rate at something \nbelow the average so we can be competitive.\n  But since that time, we have become the highest rate, and every \nsingle one of our developed country competitors--all of them--have \nreformed their tax code and lowered their rate.\n  But they haven't just lowered their rate to make us No. 1 in the \nworld--which is not a No. 1 you want to be if you want to compete and \ndevelop jobs--they have also reformed their tax code to make it more \ncompetitive internationally. We haven't done that. We have been \nbystanders in this effort to attract jobs and investment opportunities.\n  We still have what is called the worldwide system, where we don't tax \nincome where it is earned. That has created a real problem.\n  So I am glad we are having this debate on the floor. I am glad there \nis an opportunity to talk about this. I must say that, unfortunately, \nthe bill before us, the Bring Jobs Home Act, is not going to help \nbecause it doesn't get at this underlying problem we have been talking \nabout today. It does nothing about lowering the rate. It does nothing \nabout changing the international system of taxation. It tinkers around \nthe edges with one issue, and that is to remove deductions and tax \ncredits that, according to the authors of the bill, incentivizes \ncompanies to move overseas.\n  There is a group here in Washington called the Joint Committee on \nTaxation. They are nonpartisan, and they tell us in Congress what tax \npolicy means, how much it costs, and what the effects are going to be. \nHere is what they say:\n\n       Under present law, there are no targeted tax credits or \n     disallowances of deductions related to relocating business \n     units inside or outside the United States.\n\n  So why are we having this debate? Why aren't we debating the core \nissue--the real problem? I guess because this is the better political \ndebate and it is easier to do. But it is not going to help. It would be \nnice if there were these targeted tax credits that some of the authors \nclaim, because then we could get rid of those and that might help some. \nBut, as the Joint Committee on Taxation has said, that doesn't exist.\n  Let's take a look at the numbers.\n  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the very small tweaks \nthis legislation will make to the Tax Code by disallowing some of these \ndeductions will amount to around $143 million over 10 years. So they \nsay $143 million over 10 years, because even though there is no \ntargeted allowance or targeted tax credits, they think this legislation \nwill have some effect on the way the IRS will interpret it. By the way, \nit is left up to the IRS to interpret it, and it is a subjective \ndecision by the IRS since it is not targeted.\n  But let's say that $143 million over 10 years is the right number. \nThat is what the Joint Committee says. So $143 million over 10 years. \nLet me give one example.\n  There is a company in Ohio that is about a Fortune 200 or Fortune 300 \ncompany. So it is a big company--not the biggest company, but it is a \nbig company in Ohio. They decided a year or so ago to do an inversion. \nThey bought a company that was one-quarter their size overseas and they \nbecame a foreign company. Based on the public filings, we know this \nyear that company will save $160 million on its taxes because it chose \nto become a foreign company. That is wrong. Our tax system should be \nfair, it should be competitive. It shouldn't be driving these companies \nto do this on behalf of their shareholders and under their fiduciary \nresponsibility.\n  That is $160 million a year versus this bill that, even if it works \nas the folks are talking about, is intended to be a $143 million impact \nover 10 years. See what I mean about this not being a serious proposal? \nLet's get at the core problem.\n  The other problem is, if we continue to make it harder to be a U.S. \ncompany--whether it is to take away a tax credit, whether it is to take \naway a deduction, whether it is to do something else, to try to block \ninversion, what will happen? What happens every time we try to put up a \nwall to stop something but don't deal with the underlying problem? \nThese companies will continue to look overseas, and they will be \ntargets for acquisition.\n  We talked about the fact that there are no American beer companies \nanymore, except ones that have less than 2 percent market share. These \ncompanies didn't invert. They were bought by foreign companies. That is \nhappening right and left in America, and that is what would happen even \nmore if we make it even more disadvantageous to be an American company \nbecause we are trying to block this.\n  We have to get at the core issue. We can't have the highest tax in \nthe world, and we can't have an international system that is not \ncompetitive and hope to have these companies stay American companies. \nSo let's deal with the underlying problem.\n  Thirty-five companies over the past 5 years have chosen to invert, \nbut so many others have done other things to try to be competitive, \nincluding to sell to foreign companies, or not to grow, not to be able \nto compete with acquisitions, because their after-tax profits are not \nas high as their foreign competitors.\n  It is not going to be easy to do tax reform. I understand that. It is \nnever easy. That is not what we were hired to do, the easy things. We \nare on the floor right now debating this proposal called the Bring the \nJobs Home Act, which I think is a misnomer, unfortunately. I guess that \nwould be easy. It wouldn't help, but it would seem easy.\n  Tax reform is going to be hard, because we do have to lower the rate \nand broaden the base and get rid of some of these deductions and \ncredits and exemptions and so on that are out there. The Tax Code is \nnow riddled with them. Everybody likes their special provisions. But it \nis an effort well worth undertaking, because it is about our economy, \nit is about our future, it is about our kids having jobs here. It is \nabout keeping American companies here. We simply have to do it.\n  By the way, Congress has done this before. We did it back in 1986. It \nwas led by a Republican, Ronald Reagan, and a Democrat here in the \nSenate, Bill Bradley; and in the House, Dan Rostenkowski, Tip O'Neill. \nThis was a bipartisan effort. It should be again. There is no reason it \nshouldn't be bipartisan.\n\n  The President has talked about it as a big problem right now in our \neconomy, that our Tax Code is so inefficient, antiquated, needs to be \nupdated. He has talked about lowering the rate, broadening the base. I \nagree with him, let's do it. Unfortunately, we haven't seen a proposal \nfrom the administration.\n  We had a hearing on this recently and I asked the administration: \nWhere is the proposal?\n  They said: Well, we are interested in working with you.\n  Great. I am, too. All of us are.\n  Some Republicans, including Dave Camp, have put out very specific \nproposals in the House Ways and Means Committee.\n  We have to move forward on this. And we have done this before. We can \ndo hard things. It is our job to do hard things. We did welfare reform \na year before an election--actually, months before election day, with \nPresident Clinton, working with Republicans, including Newt Gingrich.\n  This seems to be the kind of thing that is harder and harder to do \naround here, and yet there is more and more urgency to do it.\n  People call it corporate tax reform or business tax reform and think: \nIt must be about the boardroom and about the executives. It is not. \nThey will be fine either way. We don't need to worry about them. We \nneed to worry about the workers. CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, \nwhich is the group that analyzes legislation, has looked at this and \nsaid: Do you know who is hurt more by these high corporate taxes we \nhave? It is the workers, of course. More than 70 percent of the burden, \nthey said, is borne by the workers in the\n\n[[Page S4883]]\n\nform of lower pay, lower benefits, and fewer job opportunities.\n\n  So we need to do this not because we are looking to help the \nboardroom but because we are looking to help the American worker at a \ntime when it is already tough.\n  Over the last 5 years, they say, average take-home pay has gone down \nabout $3,500 for a typical family. So pay is not going up, it has gone \ndown. Health care costs have gone up. In fact, they are skyrocketing.\n  I talked to some folks in Ohio last weekend who asked: Why aren't you \ndoing more to get health care costs down?\n  I said: Well, I didn't support the ObamaCare proposal. It was \npromised that the costs would go down, and they are now going up. That \nis why we need real health care reform.\n  This is a middle-class squeeze. Health care costs are up, and wages \nare down, now stagnant. This is an opportunity, not through a sideshow \nlike we are going to see on the floor here talking about how to do \nthese tweaks that aren't going to make any difference, but to really \nget at the problem is the way to get payback. That is what the \nCongressional Budget Office tells us.\n  Our Tax Code should draw companies to our shores, should bring \ninvestment here and bring jobs here instead of pushing companies away. \nAll we are looking for is a level playing field. If Americans have a \nlevel playing field here, we will be able to be competitive, and we \nwill be able to bring back jobs. We have the greatest innovators in the \nworld, we have the greatest resources, and we have incredible \ninfrastructure in this country. We have a lot of advantages. Our energy \nadvantage now, thanks to what we are doing now on private lands--we \nshould do more on public lands, but what we are doing on private lands \nis really giving us an advantage in terms of a stable supply of \nrelatively low-cost natural gas, particularly for manufacturing. We see \nthis in Ohio. It is a great opportunity, but to take advantage of that \nopportunity, we have to reform and improve these basic institutions of \nour economy, including the Tax Code.\n  By the way, it is not just the Tax Code, it is about regulatory \nrelief to ensure that American companies are not being saddled, as they \nare now, with higher and higher costs and more and more regulations \nthat make it harder for them to compete, make it harder for them to \ncreate jobs.\n  It is also about being assured that we have a trade policy that \nactually works to expand exports. That is a huge issue in my home State \nof Ohio. We do a lot of exporting. We could do a whole lot more. \nTwenty-five percent of our factory jobs are now export trade jobs. One \nin every three acres planted in Ohio is now exported. We want to do \nmore. That gets the prices up for farmers. That is adding more jobs and \ncreating more opportunity for good-paying jobs. These great jobs tend \nto pay more and have better benefits. We are sitting on the sidelines \nthere too.\n  Congress could move quickly to provide this President with the \nnegotiating authority every President since Franklin Delano Roosevelt \nhas had. Since FDR, every President has also asked for it. This \nPresident has now asked for it. You heard him in his State of the Union \nearlier this year. He hadn't asked for it earlier in his term, but now \nhe has asked for it. Let's provide it to him. Let's give him the \nability to knock down the barriers of trade for our workers, our \nservice providers, and our farmers to get this economy moving, along \nwith tax reform and regulatory reform. These are things that would \nactually make it better for the American people.\n  On the regulatory side, I am offering amendments in the context of \nthis legislation, and they are bipartisan amendments. One has to do \nwith ensuring that we do allow companies to permit something more \nquickly. Right now it can take years to permit a project in the United \nStates of America. We have a bipartisan bill. Senator McCaskill and I \nare the two lead sponsors, but we have other Democrats and Republicans \nonboard saying this is just common sense. Let's make one agency \naccountable. Let's be sure there is a way for everybody to \ntransparently look at a windshield and see what the status of the \nproject is and move it forward. Let's reduce some of the legal \nliability in some of these projects.\n\n  What people tell me--whether it is the solar companies I talked to \nyesterday or whether it is some of the oil and gas producers or whether \nit is some of the wind companies or whether it is the hydro people who \nbrought this to my attention initially a few years ago--they cannot get \nforeign investors because it takes so long to permit something in \nAmerica.\n  We used to be at the top of the heap, by the way, and now in the \nannual ease-of-doing-business surveys that are done, America has fallen \nbehind. America is now something like 34th in the world in terms of the \nease of doing business on permitting because more and more regulations \nhave been added. For an energy project, there are sometimes up to 34 \nFederal regulations. Usually it is one after the other because there is \nno coordination and accountability.\n  That is what this bill does. It is very simple. It is common sense. \nIt already passed the House. It is the kind of bill that, if passed, \nwould create jobs and good construction jobs, which is why the building \ntrades support it.\n  By the way, the labor unions, building trades, and others who support \nthis kind of legislation do so because they figured out that America \ncannot be competitive unless we have these basic institutions of our \neconomy--whether it is regulatory reform or whether it is a smarter \nenergy policy or whether it is the ability to have a tax code that \nworks, they want to be sure we are expanding opportunities for their \nmembers. So I appreciate the building trades stepping forward.\n  The other one is simply to make sure regulations are accountable, \nmake sure there is a cost-benefit analysis, make sure we use the least \nburdensome alternative in Washington, DC, to get to a policy that is \npassed by the Congress--commonsense stuff. Again, that has passed the \nHouse, too, with bipartisan support.\n  I am offering these because I do think it is important for us to have \nthis debate on tax reform, and I look forward to further debate on \nMonday and Tuesday of next week. I think this is a great opportunity \nfor us to talk about the real problems.\n  I am not going to support this solution because I don't think it will \nhelp, but I welcome the debate, and I am glad we have proceeded to this \ndebate. I am glad my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are \nraising this issue.\n  To the reporter who asked the question I got today--Are you concerned \nthat Democrats are talking about inversions?--no, I am really happy \nthey are talking about it. We should all be talking about it--\nRepublicans, Democrats, Independents alike. As Americans, we should be \nfocused on this issue and the broader issue that by our companies not \nbeing competitive, we are hurting American workers. If we don't turn \nthis around--not by show votes, not by something that looks good \npolitically but doesn't make any difference, but by actually getting at \nthe root of the problem--the highest rate in the developed world, an \ninternational system that doesn't let us be competitive globally \nbecause people cannot move around their assets to find the best, most \nefficient use for them--those two issues, if addressed, will unlock all \nkinds of opportunities. That is the potential we have. There is a \nbetter day ahead, right around the corner, if we do some of these basic \nthings.\n  I was also asked today at a press conference we do every week with \nOhio reporters: How would you grade this Congress? Are they doing the \nthings they ought to be doing?\n  I have to tell you there are small things that have been done, but, \nno, Congress is not doing the work of the people. And the work of the \npeople at its core means that the laws, the Federal laws that this \nplace alone--the House and the Senate and the President--have control \nover, those laws need to help the American people to be successful. It \nneeds to be an environment for success, an environment for people to be \nable to say: Hey, my kids and grandkids could have it better than I \nhave it because we see America on the upswing.\n  That is not what we see today--the weakest economic recovery since \nthe Great Depression. I talked about wages going down, not up. I talked \nabout the higher cost of health care. I talked about the fact that we \nhave now in this\n\n[[Page S4884]]\n\ncountry a lot of people who are discouraged about the future.\n  CNN did a poll recently, and normally when people are asked in a poll \nwhether they think their kids or grandkids are better off, they say: \nYes. That is the American dream. The next generation will be better \noff.\n  That is what my grandparents believed, and that is what my parents \nbelieved. That is not what today's generation believes. Sixty-three \npercent of the people said: No, I don't believe that is going to \nhappen.\n  What is even more troubling is that 63 percent of young people do not \nbelieve that. They don't believe their lives are better off than their \nparents'. We can change that.\n  I hope we get a vote on these amendments I talked about. I hope we \nwill have a good discussion and debate on these issues. We owe it to \nthe people we represent to solve these big problems.\n  I thank you for the time, Madam President, and I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Moment of Silence\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nobserve a moment of silence in remembering Officer Jacob J. Chestnut \nand Detective John N. Gibson of the United States Capitol Police.\n  (Moment of silence.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I ask to be recognized as if in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n\n\n                         Israeli-Gaza Conflict\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I come to the floor today to discuss the ongoing situation in Israel. \nWe all watch with great concern the images of the loss of life, young \nchildren, innocents who have lost their lives over the last few days, \nand also the men and women who served in the defense forces of Israel \nwho have lost their lives in this operation. Our hearts also go out to \nthe men and women who live in the nation of Israel who are living under \nthe constant threat of rockets that are coming over from Gaza.\n  I came to the Senate floor a week ago to express not simply my \nconcerns with this but also my solidarity--and I believe that of almost \neveryone in this body--with our ally Israel, and I received a response, \na pretty heated letter from the Palestinian Ambassador in Washington, \nDC. He expressed outrage that I and my colleagues had not expressed the \nsame level of concern for Palestinians as we had for the Israelis. He \nparticularly pointed to the case of the three murdered Israelis but \nsaid we had not expressed similar feelings for the young Palestinian \nwho lost his life.\n  I responded to his letter by pointing out a number of things. The \nfirst is that I believe that I and all my colleagues wish and pray and \nwill do all we can to further the ideal that the Palestinian people \ncould live peacefully side-by-side with their Israeli neighbors. It is \na sentiment I expressed when I visited the Palestinian officials in the \nWest Bank a year and a half ago.\n  But I also expressed that there was a significant difference between \nthe way Israel and the Palestinians reacted to these two horrible \nincidents. The Palestinian Authority had to be basically nudged into \nexpressing any sentiment about the three young people who were missing \nat the time. In fact, when the bodies were discovered, it led to street \ndemonstrations. It led to celebrations on the streets of the West Bank \nand Gaza.\n  In Israel, the discovery of the death of the young Palestinian led to \nstrong statements by the Prime Minister and condemnation. It led to a \nphone call from the Prime Minister to the family of the Palestinian. It \nled to visits by Israelis to the family of the Palestinian. It led to \nreal outrage. There was a difference there, although both are horrible \ntragedies.\n  But I think there is something now emerging that is not being talked \nabout. We have all seen the images of people being killed, civilians \nwho are losing their lives in Gaza, and some are beginning to say that \nthis is all Israel's fault, that this is Israel's fault. In fact, \nearlier today--or maybe it was last night--the Prime Minister of Turkey \nsaid that what the Israelis are doing in Gaza is worse than what Adolf \nHitler did to the Jews. It is, of course, a ridiculous statement, but \nit gives an indication of where this is headed.\n  There is a story here that is not being told and that the Palestinian \nAmbassador himself has ignored, as I point to in my response to him. \nThe first thing he ignores is that we have never in the modern history \nof the world seen any organization use human shields like Hamas is \nusing human shields today. In fact, the reality behind it is \nunbelievable.\n  I would like to read from some press accounts with regards to this.\n  Washington Post correspondent William Booth, reporting from Gaza, \nwrote in an article on the 15th of July:\n\n       At the Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, crowds gathered to \n     throw shoes and eggs at the Palestinian Authority's health \n     minister, who represents the crumbling ``unity government'' \n     in the West Bank city of Ramallah. The minister was turned \n     away before he reached the hospital, which has become a de \n     facto headquarters for Hamas leaders, who can be seen in the \n     hallways and offices.\n\n  Another report by the Washington Post on July 17 recounts:\n\n       During the lull--\n\n  I imagine in the action--\n\n     a group of men at a mosque in northern Gaza said they had \n     returned to clean up the green glass from windows shattered \n     in the previous day's bombardment. But they could be seen \n     moving small rockets into the mosque.\n  The Japanese Mainichi Daily's correspondent in Gaza reported on July \n21:\n\n       Hamas criticizes that ``Israel massacres civilians.'' On \n     the other hand, it tries to use evacuating civilians and \n     journalists by stopping them and turning them into ``human \n     shields,'' counteracting thoroughly with its guerilla tactics \n     . . .\n\n  It doesn't end there. A Globe and Mail correspondent in Gaza, Patrick \nMartin, wrote on July 20:\n\n       The presence of militant fighters in the Shejaia became \n     clear Sunday afternoon when, under the cover of a \n     humanitarian truce intended to allow both sides to remove the \n     dead and wounded, several armed Palestinians scurried from \n     the scene.\n       Some bore their weapons openly, slung over their shoulder, \n     but at least two, disguised as women, were seen walking off \n     with weapons partly concealed under their robes. Another had \n     his weapon wrapped in a baby blanket and held on his chest as \n     if it were an infant.\n\n  If you think that is bad, it gets worse. I obviously cannot play a \nvideo on the floor of the Senate, so instead I will read a statement \nfrom Hamas spokesperson Sami Abu Zuhri. This is a quote on television \nin Gaza:\n\n       The people oppose the Israeli fighter planes with their \n     bodies alone . . . I think this method has proven effective \n     against the occupation. It also reflects the nature of our \n     heroic and brave people, and we, the [Hamas] movement, call \n     on our people to adopt this method in order to protect the \n     Palestinian homes.\n\n  The response to this is, Israel drops fliers and sends text messages \nand makes phone calls telling people--civilians--we are going to \nundertake a military operation, you should leave the area. What does \nHamas do? I will tell you what they do.\n  This is from the Facebook page of their Interior Ministry \nspokesperson:\n\n       An important and urgent message: The [Hamas] Ministry of \n     the Interior and National Security calls on our honorable \n     people in all parts of the [Gaza] Strip to ignore the \n     warnings [to vacate areas near rocket launching sites before \n     Israel bombs them] that are being disseminated by the Israeli \n     occupation through manifestos and phone messages, as these \n     are part of a psychological war meant to sow confusion on the \n     [Palestinian] home front, in light of the [Israeli] enemy's \n     security failure and its confusion and bewilderment.\n\n  This next statement was on television on July 14:\n\n       We call on our Palestinian people, particularly the \n     residents of northwest Gaza, not to obey what is written in \n     the pamphlets distributed by the Israeli occupation army. We \n     call on them to remain in their homes and disregard the \n     demands to leave, however serious the threat may be.\n\n\n[[Page S4885]]\n\n\n  This is evidence that Hamas is using its own people as human shields.\n  It doesn't stop there, Mr. Ambassador. Ask yourself: Why did your \norganization--why did your government--unify with this terrorist \norganization that uses its own people as a human shield? You didn't \nmention that in your letter. You didn't mention in your letter that you \naligned yourself with an organization that calls for the destruction of \nthe Jewish state. You left that out of your letter as well, Mr. \nAmbassador.\n  What has been the international reaction to this? Well, I already \ntold you about what came out of Turkey. Just yesterday the so-called \nUnited Nations Human Rights Council--and I say so-called because it has \nsuch distinguished human rights beacons as Cuba and China on its \nmembership--voted unanimously, except for the United States, to condemn \nIsrael and to call for an investigation into war crimes against Israel. \nThere is a 700-page document that briefly mentions rockets and does not \nmention Hamas or human shields whatsoever. Meanwhile, this crisis \ncontinues.\n  What do we see coming out of Hamas? Have they stopped what they are \ndoing beyond the human shields? No. What we discovered--and what has \nbeen discovered now--is an intricate web of underground tunnels \ndesigned to bring killers into the Israeli territory. They attempted, \nby the way, to carry out a massacre at a kibbutz near the border with \nGaza. Luckily they were intercepted by Israeli defense forces. They \ndiscovered tranquilizers in their possession, the purpose of which, of \ncourse, was to use them to abduct and kidnap Israelis and take them \nback to Gaza for ransom or worse. The rockets continue to rain down as \nwell.\n  You also didn't mention in your letter, Mr. Ambassador, the cease-\nfire, which, by the way, Israel agreed to even though it was extremely \nunpopular in Israel. Why? Because three times in the last 5 years they \nhad to face this.\n  I want you to imagine for a moment that you lived in a country with a \nneighbor that blitzed you three times in the last 5 years with rockets, \ntrying to kill your children and destroy your cities and disrupt and \nparalyze your economy. There comes a point where you say enough is \nenough, we have to put an end to this. So you can just imagine how \nunpopular that cease-fire must have been among some elements of the \ncabinet and the unity government in Israel, and certainly among the \npopulation. Yet the Prime Minister went ahead with it because they \ndesire peace, and in just a few hours Hamas violated the cease-fire.\n  So please don't come to me and say that both sides are to blame here. \nThat is not true. This crisis would end tomorrow if Hamas would turn \nover its rockets and stop bombarding people. This would end tomorrow, \nby the way, if the Hamas commanders were not such cowards. I will tell \nyou why they are cowards. While they are on TV asking these people to \ngo to the rooftops of these buildings, you know where they are? They \nare hiding in their basement command center, which, by the way, is \nlocated in the basement underneath a hospital.\n  This would end tomorrow--the civilian deaths could end tomorrow--if \nthey stopped storing rockets in schools, including a U.N. school. By \nthe way, when the U.N. discovered these rockets, do you know what they \ndid with them? They turned them back over to Hamas. Don't tell me both \nsides are to blame here because it is not true. It is not true. This is \nthe result of one thing and one thing alone: Hamas has decided to \nlaunch rockets against Israel, Hamas has decided to build this \nextensive network of underground tunnels so that in a moment of \nconflict they can get these commandos into Israel and kill Israelis.\n\n  What is Israel doing? What any country would do. Of course this is \nnot an excellent example, but imagine for a moment if one of our \nneighboring countries decided to start hitting us with rockets. What \nwould the United States do? Would we sit there and say: We really have \nto be restrained and hold back here? We would not tolerate that. \nImagine that every night and every morning sirens were going off in \nyour city because rockets were on their way in and you spent the better \npart of the day running in and out of shelters and taking cover. What \nwould you say? You would say: Take care of this problem once and for \nall.\n  Why would we ever ask Israel to do anything less than we would do if \nwe were in the same situation? And that is what they are doing.\n  In the process of taking care of the situation, tragically, civilians \nare dying, and do you know why? Because Hamas is deliberately putting \nthem in the way. I just read the quotes. Hamas is asking their people \nto do what their leaders won't do. They are asking their own people to \nget in harm's way and act as human shields because they want these \nimages to be spread around the world. They are willing to sacrifice \ntheir own people to win a PR war.\n  I think it is absolutely outrageous that some in the press corps \ndomestically and most of the press corps internationally are falling \nfor this game. So please don't tell me that both sides are to blame \nhere, and please don't tell me this was caused by Israel.\n  In my time here in the Senate, I had the opportunity to visit \nmultiple countries. I have never met a people more desirous of peace \nthan the people in Israel. But peace cannot mean your destruction, and \nthat is what they are facing here--an enemy force that wants to destroy \nthem and wipe them out as a country. It is impossible to reach any sort \nof peace agreement with an organization like that. That is what Israel \nis facing here.\n  Mr. Ambassador, I ask that you go back to your government and ask \nthem to separate completely from Hamas, condemn what Hamas is doing to \nyour own people--condemn the use of human shields. That is what I ask \nyou to do. Stop writing letters to Senators and being angry at us when, \nby the way--although we should not be doing it because the law says no \nmoney should be going toward any organization linked with Hamas--the \nUnited States has been helping you to stand up your security forces in \nthe West Bank through our taxpayer money. Don't write letters to the \nU.S. Congress complaining to us about what Israel is doing when the \npeople you just created a unity government with are launching rockets \nagainst civilians in Israel and using its own people as human shields.\n  I think you need to take responsibility for your own people and your \nown part of the world. If you truly want peace, peace begins with \nlaying down your arms and stopping these attacks and condemning those \nwho are conducting these attacks and using innocent civilians as human \nshields. If you want peace, that is what you should spend your time \ndoing and not trying to rally public support around the world for the \nidea that Israel is responsible for war crimes.\n  From our perspective, I hope the United States continues to be firmly \non the side of Israel because there is no moral equivalency here. What \nis happening between Israel and Hamas is totally 100 percent the fault \nof Hamas. There is no moral equivalency here. All of the blame lies on \nHamas.\n  For this crisis to end, Hamas must either be eliminated as an \norganization or they must lay down their weapons and adhere to the true \nprecepts of peace, which is the desire to live peacefully side by side \nwith our neighbors in Israel.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                            Border Security\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we are dealing with a very disturbing \ncrisis on our borders. The situation that has developed is \nunbelievable. It is unbelievable how rapidly it has developed, but it \nhas, indeed, been building up for more than a year. It is a direct and \npredictable result of the President's policies and not enforcing the \nlaws of the United States when it comes to immigration. It is a very \nsad day, and it can only end when the President stops suspending laws \nand starts enforcing laws.\n  The President is the chief law enforcement officer in America. Every \nBorder Patrol officer, every ICE officer, every Coast Guard officer, \nevery military officer, every Department of Justice employee, and FBI \nemployee works for him. He supervises them and directs them. He has \nbeen directing them not to enforce the law rather than to enforce the \nlaw. The evidence of that is undeniable.\n  The law enforcement officers--the ICE officers, Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement officers--sued their supervisor directly appointed \nby President\n\n[[Page S4886]]\n\nObama for blocking them from fulfilling their oath to enforce the laws \nof the United States of America. There is a Federal court case that is \nstill ongoing, and the judge found, at least at one point in his order, \nthat the President has no right to direct officers not to comply with \nthe law.\n  We now know that we are facing an exceedingly grave threat of an \nunbelievable expansion of his unilateral Executive orders of amnesty \nthat go beyond anything we have ever seen in this country and which \nthreatens the very constitutional framework of our Republic and the \nvery ability of this Nation to even have borders, it seems to me, and \ncertainly to create a lawful, equitable, consistent enforcement in our \ncountry.\n  The respected newspaper National Journal, which is here in \nWashington, a nonpartisan and respected organization, reported on July \n3--and a lot of people have missed this, and we need to know what this \nis saying. We need to know what it means, and we need, as Members of \nCongress and this Senate, to resist it. We cannot allow it to happen. \nWe will not allow it to happen. The American people, when they find out \nwhat is being discussed, will not allow it to happen, in my opinion. \nCongress needs to be directed by the people--I hate to say--to resist \nit. It says:\n\n       Obama made it clear he would press his executive powers to \n     the limit. He gave quiet credence to recommendations from La \n     Raza and other immigration groups that between 5 million to 6 \n     million adult illegal immigrants could be spared deportation \n     under a similar form of deferred adjudication he ordered for \n     the so-called Dreamers in June 2012.\n\n  The DREAMers being the young people. Five to 6 million would be given \nlegal status in the United States of America when they have entered \ncontrary to law or are in the country contrary to law and are not \nentitled to work in America.\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       Obama has now ordered the Homeland Security and Justice \n     departments to find executive authorities that could enlarge \n     that non-prosecutorial umbrella by a factor of 10. Senior \n     officials also tell me Obama wants to see what he can do \n     with Executive power to provide temporary legal status to \n     undocumented adults.\n\n  What we know is with the children's group, they were provided with an \nID card that at the top of it, in big print, says, ``employee \nauthorization card.'' This is exactly what is being talked about here, \nwhat the President of the United States is saying.\n  Remember, the Congress has been asked by activist groups and certain \nbusiness interests to provide an amnesty for people who are here. The \nCongress has declined to do so. It has been fully and openly debated \nand has not passed into law. That is the decision of the Congress. That \nis the decision we have made--the duly elected body that passes laws. \nAs such, they not having been given amnesty, the President of the \nUnited States is not entitled to do so. By declaration of duly passed \nlaw, people aren't entitled to come to America unlawfully, to come to \nAmerica and stay unlawfully. They are not entitled to do that. How \nsimple is this? They are not entitled to be able to take jobs if they \ndo. They are not entitled to certain government benefits if they come \nillegally. Of course they are not. Of course they are not able to work \nand take jobs and get benefits if they came into the country illegally.\n  So when this first got talked about in more general terms, 22 Members \nof the Senate wrote President Obama and questioned what we are hearing. \nThe Senators wrote this:\n\n       These policies have operated as an effective repeal of duly \n     enacted federal immigration law and exceed the bounds of the \n     Executive Branch's prosecutorial discretion. It is not the \n     province of the Executive to nullify the laws that the people \n     of the United States, through their elected representatives, \n     have chosen to enact. To the contrary, it is the duty of the \n     Executive to take care that these laws are faithfully \n     executed. Congress has not passed laws permitting people to \n     illegally enter the country or to ignore their visa \n     expiration dates, so long as they do not have a felony \n     conviction or other severe offense on their record. Your \n     actions demonstrate an astonishing disregard for the \n     Constitution, the rule of law, and the rights of American \n     citizens and legal residents.\n       Our entire constitutional system--\n\n  The letter goes on to say--\n\n     is threatened when the Executive Branch suspends the law at \n     its whim and our nation's sovereignty is imperiled when the \n     commander-in-chief refuses to defend the integrity of its \n     borders.\n       You swore an oath--\n\n  The letter says to the President--\n\n     to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the \n     United States. We therefore ask you to uphold that oath and \n     to carry out the duties required by the Constitution and \n     entrusted to you by the American people.\n\n  The President is limited. He is not all-powerful. He is entrusted \nwith certain limited powers by the people of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Now we understand he intends to go even further. In the response we \ngot back, he never addressed it at all, except for his Secretary of \nHomeland Security, Mr. Jeh Johnson. He announced that, yes, he is \nindeed, at the order of the President of the United States, conducting \na review of how many other people he can provide this amnesty for and \nwork authorization for.\n  So last week one of our able colleagues, Senator Ted Cruz--a former \nsolicitor general for the attorney general's office in Texas who has \nargued cases in appellate courts in the country--identified this \nproblem and proposed I think a legislative fix that every Member of \nthis body should sign. Some may say, Well, the President, I don't think \nhe is going to do this. OK. Why not bar him from doing it? Some say, I \ndon't think we should sign it. Why not? He basically said he has \nalready done it with the younger group, and he said it is going to be a \ntenfold increase in the 5 million to 6 million people who are suggested \nto be legalized by the President's unilateral Executive order; \nrepresents about 10 times the number of people who have already been \ngiven lawful status, in effect, by the President's unlawful Executive \norder.\n  At this time perhaps it would be appropriate, and I would appreciate \nit, if the Senator from Texas would explain his analysis of this issue \nand how his legislation would be effective in ensuring that we don't go \ndown this illegal road any further.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I thank my friend, the junior Senator from \nAlabama, for his very kind comments and for his relentless leadership \nin defense of the rule of law and standing against amnesty.\n  What I wish to speak about this afternoon is the humanitarian crisis \nthat is playing out on our southern border right now and the abdication \nof responsibility that is playing out in Washington, DC.\n  A couple of weeks ago President Obama was in my home State of Texas. \nHe found time to go to two Democratic Party fundraisers, to pal around \nwith some Democratic Party fat cats, to collect a whole bunch of \nchecks. Yet somehow he didn't have time to make it down to our southern \nborder.\n  The day before he was in Colorado and he found time to play a game of \npool with the Governor there. I am glad he enjoyed himself playing \npool. Yet somehow he didn't have time to go visit Lackland Air Force \nBase and see the 1,200 children who are being held there who are paying \nthe price for the failure of the Obama immigration policy. In the \ncoming weeks he is headed to Martha's Vineyard. He is, I am sure, going \nto enjoy himself paling around with swells. Yet the people held in \ndetention facilities up and down the border are not going to see the \nCommander in Chief because he cannot be bothered to address the human \nsuffering.\n  He was just in California, in Hollywood, where the producer of \n``Scandal'' hosted him. That is kind of fitting because it is \nscandalous that the President has more time to be ``Fundraiser in \nChief'' than he does to do his basic job as Commander in Chief in \nsecuring our borders.\n  Let me tell my colleagues, while the President was running around \ncollecting checks from Democratic Party fat cats, I was back home in \nTexas. I was on the border this weekend down in McAllen. I sat down \nwith the chief of the Border Patrol in McAllen. I sat down with the \nline officers of the Border Patrol in McAllen. I visited the detention \nfacilities that are being constructed to hold these children. I saw a \nremarkable facility. It used to be a gigantic warehouse, and in 18 days \nthe Border Patrol had to stand up a facility to house 1,000 children \nbecause that is the volume coming through there every couple of days.\n\n[[Page S4887]]\n\n  The President is right in one regard. He has publicly stated we are \nseeing a humanitarian crisis, and that is correct, but it is a crisis \nof his own creation. This humanitarian crisis is the direct consequence \nof President Obama's lawlessness. I will note he cannot even be \nbothered to cast his eyes on the people who are suffering because of \nit.\n  If we want to know what is causing this crisis, a simple examination \nof the numbers will suffice. Just 3 years ago, in 2011, the number of \nunaccompanied children entering this country was roughly 6,000. Then, \nin June of 2012, just a few months before the election, President Obama \nunilaterally granted amnesty to some 800,000 people who were here \nillegally in this country who entered as children. He did so, \npresumably, because he thought there would be a political benefit. It \nwas a few months before an election and he thought there was good \npolitics in ignoring the law and granting amnesty. But the foreseeable \nconsequence of that amnesty--the predictable and the predicted \nconsequence of that amnesty--if we tell people across the globe that if \nthey enter as children, they get amnesty, suddenly we create an \nincredible incentive for more and more children to come and more and \nmore children to come alone.\n  This year, the Department of Homeland Security estimates that 90,000 \nunaccompanied children will enter this country illegally. Next year \nthey estimate 145,000. I want my colleagues to compare those numbers \nfor a second. Three years ago, it was 6,000. Now it is 90,000, and next \nyear we expect 145,000. The direct and proximate cause was President \nObama's amnesty.\n  There are some in this body who might not believe what a Member of \nthe opposite party says on this. There is a whole lot of partisanship \nin Washington. It truly has shut down the ability of this body to deal \nwith real challenges facing this country.\n  If people don't believe what a Member of the opposite party says, \nperhaps they will believe the Border Patrol. Just a few weeks ago the \nBorder Patrol conducted a confidential study that was given to members \nof the Senate Judiciary Committee by a whistleblower in the Border \nPatrol, where they interviewed over 200 people who had entered the \ncountry recently illegally, and they asked them the question: Why are \nyou coming? Ninety-five percent said we are coming because we believe \nwe will get amnesty; that if we just get here, we will be allowed to \nstay.\n  The administration has been giving lots of supposed causes for this \nhumanitarian crisis. One of their favorites is the violence in Central \nAmerica. It is true. Tragically, there is a great deal of violence in \nCentral America and it has been increasing, but I would note violence \nis not new to the human condition. There have always been countries \nacross the globe that are racked by violence, racked by civil war, and \nwe have always seen when violence rises, the immigration from a \nparticular country goes up. We see legal immigration from that country \ngo up and we see illegal immigration from that country go up. What we \nhaven't seen in the past is the explosion of children.\n  The violence in Central America is a reasonable cause to explain the \nincrease in immigrants from Central America, the increase in families \ncoming up to get away from the violence. What it doesn't explain is \nthis new phenomenon: 90,000 unaccompanied children. That is a new \nphenomenon. There is no reason violence would dictate saying, I am \ngoing to take my little boy, I am going to take my little girl, and \nsend them alone. That instead is a direct response to what President \nObama did by granting amnesty that was targeted to those who entered as \nkids. Why are kids entering? Because the President has said, if you \nenter as a kid, I will grant you amnesty.\n  Several weeks ago I visited Lackland Air Force Base where roughly \n1,200 of these children are being held. I visited with the senior \nofficials there. It is worth understanding that there are many victims \nof the President's refusal to enforce the law, but some of the most \ndirect victims are these little boys and little girls because the \ncoyotes who are bringing these children in are not well-meaning social \nworkers. They do not have beards and Birkenstocks, and they are not \nthere out of love. These coyotes are hardened, vicious transnational \ndrug cartels, and these children are being subjected to horrific \nphysical and sexual abuse.\n\n  When I was at Lackland Air Force Base, a senior official there \ndescribed to me how these coyotes get custody of these kids to smuggle \nthem illegally into this country, and then sometimes they will decide \nto hold the children for ransom, to get even more money from the \nfamilies. If the families cannot or will not pay, horribly, what these \ncoyotes are doing is severing body parts of these children and sending \nthem back to the families.\n  The senior official at Lackland described coyotes putting machine \nguns to the back of the head of a little boy or a little girl and \nordering them to cut off the fingers or the ears of another little boy \nor little girl. If the child refuses, they shoot that child and move on \nto the next one. They described how on our end we are seeing children \ncome into this country--some of whom have been horribly maimed by these \nviolent coyotes and drug cartels, others of whom have enormous \npsychological damage--from a little boy or a little girl forced to \ncommit such atrocities upon pain of death.\n  I asked the officials at Lackland: How many of these children have \nbeen victimized? The answer: All of them. That was from the senior \nofficial at Lackland. By the way, one of the things we hear reports of \nis these families with the girls, before they send them up, they give \nthem birth control because the expectations are that the risks of \nsexual assault and rape are so high. That risk is being undertaken \nbecause of the promise of amnesty.\n  When I was down in McAllen this weekend, I asked the line agents--I \nsaid: Listen. Every day you guys are on the river, you are in the \nhelicopter, you are securing the border. Why are they coming? What has \nchanged? Just 3 years ago it was 6,000 kids. Now it is 90,000. What has \nchanged? Every single one of the Border Patrol agents gave the exact \nsame answer. They said they are coming because they believe they will \nget amnesty.\n  It is important to understand, by the way, the coyotes smuggle them \nacross the border, and as soon as they get across the border, they \nactively look for the Border Patrol. They are not being captured. They \nare not being caught. They go look for someone in uniform. They may \nhave ragged clothes falling off their back, they may not have food or \nwater, but they have their papers. They have their papers with them. \nThey cross the border illegally with a coyote and they endure the \nphysical and sexual abuse and then they look for the Border Patrol to \nhand their papers to. Why? Because they believe once they get here and \nhand their papers over, they get amnesty.\n  If we want to solve this crisis, there is one, and only one, way to \nsolve this crisis; that is, to eliminate the promise of amnesty. I \nmentioned a few moments ago that I wanted to talk about this \nhumanitarian crisis and talk about the abdication of responsibility \nbecause Washington has always been lousy at taking responsibility for \nthe suffering our policies create. But the response of this President, \nand I am sorry to say the Democratic majority in this body, has been \nparticularly callous.\n  President Obama proposed a $3.7 billion supplemental plan. Mind you, \nhe did not have time to visit the border, to visit the children, to see \nthe suffering, but he proposed yet more spending. The $3.7 billion \nsupplemental is an HHS social services bill. It spends a whole bunch of \nmoney. By the way, to give you a sense of just how much $3.7 billion \nis, for $3.7 billion we could purchase a first-class airplane ticket \nfor each one of these 90,000 children to return them home--first \nclass--sitting in the front row of a commercial airline. After doing \nso, we could deposit $3.6 billion back in the Federal Treasury. It is a \nmassive amount of money he has asked for, and what is striking, less \nthan 5 percent of it goes to border security.\n  Here is the cynical part. Here is the sad part. Nothing in the \nPresident's proposal does anything to solve the underlying problem. \nNothing does anything to eliminate the promise of amnesty. Nothing does \nanything to solve the problem. What the President is\n\n[[Page S4888]]\n\nsaying is he is perfectly content for this crisis to continue in \nperpetuity. Under the President's bill, next year we can expect \n145,000--DHS expects--to come. We can expect tens of thousands or \nhundreds of thousands of little boys and little girls to be physically \nassaulted and sexually assaulted by coyotes.\n  That is not humane. That is not compassionate. Any system that \ncontinues to have children in the custody of these vicious drug cartels \nis the very opposite of humane and compassionate. As my friend the \njunior Senator from Alabama pointed out, the magnet of amnesty has been \nsignificantly exacerbated in recent months. Why? Because President \nObama, in a very high-profile way, met with far-left activists and made \na promise. He said: I am going to study how to expand amnesty and to \ngrant amnesty to another 5 or 6 million people here illegally.\n  Let's be clear. There is nothing--zero--in U.S. immigration law that \ngives the President the power to grant amnesty. It is open lawlessness \nand contempt for rule of law, but yet that promise is heard. That \npromise is heard throughout Central America. That promise is heard by \nthose mothers and dads who make the heart-wrenching decision to \nhand their sons and daughters over to these coyotes. They do so because \nthey love their kids and they believe, as terrible as the journey will \nbe, that if they get here, they get a permiso, they get to stay in the \n``promised land.'' That promise of amnesty is why this crisis has \nhappened.\n\n  So I have introduced legislation to solve the problem. Last week I \nintroduced a very simple bill that puts into law that President Obama \nhas no authority to grant any additional amnesty. It is a very simple \nbill. It prevents the President from taking the DACA Program that he \nunilaterally and illegally implemented in 2012 and expanding it to \ncover any new immigrants.\n  It is interesting. Representatives from the administration go on \ntelevision and they say: These children are not eligible for amnesty. \nIf that is their position, the administration should support my bill. \nIf that is their position, all this bill does is put into law what they \nsay their position is; that these children are not eligible for \namnesty.\n  Have they supported the bill? They have not. Instead the majority \nleader of this body took it upon himself to go out and hold a press \nconference. What is the top priority for the majority leader of this \nbody? To come after and attack the legislation I introduced, to \npersonally come after the freshman Senator from Texas. The majority \nleader is welcome to impugn any Member of this body. Sadly, that \nhappens all too often. But yet nowhere in the majority leader's \ncomments was a word said about solving this problem. Nowhere in the \nmajority leader's comments was a word said about changing it so little \nboys and little girls are not physically and sexually assaulted so we \ndo not have tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of kids coming \nillegally into this country.\n  Look, we all understand politics in this town. It is an election \nyear. The election is a few months away. Scaring people and \ndemagoguing, unfortunately, is not new to Washington. But the cynicism \nthat is reflected in President Obama's and the majority leader's \napproach to this issue is a new level for this town.\n  This week I am introducing broader legislation that not only includes \nwhat was included last week--a prohibition on the President granting \namnesty--but includes two other elements: a reform of the 2008 law to \nexpedite the humane return of these children to their families and a \nprovision to reimburse the cost for the States calling up the National \nGuard to secure their borders.\n  I would like to say a word about the 2008 law. That has actually been \ndiscussed a lot in this body. Indeed, the Obama administration has two \ntalking points. If we ask the administration what has caused this \ncrisis, the first one is violence in Central America. There is \nsomething convenient about that talking point because if it is violence \nin Central America, it is not President Obama's fault. It is not \nanything they have done. It is something else extrinsic. But the second \ntalking point that sometimes the administration will say is that the \ncause of this crisis is the 2008 law.\n  There is a reason they point to that. Because it seems there is \nnothing President Obama enjoys more than blaming everything bad on this \nplanet on George W. Bush. The 2008 law was signed by George W. Bush. So \nif this crisis was caused by the 2008 law, then mirabile dictu, it is \nnot this administration's fault.\n  But John Adams famously said: Facts are stubborn things. If someone \nis going to make a claim that a crisis is caused by the 2008 law, they \nhave to be willing to take at least a moment to look to the facts.\n  The 2008 law was passed, unsurprisingly, in 2008. The number of \nchildren entering unaccompanied did not spike in 2008. It did not spike \nin 2009. It did not spike in 2010. It did not spike in 2011. In 2011 it \nwas roughly 6,000. If the 2008 law were the cause of this crisis, we \nwould have seen the numbers spike in 2008 or 2009 or 2010 or 2011. No, \nthey did not spike until 2012--June of 2012--when the President pulled \nout his pen and granted amnesty. That is the cause--the direct cause--\nthe cause that the Border Patrol tells us these immigrants are telling \nus is why they are coming.\n\n  Once the crisis was created, the 2008 law has had unintended \nconsequences. The 2008 law allowed expedited removal for unaccompanied \nchildren from Mexico and Canada--our immediate contiguous countries--\nbut created slow, delayed, bureaucratized removal for children from \nmore distant countries.\n  That did not create significant problems in 2008 or 2009 or 2010 or \n2011 because we did not have a massive influx of kids from those \ncountries. But once the President illegally granted amnesty and we \nstarted getting--as we are expected to this year--90,000 unaccompanied \nchildren--most of whom are from Central American countries--now we are \nseeing the 2008 law cause real problems because returning these \nchildren home is delayed, often delayed indefinitely.\n  When I was in the McAllen meeting with the line Border Patrol agents, \nI asked them another question. I said: Listen. Washington is \ndysfunctional. Partisan politics rips the town apart. If you could \nignore the politics, what do you say on the frontlines? How do we \nactually secure the borders? How do we solve this problem? Every single \none of the Border Patrol agents answered the same way. They said: We \nhave to send them home.\n  We treat them humanely. We treat them compassionately--because that \nis who we are as Americans; those are our values--but humanely and \ncompassionately we need to expeditiously return them to their families \nback home. Why? Because if the children are allowed to stay--and, mark \nmy words, President Obama wants these children to stay and he wants to \ngrant amnesty to the next children and the next children, which means \nthat promise of amnesty will cause tens of thousands and hundreds of \nthousands of children to continue to be physically assaulted and \nsexually assaulted in perpetuity.\n  If we grant amnesty, all it will do is incite yet more kids to be \nvictimized. The only way to solve this problem--this is coming from the \nBorder Patrol agents--is to humanely and expeditiously send them home, \nreunite them with their families.\n  The legislation I am introducing this week changes the 2008 law so \nthe policies for sending them home are the same as the policies for \nMexico and Canada. We treat Mexico and Canada with great friendship and \ncompassion. There is no reason the very same procedures cannot apply to \nchildren from Central America.\n  The final element of this bill is dealing with the real security \ncrisis that is occurring.\n  Just today the junior Senator from Alabama and I both heard a \nbriefing from one of our senior military leaders on the national \nsecurity threats caused by our porous borders, by the same avenues that \nare taking those kids in and that are also being used to smuggle vast \nquantities of drugs. The same corridors that are taking those kids in \nare also being used to smuggle in thousands of aliens from special \ninterest countries, from the Middle East, aliens from countries that \nface serious issues of radical Islamic terrorists.\n  A number of our border Governors have stepped forward to respond to \nthis crisis. I commend the Governor of my home State of Texas, Rick \nPerry, for\n\n[[Page S4889]]\n\nshowing leadership and calling up the National Guard in Texas. It was \nthe right thing to do. He should not have to do it. The Constitution \ngives that responsibility to the Federal Government. The Governor \nshould not have to step in and fill the breach. They are doing so \nbecause the President and the Federal Government are refusing to do \ntheir job. But I commend the Governors for doing so. The legislation I \nam introducing simply provides that when a State steps up and does the \njob that is our responsibility, the Federal Government will reimburse \nthe costs.\n  In all likelihood, next week we are going to have a vote on a bill \nthat is denominated a ``border security'' bill. It is a bill the \nmajority leader wants us to vote on that is a version of the \nPresident's HHS social services bill and spends a whole bunch of money \nand does nothing, zero, nada, to solve the problem.\n  The majority leader knows that. The President knows that. The \nintention is to have it voted down. One of the incredible things about \nwhere we are right now is this Democratic Senate is a do-nothing \nSenate. We do not pass any legislation of consequence. There is a \nreason for that. The majority leader has decided we are not going to \npass any legislation of consequence. So instead what do we have? We \nhave a series of show votes, every one of which is designed to fail, \nevery one of which the majority leader knows will fail, and every one \nof which is poll tested or focus-group tested to allow Democrats \nrunning for reelection to campaign based on those votes.\n  It is not legislating. It is not doing the job the Senate was meant \nto do. This border security bill that we will likely vote on next week \nwill do nothing for border security. It is not designed to. Even if it \nwere to pass, it is not designed to. It is not designed to do anything \nto stop President Obama's amnesty. It is not designed to do anything to \nexpedite reuniting these kids with their families back home. It is \nsimply designed to be a fig leaf, to say: The Democrats have responded \nto this crisis. The evil, mean, nasty Republicans did not go along.\n  That is a political narrative that is not new. It is common in \npartisan politics. It just happens not to be true. Unfortunately, the \nDemocratic majority in this body has demonstrated no interest in \nactually solving this problem. You want to know just how cynical the \nmajority leader's strategy is? They have added to this border bill a \nprovision that would replenish the Iron Dome missiles for the nation of \nIsrael.\n  I would note that has nothing to do with the crisis at our southern \nborder. It is a policy that is unambiguously good. Every Member on the \nRepublican side of this Chamber supports replenishing the Iron Dome \nmissiles that are right now keeping Israel safe from the Hamas \nterrorist rocket fire. So why has the majority leader stuck that onto a \nbill that he knows will fail and is designed to fail?\n  Well, it is called partisan politics. Because when it fails, the \ntalking points will come out. The majority leader will come out and \nsay: The Republicans do not want to solve the problem on the border. \nThe Republicans are unwilling to stand with our friend and ally Israel. \nLet me tell you right now, every Republican on this side of the Chamber \nwould vote right now, this afternoon, to replenish the Iron Dome \nmissiles. To be honest, we should be voting. You know, in most parts of \nthe country, Thursday afternoon, 4:30, people who actually have an \nhonest job are still at work. Not in the Senate. The Senate people head \non home. People are out campaigning. How about we actually have \nSenators show up on this floor more than one or two at a time and \ndebate these issues? How about we actually see Senators stand, debate \nthe issues, and resolve the problems?\n  The majority leader went on television and said: The border is \nsecure. I find that an astonishing assertion. I recognized how from the \nperch of Washington, DC, it might seem that way. Perhaps the DC/\nVirginia border is secure. But I would invite the majority leader and I \nwould invite any Member of the Chamber: Come down to Texas. Come to \nMcAllen. Come visit the border. When I was in McAllen on Saturday, the \nBorder Patrol agents told me the day before they had apprehended 622 \npeople.\n  I went to the processing center. They had 10 holding centers with 600 \nor 700 people there. One holding room had little girls below age 14, \nunaccompanied. Another holding room had little boys under age 14, \nunaccompanied. The third holding room had girls ages 14 to 19, \nunaccompanied. The fourth room had boys ages 14 to 19, unaccompanied. \nThe fifth and sixth rooms had family units, mothers and fathers and \nlittle bitty babies, including tiny infants needing diapers and \nformula. Then the final four holding areas held adults.\n  That was one day. That was not a week. That was not a month. That was \none day. Ninety thousand unaccompanied children are expected to enter \nthe country this year. The majority leader of the Senate says the \nborder is secure. I would invite the majority leader to say that to \nthose little boys and little girls who have just been victimized that \nthe border is secure. That sure would surprise them. I would invite the \nmajority leader to say that to the farmers and ranchers and the \ncitizens in South Texas because that sure would surprise them.\n  By the way, when you get outside of Washington this issue is not \npartisan. When you go down to South Texas and you visit with the \nelected leaders there, many of whom--most of whom--are elected \nDemocrats and often Hispanic Democrats, and you ask: What is your top \npriority? Among Hispanic Democrats on the border, they say: Border \nsecurity--because the border is so far from secure that their \ncommunities are paying the price.\n  I would invite the majority leader to come to Brooks County, TX. In \nBrooks County, TX, hundreds of men, women, and children are found dead \nfrom crossing illegally. I would invite the majority leader to look, as \nI have, at the photographs of these bodies. Pregnant women are \nabandoned and left to die. Those are vicious cartels and coyotes. This \nis the face of amnesty. Ninety thousand children being victimized, \nbeing physically assaulted and sexually assaulted. This is the face of \namnesty: Children held in detention centers with chain-link fences \ngoing up 18 feet, separating them in separate pens. This is the face of \namnesty. Our heart breaks for these kids. But if it really breaks for \nthose kids, we should do something about it. The only way to stop this \nhumanitarian crisis is to stop President Obama's amnesty. As long as \nthe President continues to promise amnesty, these children will keep \ncoming, and they will keep being victimized.\n  Sadly, as long as Senate Democrats are unwilling to stand up to their \nPresident and say, let's actually show some leadership and fix this \nproblem, then the Senate will continue to be the Democratic do-nothing \nSenate. We will not solve those problems. We will fail in the \nfundamental obligation all of us owe to the men and women who elected \nus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas because \nit, indeed, is the face of amnesty. He has documented for us, I think \nindisputably, that this surge of immigration was a result of the \namnesty provided for these children by the President of the United \nStates. I think that has been shown. I think we have never had a \nclearer analysis of it.\n  I am reading now further in the National Journal article about what \nthe President plans to do next. The concern we have is about the \nfuture. I am not making this up, colleagues. This is a very real action \nthe President is considering, as I read from that chart on amnesty. He \nwould execute, contrary to law, what would give legal status and work \nstatus to 5 to 6 million people, 10 times the number that he has been \nprovided for in this action.\n  What did the National Journal report? Well, I am quoting here.\n\n       The President also told a group--This is the group of La \n     Raza and other activist groups that are demanding amnesty \n     and, really, open borders. He told them that Boehner, the \n     Speaker of the House ``urged him not to press ahead with \n     executive actions because that would make legislating more \n     difficult next year.''\n\n  In other words, Speaker Boehner said: Do not use this executive \namnesty in the future, Mr. President. So now the President is talking \nto the group, these activists that have been pushing him and demanding \nthings. This is what the article says.\n\n       Obama told the group, according to those present, his \n     response to Boehner was: `Sorry\n\n[[Page S4890]]\n\n     about that. I'm going to keep my promise and move forward \n     with executive action soon.'\n\n  It makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck as a former Federal \nprosecutor in Federal court for almost 15 years to have the President \nsay this. The article went on to say:\n\n       In the room, there was something of a collective, electric \n     gasp. The assembled immigration-rights groups had been \n     leaning hard on Obama for months to use executive action to \n     sidestep Congress and privately mocked what they regarded as \n     Pollyanna hopes that House Republicans would budge . . . \n     Obama told the groups what they had been dying to hear--that \n     he was going to condemn House Republicans for inaction and . \n     . . provide legal status to millions of undocumented \n     workers--all by himself.\n\n  Mr. CRUZ. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would be pleased.\n  Mr. CRUZ. The junior Senator from Alabama has just described \nPresident Obama's stated intention to grant amnesty to an additional 5 \nto 6 million people here illegally in the months preceding this next \nelection. As the junior Senator from Alabama is certainly aware, there \nare a number of Senators up for reelection, including a number of \nDemocrats in bright red States where the constituents of those States, \nwhether in Louisiana or Arkansas or North Carolina or many other \nStates, do not support amnesty for another 5 to 6 million people here \nillegally.\n  The question I would ask my friend from Alabama: Is he aware of any \nDemocrat in this Chamber, including those Democrats running for \nreelection in conservative States where the citizens strongly oppose \namnesty--is he aware of any Democrat in this Chamber who has had the \ncourage to stand with him in standing up to President Obama and saying: \nDo not grant amnesty illegally? Is he aware of any Democrat who has \njoined the two of us in our legislation to prohibit President Obama \nfrom illegally granting amnesty to 5 to 6 million people?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, I am not. One of the things I think the American \npeople do need to understand is when Majority Leader Reid, in \nconjunction with the President of the United States, blocks even \namendments up for a vote, where does he get his power? He gets his \npower from every Member of his conference.\n  None of them are breaking in and saying: This is not right.\n  Senator Cruz's bill would deal with this future danger, that the \nPresident might do this again. I think--and we have looked at it hard, \nour Judiciary staff--we both serve on that committee--and have said \nthis will actually work to ensure that we don't have another rogue \naction, unlawful, by the President of the United States, directly \ncontrary to deciding the will of the American people and congressional \naction.\n  The President is happy that Congress doesn't pass his law, and he \nsays: They won't act, so I will.\n  But, colleagues, when we don't act, we act. That is an act. It is a \ndecision as sure as if we had passed a law. A decision not to act is a \ndecision. The President of the United States can't simply go around and \nsay: I can do anything I want because Congress won't act. How \nridiculous is that? A National Journal article calls this policy \nexplosive, and I believe that is a direct action.\n  One more question. Senator Cruz, I know, is a student of the \nConstitution, and Professor Turley at George Washington University has \ntestified numerous times before Congress. I think he considers himself \na Democrat, a liberal, but he is deeply concerned about the future of \nour Republic because of the President's overreach and exceeding the \nlawful powers given to the President.\n  Is some other President going to expand it further and very soon \nCongress becomes nothing? I would ask if the Senator shares this \nconcern, because he was very active in the attorney general's office in \nTexas. Professor Turley said:\n\n       The President's pledge to effectively govern alone is \n     alarming, and what is most alarming is his ability to fulfill \n     that pledge. When a president can govern alone, he can become \n     a government unto himself, which is precisely the danger the \n     framers sought to avoid . . .\n       What we're witnessing today is one of the greatest crises \n     that members of this body will face. . . . It has reached a \n     constitutional tipping point that threatens a fundamental \n     change in how our country is governed.\n\n  Does that cause the Senator concern and does he have any thoughts \nabout that?\n  Mr. CRUZ. Senator Sessions, it causes me great concern. One of the \nmost troubling aspects of the Obama Presidency has been the persistent \npattern of lawlessness from this President. We have never seen a \nPresident who, if he disagrees with a particular law, so frequently and \nso brazenly refuses to enforce it, refuses to comply with it, and \nasserts the power to unilaterally change it.\n  The President famously said: I have a pen and I have a phone, and he \nseems to confuse his pen and his phone for the constitutional process \nof lawmaking our country was built on.\n  Rule of law does not mean you have a country with a whole lot of \nlaws. Most countries have laws, and many totalitarian countries have a \nwhole lot of laws. Rule of law means no man is above the law. It means \nthat everyone, everyone, everyone, and especially the President, is \nbound by the law.\n  President Obama openly defies his constitutional obligation under \narticle 2 of the Constitution to take care that the laws will be \nfaithfully executed.\n  I would note that Professor Turley, as the junior Senator from \nAlabama quoted, is a liberal Democrat who in 2008 voted for President \nObama. Professor Turley also testified before the House that President \nObama has become the embodiment of the imperial President. Barack Obama \nhas become the President Richard Nixon always wished he could be.\n  Those are the words of a liberal Democratic constitutional law \nprofessor who voted for Barack Obama.\n  But my friend the junior Senator from Alabama is learned and \nexperienced in the ways of the Senate. He has seen lions of the Senate \nwalk this floor. It is unprecedented to have a President so brazenly \ndefy the rule of law, but I state what is equally unprecedented, to \nhave the Senate lie down and meow like kitty cats.\n  Abuse of power by the President is not a new phenomenon. Presidents \nof both parties have abused their power. That is a job, sadly, where \nthat tendency has been significant. But in the past, when Presidents \nhave abused their power, Members of their own party stood and called \nthem to account for it. When Richard Nixon abused his power, Members of \nboth parties rightfully decried his abuse of power, so much so that he \nwas forced to resign.\n  I can state when George W. Bush was President, he signed a two-\nparagraph order that purported to order the State courts to obey the \nWorld Court. I know this because I was at the time serving as the \nsolicitor general of Texas, and it was our State courts that the \nPresident's order purported to bind.\n  George W. Bush is a good man. He is a former Governor of Texas, he is \na Republican, and he was a friend and is a friend. Yet I was proud that \nthe State of Texas did not hesitate to stand up to that abuse of power. \nI went before the U.S. Supreme Court on behalf of the State of Texas \nand argued that President George W. Bush's order was unconstitutional, \nthat no President has the authority to give up U.S. sovereignty. I am \npleased to say the U.S. Supreme Court agreed and struck down the \nPresident's order by a vote of 6 to 3.\n  What is unprecedented today is that on the left side of the Chamber \nit is both literally and figuratively empty.\n  We had, not too long ago, the President abuse his power with recess \nappointments. One of the important checks and balances the Constitution \ncreates on Presidential authority is it gives this body, the Senate, \nthe power of confirmation. President Obama apparently didn't like any \nchecks and balances on his power, so he made a series of recess \nappointments when the Senate wasn't in recess. It was brazen, it was \nnaked. The President simply asserted: I say the Senate is in recess. \nMind you, the Senate didn't say we were in recess, but the President \nclaimed the power to declare us in recess when we weren't.\n  Do you want to know how extreme that was? Do you want to know how \nbrazen that was? Do you want to know how extraordinary that was?\n  Just a few weeks ago the Supreme Court unanimously struck it down as \nunconstitutional.\n\n[[Page S4891]]\n\n  It is important to underscore that. There is a lot of coverage in the \nnewspaper that suggests we have liberal Justices, conservative \nJustices, and on any close issue it is going to be 5 to 4. This wasn't \n5 to 4, it wasn't 6 to 3, it wasn't 7 to 2, and it wasn't even 8 to 1--\n9 to 0. Every Democratic appointee on the Court--both of President \nObama's appointees on the Court. They looked at the substantive issue \nand they said: This ain't hard. The President doesn't get to say when \nthe Senate is in recess, the Senate gets to say when the Senate is in \nrecess. And if the Senate isn't in recess, the President has to respect \nthe checks and balances of confirmation.\n  So we have an easy, no-brainier layup of a constitutional law \nquestion about the President usurping the constitutional prerogatives \nof the Senate, and how many Senate Democrats stood up to their party's \nPresident? Not a single one. Not the majority leader of the Senate, who \nwe would think might have some interest in the credibility of this \ninstitution and, I am sorry to say, not a lone Democratic Senator. It \nwasn't that long ago there were lions of the Senate on the Democratic \nside who prided themselves on defending this institution: Robert Byrd, \nwho stood for years defending this institution; Ted Kennedy.\n  I would say to my friend the junior Senator from Alabama, what is \ntruly unprecedented is that there are no Senate Democrats who say: \nEnough is enough.\n  I am hopeful at some point we will see a Senate Democrat listen to \ntheir constituents, listen to the Constitution, and listen to the rule \nof law.\n  I can assume the reason why Senate Democrats don't do it and why our \nfriends in the press often don't report on this. I can assume their \nreasoning goes something such as: Well, I basically agree with the \npolicies of President Obama. I like the policies. I agree with what he \nis doing, and he is our guy. We kind of have to back our guy.\n  I am guessing that is a reason, but I will note, as the Scriptures \nsay: There came a pharaoh who knew not Joseph and his children.\n  President Barack Obama will not always be President of the United \nStates. There will be another President. And even to my friends on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle--I must say something shocking and \nterrifying to you--there will come another Republican President.\n  If the President has the authority to do what President Obama is \nclaiming, with ObamaCare--28 times--he simply unilaterally changed the \ntext of the law, said: It doesn't matter what the law says, I say it is \nsomething different. If the President has that power, a Republican \nPresident has that power too.\n  So I would encourage all of my friends on the left who like these \npolicy issues--well, imagine some of the policy issues you don't like, \nwhether on labor law or environmental law or tort reform or let's take \ntax law. I will give an example.\n  Imagine a subsequent Republican President who stood up and stated \nquite sensibly the economy might do much better if we move to a flat \ntax, so I am therefore instructing the IRS: Do not collect any tax \nabove 20 percent.\n  Now one might say, well, that sounds extreme. That sounds radical. As \na policy matter, that would be a terrific policy.\n  But could the President instruct the IRS not to enforce tax laws? \nFifty-five Members of this body are already on record saying yes. Do \nyou know why? Because when the President suspended the employer mandate \nfor big business, the text for ObamaCare says the employer mandate \nkicks in on January 1, 2014. The President said: I am suspending that \nprovision of law. I am granting my buddies in big business a waiver. \nThat was a tax law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  I think what he is saying is reflected in what Professor Turley said. \nIt is almost like a plea to his colleague, maybe his Democratic \ncolleague, his friend. He said: ``The President's pledge to effectively \ngovern alone is alarming, and what is most alarming is his ability to \nfulfill that pledge.''\n  In other words, his ability to get away with it; that Congress \nacquiesces in it. Let me say this the President is not going to get \naway with a unilateral amnesty. We are going to take this to the \nAmerican people, and at some point this Congress will be held to \naccount if he does so. Remember, every Member is going to have to vote \nand be responsible for allowing a President to run roughshod over the \nlaw of this country, the people's representatives, and, in effect, the \npeople of the United States.\n  His plan for amnesty, under the circumstances he advocated them, has \nbeen rejected.\n  Congress is always available to consider any issue and make any \ndecision it chooses, but it has, under the circumstances driven in this \nbody, been rejected.\n  He has no power to go forward and beyond that, and we are not going \nto allow it to happen. It is wrong. Whether we agree or disagree about \nhow amnesty should be given, it is wrong for the President to \nunilaterally execute such a policy, as Professor Turley said and as the \nSenator from Texas has said, the former solicitor general of the State \nof Texas. He understands it is law, and this matter is not over. We \nwill continue to advocate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Harkin pertaining to the introduction of S. 2658 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Thank you, Madam President. This is my 75th ``Time to \nWake Up'' speech, something of a minor benchmark, I suppose. I come \nhere urging my colleagues to wake up to the threat of climate change. I \ndo this every week we are in session, hoping someday a spark will hit \ntinder. But even as the evidence of climate change deepens, the \ndialogue in Washington remains one-sided.\n  Climate change was once a bipartisan concern. In recent years \nsomething changed. I think I know what changed, and I will get to that. \nFirst, let's reminisce about the bipartisanship. As we take a look back \nin this body, we have Republican colleagues who once openly \nacknowledged the existence of carbon-driven climate change and who \ncalled for real legislative action to cut carbon emissions. Imagine \nthat. It wasn't that long ago.\n  We have a former Republican Presidential nominee amongst us who \ncampaigned for the Presidency on addressing climate change. We have \nRepublicans here who have spoken favorably about charging a fee on \ncarbon, including an original Republican cosponsor of a bipartisan \nSenate carbon-fee bill. We have a Republican colleague who cosponsored \ncarbon fee legislation in the House and another who voted for the \nWaxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill when he was in the House. For years--\nfor years--there was a steady, healthy heartbeat of Republican support \nfor major U.S. legislation to address carbon pollution.\n  Let me be specific. In 2003, Senator John McCain was the lead \ncosponsor of Democrat Joe Lieberman's Climate Stewardship Act, which \nwould have created a market-based emissions cap-and-trading program to \nreduce carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping pollutants from the \nbiggest U.S. sources.\n  Here is what Senator McCain said at the time:\n\n       While we cannot say with 100 percent confidence what will \n     happen in the future, we do know the emission of greenhouse \n     gases is not healthy for the environment. As many of the top \n     scientists through the world have stated, the sooner we start \n     to reduce these emissions the better off we will be in the \n     future.\n\n  His Climate Stewardship Act actually got a vote. Imagine that. When \nit did not prevail, Senator McCain reintroduced the measure himself in \nthe following Congress. Republican Senators Olympia Snowe of Maine and \nLincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, my predecessor, were among that bill's \ncosponsors. Other Republicans got behind other cap-and-trade proposals. \nSenator Tom Carper's Clean Air Planning Act at one time or another \ncounted Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Senator Lindsey Graham of \nSouth Carolina, and Senator Susan Collins of Maine among its \nsupporters.\n\n[[Page S4892]]\n\n  In 2007, Republican Senator Olympia Snowe was a lead cosponsor of \nthen-Senator Kerry's Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act. Senators \nMurkowski and Stevens from Alaska and Senator Specter of Pennsylvania, \nthen a Republican, were original cosponsors of the Bingaman Low Carbon \nEconomy Act. That same year Senator Alexander introduced the Clean Air/\nClimate Change Act of 2007. Each of these bills sought to reduce carbon \nemissions through a cap-and-trade mechanism.\n  Said Senator Alexander:\n\n       It is also time to acknowledge that climate change is real. \n     Human activity is a big part of the problem and it is up to \n     us to act.\n\n  That bipartisan heartbeat remained strong in 2009. Senator Mark Kirk \nof Illinois, while he served in the House of Representatives, was one \nof eight Republicans to vote for the Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade \nproposal. In that same year, 2009, Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, then \nrepresenting Arizona in the House, was an original cosponsor of the \nRaise Wages, Cut Carbon Act to reduce payroll taxes for employers and \nemployees in exchange for equal revenue from a carbon tax. On the House \nfloor then-Representative Flake argued the virtues of this approach. He \nsaid:\n\n       If we want to be honest about helping the environment, then \n     just impose a carbon tax and make it revenue neutral. Give \n     commensurate tax relief on the other side. Myself and another \n     Republican colleague have introduced that legislation to do \n     just that. Let's have an honest debate about whether or not \n     we want to help the environment by actually having something \n     that is revenue neutral where you tax consumption as opposed \n     to income.\n\n  It was a good idea then and it is still a good idea now. Senator \nFlake's words were echoed that year in the Senate by Senator Collins, a \nlead cosponsor of the Carbon Limits and Energy for America's Renewal \nAct, Senator Cantwell's carbon fee bill.\n  ``In the United States alone,'' said Senator Collins, ``emissions of \nthe primary greenhouse gas carbon dioxide have risen more than 20 \npercent since 1990. Clearly climate change is a daunting environmental \nchallenge,'' she said, ``but we must develop solutions that do not \nimpose a heavy burden on our economy, particularly during these \ndifficult economic times.''\n  Madam President, 2009--think of it. There was once not too long ago a \nclear and forceful acknowledgment from leading Republican voices of the \nreal danger posed by climate change and of Congress's responsibility to \nact.\n  What happened? Why did the steady heartbeat of Republican climate \naction suddenly flatline?\n  I believe we lost the ability to address climate change in a \nbipartisan way because of the evils of the Supreme Court's Citizens \nUnited decision. Our present failure to address climate change is a \nsymptom of things gone awry in our democracy due to Citizens United. \nThat decision did not enhance speech in our democracy. It has allowed \nbullying, wealthy special interests to suppress real debate. I have \nspoken before on the Senate floor about the Supreme Court's \nCitizens United decision, one of the most disgraceful decisions by any \nSupreme Court, destined ultimately, I believe, to follow cases such as \nLochner v. New York onto the ash heap of judicial infamy, but we are \nstuck with it for now. In a nutshell the Citizens United decision says \nthis: Corporations are people. Money is speech. So there can be no \nlimit to corporate money influencing American elections.\n\n  If that doesn't seem right, it is because it is not. Phony and \nimproper fact-finding by the five conservative activists on the Supreme \nCourt concluded that corporate spending could not ever corrupt \nelections--just couldn't do it. By some magic it is pure. That is a bad \nenough finding on its face, but they also didn't get that limitless, \nuntraceable political money doesn't have to be spent to damage our \ndemocracy.\n  Unlimited corporate spending in politics can corrupt not just through \nfloods of anonymous attack advertisements, it can corrupt secretly and \nmore dangerously through the mere threat of that spending through \nprivate threats and promises. The Presiding Officer was the attorney \ngeneral of her State, and she well knows how much mischief can be done \nin back rooms by threats and promises. That is what attorneys general \nsee when they go out and investigate.\n  As we are evaluating the effect of Citizens United on our climate \nchange debate, let's remember this: A lot of this special interest \nmoney has been spent against Republicans. I have had Republican friends \ntell me, ``What are you complaining about? They are spending more \nagainst us than against you.'' There have been times when that has been \ntrue.\n  When the Koch brothers' polluter money can come in and bombard you in \na small primary election, that is pretty scary. When the paid-for \nrightwing attack machine can be cranked up against you in your \nRepublican primary, that is pretty scary too. What the polluters can do \nwith political spending, they can threaten or promise to do in ways \nthat the public will never see or know, but the candidate will know. \nThe candidate will know for sure.\n  So I wrote a friend-of-the-court brief to the Supreme Court with \nSenator John McCain to highlight for the Justices some of the failings \nand pitfalls of their shameful Citizens United decision. ``The \ndominating influence of super PACs,'' we wrote, ``makes it all the \neasier for those seeking legislative favors and results to discreetly \nthreaten such expenditures if Members of Congress do not accede to \ntheir demands.'' I think we were right.\n  How does this bear on climate change? All that bipartisan activity I \ntalked about preceded Citizens United. After that, polluter attacks \nfunded by Citizens United money and the threat of those polluter \nattacks--perhaps promises not to make those attacks if you behave--cast \na dark shadow over Republicans who might work with Democrats on curbing \ncarbon pollution. Tens, perhaps even hundreds of millions of dark-money \ndollars are being spent by polluters and their front organizations, and \nGod only knows what private threats and promises have been made.\n  The timing is telling. Before Citizens United, there was an active \nheartbeat of Republican activity on climate change. Since then, the \nevidence has only become stronger. But after Citizens United uncorked \nall that big, dark money and allowed it to cast its bullying shadow of \nintimidation over our democracy, Republicans--other than those few who \nparrot the polluter party line that climate change is a big old hoax--\nhave all walked back from any major climate legislation.\n  We have Senators here who represent historic native villages that are \nnow washing into the sea and needing relocation because of climate \nchange and sea-level rise. We have Senators here who represent great \nAmerican coastal cities that are now overwashed by high tides because \nof climate change. We have Senators representing States swept by \ndrought and wildfire. We have Senators whose home State forests by the \nhundreds of square miles are being killed by the marauding pine beetle. \nWe have Senators whose home State glaciers are disappearing before \ntheir very eyes. We have Senators whose States are having to raise \noffshore bridges and highways before rising seas. We have Senators \nwhose emblematic home State species are dying off, such as the New \nHampshire moose, for instance, swarmed by ticks by the tens of \nthousands that snows no longer kill. Yet none will work on a major \nclimate bill. It is not safe to ever since Citizens United allowed the \nbullying, polluting special interests to bombard our elections, and \nthreaten and promise to bombard our elections with their attack ads.\n  Despite all the dark money, despite the threats and intimidation, I \nstill believe this can be a courageous time. We simply need \nconscientious Republicans and Democrats to work together in good faith \non a common platform of facts and common sense to protect the American \npeople and the American economy from the looming effects of climate \nchange in our atmosphere, on our lands, and in our oceans. We simply \nneed to shed the shackles of corrupting influence and rise to our duty.\n  In courageous times, Americans have done far more than that. It is \nnot asking much to ask this generation to stand up to a pack of \npolluters just because they have big checkbooks. In previous \ngenerations, Americans have put their very lives, fortunes, and sacred \nhonor at risk to serve the higher interests of this great Republic. We \nknow it can be done because it has been done.\n  We do not have to be the generation that failed at our duty. We are \nheaded\n\n[[Page S4893]]\n\ndown a road to infamy now, but it doesn't have to be that way. We can \nleave a legacy that will echo down the corridors of history so that \nthose who follow us will be proud of our efforts. But sitting here \ndoing nothing, yielding to the special interest bullies and their \nCitizens United money, pretending that the problem isn't real, will not \naccomplish that.\n  As I have said before, 74 times, and as I say tonight for the 75th \ntime, it is time for us to wake up.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Supporting Israel\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, yesterday Secretary of Defense Chuck \nHagel wrote to the majority leader seeking $225 million in additional \nU.S. funding for the production of Iron Dome components in Israel so \nthey can maintain adequate stockpiles and defend their population. \nRepublicans are united in support of our ally Israel. We have \nlegislation that would allow Congress to meet the Secretary's request, \nand we hope our friends on the other side will join us in coming to a \nsensible, bipartisan solution that can be passed quickly.\n  As most Senators know, the Iron Dome missile defense system has \nplayed a critical role in defending Israel's population from rocket \nattacks launched by Hamas from within the Gaza Strip.\n  While our friends in Egypt are working to bring Hamas to a cease-fire \nand end this mirage of rocket attacks--attacks that indiscriminately \ntarget the civilian population of Israel--the Iron Dome system will \nremain critical to Israel's security until a true cease-fire is \nachieved. It will remain vital afterwards as well, because this \ndefensive system helps blunt the impact of one of Hamas's preferred \ntools of terror.\n  By passing a bipartisan measure to meet the Secretary's request, we \ncan send a message to Hamas that its terrorist tactics and its attempts \nto terrorize Israel's populace will not succeed. And we can help Israel \ndefend its civilian population against indiscriminate attacks as it \ncontinues its campaign--Operation Protective Edge--to destroy the often \nIranian-supplied weapons stockpiled within Gaza, as well as to \neliminate the tunnels that allow terrorists to infiltrate into Israel \nand smuggle arms into Gaza.\n\n\n                                 Burma\n\n  Now, on a different matter in a different part of the world. For more \nthan two decades I have been coming to the Senate floor to discuss the \nlatest events in Burma. Typically, in the spring, I would introduce \nlegislation to renew the import sanctions on the then-Burmese junta \ncontained in the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act. In addition to \npressuring the junta, the annual renewal of the import sanctions \nprovided a useful forum to focus public attention on Burma.\n  After much deliberation, last summer Members of Congress chose not to \nrenew these sanctions for another year as Burma had demonstrated \nprogress toward implementing governmental reform. That said, Burma's \npath to reform is far from complete. Much work remains to be done. As \nsuch, it is important to continue focusing attention on the country in \na regular fashion. That is what I wish to do today, to highlight an \nimportant, immediate, intuitive step that the country can take to \nreassure those who wish the country well, that it remains on the path \nto reform.\n  In many ways the Burma of 2014 scarcely resembles the nation that \nexisted in 2003 when Congress first enacted the BFDA against the \nBurmese junta. Beginning about 3 years ago, Burma began to make \nsignificant strides forward in several key areas.\n  Under President U Thein Sein, the Burmese Government began to \ninstitute reforms that surprised virtually all of the onlookers. In the \nfollowing years, the government granted numerous amnesties and \npolitical pardons to political prisoners and has released more than \n1,100 political prisoners to date.\n  As a result of the new government's actions, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, \nthe Nobel Peace Prize laureate, was released from house arrest after \nspending 15--15--of the previous 21 years in detention. Since her \nrelease from House arrest, Daw Suu has been permitted to travel abroad. \nMoreover, a by-election was held in April 2012 and she was elected as a \nmember of Parliament along with a number of her National League for \nDemocracy colleagues. In fact, when she did travel abroad back in 2012, \nat my invitation she came to Louisville, KY. It was an incredible \nexperience to have her in our State and in our country.\n  In light of these democratic reforms--many of which I witnessed \nfirsthand when I visited the country in January of 2012--I believe that \nto no small degree Burma has been a remarkable story among many dark \ndevelopments in the world today.\n  However, even though the country has made incredible progress in a \nrelatively short period of time, to many Burma of late appears stalled \namidst a score of pressing challenges. These include continued conflict \nbetween the government and ethnic minorities, governmental restrictions \non civil liberties, and ongoing humanitarian issues in Rakhine State. \nAll are serious concerns that command close attention. And related to \nall of these issues is the need for Burma to continue to bring the \nmilitary under civilian control if it is to evolve into a more \nrepresentative government.\n  With the by-election in Burma scheduled for late this year and a \nparliamentary election scheduled for late 2015, reformers in the \nBurmese Government have an opportunity to regain their momentum. To my \nview, the time between now and the end of 2015 is pivotal--pivotal--for \nBurma. The elections will help demonstrate whether the country \nwill continue on the reformist path.\n\n  With that in mind, the Burmese Government should understand that the \nUnited States, and the Senate specifically, will watch very closely at \nhow Burmese authorities conduct the 2015 parliamentary elections as a \ncritical marker of the sincerity and the sustainability of democratic \nreform in Burma.\n  President U Thein Sein has made public assurances that the upcoming \nparliamentary election will be ``free and transparent.'' However, his \npledge has already been challenged by several campaign restrictions.\n  One of those restrictions is a simple one. It involves who can be \nchosen for the most important civilian office in Burma: The Presidency.\n  Burma has several requirements governing who can hold this highest \noffice. Some of them make sense. For instance, like the United States, \nBurma has a minimum age requirement for its highest office. Its \nPresident must be at least 45 years old. I suppose that helps assure \nthat only someone with a fair amount of life experience can be \nPresident.\n  In addition, the Burmese constitution stipulates that the President \nmust be a citizen who is ``well acquainted'' with the country's \n``political, administrative, economic, and military'' affairs, and is \n``loyal to the union and its citizens.'' This requirement helps ensure \nthat a president is knowledgeable about public affairs and has a vested \ninterest in serving in Burma's executive office.\n  However, Burma's constitution also includes a deeply disconcerting \nlimitation on Presidential eligibility. Section 59 stipulates that the \nBurmese President may not be a foreign national and may not have any \nimmediate family members who are foreign nationals.\n  This limitation on the home nation of a candidate's immediate family \nhas no bearing on an individual's fitness for office. This restriction \nprevents many, including Daw Suu herself, from even being considered \nfor Burma's highest office. Daw Suu, for example, would not be \npermitted to run because her deceased husband was, and her two sons \nare, British nationals. To think that the nationalities of family \nmembers have relevance for fitness to hold office or allegiance to \nBurma is dubious at best.\n  Not only is Daw Suu discriminated against but so are the Burmese who \nfled or were exiled from the country during the junta's rule. Many of \nthem\n\n[[Page S4894]]\n\nwere out of Burma for years--not by choice, I would add--and during \nthis time many became naturalized citizens in another country out of \nnecessity. These men and women are also ineligible to be President.\n  Deciding who will be the next Burmese President is obviously up to \nthe people of Burma through their elected representatives and not up to \nthe international community. But, at a minimum, I believe that \notherwise qualified candidates should be permitted to stand for office.\n  More important than the provision's unfairness for certain \nPresidential candidates is that this provision restricts the ability of \nthe people of Burma, through their representatives, to have a choice in \nwho can hold their highest office. This is profoundly undemocratic, and \nit is profoundly undemocratic at a time when Burma's commitment to \ndemocracy is actually open to question.\n  It is notable that one apparent roadblock to amending the \nPresidential eligibility requirement is the fact that the military \nholds de facto veto power over constitutional amendments. Under the \nconstitution, the military controls a block of 25 percent of the \nparliamentary seats and in excess of a 75-percent vote is required for \na constitutional amendment to go forward. The military controls 25 \npercent of the Parliament; they need over 75 percent of the Parliament \nto change the constitution. It becomes clear what this is about.\n  I understand the Burmese parliamentary committee is in the process of \nfinalizing plans for the implementation of constitutional reform, but I \nam concerned that eligibility changes will apparently not--not--include \namending the narrow restrictions of the constitution that limit who can \nrun for President. To me, it will be a missed opportunity if this \nprovision is not revisited before the 2015 parliamentary elections.\n  Modifying this provision is one way the Burmese Government can \ndisplay to the world, in an immediate and clearly recognizable way, \nthat it remains fully committed to reform. Permitting a broad array of \ncandidates to run for President is an unmistakable symbol to the \nworld--even to those who do not follow Burma closely--that Burmese \nreformers actually mean business; otherwise, such a restriction will \nquite simply cast a pall over the legitimacy of the election in the \neyes of the international community and certainly to Members of the \nU.S. Senate.\n\n  While Congress did not renew the BFDA's import ban last year and \nthere is little appetite to renew the measure this year, several U.S. \nsanctions toward Burma remain on the books. They include restrictions \non the importation of jade and rubies into the United States and \nsanctions on individuals who continue to hinder reform efforts. It is \nhard to see how those provisions get lifted without there being \nprogress on the constitutional eligibility issue and the closely \nrelated issue of the legitimacy of the 2015 elections.\n  As the 2015 elections approach, I urge the country's leadership--its \nPresident, Parliament and military--to remain resolute in confronting \nthe considerable obstacles to a more representative government that \nBurma faces. That is the only way the existing sanctions are going to \nget removed--the only way.\n  I wanted to highlight the eligibility issue as an example of an \nimportant step Burma could take to continue its reformist momentum. \nSuch a step is of course necessary but not sufficient. As I noted, \nundergirding many of Burma's problems is the need to enhance civilian \ncontrol over the military. This concern manifests itself in many ways, \nincluding the need to clarify that the commander in chief serves under \nthe President and the importance of removing the military's de facto \nveto authority over constitutional amendments.\n  One tool the United States could use to help reform Burma's armed \nforces is through military-to-military contacts. I believe that \nexposure to the most professional military in the world--our own--will \nhelp Burma develop a force that is responsive to civilian control and \nto professional standards. Security assistance and professional \nmilitary education are not simply rewards to partnering countries, as \nsome view such programs. They are tools with which we advance our \nforeign policy objectives. Helping the Burmese military to reform is in \nour interest but it cannot be done through mere exhortation; it needs \nto be done through training and regular contact with the highest \nprofessional military standards. Only then, I believe, will the Burmese \nmilitary see that being under civilian control is not--not--inimical to \nits interests.\n  This realization by the Burmese military, coupled with a successful \n2015 election that is open to all otherwise qualified Presidential \naspirants, will greatly enhance the cause for reform and peaceful \nreconciliation in Burma.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to Jeremy \nHolbrook a Marine from my home State, the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n  Jeremy hails from Magoffin County, and graduated from Magoffin County \nHigh School in 2004. The attacks of September 11, 2001, had a profound \nimpact on Jeremy, and inspired him to enlist in the Marine Corps after \ngraduating at the age of 18.\n  After completing basic training, combat training, and tank school, \nJeremy was deployed to Ramadi as a part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. \nDespite being wounded on this first tour, for which he received the \nPurple Heart, he remained determined to serve his country. Jeremy \nreturned to Iraq for a second tour, this time in Fallujah and, as in \nhis previous tour, participated in counter-insurgency missions.\n  Both Jeremy's uncle and grandfather served in the U.S. Army, and for \nJeremy it just made sense to continue that legacy of service. As he \nputs it--``pretty much whenever I saw our Nation needed people to \ndefend our Nation, I felt I needed to take the call, and that's what I \ndid.''\n  Jeremy's honorable service to this country is deserving of the praise \nof this body. Therefore, I ask that my Senate colleagues join me in \nhonoring Jeremy Holbrook.\n  The Salyersville Independent recently published an article detailing \nHolbrook's two tours in Iraq. I ask unanimous consent that the full \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n           [From the Salyersville Independent, July 3, 2014]\n\n               Holbrook Inspired by 9/11 to Join Marines\n\n                           (By Heather Oney)\n\n       The attacks of 9/11 inspired Jeremy Holbrook to join the \n     Marines, which took him on two tours of Iraq.\n       At 18 years old in 2004, Holbrook enlisted with the \n     Marines, making his family sad, but proud, he said. Since his \n     grandfather and uncle had both been in the Army, he said it \n     just seemed like the right thing to do.\n       ``Pretty much, whenever I saw our nation needed people to \n     defend our nation, I felt I needed to take the call and \n     that's what I did,'' Holbrook said.\n       The Magoffin County High School grad went to boot camp at \n     the Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island in South \n     Carolina in July 2004, graduating from there in October 2004. \n     He had his combat training at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, \n     then tank school in Fort Knox, Kentucky, assigned to the M1A1 \n     Abrams Tank Crew. He trained for Operation Iraqi Freedom at \n     Twentynine Palms, California.\n       Holbrook did two combat tours in Iraq, the first time in \n     Ramadi, Iraq, running counter-insurgency missions, and the \n     second time to Fallujah, Iraq, where he continued counter-\n     insurgency missions and route clearing.\n       Based in an old Iraqi Army barracks, Holbrook said the \n     living conditions were dingy and rundown, with no running \n     water or toilets. With temperatures climbing upward of 150 \n     degrees during the day and 110 degrees at\n\n[[Page S4895]]\n\n     night, he said they would actually get cold at night.\n       In a normal day he said they would go into a city and look \n     for insurgents. If found, they would try to eliminate them, \n     all while trying to protect and liberate the Iraqi people, \n     Holbrook said.\n       ``We slept when we could, ate when we could, and there \n     wasn't much time for a bath,'' Holbrook remembers.\n       Even though he was wounded in his first tour, receiving the \n     Purple Heart, he still went back for the second tour, \n     deployed for seven months each time. In addition to the \n     Purple Heart, he also received the National Defense Medal, \n     Iraqi Freedom Medal, Combat Action Medal, Sea Service \n     Deployment Ribbon and Global War on Terrorism Medal.\n       Holbrook said the hardest thing he had to deal with when he \n     returned to the States was coping with the loss of a friend, \n     who was killed during their first tour together.\n       Holbrook is married to Britani Holbrook, and has three \n     kids, Gavin, Austin and Bentley.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/24/senate-section/article/S4895-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JIM MORTIMER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to Jim \nMortimer. Mortimer hails from Magoffin County, KY, and served his \ncountry honorably over the course of his career with the Kentucky \nNational Guard.\n  After graduating from Castle Heights Military Academy in Tennessee, \nMortimer enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserves. Only 22 at the time, it \nwould be 30 years before he retired from the military.\n  In 1960, 2 years after enlisting, he was transferred to the Kentucky \nNational Guard. His experiences in the Guard ran the gamut from \nclearing out swamps in southern Georgia to riot control on the \nUniversity of Kentucky campus during the Vietnam war to responding to \nnatural disasters. It is this diverse range of service to our country \nthat epitomizes the National Guard motto--``Always Ready, Always \nThere.''\n  Mortimer retired from the Guard in 1988 with the rank of command \nsergeant major. In addition to his military service, he also took the \ntime to substitute teach in Lexington high schools and obtain his \nmasters from Georgetown College.\n  His service to this country is worthy of our praise here in the \nSenate--so, I ask that my colleagues join me in paying tribute to Mr. \nJim Mortimer.\n  The Salyersville Independent recently published an article detailing \nMortimer's military career. I ask unanimous consent that the full \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n           [From the Salyersville Independent, July 3, 2014]\n\n                    Mortimer Retires From the Guard\n\n                           (By Heather Oney)\n\n       Geared up early for a career in the military, Magoffin \n     native Jim Mortimer left Magoffin when he was 14 years old \n     and attended Castle Heights Military Academy, in Lebanon, \n     Tennessee. When he was 22 years old and with the draft \n     imminent, Mortimer joined the U.S. Army Reserves in \n     Sistersville, West Virginia, in 1958.\n       In 1960 he was transferred to the Kentucky National Guard \n     and was called to active duty during the Berlin Crisis in \n     1962.\n       Mortimer's unit replaced another unit that had been \n     deployed to Germany, taking their place at Fort Stewart, \n     Georgia, in charge of repairing vehicles and armament, as \n     well as various National Guard functions, he said, such as \n     riots and natural disasters.\n       While he was never sent overseas, he said the year he spent \n     in southern Georgia preparing to be deployed was his \n     strongest memory of his service.\n       For a year Mortimer said they lived in Quonset huts and \n     were tasked with clearing out swamps with saws and rakes, \n     cutting trees and brush along the way.\n       Also while he was at Fort Stewart, Mortimer said they had a \n     tornado and all the men got in their vehicles armored much \n     like tanks, while he and two other sergeants laid in the \n     ditch.\n       ``It was maybe a mile away,'' Mortimer laughed. ``Just lots \n     of wind.''\n       With an extremely flat terrain, he said lightning was a \n     problem there, with two of their soldiers hit. He remembers \n     one was near a radio and the lightning hit the antenna, \n     knocking him out of his boots.\n       During Desert Storm, Mortimer was sent to Frankfort, \n     working as a liaison aiding the dependents of the men at war.\n       During his 30 years of service, he worked at Fort Knox, \n     Kentucky; Fort Campbell, Kentucky-Tennessee border; Fort \n     Jackson, South Carolina; Fort Hood, Texas; and Fort Sill, \n     Oklahoma. Mortimer was involved in rifle marksmanship on the \n     Kentucky State Rifle Team, winning several awards. He had a \n     scout troop sponsored by the National Guard, as well.\n       In North Little Rock, Arkansas, he attended National Guard \n     matches, where Guards from all over sent teams to compete.\n       During active duty, Mortimer taught second lieutenants in \n     Officer Candidate School (OCS), as well as many other \n     courses, such as marksmanship and all weapons.\n       In 1965 he was called to deal with Vietnam War riots on the \n     University of Kentucky's campus, where students had burned \n     down the ROTC building.\n       Mortimer obtained the rank of command sergeant major in \n     1980, retiring from his employment with the Kentucky National \n     Guard and as a part-time soldier in 1988.\n       While in the Guard, Mortimer went to school, receiving a \n     degree in 1980. He began substitute teaching in Lexington \n     high schools while still in the service.\n       In 1973 he returned to Magoffin and started substitute \n     teaching in 1977 at the middle school and high school, where \n     he eventually retired from in 2000. In the meantime, he \n     received his masters from Georgetown College in 1982.\n       Mortimer is presently a member of the Salyersville Kiwanis \n     and works part-time with the Magoffin County Sheriff's \n     Office. He has a daughter and two sons, as well as six \n     grandchildren. His wife of 53 years, June, passed away in \n     2011. In 2013, he married Gail King Mortimer and the two sons \n     still live in Magoffin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/24/senate-section/article/S4895-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       RECOGNIZING ELIZABETHTOWN COMMUNITY AND TECHNICAL COLLEGE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise to commemorate the 50th \nanniversary of Elizabethtown Community and Technical College, ECTC, a \ncomprehensive community and technical college that has been serving the \ncentral Kentucky region since 1964. ECTC provides education and \ntraining to all types of Kentuckians to prepare them to succeed in a \nconstantly changing world.\n  ECTC is a member of the Kentucky Community and Technical College \nSystem. It provides accessible and affordable education and training \nthrough academic and technical associate degrees; diploma and \ncertificate programs in occupational fields; pre-baccalaureate \neducation; adult, continuing and developmental education; customized \ntraining for business and industry; and distance learning.\n  ECTC has its roots in the founding of the Elizabethtown Community \nCollege, which first opened its doors in 1964 to 355 students from 11 \ncounties. Meanwhile, Elizabethtown Technical College was founded in \n1965 through a bond issue by the Elizabethtown Independent School \nBoard. ECTC was formed by the consolidation of the two schools in 2004, \nfollowing historic legislation in 1997 that established the Kentucky \nCommunity and Technical College System.\n  For five decades, ECTC has enriched the lives of citizens by \nproviding access to quality, affordable academic, technical and \ncommunity education programs, and by partnering with communities to \nenhance the economic vitality of the region. A comprehensive college \nwith regional reach, ECTC now offers certificates, diplomas and \nassociate degrees through 34 academic and technical programs on the \nElizabethtown, Springfield, Leitchfield and Fort Knox campuses, and at \nextended campus sites throughout its 12-county service area.\n  Enrollment has grown steadily from 355 students in 1964 to 7,000 \ntoday, and thousands of alumni have distinguished themselves through \nservice to their professions and communities.\n  During the 2014-2015 academic year, the college will celebrate 50 \nyears of educational excellence and service to Kentuckians. I want to \nbe among the many who congratulate ECTC for 50 years of outstanding \nservice in education to the central Kentucky region. I want to commend \nthe school for 50 years of educating Kentuckians, and thank its \npresident/CEO, Dr. Thelma J.

Madam President, I wish to commemorate the 30th \nanniversary of Geraldine Ferraro's nomination as the Democratic \ncandidate for Vice President of the United States.\n  On the night of July 19, 1984, Gerry gave her acceptance speech as \nthe first woman to be nominated for U.S. Vice President by a majority \nparty. I was there, experiencing the thrill, excitement, and turbo \nenergy as 10,000 people\n\n[[Page S4896]]\n\njammed the Mosconi Center. Male delegates gave their tickets to female \nalternate delegates and their daughters. Gerry's walk on stage was \nelectrifying. We gave her a 10-minute resounding ovation and wouldn't \nsit down. That night, a barrier was broken. That night, they took down \nthe ``men only'' sign on the White House. For Gerry and all American \nwomen there was no turning back--only going forward.\n  Some people only knew Gerry as a political phenomenon, but I first \nknew her in Congress. She was a born fighter--for New York and every \nlittle guy and gal. She was an advocate for women, fighting for our \nstatus and giving us a new stature. Long after the campaign was over, \nshe continued to be a source of inspiration and empowerment.\n  When Gerry was chosen for the Vice Presidential nomination, she \nshowed modern American women what we had become and what we could be. \nWomen felt that if Gerry could go for the White House, we could go for \nanything. For some of us women, that meant going to Congress to make a \ndifference. Today, I know Gerry would be so proud of all we have \naccomplished. Back when we met in the House, we were the early birds. \nWe weren't afraid to ruffle some feathers, but we were in the minority. \nIn 1979, there were 16 women in the House: 11 Democrats and 5 \nRepublicans, and 2 women of color. Today, there are 79 women in the \nHouse: 60 Democrats, 19 Republicans, and 30 women of color. As the Dean \nof the Senate Women, I am proud we are 20 women strong in the Senate: \n16 Democrats and 4 Republicans. Together, we are changing the tide and \nchanging the tone.\n  We have had some amazing victories along the way. We increased breast \ncancer research funding at NIH by 750 percent to $657 million in fiscal \nyear 13. We increased childcare funding by 75 percent--$2.2 billion in \nfiscal year 14. We made sure good science included women by founding \nthe NIH Office of Research on Women's Health. The research from that \noffice has changed medical practices, reduced breast cancer by 15 \npercent, and saved lives a million at a time. This year, we celebrated \nthe fifth anniversary of the Lilly Ledbetter Act, which kept the \ncourthouse doors open for women to sue for discrimination. Last \nOctober, women on both sides of the aisle created the climate for \ncompromise that was crucial to ending the disastrous government \nshutdown.\n  We have had some amazing victories, but we still have more to do. The \nSenate women are fighting for women across America. We know women need \na raise to raise their families. That is why we are fighting for equal \npay for equal work and to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act. We are \nfighting for a better minimum wage because we know that a full-time job \nshouldn't mean full-time poverty. We are fighting for education that \nhelps our kids every step of the way. We want to give working families \npeace of mind and give children quality care for a brighter future. \nPassing my bipartisan child care and development block grant bill will \nbring affordable, accessible childcare to working families.\n  Women need a social safety net they can count on, at every age and in \nevery stage. That is why we are fighting so hard for seniors by saving \nMedicare from becoming a coupon and a promise. We are ensuring Social \nSecurity remains guaranteed, lifetime and inflation proof. We are also \nfighting for health care that is affordable and accessible, by passing \nthe Affordable Care Act to end gender discrimination in health care. I \nwas so proud when we passed my Mikulski preventive health amendment, so \nsimply being a woman is no longer a preexisting condition. We are \ntaking a stand against the Supreme Court decision that denies women \ncontraception and family planning, while valuing employer rights over \nemployee rights. And we are fighting to ensure the safety and education \nof women and girls around the world--whether they are in Nigeria, \nCentral America, or Afghanistan.\n  When Gerry took the stage at the 1984 Democratic Convention, she \nforever altered the course of history. For the rest of her life, she \nremained dedicated to empowering thousands of women in the United \nStates and around the world. Today, we honor her lasting legacy and her \nimpact on generations of women with a dream--and a desire to make a \ndifference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/24/senate-section/article/S4896-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4896-S4897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            STENNIS CENTER PROGRAM FOR CONGRESSIONAL INTERNS\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

This \n6-week program is designed to enhance their internship experience by \nproviding an inside look at how Congress works and a deeper \nappreciation for the role that Congress plays in our democracy. Each \nweek, the interns meet with senior congressional staff and other \nexperts to discuss issues such as the legislative process, power of the \npurse, separation of powers, the media and lobbying, foreign affairs, \nand more.\n  Interns are selected for this program based on their college record, \ncommunity service experience, and interest in a career in public \nservice.

I truly believe he was a natural born leader,'' \nsaid Henryetta football coach Kenny Speer. He was known for his \ntoughness. In high school one day, Coach Speer made him run lap after \nlap. All Tony had to do was say ``yes sir'' for the punishment to end. \n``I said, Tony, you say the two magic words to make you stop running. \nSo he looks at me and goes, `Si Senor,' '' said Coach Kenny Speer.\n  Tony joined the Navy on September 28, 2005, and graduated from boot \ncamp at Recruit Training Command, Great Lakes, IL, in December 2005. \nOther military assignments include Joint Forces Staff College in \nNorfolk, VA; Naval Dive and Salvage Training Center in Panama City, FL; \nNaval Explosive Ordnance Device School at Eglin Air Force Base, FL; and \nExplosive Ordnance Device Training and Evaluation Unit 1 in San Diego, \nCA.\n  He reported to Explosive Ordnance Disposal Mobile Unit Eight, \nSigonella, Sicily, in March 2008 and deployed to Afghanistan in March \n2009.\n  ``Petty Officer Randolph brought an incredible sense of youthful \nspirit, professionalism and dedication to this unit,'' said CDR Todd \nSiddall, commanding officer of EODMU 8. ``He will forever be remembered \nby his fellow Sailors as an example of true service to country and \nselfless sacrifice.''\n  Funeral services were held July 15, 2009, at First Baptist Church in \nHenryetta, OK, and he was laid to rest in Hillcrest Cemetery, Weleetka, \nOK.\n  ``He loved his friends.

Madam President, Friday, July 25, marks the 40th \nanniversary of the Legal Services Corporation, LSC. In 1974, Congress--\nwith bipartisan support, including that of President Nixon--established \nLSC to be a major source of funding for civil legal aid in this \ncountry. LSC is a private, nonprofit corporation, funded by Congress, \nwith the mission to ensure equal access to justice under law for all \nAmericans by providing civil legal assistance to those who otherwise \nwould be unable to afford it. LSC distributes nearly 94 percent of its \nannual Federal appropriations to 134 local legal aid programs, with \nnearly 800 offices serving every congressional district and U.S. \nterritories.\n  LSC-funded legal aid programs make a crucial difference to millions \nof Americans by assisting with the most basic civil legal needs, such \nas addressing matters involving safety, subsistence, and family \nstability. These low-income Americans are women seeking protection from \nabuse, mothers trying to obtain child support, families facing unlawful \nevictions or foreclosures that could leave them homeless, veterans \nseeking benefits duly earned, seniors defending against consumer scams, \nand individuals who have lost their jobs and need help in applying for \nunemployment compensation and other benefits.\n\n[[Page S4898]]\n\n  It is LSC-funded attorneys who help parents obtain and keep custody \nof their children, assist parents in enforcing child support payments \nand help women who are victims of domestic violence. In fact, three out \nof four legal aid clients are women, and legal aid programs identify \ndomestic violence as one of their top priorities.\n  I know firsthand the important work of the Legal Services \nCorporation. Before I was elected to Congress, I worked as a legal aid \nattorney in Polk County, IA. I experienced the challenges--and also the \nrewards--of representing people who otherwise would not have the legal \nassistance they deserve. And I developed a deep appreciation for the \nrole that legal aid attorneys play within our system of justice.\n  Investing in civil legal aid helps ensure that we have equal justice \nunder the law. That is a fundamental American value, and it is \nreflected both in the first line of our Constitution and in the closing \nwords of our Pledge of Allegiance. As former Justice Lewis Powell said: \n``Equal justice under law is not merely a caption on the facade of the \nSupreme Court building. It is perhaps the most inspiring ideal of our \nsociety . . . it is fundamental that justice should be the same, in \nsubstance and availability, without regard to economic status.''\n  Given the vital role played by LSC-funded attorneys, it is disturbing \nto note that more than 50 percent of eligible clients who seek \nassistance continue to be turned away because of lack of LSC program \nresources. With the growing number of Americans eligible for services \nand increased demand for legal services, the need for legal aid \nattorneys has never been greater. On this anniversary, I salute the \nLegal Services Corporation and LSC-funded attorneys for the vital work \nthey do every day on behalf of Americans who need qualified counsel. \nEvery day that a legal aid attorney protects the safety, security and \nhealth of our most vulnerable citizens, they bring this Nation closer \nto living up to its commitment to equal justice for all.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I wish to recognize the 40th \nanniversary of the Legal Services Corporation, LSC, which falls on \nFriday, July 25.\n  Established with bipartisan support in 1974, LSC is a private, \nnonprofit corporation funded by Congress that aims to provide access to \ncivil legal assistance to Americans who would otherwise be unable to \nafford it. LSC is a major source of funding for civil legal aid in this \ncountry and distributes over 90 percent of its annual Federal \nappropriation to over 130 local legal aid programs and close to 800 \noffices across every congressional district and territory.\n  Millions of Americans rely upon LSC-funded programs each year for \nhelp with their most basic civil legal needs. Every day, LSC-funded \nprograms help low-income individuals and families fight illegal \nevictions, safeguard their financial health, and secure their veterans \nbenefits. In my home State of Washington, LSC-backed programs have been \nhelping survivors of the Oso mudslide get back up on their feet and \nrebuild their lives.\n  LSC-funded services are especially important for women across the \ncountry. Over 70 percent of legal aid clients are women and one-third \nof LSC-eligible cases involve family law issues such as domestic abuse, \nchild support, and child custody.\n  Today, the need for LSC-supported programs and attorneys has never \nbeen greater. According to the Census Bureau, nearly one in five \nAmericans qualifies for LSC-funded services. Yet recent studies show \nthat due to financial constraints legal aid offices are forced to turn \naway more than half of the eligible individuals coming to them for \nhelp. As we mark this anniversary, I applaud the efforts of LSC, the \nprograms and services funded by the corporation, and ask that we commit \nourselves to ensuring that Americans of all backgrounds have access to \nadequate legal services. LSC is essential to protecting the lives and \nliberty of the most vulnerable Americans. We are a better nation for \nits 40 years of service and advocacy on their behalf.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, July 25, 2014, marks the 40th \nanniversary of the Legal Services Corporation (LSC). With bipartisan \nsupport, including that of President Nixon, LSC was established in 1974 \nas a private, nonprofit corporation, funded by Congress, with the \nmission to ensure equal access to justice under law for all Americans \nby providing civil legal assistance to those who otherwise would be \nunable to afford it. LSC distributes nearly 94 percent of its annual \nFederal appropriations to 134 local legal aid programs and has nearly \n800 offices that serve each of the 435 congressional districts and the \nU.S. territories.\n  LSC-funded legal aid programs make a crucial difference to millions \nof Americans by assisting with the most basic civil legal needs, such \nas helping women get protection from abuse, mothers to obtain child \nsupport, families from unlawful evictions or foreclosures that could \nleave them homeless, veterans seeking benefits duly earned, defending \nseniors against consumer scams, and individuals who have lost their \njobs and need help in applying for unemployment compensation and other \nbenefits. In my home State, more than 25 percent of the population is \neligible for LSC-funded legal services. The three programs funded by \nLSC served nearly 40,000 Louisianians and closed nearly 16,000 cases \nlast year.\n  On this 40th anniversary, I congratulate and commend the Legal \nServices Corporation for the vital work they do every day on behalf of \nAmericans who need qualified counsel. With the growing number of \nAmericans eligible for services and increased demand for legal \nservices, the need for legal aid attorneys has never been greater. \nEvery day that a legal aid attorney protects the safety, security, and \nhealth of our most vulnerable citizens, they bring this Nation closer \nto living up to its commitment to equal justice for all.\n  Mr. KING. Madam President, Friday, July 25, marks the 40th \nanniversary of the Legal Services Corporation (LSC). In 1974, \nCongress--with bipartisan support, including that of President Nixon--\nestablished LSC to be a major source of funding for civil legal aid in \nthis country. LSC is a private, nonprofit corporation, funded by \nCongress, with the mission to ensure equal access to justice under law \nfor all Americans by providing civil legal assistance to those who \notherwise would be unable to afford it. LSC distributes nearly 94 \npercent of its annual Federal appropriations to 134 local legal aid \nprograms, with nearly 800 offices serving every congressional district \nand U.S. territories.\n  LSC-funded legal aid programs make a crucial difference to millions \nof Americans by assisting with the most basic civil legal needs, such \nas addressing matters involving safety, subsistence, and family \nstability.

In fact, three out \nof four legal aid clients are women, and legal aid programs identify \ndomestic violence as one of their top priorities. LSC-funded attorneys \nprovide critical legal services that would otherwise be unavailable.\n  In fact, I began my career as one of these attorneys. Beginning in \n1969, I worked in Skowhegan, ME for a legal services provider called \nPine Tree Legal Assistance. Although my time predated LSC, today Pine \nTree is funded by LSC and continues to provide high-quality legal \nservices to those in most need. I learned firsthand during this period \nthat the work of LSC attorneys is a critical element of making real the \npromise of our country to our disadvantaged and disenfranchised \ncitizens.\n  Given the vital role played by LSC-funded attorneys, we need to do \nbetter than turn away more than 50 percent of eligible clients who seek \nassistance because of lack of LSC program resources. With the growing \nnumber of Americans eligible for services and increased demand for \nlegal services, the need for legal aid attorneys has never been \ngreater. On this anniversary, I salute the Legal Services Corporation\n\n[[Page S4899]]\n\nand LSC-funded attorneys for the vital work they do every day on behalf \nof Americans who need qualified counsel.

He has \nbeen asked to serve as the new forest supervisor with the Medicine Bow-\nRoutt National Forest\n\n[[Page S4900]]\n\nand will shortly be assuming those duties. I want to recognize him for \nthe exceptional service and leadership he has provided in working for \nthe Black Hills of my Home State of South Dakota.\n  A graduate of St. Mary's High School, Bismarck, ND, Jaeger earned a \nbachelor of science degree in civil engineering from the United States \nMilitary Academy at West Point, NY, in 1982. He served 7 years Active \nDuty in the U.S. Army and retired from the South Dakota Army National \nGuard in 2010 as a lieutenant colonel.\n  Jaeger started his Forest Service career as a civil engineer on the \nRio Grande National Forest in Monte Vista, CO, followed by working as \ndistrict engineer on the Medicine Bow-Routt National Forests and \nThunder Basin National Grasslands on the Douglas Ranger District in \nWyoming. In 1996 he became the works program officer for the Angell Job \nCorps in Yachats, OR, and in 1998 was selected as the center director \nof the Boxelder Job Corps Center in Nemo, SD. In 2007 Mr. Jaeger \nassumed the duties as the deputy forest supervisor for the Black Hills \nNational Forest of South Dakota and Wyoming.\n  Jaeger is an avid skier, hiker, and enjoys mountain biking. He and \nhis wife Carole have three wonderful children.\n  There have been a number of key accomplishments on the Black Hills \nNational Forest that Jaeger has helped facilitate, including guiding \nthe successful merger of the Tribal Youth Natural Resources Crew with \nthe Boxelder Job Corps Center Crew to become the Youth Natural \nResources, YNR, Crew. The YNR Crew is much better organized, provides \nunique work training and education, remains very diverse and \nproductive, and improves the land. The YNR Crew received a Regional \nForester's Honor Award in 2013. Dennis, as a key member of the Forest \nLeadership Team, helps guide one of the largest forest restoration \nprograms in the United States. The Black Hills Forest received the \nRegional Forester's Honor Award for its timber program in 2013 and the \nChief's Honor Award in 2013 for its Mountain Pine Beetle Response \nProject.\n  Dennis has served as the Agency Administrator on two very large and \ncomplex fires in 2012, White Draw and Myrtle. Dennis interacted \nprofessionally with several Federal, State, and county cooperators and \nthe National Guard and private citizens under very difficult \ncircumstances.\n  Dennis is known for his positive, ``can do'' attitude, his \noutstanding customer service, and his passion for the Forest Service \nmission and the well-being of employees and the public he serves. He is \nhighly visible and respected by the Federal delegation, tribes, the \nNational Forest Advisory Board, State officials and many stakeholders.\n  I am proud to recognize and honor Dennis' service to the U.S. Forest \nService and am delighted to join with his family and friends in \ncongratulating him on this promotion to forest supervisor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/24/senate-section/article/S4900-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING LANCE HOWARD TURNER\n\n Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity \nto pay tribute to a great Utahn and patriot, Lance Howard Turner. Lance \npassed from this life on Monday last, and his family and friends will \ndearly miss him.\n  There is a beautiful painting hanging on the wall of the Rex E. Lee \nconference room in my office. It is a painting of a majestic landscape \nin the Southwestern portion of United States painted by Lance Turner. \nThis painting shows the beauty of the land that he loved so dearly and \ndemonstrates the mastery developed over a lifetime of hard work.\n  During his career, Lance was able to take part in and lead many \nsuccessful programs. One such program, well known to all, involves a \ntalking bear that helps campers keep our forests safe. In 2009, KSL, a \nUtah news station, ran a story on Lance, who was the art director at \nFoote, Cone & Belding in the 1950s. Lance was tasked with marketing the \nnewly created Smokey Bear, whose mission was to reduce manmade forest \nfires. The campaign was a success and remains the longest running PSA \ncampaign in our country's history. Smokey Bear also remains a highly \nrecognized American character and continues his original mission of \nencouraging fire safety.\n  More important than any success in his professional life, Lance was a \ngood husband and father who, according to his children, was always \nwilling to share the wisdom he had gained through a life of service. He \nwas a faithful member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day \nSaints and made sure to always take care of those in need. He loved to \nhunt pheasants and had a deep love for this country.\n  I offer my heartfelt condolences to his children, Heidi, Josh, Chip, \nand Matt, and his 14 grandchildren and 22 grandchildren.

Madam President, it is with a heavy heart that I \npay tribute to a young New Jersey police officer who gave his life in \nthe line of duty on Sunday, July 13.\n  Officer Melvin Santiago was born and raised in Jersey City, New \nJersey's second largest city. As a child, he dreamed of following in \nthe footsteps of his uncle, an officer in the city's police department. \nThat dream came true last December, when he graduated from the police \nacademy, and it ended tragically early Sunday morning, when he was \nambushed and killed in the line of duty while responding to a call. He \nwas only 23 years old.\n  Officer Santiago is described by his friends and family as having \nbeen full of life, with an easy smile and a gift for making others \nlaugh. He is a source of pride for his parents, mother Cathy and \nstepfather Alex, and a role model for his younger brother and cousins. \nOfficer Santiago was committed to being the best police officer he \ncould be, and he quickly earned the respect of his fellow officers by \nvolunteering to work in the West District--one of Jersey City's \ntoughest neighborhoods--because he wanted to serve where he was most \nneeded. According to his family, he savored every moment of the last 7 \nmonths, thrilled to be doing what he loved.\n  Officer Santiago's courage, spirit of service, and commitment to his \ncommunity will be long remembered by those he protected and for whom he \ngave his life. As we recognize Officer Santiago's tremendous sacrifice, \nI ask that the Senate join with this courageous officer's family, \nfriends, fellow Jersey City Police Department personnel, the Jersey \nCity community, and the State of New Jersey in mourning the loss of \nthis extraordinary young man.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/24/senate-section/article/S4900-3", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4900-S4901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING CHRISTOPHER GOODELL\n\n Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, it is with great sadness that I \npay tribute to a New Jersey police officer who tragically lost his life \nin the line of duty last week.\n  Officer Christopher Goodell, a lifelong resident of the Borough of \nWaldwick, NJ, was killed when his patrol car was struck by a tractor-\ntrailer early Thursday morning, July 17. He was 32 years old and will \nbe greatly missed by all who knew him.\n  Officer Goodell is described by friends and colleagues as having been \nfriendly to everyone he met, with a gift for comedy and a kind heart. \nHe was also long-committed to serving others. He joined the Marine \nCorps in the wake of September 11, 2001, earning several medals and \ncommendations for his service in Iraq, including the Air Medal and two \nHumanitarian Service Medals. Upon his return, Officer Goodell never \nstopped serving--first as a dispatcher for the Waldwick Police \nDepartment, and later as a police officer.\n  Officer Goodell embraced the responsibilities that came with being a \npolice officer, and he cherished the opportunity to protect and serve \nthe town\n\n[[Page S4901]]\n\nthat helped raise him. He was a role model for children in the \ncommunity, and he always took the time to speak with students at the \nlocal high school about staying on the right track. Officer Goodell was \neager to help others, from working to make our streets safer to once \nassisting a man who had collapsed at his gym. Simply put, his \ndedication saved lives.\n  Officer Goodell is mourned by his father Mark, his mother Patricia, \nhis fiancee Jillian, his sister Nicole, his niece and nephew, a large \nextended family, many friends and neighbors, fellow Waldwick Police \nDepartment personnel, the Borough of Waldwick, and the entire State of \nNew Jersey. His spirit of service and his dedication to his community \nand to our Nation will be long remembered by those he protected and \nserved. I ask my colleagues in the Senate to please join me in honoring \nthis remarkable young police officer and marine, and in recognizing his \ntremendous service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/24/senate-section/article/S4901-1", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING VETERANS SUPPORT NETWORK\n\n Mr. HELLER. Madam President, I wish to recognize a veterans \neducation program within Las Vegas known as Veterans Support Network \nfor its continued dedication to helping its fellow servicemembers gain \ntraining and certifications that will assist them in becoming self-\nsufficient. This unique program works to improve the lives of disabled, \nvisually impaired, and homeless veterans by providing educational \nclasses and trainings, funding for on-the-job training, as well as \nprofessional talking books and Braille books to assist those with \ndisabilities.\n  The brave men and women who served the United States and fought to \nprotect our freedom have often come home to a struggling economy. A \nnumber of veterans are unable to find a job or afford to buy or rent a \nhome. As the demographics of our Armed Forces have changed throughout \nthe years, so too have the needs of homeless veterans. As a member of \nthe Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, this is an issue I have been \npersonally involved with and have introduced legislation to address. \nOrganizations like the Veterans Support Network serve to help those in \nneed in the Las Vegas community. This organization is a shining example \nof the kind of initiatives that will help to get our veterans off of \nthe streets.\n  There is no way to adequately thank the men and women that lay down \ntheir lives for our freedoms, but the founders and volunteers at the \nVeterans Support Network are working to assist our Nation's veterans by \ngiving them the opportunity to start a new career. The organization was \nfounded by Ed Manley, a brave veteran who has selflessly been working \ntoward the betterment of the homeless veteran community by teaching \ncertification classes and working tirelessly to find funds to assist \nthe homeless and wounded veterans within the community. This \norganization's continued dedication to serving veterans needing to \nlearn new skills, build resume experience and earn wages through work \nassistance programs is commendable.\n  As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I know the \nstruggles that our veterans face after returning home from the \nbattlefield. Congress has a responsibility not only to honor these \nbrave individuals, but to ensure they receive the quality care they \nhave earned and deserve. I remain committed to upholding this promise \nfor our veterans and servicemembers in Nevada and throughout the \nNation. I am very pleased that veterans service organizations like the \nVeterans Support Network are committed to ensuring that the needs of \nour veterans are being met.\n  Today, I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in recognizing \nthe Veterans Support Network, an organization whose mission is both \nnoble and charitable. I am both humbled and honored to recognize the \nVeteran's Support Network's mission of providing veterans with the \nskills that will allow them the opportunity to change their \ncircumstances. This organization's commitment to helping struggling \nveterans get back on their feet is admirable, and I wish them the best \nof luck in all of their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/07/24/senate-section/article/S4901-2", "month": "07", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TEXT OF AN AMENDMENT TO THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE \n UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED KINGDOM OF \n   GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND FOR COOPERATION ON THE USES OF \nATOMIC ENERGY FOR MUTUAL DEFENSE PURPOSES OF JULY 3, 1958, AS AMENDED--\n                                 PM 51\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit to the Congress, pursuant to section 123 d. \nof the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, the text of an amendment \n(the ``Amendment'') to the Agreement Between the Government of the \nUnited States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of \nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland for Cooperation on the Uses of \nAtomic Energy for Mutual Defense Purposes of July 3, 1958, as amended \n(the ``1958 Agreement'').

The joint classified letter \nand classified portions of the Amendment are being transmitted \nseparately via appropriate channels.\n  The Amendment extends for 10 years (until December 31, 2024), \nprovisions of the 1958 Agreement that permit the transfer between the \nUnited States and the United Kingdom of classified information \nconcerning atomic weapons; nuclear technology and controlled nuclear \ninformation; material and equipment for the development of defense \nplans; training of personnel; evaluation of potential enemy capability; \ndevelopment of delivery systems; and the research, development, and \ndesign of military reactors.

A bill to amend the definition of ``homeless person'' under \nthe McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act to include certain homeless \nchildren and youth, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce bipartisan \nlegislation with my colleagues Senator Portman and Senator Begich that \nwould expand the definition of ``homeless'' used by the U.S. Department \nof Housing and Urban Development, HUD, to ensure all homeless children \nand families are eligible for existing Federal homeless assistance \nprograms.\n  According to the U.S. Department of Education, approximately 1.1 \nmillion children were homeless during the 2011-2012 school year; this \nis a 24 percent increase from the 939,903 homeless students enrolled in \nthe 2009-2010 school year.\n  In California, nearly 250,000 children experienced homelessness last \nyear, up from 220,000 in 2010 and nearly four times the 65,000 homeless \nchildren in the State in 2003.\n  Unfortunately, the numbers reported by the HUD ``Point-in-Time \nCount'' fail to reflect these increasing numbers.\n  According to the 2012 HUD ``Point-in-Time Count,'' there were only \n247,178 people counted as homeless in households that included \nchildren, a fraction of the true number.\n  This is important because only those children counted by HUD are \neligible for vital homeless assistance programs. The rest of these \nchildren and families are simply out of luck.\n  The Homeless Children and Youth Act of 2014 would expand the homeless \ndefinition to allow HUD homeless assistance programs to serve extremely \nvulnerable children and families, specifically those staying in motels \nor in doubled up situations because they have nowhere else to go.\n  These families are especially susceptible to abuse and trafficking \nbecause they are often not served by a case manager, and thus remain \nhidden from potential social service providers.\n  As a result of the current narrow HUD definition, communities that \nreceive federal funding through the competitive application process are \nunable to prioritize or direct resources to help these children and \nfamilies.\n  This bill would provide communities with the flexibility to use \nfederal funds to meet local priorities.\n  I would note that the bill comes at no cost to taxpayers and does not \nimpose any new mandates on service providers.\n  Finally, this legislation improves data collection transparency by \nrequiring HUD to report data on homeless individuals and families \ncurrently recorded under the existing Homeless Management Information \nSystem survey.\n  I am pleased that Senators Rob Portman and Mark Begich have joined me \nas original cosponsors on this bill.-\n  Homelessness continues to plague our nation. If we fail to address \nthe needs of these children and families today, they will remain stuck \nin a cycle of poverty and chronic homelessness.\n  It is our moral obligation to ensure that we do not erect more \nbarriers for these children and families to access services when they \nare experiencing extreme hardship. I believe this bill is a commonsense \nsolution that will ensure that homeless families and children can \nreceive the help they need.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2653\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prioritize funding for the National Institutes of \nHealth to discover treatments and cures, to maintain global leadership \nin medical innovation, and to restore the purchasing power the NIH had \nafter the historic doubling campaign that ended in fiscal year 2003; to \nthe Committee on the Budget.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, last year, 2013, marked the 10-year \nanniversary of the completion of the historic campaign to double \nfunding for the National Institutes of Health.\n  Beginning in fiscal year 1998, I worked with Congressman John Porter \nand Senator Arlen Specter in our leadership roles on the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and \nRelated Agencies. In that year, 1998, funding for the National \nInstitutes of Health was $13 billion. By fiscal year 2003, we had \nincreased NIH funding to $27 billion. We doubled funding in 5 years. We \nsaid we were, and we laid out a plan under both Republican and \nDemocratic administrations and we got it done. That was a historic \nmilestone for biomedical research in the United States.\n  Truly, increasing our Nation's investment in NIH was a bold statement \nof our Nation's commitment to retaining our standing as the undisputed \nworld leader in biomedical research, and we have reaped extraordinary \nbenefits from that investment. We reaped benefits in terms of new \ntreatments, new diagnostics, and the new jobs and economic growth that \nbiomedical research brings.\n  But where does NIH stand today, 10 years after the historic doubling \nof funding for biomedical research, which did so much to advance \nAmerica's economy and our standing in the world? Where are we today? \nSadly, as this chart illustrates, we have been falling behind.\n  So here we are. We got back up to where we should be by doubling the \nfunding. Since that time, it has basically leveled off. We are now \nshort about $8 billion below where we would be if we had just kept up \nwith inflation. So NIH has lost about 20 percent of its purchasing \npower from that time. Success rates for applicants fell from the \ntraditional range of 25 to 35 percent to just 16 percent last year, \n2013. Promising research was not funded, and many young scientists had \nno choice but to find other occupations. This has had profoundly \nnegative consequences. Our biomedical pipeline is clearly showing the \nnegative effects.\n  So today I am introducing a bill that allows us to find common \nground, on a bipartisan basis, to jump-start our reinvestment in the \nNational Institutes of Health and ensure America's leadership in \nbiomedical research.\n  Republicans and Democrats may disagree on what level of revenue is \nappropriate. We disagree about the value of investing in education in \norder to build a stronger workforce. But I have yet to hear any Senator \nwho disagrees with my view that Federal investments in biomedical \nresearch are good for the economy and good for our country.\n  As the chairman of the appropriations subcommittee that funds NIH, I \nget letters from Senators every year requesting support for research \nprograms, so I can speak with authority when I say the majority of \nSenators--from both parties--believe we should be investing more \nstrongly in NIH. That is exactly the aim of the bill I am introducing \ntoday. The Accelerating Biomedical Research Act makes NIH a priority in \nour national budget process by creating a budget cap adjustment for the \nNational Institutes of Health. This bill will put a plan in place for \nthe Appropriations Committee to reverse the 10-year retrenchment in \nbiomedical research funding over the remaining years of the Budget \nControl Act.\n  Importantly, the Accelerating Biomedical Research Act is not an \nappropriation. It is not a mandatory trust fund. It is not a tax \ncredit. The bill that I am introducing does not score for CBO purposes \nbecause it does not spend any money now. I am always hearing that we \nshould have a robust debate on the budget and our spending priorities \nas a country. So this bill starts that debate. I invite Senators to \ncosponsor this bill if they believe, as I do, that we should change our \nbudget to allow for biomedical research to grow in the United States.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of the organizations who have \nendorsed this bill be entered into the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  I believe we must do this. I believe we must do this to save lives \nand to improve the health of the American people. I also believe we \nmust do it because we know that investing in biomedical research \ncreates jobs and spurs the economy.\n  Some may say that changing the budget allows for more spending so it \nshould be offset by cuts to other programs. Well, to that I say there \ncan be little doubt that NIH funding abundantly pays for itself in \nexpanded economic activity. Respected economists have studied this, and \nthey have estimated that each dollar of investment in the National \nInstitutes of Health generates anywhere from $1.80 to $3.20 in economic \noutput.\n\n  Let me take just one vivid example of the payoffs from our Federal \ninvestments in biomedical research.\n  In 2003 NIH completed the Human Genome Project started about 13 years \nearlier. In total, the Federal Government invested $3.4 billion of \ntaxpayers' money in sequencing the human genome. That project has had a \ntruly staggering economic impact. As of 2012, it had generated $965 \nbillion in economic activity, personal income exceeding $293 billion, \nand more than 4.3 million job-years of employment. For every dollar our \ngovernment spent on the Human Genome Project, America has reaped $178 \nin economic benefits--for every dollar we invest. And this is just the \neconomic impact. The positive impact in terms of cures discovered and \nlives saved is incalculable.\n  But research doesn't have to launch an entire industry to contribute \nsignificantly to our economy as the Human Genome Project did. I will \ngive an example from my home State.\n  Dr. Joseph Walder, a researcher at the University of Iowa, received a \n$5.7 million research grant many years ago from the National Heart, \nLung, and Blood Institute. In the course of his research, he developed \nsynthetic DNA and RNA technology. Realizing that\n\n[[Page S4907]]\n\nthis was a valuable research tool, Dr. Walder launched a company called \nIntegrated DNA Technologies in 1987. Out of a $5.7 million Federal \ninvestment came a company with $100 million in annual sales, employing \n650 people.\n  Now, if the creation of all of these companies and products and jobs \nisn't enough of a reason to expect that this bill will boost the \neconomy and lower the Federal deficit, I have another reason. One of \nthe principal missions of biomedical research is to reduce and improve \nchronic diseases and health conditions that are a major factor in \ndriving deficit spending. In 2006, economists found that a future 1-\npercent reduction in mortality rates from cancer would save $500 \nbillion to current and future Americans. A cure for cancer was \nestimated to save $50 trillion to Americans in future expenditures.\n  Recent estimates indicate the economic cost of Alzheimer's disease is \nover $200 billion a year. That is going to rise to over $1 trillion a \nyear by 2050 unless a prevention or cure is found. The Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention reports that annual costs from \nundiagnosed diabetes are about $245 billion a year. And a recent study \nprojects that, by 2030, nearly 45 percent of the United States \npopulation will face some form of cardiovascular disease, costing a \ntotal of $1.2 trillion between now and 2030.\n  I could go on and on with examples and studies, but no matter what I \nsay, some will say we can't afford this bill. But we can't afford not \nto do this. The status quo confronts our Nation with what those in the \nmilitary call a ``clear and present danger.''\n  The United States has been the global leader in research, but that \nstanding is now in jeopardy. While the United States has been \nretrenching in biomedical research, other countries, including China, \nIndia, and Singapore, have been redoubling their investments and \nsurging forward. Of the 10 leading countries in the field of scientific \nresearch, the United States is the only one that has reduced its \ninvestment in scientific research.\n  Let me repeat that. Of the 10 leading countries in the world in the \nfield of scientific research, the United States is the only one that \nhas reduced its investment in scientific research.\n  According to an NIH study:\n\n       Other countries are investing more in biomedical research \n     relative to the size of their economies. When it comes to \n     government funding for pharmaceutical industry-performed \n     research, Korea's government provides seven times more \n     funding as a share of GDP than does the United States, while \n     Singapore and Taiwan provide five and three times as much, \n     respectively. France and the United Kingdom also provide more \n     than the US, as a share of their economies.\n\n  This chart here vividly shows what has been happening in research \ninvestment just since 2011 as a percent of GDP: China, Brazil, South \nKorea, India, UK, France, Japan, Germany, and Russia are increasing. In \nthe United States we are going in the wrong direction.\n  Dr. Francis Collins, Director of NIH, testified before my \nsubcommittee about the ambitious investments of America's rivals. He \nsaid this:\n\n       China has made policy changes to invest heavily in the life \n     sciences industry, moving [China] closer to becoming a world \n     leader in science and technology by the end of the decade. \n     Over the past decade, Singapore has also pursued a \n     prominent role as a global leader in the life sciences. \n     For example, their pharmaceutical industry R funding was \n     five times greater than that of the United States in 2009 \n     as a share of GDP.\n\n  I will say one more thing about China's ambitious plans. China has \nidentified biotechnology as one of seven key ``strategic and emerging \npillar'' industries. They have pledged to invest $308.5 billion in \nbiotechnology over the next 5 years. By contrast, the U.S. investment \nover the same period of time will be roughly $160 billion, just about \nhalf of what China is doing.\n  It is a shocking and disturbing fact that, if current trends \ncontinue, the U.S. Government's investment in life sciences research as \na share of GDP will soon be about one quarter of what China is doing.\n  According to the NIH, China already has more gene sequencing capacity \nthan the entire United States, and they have about one third of global \ncapacity.\n  Imagine that. We are the ones that mapped and sequenced the entire \nhuman genome. We are the ones that put the $3.6 billion into that. We \nreaped some rewards and benefits--as I just said--but right now China \nhas more gene sequencing capacity than we do. That, again, illustrates \nmy point that they are moving ahead and we have sort of slowed down and \nstopped, resting on our laurels, so to speak.\n  The budget caps enacted by Congress are forcing disinvestments in a \nwhole range of priorities that are the key to our Nation's prosperity. \nThese disinvestments are having devastating impacts across our \neconomy--lower growth and fewer jobs.\n  Again, I appreciate there are honest disagreements about the \nappropriate levels of investment in education, job training, and other \ndomestic priorities. But from countless conversations with Senators \nfrom both parties, there seems to be one area of broad agreement, and \nthat is that we should invest robustly in the National Institutes of \nHealth. And that is why I have introduced this bill today. It is time \nfor us on a bipartisan basis to reverse this erosion of support for \nbiomedical research to ensure America's standing as a world leader in \nthis field. This is what we are talking about, a discretionary cap \nadjustment. That is what our bill would do to allow NIH to make up for \nlost ground.\n\n  Here is what is happening. We are about $8 billion behind. By \nproviding a budget cap adjustment we can close this gap by 2021 and \nbring it up to where it should be if we could allow for increases due \nto inflation. Quite frankly, I guess I could argue we have to do even \nmore than that, but this is the minimum we ought to do, a minimum to \nclose the gap in biomedical research.\n  We have to do this for the health of our people, our economy, and our \nFederal budget.

Res. 519\n\n       Whereas the members of the airborne forces of the Armed \n     Forces of the United States have a long and honorable history \n     as bold and fierce warriors who, for the national security of \n     the United States and the defense of freedom and peace, \n     project the ground combat power of the United States by air \n     transport to the far reaches of the battle area and to the \n     far corners of the world;\n       Whereas the experiment of the United States with airborne \n     operations began on June 25, 1940, when the Army Parachute \n     Test Platoon was first authorized by the Department of War, \n     and 48 volunteers began training in July 1940;\n       Whereas August 16 marks the anniversary of the first \n     official Army parachute jump,\n\n[[Page S4909]]\n\n     which took place on August 16, 1940, to test the innovative \n     concept of inserting United States ground combat forces \n     behind a battle line by means of a parachute;\n       Whereas the success of the Army Parachute Test Platoon in \n     the days immediately before the entry of the United States \n     into World War II validated the airborne operational concept \n     and led to the creation of a formidable force of airborne \n     formations that included the 11th, 13th, 17th, 82nd, and \n     101st Airborne Divisions;\n       Whereas, included in those divisions, and among other \n     separate formations, were many airborne combat, combat \n     support, and combat service support units that served with \n     distinction and achieved repeated success in armed \n     hostilities during World War II;\n       Whereas the achievements of the airborne units during World \n     War II prompted the evolution of those units into a \n     diversified force of parachute and air-assault units that, \n     over the years, have fought in Korea, Vietnam, Grenada, \n     Panama, the Persian Gulf region, and Somalia, and have \n     engaged in peacekeeping operations in Lebanon, the Sinai \n     Peninsula, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo;\n       Whereas, since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, \n     the members of the United States airborne forces, including \n     members of the XVIII Airborne Corps, the 82nd Airborne \n     Division, the 101st Airborne Division, the 173rd Airborne \n     Brigade Combat Team, the 4th Brigade Combat Team (Airborne) \n     of the 25th Infantry Division, the 75th Ranger Regiment, \n     special operations forces of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, \n     and Air Force, and other units of the Armed Forces, have \n     demonstrated bravery and honor in combat, stability, and \n     training operations in Afghanistan and Iraq;\n       Whereas the modern-day airborne forces also include other \n     elite forces composed of airborne trained and qualified \n     special operations warriors, including Army Special Forces, \n     Marine Corps Reconnaissance units, Navy SEALs, and Air Force \n     combat control and pararescue teams;\n       Whereas, of the members and former members of the United \n     States airborne forces, thousands have achieved the \n     distinction of making combat jumps, dozens have earned the \n     Medal of Honor, and hundreds have earned the Distinguished \n     Service Cross, the Silver Star, or other decorations and \n     awards for displays of heroism, gallantry, intrepidity, and \n     valor;\n       Whereas the members and former members of the United States \n     airborne forces are all members of a proud and honorable \n     tradition that, together with the special skills and \n     achievements of those members, distinguishes the members as \n     intrepid combat parachutists, air assault forces, special \n     operation forces, and, in the past, glider troops;\n       Whereas individuals from every State of the United States \n     have served gallantly in the airborne forces, and each State \n     is proud of the contributions of its paratrooper veterans \n     during the many conflicts faced by the United States;\n       Whereas the history and achievements of the members and \n     former members of the United States airborne forces warrant \n     special expressions of the gratitude of the people of the \n     United States;

SOUND REGULATION ACT.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Sound \n     Regulation Act of 2014''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Growing Federal regulation that is highly prescriptive \n     in nature burdens and impairs the international \n     competitiveness of industry in the United States.\n       (2) Prescriptive regulation takes away flexibility, is \n     adversarial in nature, leads to unintended consequences, and, \n     especially as it proliferates, slows economic growth and job \n     creation.\n       (3) Despite evidence of increasing regulatory costs, \n     Federal agencies hold fast to the presumption that their \n     rules are in the public interest.\n       (4) Some statutes prohibit agencies from considering costs \n     and benefits in rulemaking, although no statutes prohibit \n     agencies from analyzing the costs and benefits of rules for \n     informative purposes.\n       (5)(A) Cost-benefit analysis is not institutionalized for \n     independent regulatory agencies.\n       (B) Executive agencies perform cost-benefit analysis \n     pursuant to Executive order and under the purview of the \n     Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (commonly \n     referred to as ``OIRA''), which takes direction from the \n     President.\n       (C) Peer review is not required for cost-benefit analysis \n     by independent regulatory agencies or executive agencies.\n       (6) There are no--\n       (A) statutory standards for cost-benefit analysis in \n     Federal rulemaking; or\n       (B) consistent, material consequences when rules are based \n     on faulty or inadequate analysis.\n       (7) Agencies--\n       (A) conduct their own regulatory impact analysis--\n       (i) largely by methods of their own choosing; and\n       (ii) only on a small fraction of the rules they issue; and\n       (B) use regulatory cost-benefit analysis mainly in support \n     of favored, preconceived rules rather than as a decision \n     tool.\n       (8) Common deficiencies in the regulatory analysis used by \n     agencies include--\n       (A) lack of a coherent theory by which to--\n       (i) define a problem;\n       (ii) determine why the problem occurs; and\n       (iii) guide the agency to the most efficient response;\n       (B) lack of objective evidence that an actionable problem \n     actually exists, what its dimensions are, and how they differ \n     from acceptable norms;\n       (C) lack of comprehensive analysis to--\n       (i) determine whether a market malfunction exists; and\n       (ii) orient rulemaking to the causes, not the symptoms, of \n     the market malfunction;\n       (D) failure to set clear and realistic objectives whose \n     benefits justify the cost of achieving the objectives;\n       (E) objectives that--\n       (i) are disconnected from costs; and\n       (ii) may be expansive and vague so that any regulation can \n     be made to appear beneficial;\n       (F) agencies increasingly claiming--\n       (i) incidental benefits (also know as ``co-benefits'') that \n     are not in furtherance of the stated objective; and\n       (ii) even private, as opposed to public, benefits for \n     rules;\n\n[[Page S4920]]\n\n       (G) failure to--\n       (i) develop regulatory options in light of market analysis; \n     and\n       (ii) rank regulatory options by how efficiently they will \n     improve the market process;\n       (H) inconsistent assumptions and methodologies across \n     agencies;\n       (I) invalid baselines for gauging regulatory effects;\n       (J) the omission of important impacts, such as the impact \n     on employment and on the international competitiveness of \n     United States firms;\n       (K) failure to reevaluate regulations after implementation; \n     and\n       (L) failure to consider the cumulative costs of regulation \n     by the various Federal, State, local, and tribal agencies.\n       (9)(A) Despite continually changing market conditions, \n     agencies do not--\n       (i) regularly review their existing regulations and \n     regulatory regimes; or\n       (ii) review the division of functions--\n       (I) among different Federal agencies; or\n       (II) among Federal, State, local, and tribal agencies.\n       (B) Regulations lose their purpose, yet linger and \n     accumulate, imposing unnecessary costs and slowing economic \n     growth to the detriment of--\n       (i) material living standards; and,\n       (ii) to some extent, the very social conditions that are \n     the objects of regulation.\n       (10)(A) Agencies typically do not--\n       (i) proactively conduct regulatory cost studies; and\n       (ii) report to Congress on unnecessary costs that are not \n     under the control of the agencies because of the way laws are \n     written.\n       (B) Agency recommendations on how to improve the efficiency \n     of regulation by modifying an existing statute could be \n     helpful to Congress.\n       (c) Uniform Use of Cost-benefit Analysis.--Section 553 of \n     title 5, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end \n     the following:\n       ``(f)(1) Before an agency publishes or otherwise provides \n     notice of a notice of proposed rulemaking under this section, \n     the agency shall comply with the following requirements with \n     respect to the proposed rule:\n       ``(A) The agency shall identify, in the context of a \n     coherent conceptual framework and supported with objective \n     data--\n       ``(i) the nature and significance of the market failure, \n     regulatory failure, or other problem that necessitates \n     regulatory action;\n       ``(ii) the reasons why national economic and income growth, \n     advancing technology, and other market developments will not \n     obviate the need for the rulemaking;\n       ``(iii) the reasons why regulation at the State, local, or \n     tribal level could not address the problem better than at the \n     Federal level;\n       ``(iv) the reasons why reducing rather than increasing the \n     extent or stringency of existing Federal regulation would not \n     address the problem better;

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Bipartisan Congressional \n     Trade Priorities Act of 2014''.\n\n     SEC. 202. TRADE NEGOTIATING OBJECTIVES.\n\n       (a) Overall Trade Negotiating Objectives.--The overall \n     trade negotiating objectives of the United States for \n     agreements subject to the provisions of section 203 are--\n       (1) to obtain more open, equitable, and reciprocal market \n     access;\n       (2) to obtain the reduction or elimination of barriers and \n     distortions that are directly related to trade and investment \n     and that decrease market opportunities for United States \n     exports or otherwise distort United States trade;\n       (3) to further strengthen the system of international trade \n     and investment disciplines and procedures, including dispute \n     settlement;\n       (4) to foster economic growth, raise living standards, \n     enhance the competitiveness of the United States, promote \n     full employment in the United States, and enhance the global \n     economy;\n       (5) to ensure that trade and environmental policies are \n     mutually supportive and to seek to protect and preserve the \n     environment and enhance the international means of doing so, \n     while optimizing the use of the world's resources;\n       (6) to promote respect for worker rights and the rights of \n     children consistent with core labor standards of the ILO (as \n     set out in section 11(7)) and an understanding of the \n     relationship between trade and worker rights;\n       (7) to seek provisions in trade agreements under which \n     parties to those agreements ensure that they do not weaken or \n     reduce the protections afforded in domestic environmental and \n     labor laws as an encouragement for trade;\n       (8) to ensure that trade agreements afford small businesses \n     equal access to international markets, equitable trade \n     benefits, and expanded export market opportunities, and \n     provide for the reduction or elimination of trade and \n     investment barriers that disproportionately impact small \n     businesses;\n       (9) to promote universal ratification and full compliance \n     with ILO Convention No. 182 Concerning the Prohibition and \n     Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of \n     Child Labor;\n       (10) to ensure that trade agreements reflect and facilitate \n     the increasingly interrelated, multi-sectoral nature of trade \n     and investment activity;\n       (11) to ensure implementation of trade commitments and \n     obligations by strengthening the effective operation of legal \n     regimes and the rule of law by trading partners of the United \n     States through capacity building and other appropriate means;\n       (12) to recognize the growing significance of the Internet \n     as a trading platform in international commerce; and\n       (13) to take into account other legitimate United States \n     domestic objectives, including, but not limited to, the \n     protection of legitimate health or safety, essential \n     security, and consumer interests and the law and regulations \n     related thereto.\n       (b) Principal Trade Negotiating Objectives.--\n       (1) Trade in goods.--The principal negotiating objectives \n     of the United States regarding trade in goods are--\n       (A) to expand competitive market opportunities for exports \n     of goods from the United States and to obtain fairer and more \n     open conditions of trade, including through the utilization \n     of global value chains, by reducing or eliminating tariff and \n     nontariff barriers and policies and practices of foreign \n     governments directly related to trade that decrease market \n     opportunities for United States exports or otherwise distort \n     United States trade; and\n       (B) to obtain reciprocal tariff and nontariff barrier \n     elimination agreements, including with respect to those \n     tariff categories covered in section 111(b) of the Uruguay \n     Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3521(b)).\n       (2) Trade in services.--(A) The principal negotiating \n     objective of the United States regarding trade in services is \n     to expand competitive market opportunities for United States \n     services and to obtain fairer and more open conditions of \n     trade, including through utilization of global value chains, \n     by reducing or eliminating barriers to international trade in \n     services, such as regulatory and other barriers that deny \n     national treatment and market access or unreasonably restrict \n     the establishment or operations of service suppliers.\n       (B) Recognizing that expansion of trade in services \n     generates benefits for all sectors of the economy and \n     facilitates trade, the objective described in subparagraph \n     (A) should be pursued through all means, including through a \n     plurilateral agreement with those countries willing and able \n     to undertake high standard services commitments for both \n     existing and new services.\n       (3) Trade in agriculture.--The principal negotiating \n     objective of the United States with respect to agriculture is \n     to obtain competitive opportunities for United States exports \n     of agricultural commodities in foreign markets substantially \n     equivalent to the competitive opportunities afforded foreign \n     exports in United States markets and to achieve fairer and \n     more open conditions of trade in bulk, specialty crop, and \n     value added commodities by--\n       (A) securing more open and equitable market access through \n     robust rules on sanitary and phytosanitary measures that--\n       (i) encourage the adoption of international standards and \n     require a science-based justification be provided for a \n     sanitary or phytosanitary measure if the measure is more \n     restrictive than the applicable international standard;\n       (ii) improve regulatory coherence, promote the use of \n     systems-based approaches, and appropriately recognize the \n     equivalence of health and safety protection systems of \n     exporting countries;\n       (iii) require that measures are transparently developed and \n     implemented, are based on risk assessments that take into \n     account relevant international guidelines and scientific \n     data, and are not more restrictive on trade than necessary to \n     meet the intended purpose; and\n       (iv) improve import check processes, including testing \n     methodologies and procedures, and certification requirements,\n     while recognizing that countries may put in place measures to \n     protect human, animal or plant life or health in a manner \n     consistent with their international obligations, including \n     the WTO Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and \n     Phytosanitary Measures (referred to in section 101(d)(3) of \n     the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3511(d)(3)));\n       (B) reducing or eliminating, by a date certain, tariffs or \n     other charges that decrease\n\n[[Page S4934]]\n\n     market opportunities for United States exports--\n       (i) giving priority to those products that are subject to \n     significantly higher tariffs or subsidy regimes of major \n     producing countries; and\n       (ii) providing reasonable adjustment periods for United \n     States import sensitive products, in close consultation with \n     Congress on such products before initiating tariff reduction \n     negotiations;\n       (C) reducing tariffs to levels that are the same as or \n     lower than those in the United States;\n       (D) reducing or eliminating subsidies that decrease market \n     opportunities for United States exports or unfairly distort \n     agriculture markets to the detriment of the United States;\n       (E) allowing the preservation of programs that support \n     family farms and rural communities but do not distort trade;\n       (F) developing disciplines for domestic support programs, \n     so that production that is in excess of domestic food \n     security needs is sold at world prices;\n       (G) eliminating government policies that create price \n     depressing surpluses;\n       (H) eliminating state trading enterprises whenever \n     possible;\n       (I) developing, strengthening, and clarifying rules to \n     eliminate practices that unfairly decrease United States \n     market access opportunities or distort agricultural markets \n     to the detriment of the United States, and ensuring that such \n     rules are subject to efficient, timely, and effective dispute \n     settlement, including--\n       (i) unfair or trade distorting activities of state trading \n     enterprises and other administrative mechanisms, with \n     emphasis on requiring price transparency in the operation of \n     state trading enterprises and such other mechanisms in order \n     to end cross subsidization, price discrimination, and price \n     undercutting;\n       (ii) unjustified trade restrictions or commercial \n     requirements, such as labeling, that affect new technologies, \n     including biotechnology;\n       (iii) unjustified sanitary or phytosanitary restrictions, \n     including restrictions not based on scientific principles in \n     contravention of obligations in the Uruguay Round Agreements \n     or bilateral or regional trade agreements;\n       (iv) other unjustified technical barriers to trade;

and\n       (ii) with respect to labor, decisions regarding the \n     distribution of enforcement resources are not a reason for \n     not complying with a party's labor obligations; a party to a \n     trade agreement retains the right to reasonable exercise of \n     discretion and to make bona fide decisions regarding the \n     allocation of resources between labor enforcement activities \n     among core labor standards, provided the exercise of such \n     discretion and such decisions are not inconsistent with its \n     obligations;\n       (C) to strengthen the capacity of United States trading \n     partners to promote respect for core labor standards (as \n     defined in section 211(17));\n       (D) to strengthen the capacity of United States trading \n     partners to protect the environment through the promotion of \n     sustainable development;\n       (E) to reduce or eliminate government practices or policies \n     that unduly threaten sustainable development;\n       (F) to seek market access, through the elimination of \n     tariffs and nontariff barriers, for United States \n     environmental technologies, goods, and services;\n       (G) to ensure that labor, environmental, health, or safety \n     policies and practices of the parties to trade agreements \n     with the United States do not arbitrarily or unjustifiably \n     discriminate against United States exports or serve as \n     disguised barriers to trade;\n       (H) to ensure that enforceable labor and environment \n     obligations are subject to the same dispute settlement and \n     remedies as other enforceable obligations under the \n     agreement;

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) record volumes of natural gas production in the United \n     States as of the date of enactment of this Act are providing \n     enormous benefits to the United States, including by--\n       (A) reducing the need for imports of natural gas, thereby \n     directly reducing the trade deficit;\n       (B) strengthening trade ties among the United States, \n     Canada, and Mexico;\n       (C) providing the opportunity for the United States to join \n     the emerging global gas trade through the export of liquefied \n     natural gas;\n       (D) creating and supporting millions of new jobs across the \n     United States;\n       (E) adding billions of dollars to the gross domestic \n     product of the United States every year;\n       (F) generating additional Federal, State, and local \n     government tax revenues; and\n       (G) revitalizing the manufacturing sector by providing \n     abundant and affordable feedstock;\n       (2) large quantities of natural gas are lost due to venting \n     and flaring, primarily in areas where natural gas \n     infrastructure has\n\n[[Page S4947]]\n\n     not been developed quickly enough, such as States with large \n     quantities of Federal land and Indian land;\n       (3) permitting processes can hinder the development of \n     natural gas infrastructure, such as pipeline lines and \n     gathering lines on Federal land and Indian land; and\n       (4) additional authority for the Secretary of the Interior \n     to approve natural gas pipelines and gathering lines on \n     Federal land and Indian land would--\n       (A) assist in bringing gas to market that would otherwise \n     be vented or flared; and\n       (B) significantly increase royalties collected by the \n     Secretary of the Interior and disbursed to Federal, State, \n     and tribal governments and individual Indians.\n\n     SEC. 103. AUTHORITY TO APPROVE NATURAL GAS PIPELINES.\n\n       Section 1 of the Act of February 15, 1901 (31 Stat. 790, \n     chapter 372; 16 U.S.C. 79), is amended by inserting ``, for \n     natural gas pipelines'' after ``distribution of electrical \n     power''.\n\n     SEC. 104.
