Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Veterans Health Care and Job Training\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote to advance \nbipartisan legislation that expands and improves the health care and \njob training available to our Nation's veterans.\n  I thank the Senator from Vermont, Bernard Sanders, for his leadership \non this issue and for his dedication to America's service men and \nwomen.\n  The 19th century British statesman George Canning said: ``When our \nperils are past, shall our gratitude sleep?''\n  ``When our perils are past, shall our gratitude sleep?''\n  Although it is clear the world is still a very perilous place, the \nUnited States is finally winding down more than a decade of war in \nAfghanistan, and we are out of Iraq.\n  Mr. President, our gratitude shall not sleep. It is time to \ndemonstrate the\n\n[[Page S1012]]\n\ndepth and breadth of our appreciation to the men and women who have \nkept this country safe in spite of the risk to their lives and the \nsacrifices required of their families.\n  I think of a young man from Hawthorne, NV, who enlisted right out of \nhigh school, who was 18 years old. He was in Afghanistan for a matter \nof days, and one of those explosive devices blew off his legs at the \nhips. I think of him and his parents. What a struggle. That is what \nthis legislation is all about.\n  This bill would not only improve veterans' access to health care, it \nwould extend job training programs for servicemembers reentering the \ncivilian workforce. It would bolster benefits for surviving spouses and \nchildren. And it would make the Veterans' Administration more \ntransparent and more efficient.\n  Senator Sanders' legislation would allow the Veterans' Administration \nto open 27 new clinics and medical facilities in 18 States and Puerto \nRico. These clinics will improve the quality of care and reduce travel \ntime for our retired heroes, particularly for veterans who live in \nrural areas--as the young man I just talked about is from a very rural \npart of Nevada in Hawthorne.\n  This legislation would help the VA work to end the backlog of claims \nfor benefits. Legislation contained in this package will also improve \ncare and benefits for veterans who experienced sexual trauma while \nserving their country.\n  This measure also expands educational opportunities for recently \nseparated veterans by securing in-State tuition rates for post-9/11 \nveterans at all public colleges and universities. And this measure \nrenews the VOW to Hire Heroes Act, which has helped spur hiring of out-\nof-work servicemembers and has given more than 70,000 veterans access \nto job training.\n  Unfortunately, though, unemployment is still far too high among \nveterans transitioning back to the civilian workforce. Last year more \nthan 700,000 men and women who served in the U.S. military were \nunemployed. This is simply unacceptable. No one who has fought for \ntheir country overseas should have to fight for a job here at home.\n  Instead, we should be helping veterans--especially those who have \nendured more than a decade of war--to continue to serve their country \nas productive citizens. That is why this legislation extends for 2 \nyears a program that helps former servicemembers get the skills they \nneed to compete in a civilian workforce.\n  This legislation has the support of virtually every veterans \norganization in this country--25 of them--including the American Legion \nand the Veterans of Foreign Wars.\n  The bill is fully paid for with the savings from winding down the two \nwars in Iraq and Afghanistan that so strained our military and our \nfinancial resources for more than a decade. The Pentagon projects that \nwar spending will go down as we continue to reduce the number of \nAmerican troops in Afghanistan.\n  This legislation will lock in those savings, establishing caps on \noverseas war spending for the very first time. It is only fair that we \nuse a small portion of those savings to invest in our returning \nveterans, who have given so much over the past 13 years to ensure our \nsafety.\n  Even with the perils of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan past for so \nmany of our servicemembers, our gratitude shall not sleep. We owe it to \nour veterans to make the transition to peace a very productive time.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n                           Medicare Advantage\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, late last week the Obama administration \nproposed yet another round of drastic cuts to a popular Medicare \nprogram used by millions--millions--of American seniors. Not \nsurprisingly, they did it quietly, in the hopes that these latest cuts \nto Medicare Advantage would somehow get lost in what folks around here \ncall the ``Friday news dump.'' But the American people are not easily \nfooled.\n  The far left has always hated Medicare Advantage. It is a program \nthat offends them ideologically because it offers more market-based \nchoices to seniors than traditional Medicare. But the left's prodding \nis not the only reason the Obama administration has already cut this \nsuccessful program so deeply, and why now it plans to cut it even \ndeeper.\n  The hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of cuts that Washington \nDemocrats want to impose on Medicare Advantage--cuts that will cause \nmillions of seniors to lose access to doctors and face higher \npremiums--are basically all to fund ObamaCare.\n  Some folks might describe this as ``robbing Peter to pay Paul.'' But \nI have a better analogy: It is like ripping parts off a Cadillac to \npatch up a Pinto. America's seniors actually understand this.\n  Our constituents like--they like--the choices Medicare Advantage \noffers. And they do not like ObamaCare. That is why seniors from all \nacross Kentucky have written to protest this misguided policy.\n  Jack and Alda Rice from Fairdale wrote that Medicare Advantage has \nbeen there for them when they needed it, and that it is ``tough for \nseniors to have to find new doctors, especially for those who live in \nrural areas. It means traveling greater distances and spending more on \ngas.''\n  ``It is a sad thing,'' they wrote, ``when good doctors leave a plan \nbecause of funding cuts.''\n  Ronald and Linda Baynum from Edgewood wrote that they ``[found] it \nappalling'' that money that was put away for senior citizens is now \nbeing used for things like ObamaCare. ``It seems like most politicians \nare only working for themselves instead of the people,'' they wrote.\n  Well, look, they have every right to be frustrated. I mean, why on \nEarth would we want to ruin one program that is helping people in order \nto fund another that is causing them so much pain? The question answers \nitself.\n  That is why I, along with Senators Cornyn, Thune, Barrasso, Moran, \nand Blunt sent a letter to the administration today--to express our \ndeep concerns with these proposed cuts to Medicare Advantage and other \nproposals that would increase premiums, reduce choices, and cause \nAmerica's seniors to lose access to the health plans they were promised \nthey could keep. Our letter asks the administration to act within the \nbounds of the law to limit the negative impact these misguided policies \nwould have on seniors.\n  It is notable that even some of our friends on the other side of the \naisle seem to understand the pain all of this is causing. That is why \n19--19--Senate Democrats recently signed a bipartisan letter with 21 \nRepublicans that called on the administration to mitigate the impact of \nthese cuts to Medicare Advantage. We appreciate Democratic support on \nany issue. It is good when they acknowledge the senselessness of \ncutting one successful program to fund a failed one, of cuts that will \nmake it even harder for America's seniors to keep the benefits, plans, \nand doctors of their choice. But, frankly, it is hard to believe they \nare really being serious on this one. That is because nearly every one \nof these Senators voted for ObamaCare, the very law that imposed the \nsame cuts they are now railing against. Nearly every single one of them \nvoted later to keep these cuts in place.\n\n  Senator Hatch proposed an amendment that would have reversed \nObamaCare's cuts to Medicare Advantage. It only failed because nearly \nevery Democratic Senator voted against it. So Washington Democrats had \ntheir chance for a mulligan. They took a pass. They actually cannot \nhave it both ways. Signing on to some letter will not absolve them of \nresponsibility now. It will not erase the fact that even when they were \ngiven a second chance to help American's seniors, many voted a second \ntime to take a whack at Medicare.\n  Let's not forget that these folks and their allies are basically the \nsame ones--the very same ones--who promised up and down that Americans \ncould keep their health care plans that they had and they liked, under \nObamaCare--a promise that was voted the ``Lie of the Year'' in 2013. So \nAmericans are not about to be taken in on the latest ObamaCare spin.\n  Let's be honest. The only realistic solution is to undo the damage \naltogether by starting over with real reform. That means replacing\n\n[[Page S1013]]\n\nObamaCare and its more than $700 billion in Medicare cuts--cuts imposed \nsolely to fund ObamaCare--and replacing that with bipartisan reforms \nthat can actually help struggling middle-class Americans.\n  I urge the Democrats to follow the lead of one prominent Senate \nDemocrat who said just the other day he would vote tomorrow--vote \ntomorrow--to repeal ObamaCare. If he is serious about what he said, \nthat means he is finally listening to the American people instead of \nthe party bosses in Washington. If more of his colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle would only do the same, we could finally move forward \nwith real patient-centered health reform; we could finally do away with \nthe practice of raiding Medicare to fund ObamaCare; we could finally be \ndone with the hurt this law is imposing on men and women all across our \ncountry--college graduates, moms, dads, small business women, \nconstituents who struggle every day just to get by, and, of course, \nmillions, literally millions of seniors. Republicans are on their side. \nWe agree with them that ObamaCare is a law that just does not work, and \nwe agree with them that now is not the time to impose higher costs and \nreduce choices for senior citizens, as the partisan ObamaCare law \nproposes.\n  I know the authors of this law may have had good intentions, but now \nis the time for them to admit past mistakes and to work with \nRepublicans in a bipartisan fashion to remedy these errors before even \nmore people get hurt by ObamaCare.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/25/senate-section/article/S1013-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to speak about a friend of mine and \na Presidential nominee to be on the Federal bench in Arkansas. I will \ntake 3 to 5 minutes. I know there are others who want to speak.\n  Today I rise to support the nomination of Judge James Moody--whom in \nArkansas we call Jay Moody--to be a Federal judge in the Eastern \nDistrict of Arkansas. Jay has been a phenomenal judge and lawyer for a \nlong time in Arkansas.\n  One of the things this nomination illustrates to me and I think also \nbrings home to people around the country is that this body should not \nplay games with the third branch of government. We have our own issues. \nThis body can be dysfunctional and highly partisan. Let's not export \nthat to the judiciary. We have a fine man who has offered his services \nto be a Federal judge.\n  If you look at what I like to look at, Is he well qualified? Yes, \nabsolutely. Everyone agrees on that. Can he be fair and impartial? That \nis what you want in a judge. The answer is yes, he can be very fair and \nimpartial. He has demonstrated that as a member of the Arkansas bench \nfor a long time now.\n  Also, especially in a district court position, does he have the right \njudicial temperament? I think every person who has ever dealt with \nJudge Jay Moody will say that he not only has the right temperament, \nbut he meets and exceeds all of these criteria across the board. He is \nexactly the kind of judge we should all want.\n  In fact, there is no reason why Judge Moody was not confirmed back in \nDecember. He should have been. But for the wrangling here in the \nSenate, but for the problems we have had in the Senate in the last \nseveral months, he would be a Federal judge today, and he should be a \nFederal judge today. In fact, 2 weeks ago I came to the floor and asked \nfor consent that we go ahead and just confirm him by unanimous consent, \nbut that was not granted.\n  Since 2003 Jay Moody has served as a circuit judge--that is a trial \ncourt judge in Arkansas--for the Sixth Judicial District, which is the \nLittle Rock area. He previously worked at the Wright, Lindsey & \nJennings law firm, which is one of the most prestigious firms in the \nState. It is a very well-known law firm. It is highly professional, has \na great reputation. He became a partner there in 1994, just a few years \nafter he joined the firm. He also spent time as an adjunct professor at \nthe University of Arkansas Bowen School of Law, where he earned his \nJ.D. He is also a member of a number of different lawyer groups and \nassociations--at least he was before he entered the bench.\n  I could spend 20 minutes talking about his qualifications, talking \nabout what a fine nominee and fine selection Jay Moody is to be a \ndistrict court judge in the Eastern District of Arkansas, but, \nhonestly, this turns out to be a no-brainer, so I am not going to \nbelabor his qualifications and why we should do this other than to say \nthat I know I am tired--and I think people all over the country are \nalso tired--of the gridlock here in Washington. They look at a State \nsuch as Arkansas where we have eight Federal district court judges and \nwe have two vacancies. These vacancies should have been filled back in \nDecember. There is no reason why they should not. But they have been \nworking under 75 percent horsepower now for months. We could have fixed \nthat back in December, but because of the wrangling here in the Senate \nand in Washington, that was not done.\n  Today is the day we can rectify that. Today is the day we can confirm \nJudge Moody to be on the Federal bench.\n  I think we can all be very proud of this nomination. Again, he is \nexactly what we would all want in a Federal judge. That is confirmed by \ntalking to lawyers in Arkansas. It does not matter if you are a \ncriminal or civil lawyer; it does not matter if you are a plaintiff's \nlawyer or a defense lawyer; everybody agrees he will be a great Federal \njudge.\n  One of his old law partners, the managing partner of Wright, Lindsey \n& Jennings, Ed Lowther, told me one time--I said: How is Jay Moody on \nthe bench? Of course, we all knew him as a lawyer. How is he on the \nbench? He paid one of the best compliments a lawyer can pay to a judge. \nHe said, ``He gets his work done.'' Can we really ask for any more than \nthat? He gets his work done. He takes care of it.\n  In fact, it is almost uncanny when you look at the very difficult, \nhigh-profile, complicated cases that come to the trial court level in \nPulaski County Circuit Court. Again, that is our trial court there in \nLittle Rock. Almost always, he is the one who ends up with the case. \nNot only do the lawyers love him and appreciate him, but also his \ncolleagues obviously have a lot of respect, and they often hand off the \nmore difficult cases to Judge Moody.\n  In fact, I heard a conversation here on the floor just 2 or 3 weeks \nago. My colleague, Senator Boozman of Arkansas, is supportive of this \nnominee and has been helping push this nominee through the process. He \nwent to the Judiciary Committee--by the way, this nomination has come \nthrough the Judiciary Committee not once but twice. Senator Boozman \nhelped push him through the Judiciary Committee, helped get him to the \nfloor, and has talked to his Republican colleagues. I overheard a \nconversation the other day where Senator Boozman was talking to Leader \nMcConnell. John Boozman turned to Senator McConnell and said, ``Mitch, \nthis guy is great.'' He said, ``You could not have picked someone \nbetter had you picked him yourself.'' That is really Jay Moody in a \nnutshell.\n  With that, I would like to ask my colleagues to vote for this \nnomination today. I believe we will vote in about 30 to 45 minutes. I \nam not sure exactly what time we start. But I ask my colleagues to \nsupport this nomination.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Murphy.). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S1014]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/25/senate-section/article/S1014-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1014-S1016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, last Friday we heard that the health care \nlaw is scheduled to deliver yet another blow to Americans. The \nadministration released a proposal that would significantly cut \nMedicare Advantage.\n  Medicare Advantage is a very well-received program. It offers private \nplan options for seniors on Medicare. Nearly 30 percent of Medicare \nbeneficiaries voluntarily choose to enroll in Medicare Advantage \nbecause it offers extra benefits, it offers lower costs, more \nflexibility, and better care coordination than the traditional Medicare \nprogram.\n  This program, Medicare Advantage, has been very well received in the \nState of Nebraska. About 35,000 Nebraskans are enrolled in Medicare \nAdvantage.\n  An analysis notes that further cuts to Medicare Advantage would \n``disproportionately affect beneficiaries with low incomes, including \nthe 41 percent of enrollees with incomes below $20,000.''\n  This announcement is absolutely no surprise; the health care law has \nsiphoned over $700 billion from Medicare--not to strengthen the program \nbut to pay for ObamaCare; $308 billion of those cuts come from Medicare \nAdvantage, again disproportionately affecting beneficiaries with low \nincomes, including 41 percent who are trying to live on incomes below \n$20,000.\n  The reality is these cuts will likely mean fewer benefits and higher \nout-of-pocket costs for seniors who can't afford that. Plans could drop \nout of the market all together or seniors could find out that their \ntrusted doctor will no longer be covered by their plan. We have already \nstarted to see the consequences.\n  Since the passage of ObamaCare, the number of Medicare Advantage \nplans available to seniors has not been strengthened. In fact, they \nhave been reduced from 48 in 2009 to now 20.\n  In rural areas, seniors have fewer choices. The plans available have \ndropped from 36 to 13, according to a Kaiser analysis.\n  Another study estimates about 526,000 of current 2013 Medicare \nAdvantage enrollees will have to make some changes because their plan \nis not available in 2014.\n  How do these consequences match up with the President's promises? \nWell, they don't. The President spoke about Medicare, and he said: \n``Don't worry; I am not going to touch it''--or his promise: If you \nlike your plan, you can keep it, which an independent fact checker has \ncalled the lie of the year.\n  The Medicare Advantage issues unraveling today are symbolic of the \nbroader problems with the law. The math doesn't add up, and the \npromises aren't kept. Nearly every week it seems the authors and \nsupporters of this law are trying to bury their past. They are trying \nto create hollow promises. They are trying to get around misleading \nstatements and hide behind a new position, at least until the November \nelections are over.\n  It is remarkable that they are perfectly willing to evade the key \npillars of this law. The law's employer mandate has been ignored and \ndelayed. Mandated plan benefits aren't required for another year, and \ndeadlines are conveniently rescheduled--to when? Until after the \nelection.\n  This time around 19 Democratic Senators have joined a number of \nRepublicans in writing the Medicare administrator saying the \nadministration's Medicare Advantage cuts ``create disruption and \nconfusion'' and ``inhibit plans from driving the innovation that has \nresulted in better care and improved outcomes for Medicare \nbeneficiaries.''\n  What is so contradictory is that these same individuals voted against \namendments offered by Senator Hatch, twice, during the health care law \ndebate that would have struck ObamaCare's Medicare Advantage cuts. They \ntwice voted against that.\n  Understanding the consequences of these Medicare Advantage cuts \nbefore the law was passed would seem like the responsible course of \naction. But rejecting these amendments, voting for a bill that cuts \nover $300 billion for Medicare Advantage, then backpedaling when the \npolitics get tough, and when the cuts become real to everyday \nfolks, apparently, they were for the cuts before they were against the \ncuts.\n\n  It is even more frustrating when you consider that recent efforts to \ndodge these cuts are only part of the story. For the past few years, \nthe Obama administration has been pumping money back into Medicare \nAdvantage under the guise of a so-called demonstration program that the \nGovernment Accountability Office says they probably don't even have the \nauthority to run. GAO asserted that HHS should terminate the \ndemonstration program, but the administration flat-out ignored that.\n  The real purpose of the $8 billion program was to effectively mask \nthe health care law's significant cuts to Medicare Advantage until \nwhen? After the November election. It is just another example of the \nadministration's hiding their poor decisions and then rewriting the law \nas they see fit. But as this new Medicare notice clearly shows, this \nphony demonstration project is about to run out and our senior citizens \nare truly caught.\n  Our taxpayers deserve a government that is held accountable for its \nactions. Americans are tired of temporary fixes and lip service. They \nare rightfully demanding the truth. It is time for my friends across \nthe aisle to own up to the devastating consequences of this law and \nacknowledge it is time to repeal it.\n  During the debate, Republicans also supported an amendment to ensure \nMedicare savings were invested back into Medicare, not used to back \nObamaCare. Remarkably, nearly everyone on the Democratic side of the \naisle rejected that idea. Republicans are still committed to that \nprinciple, and we stand ready to work on ensuring the Medicare Program \nis accessible, that it is flexible, and that it is cost-efficient for \nseniors today and for our grandchildren in the decades to come.\n  Taking money out of Medicare to finance ObamaCare was wrong and it \nneeds to stop. That is a promise worth delivering on.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss the \npain ObamaCare continues to inflict on Americans. It seems like every \nweek brings more ObamaCare bad news for somebody--families, businesses, \nmiddle-income Americans, lower income Americans. This past week the bad \nnews was for seniors.\n  On Friday the Obama administration announced its planned 2015 cuts to \nMedicare Advantage--cuts that were dictated by ObamaCare and will \nresult in higher prices and fewer choices for millions of American \nseniors. More than 15 million seniors--close to 30 percent of all \nMedicare recipients--are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans. The Wall \nStreet Journal reports that approximately one out of every two new \nMedicare enrollees chooses Medicare Advantage.\n  Medicare Advantage offers seniors a chance to pick a plan that is \nright for them instead of a one-size-fits-all approach. Advantage plans \nalso frequently offer important health supplements, such as dental, \nvision, hearing, and wellness benefits, as well as smaller copays or \ndeductibles. Studies also show that Medicare Advantage Program \nenrollees receive better care and experience better health outcomes \nthan seniors enrolled in traditional fee-for-service Medicare.\n  Despite the benefits these plans offer to seniors, Democrats and the \nPresident supported Medicare Advantage cuts in the President's health \ncare law. In 2010, the President and Democrats paid--or I should say \ntried to pay--for ObamaCare by, among other things, cutting more than \n$700 billion from Medicare--already, I might add, on its way to \nbankruptcy--to pay for yet a new entitlement for nonseniors. More than \n$300 billion of those cuts were targeted specifically at the Medicare \nAdvantage Program.\n\n[[Page S1015]]\n\n  Those cuts are kicking in this year, hitting Medicare Advantage \nbeneficiaries with cost increases and benefit cuts of up to $70 per \nmonth--no small amount for a senior on a fixed income. Friday's \nannouncement of further steep cuts for 2015 could mean up to an \nadditional $75 per month in increased cost next year.\n  But that is not all. Cost hikes are bad enough, but this year's cuts \nand the 2015 cuts announced Friday will result in a host of other \nproblems for seniors who participate in Medicare Advantage. First and \nforemost, some seniors will lose their plans entirely as a result of \nObamaCare's cuts, breaking the President's promise that if you like \nyour plan you can keep it.\n  The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that more than one-half \nmillion seniors will lose their current plans in 2014. If the 2015 cuts \ngo into effect, even more seniors will lose their plans next year. \nSeniors will also have fewer plan choices as a result of ObamaCare's \nraiding Medicare Advantage to pay for a new health care entitlement \nprogram. If next year's cuts go into effect, we can expect to see even \nmore reductions.\n  These higher costs and reductions in available Medicare Advantage \nplans will disproportionately impact low-income seniors in rural areas, \nareas such as those I represent in South Dakota. Forty-one percent of \nthose seniors in Medicare Advantage plans have annual incomes of less \nthan $20,000 and are least able to bear the higher costs forced on them \nby ObamaCare. Yet it is precisely those seniors who are bearing the \ngreatest burden when it comes to paying for ObamaCare.\n  On top of that, reports indicate that plans are responding to the \ncuts by reducing their footprint in rural markets, giving these seniors \nfewer options when it comes to choosing a health care plan.\n  Finally, similar to so many other Americans suffering under \nObamaCare, seniors on a Medicare Advantage plan may no longer be able \nto keep the doctors they have and like thanks to these cuts. Between \nMedicare cuts and the new ObamaCare tax insurance companies are facing \nthis year, companies are scrambling for ways to be able to afford to \ncontinue their plans. Frequently their only option is to narrow their \nnetworks of doctors and hospitals or raise their copayments and \ndeductibles, thus reducing seniors' choices and increasing their health \ncare costs.\n  Republicans have long touted the quality care and patient choice \noffered by Medicare Advantage plans. When the health care bill was \nbeing considered in 2010, we warned at the time that Medicare cuts \nbeing proposed in the bill would hurt seniors, damage Medicare \nAdvantage, and weaken a program already hastening toward bankruptcy. \nDespite this, Democrats not only supported the health care bill, they \nalso voted twice against measures to repeal the law's cuts to Medicare \nAdvantage.\n  Now it seems many Democrats have changed their minds. Earlier this \nmonth, 19 Democratic Senators, most of whom voted for ObamaCare in \n2010, joined a number of Republicans in sending a letter to Marilyn \nTavenner, Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid \nServices, urging her not to cut Medicare Advantage. Let's hope it is \nnot too little too late.\n  Democrats' support for the Medicare Advantage letter to the CMS \nAdministrator reflects their increasing unease with their support for \nObamaCare. Once they planned to tout ObamaCare to voters as a \nlegislative triumph, but Democrats up for reelection now can't run away \nfrom the law fast enough.\n  In fact, the President has repeatedly delayed parts of the health \ncare law to give Democrats political cover. Each delay is a tacit \nadmission that, yes, this law will hurt jobs and the economy because, \nafter all, if this law is not going to hurt jobs and the economy, why \ndo we have to continually delay it? The latest number is somewhere in \nthe twenties. I have heard 24, 27, and 28 different delays of the \nharmful effects and impacts of ObamaCare.\n  If the health care law is the panacea the American people were \npromised, Democrats and the President would be working to implement the \nlaw faster, not slow it down.\n  The only possible reason to delay the law is because its \nimplementation is going to hurt. It is a little awkward when your \nsignature legislation has to be repeatedly delayed to give the folks \nwho voted for it a better chance of keeping their jobs.\n  Unfortunately, the President doesn't seem to have learned his lesson. \nNot content with the damage his health care law is doing to an already \nstruggling economy--a recent CBO report warned that the health care law \nmay result in up to 2.5 million fewer full-time workers--he continues \nto push policies that will further weaken an already sluggish economy, \nsuch as a minimum wage bill that CBO reports would result in up to 1 \nmillion fewer jobs.\n  At a time when our labor force participation rate is at Jimmy Carter-\nera lows, a law that would further reduce the number of full-time \nworkers is one of the worst possible things we could do for our \neconomy. People working produces economic growth. The fewer people \nworking, the less likely we are to produce the kind of growth we need \nto pull our economy out of the slump it has been in throughout the \nPresident's administration. What we need right now are policies that \nwill create jobs and encourage businesses to expand and invest in our \neconomy and in our workers.\n  If the President were really serious about reversing the economic \nstagnation of the past 5 years, he wouldn't be pushing his health care \nbill or a minimum wage hike. Instead, he would be calling the Senate \nmajority leader and urging him to take up and pass trade promotion \nauthority, which will create thousands of jobs for American workers. He \nwould sign off on the Keystone Pipeline and the 42,000-plus jobs it \nwould support. He would join bipartisan majorities in both Houses of \nCongress to support a repeal of the job-destroying medical device tax \nin his health care law, a tax that has already cost more than 33,000 \njobs.\n  American families and workers are hurting. They have been hit hard by \nObamaCare and the Obama economy. It is time for the President to give \nthem some help.\n  I would argue there are bipartisan issues out there. The trade \npromotion authority, repealing the medical device tax, and the Keystone \nPipeline have broad bipartisan majorities here in the Senate. We had a \nvote a year ago on the budget on repealing the medical device tax, and \n79 Senators, including 30 Democrats, voted for that. The last time we \nhad a vote here on the Keystone Pipeline, 62 voted in support of it, \nagain representing broad bipartisan support for that initiative. We \nknow the trade promotion authority is something that enjoys support \nfrom both Republicans and Democrats. All of these initiatives enjoy \nbroad bipartisan support and are known job creators. Those are the \ntypes of things we ought to be focused on, not things that, according \nto the Congressional Budget Office, are going to cost more jobs.\n  Implementation of ObamaCare, according to the CBO report a couple \nweeks ago, will reduce the number of workers in this country by 2.5 \nmillion over the next decade. It also said it would reduce overall \nwages by about 1 percent. So that is fewer jobs and lower take-home \npay.\n  Last week we had the report come out from the Congressional Budget \nOffice that raising the minimum wage could cost up to 1 million jobs at \nthe same time it is raising prices. So the very people we are trying to \nhelp are going to have fewer jobs and higher costs. How does that solve \nthe problems our economy faces? How does that get people in this \ncountry back to work? How does that grow and expand our economy in a \nway that creates greater opportunity for middle-class families?\n  There are things we can do on which there is broad bipartisan support \nthat are known job creators, that are known to expand and grow our \neconomy. I would add to that list as well reforming our Tax Code. We \nhave lost so much in terms of economic growth in the past few years \nsince the recession and coming out of that recession because we have \nhad subpar growth. We haven't seen the type of growth rates we normally \nsee and experience coming out of a recession during a recovery. As a \nconsequence, we have much larger deficits because when the economy is \ngrowing at a sluggish, anemic, slow rate, it means there are fewer \npeople working, fewer people investing, fewer\n\n[[Page S1016]]\n\npeople making money, and therefore fewer people paying taxes. We need \nthe opposite. We need a growing, expanding, vibrant, dynamic economy \nfueled by policies in Washington, DC, that make it less expensive and \nless difficult to create jobs rather than more expensive and more \ndifficult, which is what we see coming out of the Obama administration \nand the Democratic majority here in the Senate.\n  We can do better. We must do better for the American people, for \nmiddle-class families who have been hit hard by the effects and the \nimpacts of this economy with fewer jobs, lower take-home pay, higher \npremiums, higher deductibles, and fewer choices of doctors and \nhospitals under ObamaCare. These policies are hurting the American \npeople. We need to put policies in place that will help the American \npeople by growing our economy and creating more jobs for middle-class \nAmericans.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/25/senate-section/article/S1016-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Sessions III\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for almost two decades Judge William \nSessions has served as a Federal judge for the District of Vermont. \nLast month Judge Sessions announced he would take senior status later \nthis year. I have worked with Senator Sanders, Representative Welch, \nand the Vermont Bar Association to convene a merit commission to find \nhighly qualified candidates to serve on the Vermont District Court so I \ncan then recommend them to the President.\n  I know I speak on behalf of all Vermonters, no matter what their \nbackground, when I thank Judge Sessions for his years of distinguished \npublic service and applaud him for agreeing to continue his judicial \nservice even after he takes senior status this summer. Because of his \ncontinued dedication, Vermont will have one of the most highly \nrespected and extraordinarily capable jurists on the Federal bench. I \nam proud to call Judge Sessions my friend, and I am honored to have \ncast my vote to confirm his nomination 18 years ago.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the \ncompletion of my remarks a Rutland Herald article written by Brent \nCurtis that recounts his many accomplishments.\n  There are only two authorized district judgeships in Vermont. We are \nthe second smallest State in the Union. So, when President Clinton \nasked for my recommendation to fill a vacancy in my native State, I did \nnot take this task lightly. I knew the people of Vermont deserved a \njudge with integrity, intelligence, and fairness, somebody whom anybody \ncould go before--plaintiff or defendant, rich or poor, no matter their \npolitical background--and know they would have a fair hearing.\n  During my time in private practice as a litigant and then as State's \nattorney in Vermont, I experienced firsthand the tradition of legal \nexcellence we have in Vermont. I know many Vermont lawyers who are \namong the best this country has to offer, and Bill Sessions earned a \nreputation as one of the finest trial lawyers in the State. He was \nwidely respected by prosecutors and defense lawyers, and by the \nplaintiff and defense bars alike. He was praised by those who had been \nhis co-counsel, by State and Federal judges and prosecutors, and even \nby those who had been his opposing counsel in court. It was a privilege \nto submit his name to the White House for nomination to the U.S. \nDistrict Court. At the time, I told President Clinton this would be one \nnomination he would never have to question his judgment in making \nbecause he would have somebody who would always serve the country so \nwell. The Senate confirmed him unanimously on August 11, 1995.\n  Judge Sessions received his B.A. from Middlebury College in 1969. \nUpon his graduation with honors from the George Washington University \nLaw School in 1972, Judge Sessions served his country in the U.S. Army \nfrom 1972 to 1977 and in active service from 1972 to 1973. He also \nserved as a law clerk to another friend of mine, Judge Hilton Dier of \nthe Addison County District Court. Before his service on the Federal \nbench, Judge Sessions contributed to his community as an adjunct \nprofessor at Vermont Law School; in private practice; as the executive \ndirector of the Addison County Youth Services Bureau; and as a public \ndefender in Addison County, VT.\n  During his years of service on the Federal bench, Judge Sessions has \nworked tirelessly to ensure that all those who come before him are \ntreated fairly and with dignity. He is a judge who has taken seriously \nhis commitment to both justice and the American people. He served for \nmany years as a member of the Judicial Conference, composed of the \nleaders of the Federal judiciary.\n  Judge Sessions also served for a decade on the U.S. Sentencing \nCommission, eventually serving as its Chairman. Three Presidents, both \nDemocratic and Republican, nominated him to this Commission, and the \nSenate confirmed him unanimously each time. As a commissioner, Judge \nSessions made deeply significant contributions to American sentencing \npolicy. He played an important role in the reduction of the sentencing \ndisparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses. He has done vital work \nto improve the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. This was especially \nimportant following a number of Supreme Court cases that gave judges \nmore discretion in the sentences they impose. Even after his time on \nthe Sentencing Commission, Judge Sessions continued to work for better \nsentencing policy, publishing an article in a journal of the University \nof Virginia School of Law that explained how the three branches of \ngovernment could work together to improve sentencing in America.\n  Judge Sessions has not forgotten what it is to be a Vermonter. He \nstill finds time on weekends to be at farmers markets around Vermont. \nHe is a familiar face at the booth for Blue Ledge Farm, a small Vermont \ndairy started by his daughter, Hannah, and son-in-law, Greg. I think of \na picture of him holding a grandchild in one hand and making change for \none of the customers with the other.\n  He is one of our country's most respected jurists. He is a lawyer's \nlawyer and a judge's judge. Marcelle and I think of him and Abi, his \nwife, as dear personal friends.\n  Our justice system has benefited a great deal from Judge Sessions' \nyears of service. I thank Judge Sessions for all he has done as a \nFederal judge. I thank him for continuing to serve as a model jurist.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Rutland Herald, Feb. 16, 2014]\n\n            Sessions Reflects on Years On and Off the Bench\n\n                           (By Brent Curtis)\n\n       U.S. District Judge William K. Sessions III will shift to \n     senior status.\n       Long before he was making decisions in a courtroom, federal \n     Judge William Sessions III was working to keep people out of \n     them.\n       With only months remaining before he shifts to senior \n     status in June, Sessions, who turned 67 this month, can look \n     back over two\n\n[[Page S1017]]\n\n     decades of rulings that carried both constitutional and \n     criminal ramifications.\n       But before he was tapped by President Bill Clinton to serve \n     as a federal judge in Vermont in 1995, and before he began a \n     career as a trial lawyer and civil rights practitioner in the \n     1970s, Sessions was a teacher and an advocate to troubled \n     youth and prison inmates.\n       After earning a bachelor's degree from Middlebury College \n     in 1969, Sessions went to Washington, D.C., to attend the \n     George Washington University Law School.\n       Before his legal studies began, he volunteered to be a \n     reading and math teacher to inmates in the Washington, D.C., \n     prison system.\n       ``It was a profound experience for me,'' Sessions said in \n     an interview. ``I was nervous and scared but I learned how to \n     relate with these guys and I learned and loved their stories, \n     and decided at that point I wanted to work with kids and \n     young people.''\n       He added, ``I had this unbelievably moving experience and \n     then the question was `How do I get involved in helping young \n     people so they don't end up in places like prison?' ''\n       His initial work toward that goal was to open a youth \n     center for delinquent and troubled kids in Middlebury. But \n     when a job as a public defender opened up in the mid 1970s, \n     Sessions said he seized the opportunity and spent the next \n     two decades blending his humanitarian and legal passions.\n\n\n                             Focused on law\n\n       With that kind of background, the role of a judge--whose \n     job it is to remain impartial during often emotionally and \n     politically charged proceedings--might seem too restrictive.\n       But Sessions said that, like all judges, he has strived to \n     suppress his biases and focus on the law and the legal \n     questions that have come before him.\n       The one area where he said his humanitarianism shows in the \n     courtroom is in the courtesy he strives to show to everyone \n     who stands before him.\n       ``I love treating people with respect,'' he said. ``In this \n     courtroom, I take a great deal of pride in seeing that a \n     little bit of Vermont takes place in the courtroom. . . . \n     Each defendant is treated respectfully. I think that's how \n     people treat each other in Vermont.''\n       He has also tried to look beyond a person's crime to \n     consider variables about their risk to commit future \n     offenses, their rehabilitative needs including mental health \n     and substance abuse and the message that a potential sentence \n     might send to the broader public.\n       ``I would say that I look closely at the nature of the \n     crime and whether they're taking responsibility for it,'' he \n     said. ``In all the studies I've read, if someone is \n     accountable for their crime, they're much less likely to re-\n     offend.''\n       ``On the other hand, I feel really strongly that human \n     characteristics, the need for rehabilitation and the need to \n     protect society by addressing those issues that a particular \n     defendant has are also important,'' the judge added.\n       Over the years, Sessions has heard countless criminal \n     cases, including the first death penalty case in the state in \n     more than half a century. In that case, involving convicted \n     murderer Donald Fell, Sessions ruled in 2002 that the Federal \n     Death Penalty Act of 1994 was unconstitutional. The 2nd U.S. \n     Circuit Court of Appeals later reversed that ruling and an \n     appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court wasn't taken up by the \n     justices. Because Fell's case remains under appeal, Sessions \n     said he is unable to discuss it.\n       Sessions also served for 11 years on the U.S. Sentencing \n     Commission which was established to address disparities in \n     criminal sentencing.\n       Politics surrounds the group, with congressmen split over \n     whether they wanted to create it in 1999 and insistence among \n     legislators that the commissions members be made up equally \n     of judges nominated by conservatives and liberals.\n\n\n                             Judges united\n\n       But the agendas of the politicians who created the \n     commission didn't enter into the work of the judges who \n     Sessions said were routinely united in their opinions on \n     changes designed to make sentencing guidelines and outcomes \n     more uniform from state to state.\n       And in no arena were the judges more in agreement, he said, \n     than in their work on addressing the disparities in \n     sentencing for those guilty of possessing crack cocaine.\n       Prior to the commission's work on crack cocaine sentences, \n     a 100-to-1 disparity existed between sentencing for crack and \n     powder cocaine.\n       A defendant guilty of possessing 5 grams of crack cocaine \n     faced a five-year minimum sentence while a person would have \n     to possess 500 grams of powder cocaine to receive the same \n     punishment.\n       ``It stemmed from a fear in the 1980s that crack cocaine \n     was a devastating drug that was much more serious than powder \n     cocaine,'' Sessions said. ``So the penalties were \n     extraordinarily high. Five grams of cocaine is an \n     extraordinarily small amount.''\n       After it became clear that there wasn't much difference \n     between crack and powder in terms of ill effects, and after \n     it became clear that those being sentenced for crack cocaine \n     possession were disproportionately black people, Sessions \n     said it became obvious to all the judges on the commission \n     that their first task needed to be a change to the crack \n     sentencing guidelines.\n       ``We went around the room and we were each asked what we \n     wanted to change first and the judges unanimously spoke of \n     changing the crack versus powder cocaine disparity,'' he \n     said. ``The reason really stems not only out of the criminal \n     justice system but on the impact on minority communities in \n     the country.''\n       In 2004, the commission changed the sentencing guidelines \n     for crack cocaine possession and in 2010 Congress passed \n     changes to the required amount someone must possess to \n     receive a minimum five or 10-year jail sentence.\n       The changes were made retroactively and had the effect, on \n     average, of reducing jail sentences for crack cocaine \n     possession by three years.\n       ``That meant that 20,000 people in prison were resentenced \n     for crack cocaine and many were released immediately,'' \n     Sessions said, calculating that about 25 cases in Vermont \n     were affected by the sentencing change.\n\n\n                            National impact\n\n       Beyond the criminal cases, Sessions has decided a number of \n     cases with weighty constitutional import.\n       Thanks to being in a small state with just two federal \n     judges, Sessions said he has received a disproportionate \n     amount of cases with potential national ramifications over \n     the years.\n       One of the most far reaching cases he's decided was a 2007 \n     case in which he ruled in favor of Vermont, New York and a \n     number of environmental groups in a case involving several \n     automobile manufacturers.\n       The case was based on regulations passed in California and \n     then adopted in Vermont and New York that sought to reduce \n     automobile emissions by establishing higher mileage \n     requirements for new cars.\n       ``(The auto manufacturers) sued in each of the circuits and \n     our case came up first,'' Sessions said. ``It was a question \n     of whether it was a requirement that was justified \n     constitutionally.''\n       Car manufacturers argued that the changes would have a \n     severe impact on the industry and they argued that global \n     warming hadn't been established.\n       Over the course of a six-week trial, Sessions heard from \n     dozens of witnesses before issuing a 350-page decision that \n     upheld the state's regulations.\n       ``I've been told it's in textbooks on environmental law,'' \n     he said.\n       The shift to senior status will likely reduce Sessions' \n     workload, as a new federal judge will be appointed to the \n     district. But while he said he's looking forward to time with \n     his four grandchildren and hiking and biking with his wife, \n     the judge said he isn't thinking yet about slowing his work \n     on the bench.\n       ``I'm not planning on slowing down at all,'' he said. ``At \n     this point, I'm a pretty young guy. I'm going to be 67 this \n     month, but I feel like 50.''\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am very pleased to express my strong \nsupport for two highly qualified nominees to the U.S. District Court \nfor the Northern District of California:\n  Superior Court Judge Beth Freeman, and James Donato.\n  I recommended these candidates to President Obama after my bipartisan \nscreening committee gave them both strong recommendations.\n  I am very pleased they will soon fill two longstanding vacancies in \nthe Northern District of California.\n  Judge Freeman earned her law degree from Harvard Law School in 1979, \nand she served in the County Counsel's Office in San Mateo for 18 \nyears.\n  She has spent the last 12 years on the San Mateo Superior Court, \nincluding as presiding judge and assistant presiding judge. She has \npresided over more than a thousand trials, and she has experience in \nboth civil and criminal cases.\n  I have received letters of support for Judge Freeman from Don \nHorsley, president of the San Mateo Board of Supervisors and former \nchair of the County's Domestic Violence Council, and from Stephen \nWagstaffe, San Mateo District Attorney.\n  These letters are strong endorsements for Judge Freeman, and I will \nsimply quote what Mr. Wagstaffe said: ``In 36 years as a prosecutor in \nSan Mateo County, I have not seen a better judge in all respects than \nJudge Freeman.''\n  That is very high praise, and I am pleased Judge Freeman soon will be \nconfirmed and begin her service as a Federal judge in San Jose.\n  Let me now describe Jim Donato, who once confirmed will serve in San \nFrancisco.\n  Mr. Donato earned his law degree from Stanford Law School where he \nwas a Senior Editor of the Stanford Law Review. He clerked for Judge \nProcter Hug on the Ninth Circuit.\n  He served for 3 years in the City Attorney's Office in San Francisco. \nHe has built a distinguished record over two decades as a private \npractitioner handling complex civil cases such as antitrust cases, at \nCooley LLP and Shearman & Sterling LLP.\n  Complex civil experience is especially important in Northern \nCalifornia because the Northern District's docket is 84 percent civil, \naccording to the most recent statistics.\n  Mr. Donato also is a leader in the San Francisco legal community \nwhere he has devoted much of his time to the Bar Association of San \nFrancisco, including as its President in 2008.\n  I have great confidence Mr. Donato will be an outstanding federal \ndistrict judge.\n  Let me close by noting that each of these nominees will fill a \njudicial vacancy that has been designated as a ``judicial emergency'' \nby the Judicial Conference of the United States.\n  The Northern District's weighted caseload per judgeship is over 13 \npercent above the national average. Filings per active judge are up 17 \npercent since 2008. In fact, it now takes 27 percent longer for a civil \ncase to get to trial than it did in 2010.\n  The vacancy Judge Freeman would fill has existed for over 800 days. \nThe vacancy Mr. Donato would fill has existed for over 500 days.\n  It is long past time for these seats to be filled. Indeed, each of \nthese nominees should have been confirmed in 2013--but, unfortunately, \neach had to be renominated in this session and voted out of the \nJudiciary Committee for a second time. This wasted several months \nduring which each could have been serving as a Federal Judge.\n  Nevertheless, I am very pleased that, today, Judge Freeman and Jim \nDonato will be confirmed and will be able to assume their duties \nshortly.\n  I urge my colleagues to support both of these fine nominees.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/25/senate-section/article/S1018-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1018-S1019]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the next nominee, James Donato of \nCalifornia, was originally nominated in June of 2013. He was voted out \nof the Judiciary Committee unanimously.\n  I have heard from my friends on the Republican side that we should be \nconcerned about emergency vacancies. This is an emergency vacancy. He \nwas reported out unanimously for the first time last October. He had to \nbe reported out a second time this year--again, unanimously. He has the \nstrong support of the two Senators from California. So holding up and \nhaving a filibuster and going through all of that on this nomination is \nthe kind of game playing that hurts the Federal judiciary. It is almost \nlike the efforts made by our friends on the other side in closing down \nthe government last year, and this is just a slow way to close down the \nFederal judiciary.\n  I urge immediate consideration and confirmation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, may I direct a question through the Chair to \nthe distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Does the chairman of the committee think we should have a recorded \nvote on this?\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Everyone knows we are in this \nsituation because the Republicans are slow-walking every nomination--\nevery nomination. There is no reason, no reason whatsoever, that we are \nhaving votes on cloture on these judges, as Senator Leahy pointed out \nearlier, reported out unanimously.\n  It is a waste of the taxpayers' time to go through the process we \nhave been going through. We are going to continue working to move the \nbacklog. We have scores of judges, district court judges, and we have a \nnumber of circuit court judges. We are going to, in the near future, \nfile cloture on all of them. If that is what the Republicans want us to \ndo, then that is what we will do. The American people will see the \ncolossal waste of time we have been going through, not only on district \ncourt judges but circuit court judges and all nominations.\n  I would suggest to my friend the senior Senator from Iowa he not \nbelieve his own words because they are simply not true.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, every Veterans Day and every Memorial \nDay many of us, regardless of our political views, go out into our \ncommunities and we speak about our respect and admiration for the \nveterans of this country. As chairman of the Senate Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs for the last year, I have learned that regardless of \npolitical ideology, virtually all Members of the Congress in fact mean \nwhat they say and do understand and do appreciate the enormous \nsacrifices veterans and their families--and their families--have made \nfor our Nation.\n  Sadly, everybody in this country knows we are living at a time when \nthe Congress is virtually dysfunctional and partisanship runs rampant. \nBut I have found on my committee and in the Congress as a whole that \nMembers do understand the sacrifices made by the men and women who put \ntheir lives on the line and do, although we have differences of \nopinion, want to do the right thing to defend those who have defended \nus.\n  The good news is that President Obama and the Congress, in a \nbipartisan way, have made significant\n\n[[Page S1021]]\n\nprogress in addressing a number of the problems facing veterans in this \ncountry. The President's budgets have been generous and I think \nCongress has acted in a responsible way.\n  That is the good news. But the bad news is that we still have a very \nlong way to go if we are to keep faith with those who have put their \nlives on the line to defend us. We have made progress, but we still \nhave a long way to go. I hope very much that we will go down that road \ntogether and we will tell the American people that in the midst of all \nof the partisanship, all of the politics, at least on this one issue we \ncan stand together and protect the interests of those people who have \nsacrificed so much for our country.\n  Congress cannot bring back to their families those who died in \nbattle. As the Presiding Officer knows, just in the recent wars in Iraq \nand Afghanistan, we have lost over 6,700 troops. Congress cannot \nrestore the legs and the arms and the eyesight that roadside explosions \nhave taken away from brave men and women. Congress cannot simply snap \nits fingers and magically cure the hundreds of thousands who returned \nfrom Iraq and Afghanistan with post-traumatic stress disorder or \ntraumatic brain injury or those who suffer from the pain and \nhumiliation of sexual assault. As a nation, however, while we cannot \nmagically solve those problems, we can in fact--and it is our \nresponsibility, in fact--do everything we can to help ease and \nameliorate the problems facing our veterans and their families. We \ncan't solve it all--we know that--but we can go further in ameliorating \nsome of the problems facing veterans and their families.\n  I will give my colleagues a few examples. Congress can help the 2,300 \nmen and women who were looking forward to having families but who \nsuffered reproductive injuries in Iraq and Afghanistan. I believe \nSenator Murray will come to the floor. She has long been a champion of \nthis issue, as have been others. Let me give my colleagues one case out \nof 2,300: Army veteran Matt Keil of Colorado was wounded by sniper fire \nin Iraq in 2007. The sniper's round struck Matt's neck, causing severe \ndamage to a vital artery and his spinal cord. Through sheer \ndetermination and with the love and resolve of his wife Tracy, Matt's \ncondition improved. He and Tracy began to consider having children. \nDoctors assured them that having children could be possible with the \nhelp of in vitro fertilization. The Keil family paid more than $30,000 \nfor reproductive treatments. Congress can help the Keil family and \nothers to ease that financial burden. That is a cost of war. We should \nbe there for that family and for the other families who want the \nopportunity to have children.\n  Congress can help the tens of thousands of family members who every \nsingle day provide loving care for those who were severely injured in \nWorld War II, in Korea, in Vietnam, and in other wars. Let me give my \ncolleagues another example.\n  In March of 1969, Miles Epling was on patrol in Vietnam when a booby \ntrap detonated, killing some of his fellow marines and leaving him \nwithout legs. He returned home to West Virginia in a wheelchair. From \nthat point on, he has required around-the-clock help from those around \nhim. His family provided that help without receiving any training, any \nassistance or any financial support.\n  Here is the very good news--and we should be very proud of this, in a \nbipartisan way, as a Congress: In 2010, 4 years ago, Congress passed a \nvery strong and excellent caregivers program for post-9/11 veterans. It \nis a program that is working well in providing significant help to \ncaregivers of those post-9/11 veterans. I want everybody to put \nthemselves in the place of a wife or sister or mother or brother who \naround the clock--around the clock, 24/7, 365 days a year--is providing \ncare to folks who have suffered serious injuries in one war or another. \nWe provided support for those caregivers post-9/11, for Iraq and \nAfghanistan, but we did not do that for the other wars. Now is the time \nfor us to expand the caregivers program for the families of all \ndisabled veterans who are in the same position that Miles is in. That \nis the fair thing to do, that is the right thing to do, and that is \nincluded in this comprehensive piece of legislation.\n  Because we have the moral obligation to do the very best we can for \nveterans, the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee has brought forth \ncomprehensive legislation that is strongly supported by virtually every \nveteran and military organization in the country. Today I thank the \nAmerican Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Disabled American \nVeterans, the Vietnam Veterans of America, the Military Officers \nAssociation of America, the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, \nthe Paralyzed Veterans of America, the Gold Star Wives of America, and \nthe dozens of other veterans organizations that are strongly supporting \nthis comprehensive piece of legislation.\n  In their statement of support, the DAV writes:\n\n       This massive omnibus bill--\n\n  That is the bill that is going to be on the floor in a short period \nof time. The DAV writes:\n\n       This massive omnibus bill, unprecedented in our modern \n     experience, would create, expand, advance, and extend a \n     number of VA benefits, services and programs that are \n     important to DAV and to our members. For example, responding \n     to a call from DAV as a leading veterans organization, it \n     would create a comprehensive family caregiver support \n     program for all generations of severely wounded, injured \n     and ill veterans. Also, the bill would authorize advance \n     appropriations for VA's mandatory funding accounts to \n     ensure that in any government shutdown environment in the \n     future, veterans benefits payments would not be delayed or \n     put in jeopardy. This measure also would provide \n     additional financial support to survivors of \n     servicemembers who die in the line of duty, as well as \n     expanded access for them to GI Bill educational benefits. \n     A two-plus year stalemate in VA's authority to lease \n     facilities for health care treatment and other purposes \n     would be solved by this bill. These are but a few--\n\n  ``A few''--\n\n     of the myriad provisions of this bill that would improve the \n     lives, health, and prospects of veterans--especially the \n     wounded, injured and ill--and their loved ones.\n\n  That is from the Disabled American Veterans. I thank them very much \nfor their support. The truth is that we have letters of support that \nare similar in nature from dozens of other veterans organizations, and \nwe thank them again for their support.\n  Madam President, may I ask the time situation--how much time each \nside has and how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 24 minutes remaining of the \n35 minutes originally granted, and the minority has 35 minutes.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Very good.\n  What I would like to do now is yield to the former chairperson of the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee, somebody who has done an outstanding job \nfor veterans. She has focused on one issue that I feel very strongly \nabout; that is, the need to help those veterans who would like to have \nchildren but as a result of war wounds are unable to do so.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, would the Senator yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfollowing the remarks of the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank you, Madam President. And I thank the chair of \nthe Veterans' Affairs Committee for putting together this very good \npiece of legislation we are about to consider.\n  It is no secret that in our Nation's Capital we are sharply divided \non any number of economic and political issues that are facing average \nAmericans right now. But I have come to the floor today to talk about \none issue on which we are rarely divided; that is, our duty to keep the \npromise we have made to provide not only care but opportunity to all \nthose who have honorably served in our Nation's Armed Forces. It unites \neven the most unlikely partners because we realize we have all made a \npromise to those who have signed up to serve, and we all need to keep \nit because there is so much on the line.\n  When our brave men and women volunteered to protect our Nation, we \npromised them we would take care of them and their families when they \nreturned home. We need to ask ourselves, are we doing enough for our \nNation's veterans? So this comprehensive legislation before us today \nreally is the test\n\n[[Page S1022]]\n\nfor a lot of Members of Congress. Can we put politics aside now for the \ngood of our Nation's veterans? Can we show these heroes, despite our \ndifferences, that we will work as diligently toward getting them the \nbenefits and care they have earned as they have worked for our Nation. \nI hope we can. And I say that because the investments in this bill are \na lot more than numbers on a page. They are life-changing programs for \nveterans who are looking to take the skills they have learned from the \nbattlefield to the boardroom. It is support for the countless victims \nof military sexual assault, who are desperate to come out of the \nshadows. It is providing the dream of having a family to those who are \nsuffering from some of the most devastating wounds of war. It is timely \ninvestment in the very biggest priorities of our Nation's heroes. So I \nwould like to use the remainder of my time to highlight just a few of \nthe investments that are included in this bill and how they translate \nto the lives of our veterans and their families.\n  For those who have worn our Nation's uniform, particularly for those \nyoung veterans who have spent the last decade being shuttled back and \nforth to war zones half a world away, the road home is not always \nsmooth, the redtape is often long, and the transition from the \nbattlefield to the workplace is never easy. This should not be the \ncase. We should not let the skills and training our Nation's veterans \nhave already attained go to waste. We cannot afford to have our \nNation's heroes unable to find a job to support their families, without \nan income that provides stability, or without work that provides the \npride and sense of purpose that is so critical to the transition home.\n  That is why I am proud that in this legislation we are considering \ntoday we reauthorize and build on many of the provisions that were part \nof my VOW to Hire Heroes Act, which was signed into law by President \nObama in 2011. Double-digit unemployment rates for veterans used to be \nthe norm, but since VOW became law the unemployment rate for post-9/11 \nveterans is now on par with nonveterans. And while recent data from the \nBureau of Labor Statistics proves that these programs work, we still \nhave more work to be done, and that is addressed in this legislation.\n  I also believe the great strength of our military is in the character \nand dedication of our men and women who wear the uniform. It is the \ncourage of these Americans to volunteer to serve that is the Pentagon's \ngreatest asset. Our servicemembers volunteer to face danger, to put \ntheir lives on the line, to protect our country and our people.\n  It is no longer a secret that sexual assault continues to plague the \nranks of our military services, which is another issue this \ncomprehensive legislation addresses. I think we all agree it is \nabsolutely unconscionable that a fellow servicemember--the person whom \nyou rely on to have your back and be there for you--would commit such a \nterrible crime. Even worse is the prevalence of these crimes. It is \nappalling that they commit such a personal violation of their brother \nor sister in uniform.\n\n  The National Defense Authorization Act that we passed last year took \nsome historic action to help servicemembers access the resources they \nneed to seek justice without fear, including a provision I authored to \ncreate a new category of legal advocates called special victims' \ncounsels who would be responsible for advocating on behalf of the \ninterests of the victim. But we still have a long road ahead of us \nbefore we put an end to these shameful acts and meanwhile provide all \nthe necessary resources to those who have, unfortunately, been \nimpacted. Thankfully, the chairman's legislation aims to do just that \nwith provisions to improve the delivery of care and benefits to \nveterans who experienced sexual trauma while serving in the military.\n  When our best and brightest put on a uniform and join the U.S. Armed \nForces, they do so with the understanding they will sacrifice much in \nthe name of defending our country and its people. But that sacrifice \nshould not have to come in the form of unwanted sexual contact from \nwithin the ranks.\n  Finally, I wish to talk today about a provision that has been one of \nmy top priorities in the Senate for a while now. It is a provision that \nbuilds upon our effort to improve VA services for women veterans and \nveterans with families.\n  As we all know, with the changing nature of our conflicts overseas, \nwe have been seeing the brutal impact of improvised explosive devices, \nor IEDs, which means we are now seeing more and more servicemembers--\nboth male and female--increasingly susceptible to reproductive, spinal, \nand traumatic brain injuries due to the weapons of war.\n  Thanks to modern medicine, many of these servicemembers are being \nkept alive, and they are returning home. Like so many of our veterans, \nthese men and women come home looking to return to their lives, to find \nemployment, and often to start a family. Yet what they find when they \ngo to the VA today is that the fertility services that are available do \nnot meet their very complex needs. In fact, veterans suffering from \nthese injuries find the VA is today specifically barred from providing \nmore advanced assisted reproduction techniques, such as IVF. They are \ntold that despite the fact that they have made such an extreme \nsacrifice for our country, we cannot today provide them with the \nmedical services they need to start a family.\n  These are veterans such as SSG Matt Keil and his wife Tracy. Staff \nSergeant Keil was shot in the neck while on patrol in Iraq in 2007--6 \nweeks after he married the love of his life, Tracy. The bullet went \nthrough the right side of his neck, it hit a major artery, it went \nthrough his spinal cord, and it exited through his shoulder blade. \nStaff Sergeant Keil instantly became a quadriplegic. Doctors told \nTracy, his wife, that her husband would be on a ventilator for the rest \nof his life and would never move his arms or his legs. Well, Staff \nSergeant Keil eventually defied the odds and found himself off that \nventilator and beginning the long journey of physical rehabilitation.\n  In fact, Tracy and her husband started talking and exploring the \npossibilities of having a family together. Having children was all they \ncould talk about once they started to adjust to their new normal. With \nStaff Sergeant Keil's injuries preventing him from having children \nnaturally, Tracy turned to the VA and began to explore her options for \nfertility treatments, but because of that VA ban she was turned down. \nSo Tracy and Staff Sergeant Keil decided instead to pursue IVF through \nthe private sector. Out of options, they decided this was important \nenough to them that they were willing to pay out of pocket to the tune \nof almost $32,000 per round of treatment.\n  Well, thankfully, on November 9, 2010, just after their first round \nof IVF, Staff Sergeant Keil and Tracy welcomed their twins, Matthew and \nFaith, into the world. Tracy told me--and I want to quote her:\n\n       The day we had our children something changed in both of \n     us. This is exactly what we had always wanted, our dreams had \n     arrived.\n       The VA, Congress and the American People have said \n     countless times [to us] that they want to do everything they \n     can to support my husband [and] make him feel whole again and \n     this is your chance.\n       Having a family is exactly what we needed to feel whole \n     again. Please help us make these changes [to the law] so that \n     other families can share in this experience.\n\n  Well, Tracy and Matt are not alone. There are many men and women out \nthere who share this common thread of a desperate desire to fulfill \ntheir dream of starting a family, only to find that catastrophic wounds \nthey sustained while defending our country are now preventing them from \nseeing that dream through.\n  As we all know, it should not be that way. Our Nation's heroes should \nnot have to spend tens of thousands of dollars in the private sector to \nget the advanced reproductive treatments they need to start a family. \nThey should not have to watch their marriages dissolve because of the \nstress of infertility in combination with the stresses of readjusting \nto a new life after severe injury, driving relationships to a breaking \npoint. Any servicemember who sustains this type of serious injury \ndeserves a lot more.\n  We came very close to making this bill a reality last Congress. In \nfact, with Tracy Keil sitting up in the gallery--like so many of our \nheroes who have joined us today--with Tracy watching, the Senate \nunanimously\n\n[[Page S1023]]\n\npassed this legislation. Unfortunately, what happened was that some \nRepublicans in the House of Representatives refused to take up this \nbill and pass it. So time ran out last year and we were not able to get \nit to the President's desk.\n  But this effort is not over. This provision was the very first piece \nof legislation I introduced in this Congress, and there is excellent \nmomentum to get it done. This is about giving our veterans, who \nsacrificed everything, every option we have to help them fulfill the \nsimple dream of having a family. It says we are not turning our backs \non the catastrophic reproductive wounds that have become a signature of \nthese wars.\n  It says to all those brave men and women who did not ask questions \nwhen they were put in harm's way that we will not let politics get in \nthe way of our commitment to you. This provision in the bill will \nreverse this troubling barrier to care and will bring the VA in line, \nfinally, with the military which does provide these services under \nTRICARE.\n  Our women veterans deserve this. Our male veterans deserve this. Our \nmilitary families deserve this. I am here today to urge my colleagues \nto support this bill, the Comprehensive Veterans Health and Benefits \nand Military Retirement Pay Restoration Act of 2014. Our veterans do \nnot ask for a lot. They should not have to. They have done everything \nthat has been asked of them. They have been separated from their \nfamilies through repeated deployments. They have sacrificed life and \nlimb in combat. They have done all of this selflessly and with honor to \nour country.\n  We cannot allow our commitment to them to lapse or to get caught up \nin any kind of unrelated amendments or political grandstanding. So I \nthank the Senator from Vermont and his staff for their tireless work to \nbring this legislation to the floor. I hope we do the right thing now \nand get this legislation passed and get this legislation to the desk of \nthe President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Republican whip.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I see the Senator from North Carolina is \nhere on the floor. I know he is likely here to respond to the Senator \nfrom Vermont and the Senator from Washington on the veterans bill that \nis on the floor, and what I believe is a much better alternative for us \nin dealing with the needs of our veterans in a way that is fiscally \nresponsible.\n  But what I would like to do is to turn to another story that \ncontinues to unfold worse and worse news over time, that unfortunately \nwe tend to get distracted from because there are so many other things \nthat are happening. But when the President's signature health care \nbill, the Affordable Care Act, was signed into law 4 years ago, we knew \nthat it did not just create a brand new health care entitlement. It \nactually weakened existing programs like Medicare and Medicaid.\n  For people who do not deal with these programs on a day-in and day-\nout basis, of course, Medicare is for seniors, for health care for \nseniors; Medicaid is a separate program which is shared by the States \nand the Federal Government to provide the safety net health care \nprogram for low-income Texans in my State.\n  But because of the massive new burdens that ObamaCare is placing on \nthe health care safety net, which is already failing the neediest \nmembers of society, the share of physicians accepting new Medicaid \npatients in Texas has fallen from 67 percent in 2000 to only 32 percent \nin 2012. So in 2000, 67 percent of physicians would accept a new \nMedicaid patient. Today it is roughly one-third, one out of every \nthree.\n  Of course, the reason for that is the Federal Government continues to \npay less and less. Now I think it is roughly 50 cents on the dollar \ncompared to private insurance to a physician who treats a Medicaid \npatient. So we know that many Texas physicians, including a majority of \nestablished primary care physicians, are not accepting new Medicaid \npatients at all because they are being asked essentially to work for 50 \ncents on the dollar, something they cannot afford to do.\n  Yet the architects of ObamaCare thought that it was a good idea to \nadd millions more people to a broken program, one that already was not \nproviding access to quality health care. This, of course, will further \nreduce the quality of Medicaid, which is one reason why many State \nGovernors refused the Federal Government's request to actually expand \nthe coverage of Medicaid absent reforms to fix it and make sure that it \nwould work more fairly and better and more cost effectively. Of course, \nthe consequence of that is it will make it even harder on the poorest \nand most vulnerable Americans to gain access to quality health care.\n  As for the Medicare program, of course that is for seniors, ObamaCare \ncreated a new panel of unelected bureaucrats known as the Independent \nPayment Advisory Board. What an innocuous bureaucratic-sounding name. \nSome people call it the IPAB. These are unelected bureaucrats who will \ndecide whether your health care is worth a cost-benefit analysis.\n  What they will end up doing is slashing Medicare payments to doctors \nso that many physicians can no longer afford to see new Medicare \npatients and provide the treatment that those patients and their \ndoctors believe they need and that they want. So it has become \nabundantly clear that the goal of ObamaCare is to make Medicare more \nlike Medicaid. We know what that means. We know it is not hard to \npredict, that fewer and fewer doctors will treat Medicare patients and \nsome will leave the program all together.\n  Why do we know that? Well, we have seen the experience with these new \nmajor cuts to Medicare Advantage. Not to confuse things too much, but \nMedicare Advantage is actually a private insurance alternative to \ntraditional Medicare which pays doctors based on the services they \nprovide. Medicare Advantage is a remarkably successful program that \ncovers roughly 30 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries, close to 16 \nmillion people.\n  The funds to those programs, to those 30 million, to that program \nthat benefits 30 million beneficiaries, are being slashed by \napproximately $308 billion as a result of ObamaCare. This is another \none of these hidden problems with ObamaCare that is now just coming to \nlight, even though we talked about it a lot back in 2009 and 2010. Now \nit is coming to fruition.\n  The truth is, these cuts in Medicare Advantage will force many \nseniors to pay higher premiums and further undermine their existing \nhealth care arrangements. You remember the President said: If you like \nwhat you have, you can keep it. If you like your doctor, you can keep \nyour doctor.\n  We are now learning that is absolutely not true in many cases. Just \nto give you a sense, though, of Medicare Advantage's popularity, \naccording to the Wall Street Journal, about one of two people newly \neligible for Medicare chose Medicare Advantage and enrollment is \ngrowing at a rate of roughly 10 percent per year.\n  Why is Medicare Advantage so popular compared to traditional Medicare \nfee for service? Well, for all the reasons you might expect. The \nprogram offers a lot more flexibility and much more patient choice than \ntraditional Medicare based on a number of different performance \nmeasures that also deliver better results than traditional Medicare. It \nhas become the primary driver of innovation within the Medicare system.\n\n  Yet we know, and we have known now for 4 years, and we are now seeing \nthat the reality is the administration is trying to undermine Medicare \nAdvantage to help pay for ObamaCare. Neither one is working the way the \nbeneficiaries of those programs expected and were promised they would \nwork.\n  Earlier this month I joined with 39 of my colleagues here in the \nSenate to send a letter to CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner urging \nher to ``maintain payment levels that will allow Medicare Advantage \nbeneficiaries to be protected from disruptive changes in 2015.'' Our \nletter described Medicare Advantage as ``a great success,'' noting that \none study published in the American Journal of Managed Care found that \n``the hospital readmission rates for [Medicare Advantage] enrollees are \n13-20 percent lower than for Medicare [fee-for-service] enrollees.''\n  In other words, it is more effective delivering quality care, keeping \nseniors healthy and reducing dramatically the need to have them \nreadmitted to hospitals once they are discharged.\n\n[[Page S1024]]\n\n  The Members who signed this letter were not just folks who work on \nthis side of the aisle. They included several prominent Democrats, such \nas my two colleagues from New York, the senior Senator from Minnesota, \nthe junior Senator from Massachusetts, the junior Senator from Oregon, \nand from Washington State, and from Colorado, who also happens to be \nthe Chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n  They signed this letter--39 Senators--saying: Please do not cut \nMedicare Advantage in a way that disadvantages current seniors. It is \nbad enough that ObamaCare is effectively taking money out of a \nsuccessful program, Medicare Advantage, to fund a new entitlement. It \nis bad enough that seniors are being forced to pay higher premiums and \ndeal with enormous uncertainty in order to facilitate a government \ntakeover of the health care system.\n  What makes it even worse is that ObamaCare continues to be an \nunmitigated disaster. Every day you pick up the newspaper, every day \nyou watch television: Millions of Americans have lost their preferred \nhealth insurance, and millions more are paying higher premiums for \ncoverage. Many families have discovered that their new ObamaCare-\nmandated coverage does not give their children access to their \npreferred doctors and hospitals.\n  As one physician from Washington State recently told CBS News:\n\n       We're seeing denials of care, disruptions in care; we're \n     seeing a great deal of confusion and, at times, anger and \n     frustration on the part of these families who bought \n     insurance thinking that their children were going to be \n     covered. And they've in fact found that it's a false promise.\n\n  A false promise--that is ObamaCare in a nutshell, if you think about \nit. A program that was sold as a way to help the uninsured and the \neconomy has instead hurt the economy and forced millions of Americans \nto lose their existing coverage--a false promise.\n  The Congressional Budget Office--the latest bit of bad news--now \nestimates that ObamaCare will reduce the size of the American labor \nforce by 2.5 million full-time workers over the next decade. Here is \nthe latest news. In addition, CMS has projected the law could lead to \nhigher insurance premiums for about 11 million employees at small \nbusinesses.\n  As for the promise of ``universal coverage''--do you remember, this \nwas the whole basis for government-mandated health care: Everybody is \ngoing to be covered. Well, when all is said and done, ObamaCare will, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office, leave upwards of 30 \nmillion people without health care coverage in 2023.\n  After witnessing a tidal wave of disruptions and hardships caused by \nhis signature legislative accomplishments, what is President Obama's \nresponse? His response is to either minimize the political damage, to \nkick the news past the November election, to delay the employer \nmandates, to refuse to enforce other provisions of the law, and to \nwaive the law which has no clear means for waiver. So basically, it is \nto refuse to enforce the law, to get it past the election. Let's cut \nthe bleeding, politically speaking.\n  Earlier this month, for the second time since July, the \nadministration announced they would unilaterally delay enforcement of \nthe employer mandate. Of course, the President--like so much of what he \ndoes these days--has no clear legal authority to do that, but our \ncolleagues across the aisle do not seem to care as long as they kick it \npast the election because they are worried about the accountability \nthat comes with this false promise made to sell ObamaCare.\n  Americans want the same type of health care reforms that they wanted \nback in 2009. There are plenty of alternatives, sensible patient-\ncentered reforms that will actually bring down the cost. You know, if \nyou want people to buy more of something, you reduce the cost. You do \nnot raise the cost. That creates just the opposite problem. We also \nknow there are alternatives to expand quality insurance coverage and \nimprove access to quality care.\n  I might just add--since I know the Senator from North Carolina has \nbeen patiently sitting there to speak on a different topic--that he and \nSenator Hatch and Senator Coburn have offered what has widely been \nheralded as a very sensible alternative approach to ObamaCare that \navoids the problems and reduces the costs, and it does not interfere \nwith patient choice.\n  We know ObamaCare promised these results, but it failed to deliver. \nIn response, we have many different alternative ideas that increase \npatient choice, increase transparency, and increase provider \ncompetition, all of which is designed to produce for consumers lower \ncost, wider coverage, and better quality care.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time exists on both \nthe majority and minority sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 21 minutes remaining on the \nRepublican side, 9\\1/2\\ minutes remaining on the Democratic side.\n  Mr. BURR. I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague for his \ncomments on the Affordable Care Act.\n  I am actually excited to be here having a debate about veterans and \nabout the promises we have made to those who are reliant on not only \nthe VA but on this institution to actually look at the programs and the \nservices provided, and when we, as a body, see deficiencies, reforming \nthem, fixing them, so our customer--who is that person who made that \nultimate sacrifice, who put on that uniform and, in many cases, now has \na lifetime disability because of it--can count on that health care \nsystem to be there.\n  I would have expected we would be on the floor debating in a \nbipartisan way those fixes that were needed to make sure that veterans \nwith disability claims didn't have to wait hundreds of days to \ndetermine whether they were going to have a disability that was signed \noff on and, if so, what the percentage was and that percentage then \nprovided them income.\n  I thought we would focus on the challenges the Senate has to reform \nhow the appeals process works. Because when a veteran is denied a \ndisability claim or he gets less than he thinks he should have been \nawarded, then he has the opportunity to appeal that to the court of \nappeals. The time now for the appeals decision has grown to years. It \nshouldn't be like this. It is absurd that the Congress of the United \nStates, much less the Veterans' Administration, is content with the \ndeficiencies we have in this broken system.\n  Instead of being here to look at fixes provided under the Sanders \nbill, we are here looking at how to expand the population of coverage. \nWe are here on programs that have had little to no hearings. We are \nhere without understanding the intended or the unintended consequences.\n  Let me share the knowledge I have of North Carolina where we have the \nlargest growing veterans population in America. I don't have the \nfacilities today to handle that veterans population in the timeframe \nAmericans are used to being delivered health care. I could go out and \nstart construction tomorrow, if my good friend the Presiding Officer \nwould allocate me the money, since he sits on the Appropriations \nCommittee, and build facilities, and I still couldn't meet the \nfacilities requirement needed to provide that level of care. As a \nmatter of fact, we have about $14 billion worth of construction \ncurrently underway in the country, and on an annual basis, this body--\nthe Congress of the United States--allocates about $1 billion in \nfacilities construction and maintenance money.\n  We have 14 years of backlog right now and we are not even \nanticipating what the effects are going to be of our current warriors \nwho have come out of Iraq, who will leave Afghanistan, who might enter \nSyria or who might be in a conflict down the road. No, we are here \ndebating in the Sanders bill a massive expansion in who is provided \nbenefits in the VA.\n  So who is that? It is veterans who have no service-connected \ndisability. It is veterans who are above the means-testing threshold. \nLet me put that in layman's terms. These are not people who are low \nincome and these are not people who have a service-connected \ndisability.\n  We are going to have days to debate this bill, and I will introduce \nan alternative. I will openly confess, upfront, that I don't get into \nfixes, because to do fixes there has to be bipartisanship. To reform \nprograms in the Federal\n\n[[Page S1025]]\n\nagencies, Republicans and Democrats have to come together.\n  We are here today because there was no outreach to attempt to put \ntogether a compromise bill. If the conversation we had about a day \nbefore we left a week ago, where my colleague said, this is what I am \ngoing to do, why don't you sign on, but he wasn't willing to talk about \nchanges--if that was compromise, then he did that. But I don't consider \nthat to be compromise. I don't consider it to be good-faith \nnegotiation.\n  But that is behind us. We now have this bill to consider, and it is a \nmassive expansion. And what does it do? It basically says to those \nwarriors who have service-connected disabilities, those individuals who \nare low income--and this is where they get their service, their health \ncare--you are going to have to wait in a bigger line. You are going to \nhave to get behind more people. So what veterans expect, which is that \nthe most needy will receive the services they need, is not what this \nbill does. It is not at all what it does.\n  As a matter of fact, section 301 of the Sanders bill would expand \neligibility of the VA health care system. It would qualify to enroll in \nthe VA health care as priority 8 veterans if they do not have access to \nhealth insurance except through a health exchange and do not qualify \nfor higher priority.\n  Before getting into my concerns about this affected section and what \nimpact it would have on VA, I wish to comment on how this section has \nbeen drafted. The section says:\n\n       If a veteran qualifies as a priority 8 veteran and has no \n     other option but the health exchange under the Affordable \n     Care Act, they could enroll in the VA.\n\n  Let me read that again:\n\n       If a veteran qualifies as a priority 8 veteran and has no \n     other option but the health exchange under the Affordable \n     Care Act, they can enroll in the VA.\n\n  We have just mandated that everybody in this country--except when the \nPresident delays the mandate--has to be under the Affordable Care \nAct and they are part of the health exchange. Here we are saying to \npriority 8 veterans, if your only option is the health exchange, we \nwill let you opt into the VA. Well, if the health exchange is that \ngood, why would we dare risk all other veterans who have service-\nconnected disabilities or low incomes having to wait behind people who \nwere provided health care out of the health exchange?\n\n  Some priority 8 veterans may even qualify for a subsidy under the \nexchange, something they would not receive if they were to enroll in VA \nhealth care. I don't know, are they concerned these veterans will be \nunable to find a plan that meets their needs? Everybody else in America \nwas shoved into it. Why should we be concerned about them?\n  My intention today isn't to open a health care debate. I do have \nserious concerns about this expansion. Expanding eligibility could \nstress an already overburdened system. There is a reason why the \npriority 8 veterans program was halted. The VA found they could not \nprovide timely access to services while sustaining a high level of \ncare. And judging by the well over 30 health care inspectors reports \nissued by the Office of Inspector General in this Congress alone, the \nVA is having trouble with the limited group they currently serve.\n  Here are some examples of the IG's health care inspections report \nreleased since January 2013: 1. Three deaths in Atlanta because of \ndelays in mental health care; 2. Two reports regarding delays in GI \nconsults and issues with facilities operating services in Columbia, SC; \n3. Emergency department patient death at the Memphis VA center; 4. Two \nreports on the inappropriate use of insulin pens at both the VA Western \nNew York Healthcare System and the Salisbury VA Medical Center; and 5. \nTwo reports on Legionnaires' disease at VA Pittsburgh and a review of \nLegionnaires' disease prevention at VHA facilities.\n  If we expand enrollment, if we expand the coverage, it would surely \nrequire an increase in funding at the VA. When we increase the number \nof patients entering the system, we certainly need to hire additional \nstaff and to provide more space to treat the new veterans. I have \nalready talked about the 14-year backlog we have on facilities now. \nWithout followthrough on secondary cost, we only frustrate veterans \nwhen their expectations aren't met, not satisfy them.\n  I truly believe if we expand government programs we need to do it \nresponsibly. We need to understand the intended consequences and plan \nfor the unintended consequences. We should explore whether the VA can \nmanage the implementation of this expansion. We should explore what \nimpact this will have on the VA's ability to treat combat veterans and \nveterans with limited incomes and find out what new needs, both in \nstaffing and space, would be created by this expansion.\n  Unfortunately, we don't know the answers to these questions, because \nin preparation for this section the majority didn't hold an oversight \nhearing looking specifically at the consequences--intended or \nunintended--to expand enrollment of priority 8 veterans. In fact, the \nonly hearing on this subject was a hearing on legislation pending \nbefore the committee on October 30, 2013. At that hearing we heard \ntestimony on three dozen bills--clearly, not enough time to examine the \ndetails of any of the 30 bills.\n  From their testimony at the hearing, the VA obviously agrees with me. \nDr. Robert Jessie, Principal Deputy Under Secretary for Health, \nindicated that expanding enrollment of priority 8 veterans ``presents \nmany potential complications and uncertain effects on VA's enrollment \nsystem.'' That comes from a guy pretty high up within the Veterans' \nAdministration. They are not necessarily for this.\n  Finally, I want to address a comment my colleague from Vermont made \nat a press conference a few weeks ago. He said:\n\n       We're not going to bring one new person in without making \n     absolutely certain that the VA has the resources to \n     accommodate those people.\n\n  As I read the bill, there is nothing in this provision or in the bill \nitself that would restrict implementation in that way. However, I would \ngladly support an amendment which would delay this provision until GAO \nreports that the VA could manage this additional population of \nveterans.\n  Mr. President, you might be thinking, as others who are listening \nmight, what does all this cost? How is it paid for? Is the funding \nrecurring or is it one-time funding? Is it permanent expansion?\n  Let me try to answer some of that for you. The way the Sanders bill \nis paid for is with money out of the overseas contingency operations. \nThat is more money we were going to spend that we haven't spent, that \nwe never had because we were borrowing it, and now we are going to use \nit to expand this. It is one-time funding for a permanent program. Let \nme say that again. It is one-time funding for a permanent program.\n  It is not as though we are going to fund this expansion of priority \n8s, and all of a sudden, when OCO money is gone, we say: Oops, we \ndidn't mean it; we are going to pull it back. No, these are going to be \nin the system regardless of the impact, regardless of the consequences.\n  So who is adversely affected? Today's warriors. The same warriors who \nare waiting in line to get health care services are now going to \ncompete for a limited number of slots to be seen by people who might \nhave had private insurance, by people who might have been in the health \ncare exchange, by individuals who are not low income and who have no \nservice-connected disability. Who else? Those veterans with disability \nclaims who are waiting for a determination. I mean these veterans are \ngoing to be impacted by this because we will have such an influx of \npeople within the system. Veterans are waiting for disposition of their \ndisability claims, their appeals. Those who have gone back and have \nwaited, they have finally gone through hundreds of days for a claim to \nbe determined only to find out they have to appeal it. Now they are \ngoing to go through hundreds of days of appeal, and we are saying we \nare going to have to start using some of these people to administer new \nservices which far exceed and are outside of priority 8 which I focused \non. But we will talk about the entirety of this bill as the next \nseveral days go on.\n\n  The last one, and I will stop for this afternoon: Who is adversely \naffected? Our kids, our grandchildren, the ones who sit at home today \nhoping the decisions we make about future obligations\n\n[[Page S1026]]\n\ntake into account that they are paying the tab. They are the ones who \nwill be here years from now keeping the promises we make, and they are \nhoping we only make the ones we can keep.\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes.\n  Mr. BURR. I will tell a personal story about a trip to one of our \nmilitary cemeteries abroad.\n  We were in the country of Belgium. I was there for a Memorial Day \nservice. Much to my amazement, there were probably 4,000 to 5,000 \nindividuals.\n  We got through with the formalities of a very well-constructed \nMemorial Day celebration. As I wandered through the graves, I found a \nBelgium couple with their two young children at the headstone of an \nAmerican soldier from World War II. I asked them one simple question: \nWhy are you here?\n  The Belgium father, younger than I, looked at me and he said: Sir, I \ninherited this grave from my father. My father took the responsibility \nfor this grave to always make sure it was just like it was the day he \ngot it. I have now inherited that from my father, and my children will \ninherit that responsibility from me.\n  I know there are a lot of veterans organizations who hope Senator \nSanders' bill becomes law, but I think there are a lot of veterans who \nare hoping it doesn't: the veterans who need the VA system and count on \nit for their mental health treatment, for their substance abuse \ntreatment, for their primary care. They count on it for diabetes \nmaintenance, they count on it to stay alive, and we promised it to \nthem.\n  I am sure future generations will look at the decisions we make this \nweek and will belly up to the bar for whatever it costs, but I think it \nis important for us to remember our obligations stretch long past our \nservice here. Although it seems somewhat easy to spend somebody else's \nmoney, our kids want us to reform this, our veterans want us to reform \nthis, the VA wants us to reform this.\n  Once we reform it, we can talk about expansion. Until then, it is \nirresponsible for the Congress of the United States--for the Senate of \nthe United States--to talk about dumping more people into a broken \nsystem, to ask those who have already waited so long to wait longer \nbecause of our actions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank my colleague from North Carolina, the ranking \nmember of the Veterans' Committee, for his remarks. I look forward to \ndebating some of the issues the Senator raised because I think it is \nimportant for not just the veterans of this country but the tens of \nmillions of people who support our veterans to understand what we are \ntrying to do to improve lives for those people who have put their lives \non the line to defend this country.\n  I did find it interesting that the ranking member from North Carolina \nsuggested in so many words, yes, this bill does have the support of the \nAmerican Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American \nVeterans, the Vietnam Veterans of America, the Military Officers \nAssociation of America, the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, \nParalyzed Veterans of America, Gold Star Wives of America, and dozens \nof other veterans organizations, but the implication was they may be \nsupporting this bill but veterans back home do not. I doubt that very \nmuch. In fact, I happen to believe these organizations do a very good \njob in representing the interests of their veterans and that they \nlisten to the veterans.\n  As the ranking member understands, this bill was put together not \nfrom my head, not from his head or any Member of the Senate's head. We \nlistened to the veterans community which came forward before the \nCongress. In fact, today there was a joint session--which I had to miss \nbecause I was here--with the DAV, and then we are going to hear from \nthe American Legion, from the VFW--we are going to hear from all the \nveterans organizations.\n  This bill represents what those veterans organizations said the \nveterans community needs. I strongly disagree with the Senator from \nNorth Carolina in suggesting the veterans organizations do not do an \neffective job in representing their membership.\n  The other point I will make is that I look forward to this debate. \nEvery now and then it is a good idea to have a debate on real issues on \nthe floor of the Senate, so I look forward to this debate. But in terms \nof the suggestion that this is not a bipartisan bill--I do understand \nabsolutely not every word in here nor every source of funding is \nsupported by our Republican colleagues, but as chairman of the \nVeterans' Committee, I have worked as hard as I could--and I believe \nthe ranking member knows this--to develop as best I could a bipartisan \npiece of legislation. I remind all the Members of the Senate and the \nAmerican people this legislation contains a significant number of \nprovisions authored and supported by Republican members of the \nVeterans' Committee, including my friend from North Carolina. In fact, \nto the best of my knowledge, there are some 26 separate provisions \nwhich Republican Members have authored or cosponsored. That is not an \ninsignificant number.\n  Further, perhaps two of the most prominent provisions are the omnibus \nbills. That is when we collect the number of different bills and we put \nthem into one pot. We did that on two occasions. As the ranking member \nknows, the vote on each of those omnibus bills was unanimous. Every \nDemocrat, every Republican, and the Independent chairman of the \ncommittee voted for them. In truth, other important provisions were \npassed--not unanimously, of course, but they did pass in many cases \nwith bipartisan support.\n  Furthermore, this bill contains two key bipartisan provisions passed \noverwhelmingly by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.\n  So let me acknowledge that not every provision in this bill was \nbrought before the committee. That is true. But the two major \nprovisions which were not brought before this committee are bipartisan \nand in fact have been passed overwhelmingly by the Republican-\ncontrolled House.\n\n  With almost unanimous votes, the House passed the same provision \nincluded in the Senate bill which would solve a longstanding problem to \nauthorize the VA to enter into 27 major medical facility leases in 18 \nStates and Puerto Rico.\n  My friend talks about the fact that we need more infrastructure for \nour veterans. He is right. This bill provides 27 major medical facility \nleases in 18 States and Puerto Rico, and in an absolutely \noverwhelmingly bipartisan vote that language was passed in the House.\n  The second bill--not included in our discussions in the Senate \ncommittee--also passed with very broad support in the House--deals with \nensuring that veterans can take full advantage of the post-9/11 GI bill \nand get instate tuition in the State in which they currently live. If I \nam not mistaken, I believe my friend supports that provision.\n  It is fair to say not every provision was debated in the committee. \nHe is right. But the two major provisions that were not, were passed \nwith overwhelming support in the House and I believe will pass with \noverwhelming support in this body and are included in this legislation.\n  I believe virtually every Member of the Senate, regardless of his or \nher ideology, cares about veterans--and I know the Senator from North \nCarolina does--and all of us want to do the very best we can. That is \nwhy I have worked so hard with Members of my committee, with \nRepublicans and Democrats, to make this bill as bipartisan as it \npossibly could be. I am not here to say it is 100 percent bipartisan. \nIt is not. But we worked hard, and there are significant and major \nprovisions in this bill which come from my Republican colleagues \nbecause they were good ideas. As chairman of the committee, my view is \nwe don't reject an idea because somebody has an ``R'' next to their \nname. If they have a good idea, it is in the bill.\n  May I ask the President how much time remains.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I will very briefly touch on some of the other \nprovisions in the bill.\n  We restore full COLA for military retirees. As we all know, the House \nand the Senate passed and the President signed the bill to undo the \nprovision in the Budget Act, but they did not include those members of \nthe military\n\n[[Page S1027]]\n\nwho signed up after January 2014. They are still suffering from a cut \nin the COLA. We address that.\n  This bill does expand VA health care and among other ways it provides \ndental care. I don't know about other States, but in my State--and I \nsuspect all over this country--in talking to veterans, they think \ndental care is part of health care. Right now, except for service-\nconnected situations, dental care is not provided. We have a major \npilot project to say to veterans: Yes, dental care is part of VA health \ncare and you can get that.\n  As to advanced appropriations for the VA, not everybody knows this, \nbut we were 7 to 10 days away from disabled veterans not getting their \nchecks when the government was shut down. This legislation ensures \nveterans receive consistent access to the benefits they have earned by \nestablishing advanced appropriations for the mandatory accounts at VA.\n  We move forward in a bipartisan way to end the benefits backlog. My \ncolleague from North Carolina pointed out it is a serious issue. \nEverybody agrees it is a serious issue. I think the VA is making some \nprogress. This legislation has significant language to help the VA move \nforward in that area.\n  This legislation would extend from 5 years to 10 years unfettered \naccess to VA health care for recently separated veterans to address \ntheir health care needs early.\n  This legislation renews our vow to hire veterans, making sure \nveterans get the employment opportunities many are now lacking when \nthey come back from Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  This legislation deals in a significant way with the horrendous issue \nof sexual assault, making sure victims of sexual assault--women and \nmen--get the care they need at the VA.\n  I will conclude by saying this is a serious bill which deals with a \nvery serious issue. My hope is every Member treats the needs of \nveterans with the respect they deserve. I look forward to the debate \nwhich I am confident we will have.\n  Clearly, this is not a perfect bill, and I know there are Members who \nhave ideas as to how they can improve it. This is what the legislative \nprocess is about. My sincere hope, however, is amendments which are \nbrought forth deal with veterans issues and not amendments which are \nnot relevant and not germane to this discussion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. The ranking member and I have disagreements, and that is \nwhat the legislative process is about. Let's debate the issues on the \nfloor.\n  I hope we show our respect to the veterans by not getting into issues \nthat have nothing to do with veterans' needs. I hope we are not off \ndebating Iran or ObamaCare or gay marriage or whatever it may be. I \nguess those are good political issues for some people. I hope people \nunderstand how significant and important the issue itself is--the needs \nof our veterans--and we stay focused on that issue as we bring forth \namendments.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the chairman of the \ncommittee. He is right when he said we have a lot of agreements. As a \nmatter of fact, about 80 percent of the policies in his bill are in my \nalternative bill, but I have a big problem with the other 20 percent. I \nhave a problem with the cost. I have a problem with the unintended \nconsequences. I wish we could figure out the intended consequences, but \nwe cannot because there has not been much time to do it.\n  I look forward to the next several days. I believe the chairman made \na plea that the amendments be limited to VA issues. That might be \npossible if the minority had the opportunity to amend legislation in \nthis institution. I think we have had four votes on Republican \namendments since July. To suggest that Iran is not important is, in \nfact, turning a blind eye on the world.\n  In my bill I have a piece of legislation that is cosponsored by 59 \nSenators, and it is bipartisan. My legislation is the Iran sanctions \nbill. Why? Because it is the only way we can get this to the floor. We \nhave been denied the opportunity to deal with this issue in any other \nway. This is important to the American people, and it is important to \nour friends and allies around the world. I am sure it will dominate \npart of the debate.\n  Make no mistake about it, the one matter the chairman didn't point to \nwas what we are fixing. We are adding a lot of stuff, but we are not \nfixing anything. Ask any veteran.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask for an additional 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURR. If you ask any veteran about the areas that need reform, I \nbelieve they would tell Chairman Sanders, just like they would tell me: \nYes, there are a lot of places that need reform. To suggest that should \nnot be part of this debate is ludicrous.\n  I look forward to the next several days, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport getting on this bill and to vote yea when they come to the \nfloor for this next vote.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before \nthe Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 301, S. 1982, the Comprehensive \n     Veterans Health Benefits and Military Retirement Pay \n     Restoration Act.\n         Harry Reid, Bernard Sanders, Tom Harkin, Brian Schatz, \n           Mary L.

Leahy, Robert P. \n           Casey, Jr., Joe Donnelly, Jon Tester, Barbara Boxer, \n           Richard Blumenthal, Sherrod Brown, Barbara Mikulski.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived. The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate \nthat debate on the motion to proceed to S. 1982, a bill to improve the \nprovision of medical services and benefits to veterans, and for other \npurposes, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Florida (Mr. Nelson) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 99, nays 0, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 44 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--99\n\n     Alexander\n     Ayotte\n     Baldwin\n     Barrasso\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Blumenthal\n     Blunt\n     Booker\n     Boozman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Burr\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Coats\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coons\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     Cruz\n     Donnelly\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Fischer\n     Flake\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Heinrich\n     Heitkamp\n     Heller\n     Hirono\n     Hoeven\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Johnson (SD)\n     Johnson (WI)\n     Kaine\n     King\n     Kirk\n     Klobuchar\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Lee\n     Levin\n     Manchin\n     Markey\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Moran\n     Murkowski\n     Murphy\n     Murray\n     Paul\n     Portman\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Rubio\n     Sanders\n     Schatz\n     Schumer\n     Scott\n     Sessions\n     Shaheen\n     Shelby\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Toomey\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Vitter\n     Walsh\n     Warner\n     Warren\n     Whitehouse\n     Wicker\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Nelson\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 99, the nays are 0. \nThree-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the \naffirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I would like to spend a little bit of time \noffering a viewpoint different from the viewpoint of the chairman of \nthe committee on this bill.\n  First of all, I want to say by context that my father and his two \nbrothers all served in World War II. My two brothers served during the \nVietnam era.\n\n[[Page S1028]]\n\nThere is no question we have an obligation to meet our commitments to \nthose who have put their lives and futures on the line for this \ncountry.\n  But it pains me that, although we have increased spending 58 percent \nin the VA programs since 2009, which was fiscal year 2010, what we have \nseen is a complete lack of oversight of what is happening. Let my give \nan example. The VA Committee in the Senate last year held 30 hearings, \n4 of which were oversight. If you read the transcripts of those \nhearings, you cannot call them oversight hearings even though they were \nbilled as oversight hearings.\n  Why is that important? It is important because there are a multitude \nof significant, serious problems in the Veterans' Administration. Just \n2 days ago it was discovered that in an L.A. VA clinic, the staff of \nthe clinic destroyed the medical records of thousands of people so that \nwhen they do the metric on how far behind they are, we cannot measure \nit; or the fact that 82 veterans last year died of carcinomas through \ndelayed diagnosis because they could not get a diagnostic procedure, \nsuch as a colonoscopy; or the fact that we have all these veterans who \ncannot access mental health care, and we see the suicide rate--\nunacceptable, to say the least.\n  So we have a bill on the floor that massively--and that is a small \nword for what this bill does--massively expands the authority and the \nability of the VA to offer care to another 14 million veterans--from 6 \nmillion to 20 million.\n  On a system today that cannot keep up, we have 600,000 people waiting \nfor a disability determination. We are not having oversight hearings on \nthat. We are not having oversight hearings on a South Carolina VA \nhospital where people are dying from malpractice like crazy. We are not \nhaving the oversight hearings to hold the VA accountable. What we are \ndoing is putting a bill to expand their responsibilities instead of \nholding them accountable for the responsibilities they have today. That \nis what we should be doing. Instead, we are going to add $60 billion. \nAnd that is a conservative number. That is my number.\n  But all you have to do is look at what the cost and the efficiency \nand the outcomes are through the VA system to see that we are going to \ndiminish the veterans caregiver program by expanding it to everybody. \nWe are going to create all sorts of new programs and no resources to \nactually provide them. And we are going to create more advanced \nfunding, advanced appropriations, which will limit our ability to hold \nthem capable and culpable in the future.\n  There are a lot of things we ought to be doing for our veterans right \nnow that are already in law that we are not doing, and we come to the \nfloor with a massive expansion at a time when we cannot even care for \nwhat we are doing. As a physician who trained in VA hospitals, I know \nthe difference in the level of care. I can assure you it has not gotten \nany better. From my colleagues I speak to in the medical profession and \nfrom the veterans whom I talk to who contact me, it has gotten far \nworse. It does not have to be that way, but it will always be that way \nif, in fact, we continue to not hold those in leadership positions \naccountable for not stepping to the bar for performance, quality, and \noutcome.\n  From Congress to the Pentagon, we must reassess what laws, \nregulations, and rules can be changed to ensure that benefits and other \ndecisions the Veterans' Administration makes are beyond reproach and \nbased on the best facts available. Let's ensure that the Department's \nlimited resources are focused on its core mission rather than disbursed \nin an effort to remedy every possible problem for every veteran. \nRemember, when everyone is first priority, no one is. That is what this \nbill is. We diminish the priority of the commitments we have made to \nthe veterans who are out there today.\n  Our veterans are looking to us for help. We are about to enact \nlegislation that is going to further strain the ability of the VA to do \nits most basic charge: help with the health care, mental health, and \ncapability of those who have put it all on the line for this country.\n  It is shameful that Congress now is trying to claim credit for \nproviding new benefits while our old promises are forgotten. Our \nheroes--our heroes--are literally dying at the hands of malpractice, \nincompetency, and delay.\n  If we really wanted to care for our veterans--those with service-\nconnected disabilities--what we would say is, go wherever you want to \ngo to get whatever you need because you served this country. And it \nactually would cost less. But because we pile them into a broken system \nnow--and that is not all VA organizations. Let me clarify that. There \nare some excellent VA hospitals that do great work. Their specialists \nare far ahead of the private sector. But on general grounds, to put a \nveteran at a place with less than the best possible care dishonors \ntheir service to this country--dishonors their service to our country.\n  Veterans are our heroes. They are the symbol of our country of \nsacrifice, of giving for others. Yet we have four oversight hearings in \na year? With the multitude of problems that are going on in the VA \nhospitals and the Veterans' Administration in terms of disability \ndetermination, we have four? The House had 34 oversight hearings, and \nthey were rigorous. When you ask members of the committee: Have you \nread the House oversight hearings? No. They had 26 regular hearings and \n34 oversight hearings trying to hold the VA accountable.\n  We are not going to hold the VA accountable with this bill. We are \ngoing to make them less accountable. And that is a disservice to the \nvery people who have honored us by serving in the military of this \ncountry.\n  As of February 15, 2014, the VA has 677,000 claims pending for \ndisability compensation. Why should it take a year for somebody who put \ntheir butt on the line for this country and received an injury and is \ndisabled? Why should it take a year for us to determine that we owe \nthem an extra bit of compensation and availability?\n  What is being done to fix that? We have a VA regional center in my \nhome town, with good employees, hard-working employees. They are not \ndestroying files so they can say they met a metric. Veterans seeking \nmental health treatment still experience weeks-long delays scheduling \nappointments. The epidemic of overprescription of opiates--let me say \nthat again--there is an epidemic of overprescription of opiates for \nthose people who served our country, making them dependent addicts \nbecause we give them the wrong treatments.\n  There are avoidable veterans deaths at the VA. In a recent story by \nCNN on misdiagnosis and improper care for gastrointestinal conditions, \nthere were 2-year consultation delays--2 years to get in to see a \nspecialist at the VA when you are losing blood. How do we explain that? \nWho is accountable? We are, because we are not holding them \naccountable.\n  There were 82 deaths last year alone--I am sure that is a far \nunderstatement--because of delayed diagnosis for just investigative \nendoscopies. That is just what is documented. How do we accept that? \nHad they been in the private sector, they would not have had a delay. \nThey would not be dead.\n  So here is the proposal that I would put out. Do our veterans deserve \nthe best of care in this country? I think they do. Should they be able \nto get that care where they know the quality, they know the outcomes \nand the transparency as to what their future might be or must they be \nforced into a system that is going to give them something less? That is \nwhere we are today.\n  The chairman in his bill increases VA medical care for everybody who \nserved without a disability. What will that do to the VA system? We \ncannot handle what we have in front of us now in terms of those who \nhave a percentage medical disability that allows them access to the VA \nhealth care system.\n  So when you triple that or more than triple it, where are the \nresources? If we really mean what we say in this bill, you are talking \nhundreds of billions of dollars over 10 years. You are not talking the \n$30 billion that the chairman says is what the cost is. You are talking \nhundreds of billions. But the point I would make is we have an \ninfrastructure out there that can care for our veterans. It is the \nhospitals all around the country. It is the doctors all around the \ncountry. Does a veteran not have the right to get the best care? Should \nwe not give him a card and say: You served this country. Here is your\n\n[[Page S1029]]\n\nservice connection. Here is your disability. You can get care at a VA \nhospital, if you want, or you can get care wherever you want.\n  But I will guarantee you what will happen is, if we give what was \npromised to the veterans--not what we are giving today--real care, real \nopportunity with real transparency as the outcome, what you will see is \nmarked improvement in care, marked improvement in outcomes, no change \nin additional cost--no change in additional cost--and access that is \npromised but not denied and delayed.\n  In one South Carolina VA facility alone, 20 veterans are either dead \nor dying of cancer because of delayed diagnoses. They had the symptoms \nand presented them to the hospital, but because of delay and \nincompetency--just that one hospital.\n  The other thing we know is veterans' malpractice claims are markedly \nincreasing--markedly. All you have to do is look at the OIG report on \nthe claims of deficiencies at the VA in New Haven, CT. Contamination, \ncross-contamination, inadequate procedures for infection precautions, \nabsence of employees that are supposed to be on duty when they are not, \nfailure to clean operating rooms properly, failure to have the proper \nventilation system in an operating room for a contaminated case. That \nis just one hospital.\n  What does that mean in real life? What that means in real life is the \nrisk for iatrogenic or facility or physician-caused infection goes \nthrough the roof--not the fault of the physician but the fault of the \nVA for not managing the system properly.\n  Former VA epidemiologist, Dr. Steven Coughlin, testified before the \nHouse Veterans' Affairs Committee that the VA failed to follow up on \nover 2,000 veterans who indicated in VA surveys that they were \nexperiencing suicidal thoughts. When the HVAC followed up on Dr. \nCoughlin's claims, they found that they were validated. Unfortunately, \ntoo many of those who had suggested their problems committed suicide. \nIt is a little late.\n  Because Dr. Coughlin brought this up, he was admonished, bullied, and \nintimidated for speaking about the ethical lapses at the VA. Where is \nthe oversight hearing? You see, if we are not going to hold the VA \naccountable, the quality of care is not going to rise to the level that \nour veterans deserve.\n  Another area is this. The VA wasted $3 billion over the past 10 years \nbecause they failed to secure competitive market prices for surgical \nimplants. That is $3 billion. That is documented. That is a GAO study. \nGAO did that. We did not do it. We did not find it. Oh, by the way, at \nthe end of the year when they had some money to spend, about $600,000 \nworth of artwork was purchased, instead of putting it into additional \ndoctors, cleaning operating rooms, additional people to secure \nclearances on disability.\n  By expanding VA care and the potential of 22 million more veterans, \nyou can guarantee that the veterans who are getting care now are going \nto get poorer quality and less access to care. You can guarantee that. \nThat is what this bill is really about. This bill is really about a \ndecrease in the requirements for care for our veterans. It is not about \nan increase. It is about a decrease because when you flood that system \nwith people who do not have a service-connected disability, what will \nhappen is this. Easy goes first and hard goes last. I have seen that in \nthe VA my whole life.\n  There is also an expansion in the caregivers program. I am not sure I \ndisagree with it. But certainly, for those after 9/11 a commitment \nought to not be diminished if we expand this program. The minimum cost \nfor that is $9.5 billion. The VA has not yet met its full obligation \nunder the VA caregivers law that we have today. Yet we are not holding \nthem accountable.\n  There is another area in this bill that I think is tragic. It is well \nintended, but it mandates that the University of West Virginia or the \nUniversity of Oklahoma must give in-State tuition to anybody from \nanywhere that has ever served or they lose their benefits under the GI \nbill. That totally ignores the Constitution in this country.\n  Now, 20 States have already said they are doing that. Ten others have \nbills in the process. Eight others have a partial. So we are at 38 of \nthe 50 States right now. But in our vision, we are going to mandate \nthat the Tenth Amendment does not mean anything, that the 80 percent of \nfunding on higher education in Oklahoma that comes from people in the \nState of Oklahoma, that we can co-opt that and coerce them and tell \nthem what they are going to do.\n  It is well intended. But it is certainly not constitutional. It \ncertainly does not respect the Tenth Amendment of the United States. \nDoes Oklahoma or West Virginia have the right to make a decision on who \nthey give in-State tuition to? Why not just pass a law that says: Every \nState will give in-State tuition to everybody.\n  The reason it was connected with States is because of State funding. \nWe totally trample that. Again, the advanced appropriations will limit \nour ability to hold those people accountable for the very things that I \nhave described to you. But we are going to do it anyway.\n\n       A proposal to expand VA advanced appropriations needs to be \n     considered by the administration as a part of an across-the-\n     government review of the advantages and disadvantages of such \n     progress, not only for the VA but potentially other programs \n     and agencies. Only in the context of such a broad review \n     could the administration offer an opinion on making such a \n     change for the VA. Therefore, we cannot offer a position.\n\n  That is from the VA. The real answer is: Give us advanced \nappropriations, and then it is only after the fact that you can hold us \naccountable, not during the fact.\n  Here is another GAO study that we should be highly concerned about. \nThe VA--this is the GAO--has no idea how long most patients wait to \nreceive care. They do not even know their own metrics.\n\n       It is unclear how long veterans are waiting to receive care \n     in VA's medical facilities because the reported data are \n     unreliable, because VA hospitals have tried to cover up wait \n     times, fudge numbers, and backdate delayed appointments in \n     an effort to make things better than they are.\n\n  That is directly from a GAO report. Where is the oversight hearing on \nthat; or the L.A. facility that just destroyed medical records so \nnobody could know how long people had been waiting for appointments?\n  Based on GAO recommendations to improve reliability of reported wait \ntimes for new medical appointments in 2013, the VA changed the way it \ntracks and calculates its performances. Using the new tracking method \nin 2013, the VA reported only 41 percent of veterans were scheduled for \na new primary care appointment and only 40 percent of veterans were \nscheduled for a new specialty appointment within the 14-day standard.\n  So 40 percent of the time, with the 6 million veterans we have now, \nthey are getting adequate timely care, and 60 percent are not. Yet we \nare going to expand that to 22 million, and we don't have the resource \nbase or the facility base or the employee base or the professional base \nor the caregiver base to do that?\n  In contrast, in 2012 the VA reported that 90 percent of new primary \nappointments and 95 percent of specialty appointments had met the 14-\nday standard.\n  The VA exam requests backlog purge. VA employees destroyed veterans' \nmedical records to cancel backlog exam requests.\n  That is from Patrick Howley, again.\n  Oliver Mitchell, a marine veteran and former patient services \nassistant at the Los Angeles VA system, told the Daily Caller: We just \ndidn't have the resources to conduct all those exams. Basically we \nwould get 3,000 requests a month for medical exams, but in a 30-day \nperiod we only had the resources to do about 800. That is 25 a day. \nThat rolls over to the next month and creates a backlog. It is a \nnumbers thing. The waiting list counts against the hospital's \nefficiency. The longer a veteran waits for an exam, it counts against \nthe hospital as far as productivity is concerned. Some patients were \nwaiting 6 to 9 months for an exam, and the VA didn't know how to \naddress the issue.\n  Is the answer to open this to another 16 million veterans or is the \nanswer to improve the efficiency, transparency, quality, and outcomes \nof the present VA system before we go about expanding this system to \npeople who are otherwise covered?\n  Mr. Mitchell, when he tried to sound the alarm on the VA's deliberate \nattempt to fraudulently reduce the backlog, was transferred out of his \ndepartment and eventually terminated from\n\n[[Page S1030]]\n\nhis job. After he contacted Congress in 2011--2 months later when the \nVA found out about it--he was fired.\n  So do we really want transparency in what we are doing? Do we really \nwant to know what is going on? Do we really want to fix the system? Do \nwe really want to offer health care to veterans and make it equal to \nwhat they can get in the private sector or do we want to say we want to \noffer all these new benefits at the same time we are not meeting our \ncommitment on the benefits we have already promised? That is the game \nthat is being played.\n  Earlier I said the VA said the Committee on Veterans Affairs held 30 \nhearings. They only held 16--16 hearings; 1 every 3 weeks.\n  The annual budget of the Department of Veterans Affairs exceeded $134 \nbillion a year. Delay in vet care is not for the lack of money. The \ndelay in vet care is not for the lack of money, it is for the lack of \naccountability in management. Case in point: More than 20 veterans have \ndied or are dying due to late diagnosis and treatment of cancer at the \nWilliam Jennings Bryan Dorn Veterans Medical Center in Columbia, SC. \nDocuments show only one-third of that $1 million appropriated by \nCongress to fix the problem was used for its intended purpose at that \nVA facility. Only one-third of the money we appropriated to fix this \nproblem was actually used to pay for care for veterans on waiting \nlists. At the same time, the documents show the waiting list at Dorn \nkept growing to 3,800 patients in December of 2011.\n  I will be back to speak on the floor and offer amendments. I have \npages and pages of examples of veterans who served this country \nhonorably, proudly, and sacrificed to a great extent, who are getting \nsubstandard care in the system we are offering them today. Before we \nexpand that system, what is needed is a rigorous oversight and debate \nabout how we are doing what we are doing now.\n  The promise of access to care for our veterans, as shown by VA \ncenters and clinics all across this country, hospitals all across this \ncountry, diagnostic procedures all across this country, reflects that \nwhen access is delayed, that care is denied. And that is what is \nhappening right now far too often to the people who have served this \ncountry. We ought to be about fixing that and holding accountable those \nin the responsible positions, and holding ourselves accountable to do \nwhat is necessary to give at least the standard of care they could get \nanywhere else in the country. That is the direction in which we should \ngo.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I look forward to discussing in the next \nseveral days the issues Senator Coburn raised, but I did want to make \none clarification, and I hope the Senator is listening. He repeatedly \nindicated this legislation opens the door to every one of the 22 \nmillion veterans in America, and then proceeded to say that once you \nopen the door, you are going to have inadequate care because we don't \nhave the resources to take care of 22 million veterans. That simply is \ninaccurate and that is not in the legislation.\n  There is nothing in the legislation that says we open the door to \nevery veteran in America regardless of income. So when people talk \nabout the VA suddenly being flooded by veterans and care being \ndiminished because of the huge increase into the system, that is just \nnot true.\n  What is true? What is true right now is we have an absurd and \ncomplicated income eligibility system throughout this country. What \nhappens in the State of Vermont or the State of California--one's \neligibility for the VA, if you are a priority 8--is different and \ndependent upon the county in which you live. So in Vermont, you can be \nliving in a county where if your income level is $45,000 a year you are \neligible for VA health care, but in a county where the line is drawn \njust across the street, you may not be eligible. In States such as \nCalifornia or Georgia, which have many, many, many counties, you have \nthe absurd situation where a person living on one side of the street is \neligible for VA health care, but the person living on the other side of \nthe street is not eligible for VA health care.\n  This is totally absurd, and we end up having hundreds and hundreds \nand hundreds of different income eligibility standards. So what this \nlegislation does is not open the door--and I hope my Republican \ncolleagues will not continue to say it because it is not true--but it \ndoes say that in a State where you have different income eligibility \nstandards based on counties, what we will do is have one income \neligibility standard per State, that being the highest level. So we \nwill have 50 different standards--50 different standards for 50 \ndifferent States--not have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of \ndifferent standards. In every State there will be an income eligibility \nlevel, but it will not open the door for health care to 22 million \nveterans.\n  Second of all, we were very careful in this legislation to say, if a \nveteran who, under this bill, would be eligible for VA health care, a \nveteran who can newly access VA health care, we absolutely have to have \nthe medical infrastructure available so that all veterans will get the \nquality care they need; so that new veterans coming in will not \ndiminish service for other veterans. In this bill we make clear--and we \nmade this clear in our long discussion with the Disabled American \nVeterans--the priority for the VA remains those veterans who are \ninjured in action, those veterans who need that care. That is the \nhighest priority that we establish.\n  So when people say we are opening the door to all veterans, care is \ngoing to be diminished, that simply is not true. That is not what the \nbill says.\n  Thirdly, let me reiterate some of the provisions in this bill, \nbecause before we vote on final passage--and, by the way, I want to \ntake this opportunity to thank every Member of the Senate for voting to \nproceed. I think it is time we had some very serious debate about VA \nhealth care, and now is the time to do it. But let me reiterate a point \nI made earlier. Senator Coburn raised important issues, Senator Burr \nbefore him raised important issues, and we should debate those issues. \nBut in all due respect for the veterans of this country, who have \nsacrificed so much, let us not politicize this debate on veterans \nissues by bringing in sanctions against Iran or let us not bring in \nObamaCare, let us not bring in the dozens of other issues that are out \nthere. Let us debate this issue on its merits. Let us bring forth \namendments which deal with veterans issues.\n  Senator Coburn and Senator Burr have amendments which deal with \nveterans issues. I welcome those amendments. Let us have those debates. \nNobody ever suggested this bill is perfect. There are a lot of Senators \nout there, Democrats and Republicans, who have ideas about how we can \nimprove the services and the programs we provide to veterans. I welcome \nthose ideas. But do not destroy this legislation by politicizing it, by \ndoing what we have done month after month, year after year, which is \nwhy the American people have so much contempt for what goes on in \nCongress. Let us focus on veterans issues.\n  We have differences of opinion. Let us debate those issues. Let us \nnot bring in extraneous matters, poison pills, which will give people a \nreason to vote against this bill. Let us debate veterans issues.\n  Let me talk about some of the issues in this bill that my Republican \ncolleagues did not talk about. No. 1, I am proud--I hope we are all \nproud--that recently we made sure the promises made to military \nretirees were kept, that we rescinded the 1-percent COLA decrease that \nwas in the bipartisan budget agreement. But we did not go far enough. \nMen and women who are joining the military after January 2014 are still \nsubject to that decrease in COLA.\n  Are we in favor of keeping promises to all veterans, including the \nnew members of the Armed Forces or are we not? Let us debate that \nissue. I believe that we keep our promises to all veterans. That is in \nthe bill. If people want to oppose that, they have the right to oppose \nthat.\n  We have heard in several instances that the VA does not have the \nmedical infrastructure to take care of the needs of veterans, and that \nis true. That is why in this bill we authorize the VA to enter into 27 \nmajor medical facility leases in 18 States and in Puerto Rico--18 \nStates and Puerto Rico.\n  So don't come forward and say ``gee, VA does not have the \ninfrastructure to\n\n[[Page S1031]]\n\ntake care of veterans needs'' but then vote against a provision that \nsignificantly expands VA health care capabilities. I talked a moment \nago about what we mean by expanding VA health care. We do away with the \nabsurdly complicated bureaucratic situation that now exists in which \nthere are hundreds of different income eligibility standards in the 50 \nStates of the country. We reduce it to 50. In California or Vermont, \nyou will know whether you are eligible for health care as a Priority 8 \nveteran.\n  Does it open the opportunity for more veterans to come into VA health \ncare? It does. The reason is because VA provides good-quality health \ncare to our veterans, which is why the veterans throughout this country \nwhom I have talked to and in patient satisfaction surveys approve and \nare supportive of VA health care. More want to come into the system.\n  We heard just how terrible and awful VA health care is, and then we \nheard: We don't want to open the doors because it is going to be \nflooded with new people coming into VA health care. You can't have it \nboth ways. If VA health care is so terrible, why are you afraid of new \npeople coming into VA health care? The answer is that if you go out to \nthe veterans community, they will tell you: Yeah, there are problems in \nVA. But there are problems in every health care institution in this \ncountry. Over 30,000 Americans die every single year because they don't \nget to the doctor when they should because they don't have health care. \nI don't want any veterans to be part of that number.\n  Hospitals all over this country are struggling with an epidemic of \ninfections. The VA has done better than many other medical institutions \nin addressing that.\n  In terms of telehealth--which is so important to veterans in my rural \nState and in rural States all over the country--guess which medical \ninstitution is leading the country in terms of telehealth. It is the \nVeterans' Administration. That means a veteran can walk into a VA \ncommunity-based outreach clinic in rural West Virginia and have a \nteleconference with a specialist in any other part of the country. VA \nhas been cutting-edge in terms of telehealth.\n  We talk about medical technology and medical health care records. \nGuess which health care institution in America has led the effort in \nterms of medical and health care technology. It has been the VA.\n  So I find it interesting that on one hand some of my colleagues tell \nus how terrible VA health care is, and on the other hand they are \nnervous that hundreds of thousands of veterans may want to access VA \nhealth care because, in fact, it is one of the best health care \ninstitutions in the country.\n  Does VA have problems? Of course it has problems. I am not aware of \nany health care institution in America that does not have its share of \nproblems. The difference between the VA and many private or nonprofit \nhospitals is--and it should be this way--by law, every problem at the \nVA makes it to the front pages. My guess is that if a hospital in West \nVirginia or Vermont screws up, they don't necessarily make it to the \nfront pages. Because VA is public and by law they have to be \ntransparent, they are on the front pages.\n  In terms of advanced appropriations for VA, my friends on the other \nside have a bit of a problem with that. I don't. I find it interesting \nthat when our Republican colleagues in the House shut down the U.S. \nGovernment because they don't like and wanted to defund ObamaCare, we \nwere 7 days to 10 days away from preventing disabled veterans from \ngetting the checks they need in order to survive. So I believe advanced \nfunding for the VA to make sure that they are never put in that \nposition again, that there is money in the bank to pay the benefits we \nowe to our veterans in the event of another government shutdown, is \ngood public policy.\n  As I mentioned earlier, when we talk about health care, in my view, \nwe have to talk about dental care as well. If people do not have \nadequate dental care, it impacts their employability, say if they are \nmissing front teeth. People get sick from infections if they don't have \nadequate dental care. I think we owe it to our veterans to make sure \nthey do.\n  This legislation provides a pilot project for 30,000 veterans to \nbegin to access dental care within the VA. We will see how that pilot \ngoes. I suspect we are going to see a huge need out there. And if some \nof my colleagues think veterans are not entitled to dental care, then \nwe have a difference of opinion. That is fine. Let's debate it. But I \nthink dental care is an intrinsic part of health care in general. I \nthink we have a dental care crisis in the United States of America and \nwithin the dental community. Right now dental care is available to \nthose veterans who have suffered service-connected dental problems but \nnot available to veterans in general. I want to change that.\n  I have heard the discussion about the backlog. Every Member of the \nSenate is concerned about the backlog. We have had hearings in the \nSenate about the backlog. I am really glad that today people are \nconcerned about the backlog. I just wonder where they were 5 years ago \nwhen--before Obama became President--the VA was probably the largest \ninstitution in this Nation, if not the world, that still did all of its \nbenefits processing work on paper, not digitally.\n  When Secretary Shinseki became Secretary of the VA, he said: We are \ngoing to bring the VA into the 21st century. We are going to go from \npaper to digital, to an electronic system.\n  That is what they have been doing, and what we have seen is real \nprogress. Is it fast enough for me? No, it is not. But Secretary \nShinseki has told me personally and our committee that they are on \ntrack, so by the end of 2014 all VA claims will be processed within 120 \ndays with 98 percent accuracy. That is pretty good. Just think for a \nmoment what a huge task that is. Individual veteran files wider than \nthis, with years and years of records, have to be put into a digital \nsystem. That is what they are doing, and they are making progress. In \nthis legislation, we have brought forth Republican and Democrat ideas \nto make sure that they are, in fact, on target and that they reach the \nvery ambitious goals Secretary Shinseki brought forth.\n  So if you are interested in the claims backlog, vote for this \nlegislation because we have bipartisan language in it to make sure \nveterans do not have to wait years to get their claims processed.\n  My friend from Oklahoma said he is not sympathetic to the idea that \nveterans should pay instate tuition, which is essentially what we meant \nwhen we passed the post-9/11 GI educational bill. Every time we bring \nforth legislation, we hear all of the reasons why we should not go \nforward in providing services and benefits to our veterans.\n  I would argue--and many economists would agree with me--that one of \nthe most significant pieces of legislation passed in the modern history \nof the United States of America was the GI bill of World War II. That \nbill said to the millions of people who fought in World War II, in that \nterrible war: When you come home, no matter what your income is, you \nwill be eligible to get a higher education. As a result of that \nlegislation, millions of soldiers who returned were able to go to \ncollege. They became businessmen, they became doctors, they became \nlawyers. And one of the reasons the economy of the United States of \nAmerica expanded significantly for the middle class was a direct result \nof that very important GI bill.\n  What we said several years ago was that we should take that premise \nand apply it to the men and women who served post-9/11 in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. It was quite a political debate here. Some of my \nRepublican friends had their doubts. We passed it, and today over 1 \nmillion veterans and their family members are now getting a college \neducation. In my view, that was exactly the right thing to do.\n  One of the problems is that veterans move about. So if they go from \nthe State where they have lived their whole life--for example, they \nlived in Vermont and go to California--and the GI bill promises them \ninstate tuition, it turns out the tuition in the State they are in now \nmay be a lot higher than in their home State and sometimes makes it \nimpossible for them to go to college.\n  We agree with virtually all the veterans organizations that the \nintent of the post-9/11 GI education bill was to\n\n[[Page S1032]]\n\nmake sure they get instate tuition. So if somebody from California \ncomes to Vermont, they get our instate tuition. If somebody from \nVermont goes to California, they get their instate tuition. Not doing \nso denies many people a higher education.\n  Previously, this Congress passed language which says that if you \nserved in Iraq and Afghanistan, you are going to get 5 years of free \nhealth care, which was the right thing to do. It turns out not \neverybody learned about the benefit. Four or five years have come and \ngone. What we say to those veterans is, we are going to give you \nanother 5 years to take advantage of that provision.\n  Senator Murray from Washington--the former chair of the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee who preceded me--and Senator Reid earlier today \ntalked about the employment situation for veterans. I think we all know \nwe are in a tough economy. Real unemployment is close to 13 percent. \nYouth unemployment is higher. So when somebody who gets out of the \nservice and comes home to look for a job--it is hard to do.\n  I believe we have to do what we can to make sure that when people \nleave the service they can find a job. That is what this legislation \ndoes. We also want to make sure the skills acquired by the men and \nwomen of our Armed Forces while on Active Duty or in the National Guard \nbecome applicable to civilian life as well, and we have language in \nthis bill that does that.\n  There is another issue which I didn't hear my Republican colleagues \ntalking about but which is a very important part of the bill. We have a \nsituation where some 2,300 veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan \nhave come back with a variety of wounds that make it impossible for \nthem to have children. I will give one example.\n  Army veteran Matt Keil of Colorado was wounded by sniper fire in Iraq \nin 2007. The sniper's round struck Matt's neck, causing severe damage \nto a vital artery and his spinal cord. Through sheer determination and \nwith the love and resolve of his wife Tracy, Matt's condition improved. \nHe and Tracy began to consider having children. Doctors assured them \nthat having children could be possible with the help of in vitro \nfertilization. The Keil family paid more than $30,000 for reproductive \ntreatments.\n  In the legislation on the floor now, we say that is wrong. If a \nservicemember who was injured in war wants to have a family and is \nunable to have a family, we should make it possible for them to do so. \nIf some of my colleagues on the other side disagree, that is fine. \nLet's have that debate. I think we owe it to the 2,300 men and women \nwho were wounded in battle. They should have the opportunity to raise a \nfamily.\n\n  We all know that one of the uglier aspects of military service in \nrecent years has been the epidemic of sexual assault. When we send \npeople into the military, we do not want to see men and women being \nsexually assaulted. I know the Department of Defense is working hard to \naddress this issue, but the fact is that many veterans who came home \nfrom war were sexually assaulted. This legislation contains important \nprovisions that would improve the delivery of care and benefits to \nveterans who experienced sexual trauma while serving in the military.\n  This provision was inspired by Ruth Moore. She struggled for 23 years \nto receive VA disability compensation. This is a woman who was sexually \nassaulted and had a very difficult time proving that and getting the \ncare she needed. We address that issue in this legislation.\n  In 2010, the Congress took a very significant step forward in saying \nto family members who were caring for disabled vets that we understood \nhow terribly difficult it is for them. There are wives, sisters, \nbrothers, and other family members who, 7 days a week, 24 hours a day, \nare on call for veterans who have suffered serious injuries, and that \nis tough. That is very tough and stressful. There are wives and sisters \nand brothers out there who don't get any time off. They are on call 7 \ndays a week.\n  We passed a caregivers act that provides a modest stipend. It \nprovides training and time off for people who are caring for veterans 7 \ndays a week. It says, you can have a day off. We will send in a nurse. \nWe did that for post-9/11 veterans. The truth is there are tens of \nthousands of families who are experiencing and going through the same \nissues and have been doing so for decades. I believe it is appropriate \nthat we expand the caregivers act to every generation of veterans and \nmake sure that those families get the help they need.\n  I have heard some of my Republican colleagues say this legislation \nsimply opens the door to every veteran in America to come in, and that \nwhen they come in, the quality of care is going to be diminished. That \nis simply an inaccurate statement, and I hope my colleagues read the \nlegislation before they repeat that. It is not true. What we do is end \nthe absurd and complicated situation of having hundreds and hundreds of \ndifferent income eligibility standards. Instead of many hundreds of \nstandards, there will be one in each State, and it will be the highest \nstandard, which will mean that more veterans are able to come into VA \nhealth care. It does not open the door. We have been clear in saying we \nwill not bring more veterans in until we make sure we have the \ninfrastructure to deal with those veterans.\n  Some people have said: Well, why do you want to bring more veterans \ninto the VA? The answer is pretty simple. I talked to many veterans in \nVermont who would like to get into VA health care because of the \nrespect and the knowledge about the needs of veterans and the high \nquality of care they get, and the fact that there is a strong network \nof primary health care facilities all over the country which they can \naccess.\n  I will conclude for the moment by saying I very much appreciate the \nfact that every single Member of the Senate--I believe there were 99 \nvotes--voted to proceed on this debate. I look forward to this debate. \nIt is an important debate. I look forward to serious amendments which \naddress the needs of veterans. I think it would be very disrespectful \nto the veterans community if we started injecting into this debate \ntotally extraneous and highly political and partisan issues.\n  The issue of sanctions in Iran is a very important issue. People have \nhonest differences of opinion. That is not an issue regarding VA health \ncare. It is not an issue regarding the caregivers program. It is not an \nissue regarding dental care for our veterans.\n  Let's respect veterans and have this debate on veterans issues and \nnot on extraneous political issues which will divide us. Let's try to \ncome together and not be divided.\n  With that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RISCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Remembering Mayor Marsha Ogilvie\n\n  Mr. RISCH. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ndistinguished Idahoan, Marcia H. Ogilvie, a loyal and steadfast mayor \nof Sandpoint, ID.\n  On January 8 of this year Mayor Ogilvie lost a valiant battle with \ncancer, and my State lost a good friend, a champion for women and \nchildren, and a tireless public servant.\n  Mayor Ogilvie was born at March Air Force Base in southern California \nand moved to the great State of Idaho in 1994. In the 20 years she made \nIdaho her home, she distinguished herself in service to others. As she \nonce said--and many in Sandpoint now say--she won the hearts and minds \nof the people in Sandpoint.\n  Elected mayor just 2 years ago, and having served the previous 2 \nyears on the city council, Mayor Ogilvie leaves a giant hole in those \nhearts and in the broader community. The business and professional \nexperience Mayor Ogilvie brought was wide and varied and earned her the \nrespect of many.\n  Early in her career, she served in restaurant and retail management. \nWhen she and her husband Francis arrived in Sandpoint, they opened a \ncouple of small businesses--the Candy Cottage and All Smiles, a gift \nshop. But Marsha Ogilvie was not just about business. She cared deeply \nabout the health, welfare, and success of women and children.\n  Soon after moving to Idaho, and well before entering public service, \nshe established Kinderhaven, a nonprofit\n\n[[Page S1033]]\n\ncommunity organization which is dedicated to supporting children in \ncrisis. Founded in 1996, and under the vision and compassionate care of \nMarsha Ogilvie, more than 1,300 children have found the all-important \nhelp they needed in times of their great distress. So important to the \nSandpoint community, Kinderhaven was named the grand prize winner in \nthe 2002 Governor's Brightest Stars Awards.\n  In addition, Mrs. Ogilvie, who crossed paths with many women serving \nas volunteers in the Sandpoint community, started Women Honoring Women. \nIt was designed to be a one-time event, but it has evolved since 1999 \ninto an annual event to recognize and honor women in Bonner County, ID. \nIt recognizes women 65 or older who are working to make a difference in \nthe lives of others, who love to learn, and who exhibit qualities of \nleadership.\n  Marsha Ogilvie recognized these qualities in others because she too \npossessed them--well, all but one. She was only 64 when she passed \naway.\n  If these achievements were not enough, Marsha Ogilvie joined with \nthree friends to co-author a children's book which was just recently \npublished. ``Gigi's Enchanted Forest'' was a way to honor the life of a \nmutual friend of theirs who shared their hope for and love of children \nand a dedication to community service.\n  Mayor Marsha H. Ogilvie personified a life of giving and caring. Her \nunparalleled legacy of hard work, reaching out to her community, and \nrecognizing those who help others in volunteer service is indelibly \netched on the hearts and minds of those she served in Sandpoint, ID, \nand far beyond the city limits.\n  May God bless her husband, her family, and the hundreds of Idahoans \nwho will miss her passion, exuberance, and spirit of joy.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nup to 15 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, late in the day on Friday--after \nreporters had gone home for the weekend--the Obama administration \nquietly released its new Medicare Advantage payment rates. The cuts the \nPresident wants to make to this program are potentially devastating to \nmillions of Americans.\n  The next morning the New York Times' headline read: ``U.S. Proposes \nCuts to Rates in Payments for Medicare.''\n  Politico wrote about it too. They said:\n\n       The Obama Administration is proposing a major cut in 2015 \n     payments to Medicare Advantage.\n\n  Fifteen million Americans depend on these health insurance plans the \nPresident wants to cut.\n  Instead of listening to seniors and investing in a program that works \nwell, the Obama administration is doing everything conceivable to make \nsure Medicare Advantage fails.\n  Back in December the press gave President Obama the Lie of the Year \nAward for his statement that if you like your health care plan, you can \nkeep it. Millions of people across America have now gotten letters \nsaying their insurance plans are being canceled because of the \nDemocrats' health care law. By cutting Medicare Advantage, I tell my \ncolleagues, the Obama administration is now ensuring that even more \nAmericans can't keep the health care plan they like.\n  Twenty-nine percent of all Medicare patients have chosen to enroll in \nMedicare Advantage. There is a reason for that. The Medicare Advantage \nProgram lives up to its name by delivering clear advantages. The plans \ngive extra benefits such as dental coverage, vision coverage, hearing \nbenefits, wellness programs, and other benefits that are important to \nour seniors. Sometimes they offer smaller copayments, lower \ndeductibles, and less out-of-pocket costs than the traditional Medicare \nProgram does. Sometimes seniors even pay a higher monthly premium for \nthese extra benefits, but often the benefits are financed through plan \nsavings due to the programs and the way they work.\n  For many seniors Medicare Advantage is a good option. It is the right \noption for them. These are people who don't have a lot of money but who \nstill want the peace of mind that comes with good health insurance. \nThose seniors are now facing much higher costs or lower benefits \nbecause of the Obama administration's decisions rolled out last Friday \nnight. Because of this proposal and the administration's way to try to \nsneak it out on Friday, seniors are concerned and anxious about what \nthe administration is also hiding.\n  Ever since the President and Democrats in Congress passed their \nhealth care law, they have been going after seniors who rely on \nMedicare. They raided a total of over $700 billion from Medicare--and \nwe discussed that during the debate over the health care law. The money \nwas taken from seniors on Medicare not to strengthen Medicare, not to \nsecure the future of Medicare but to start a whole new government \nprogram for other people. There is a whole new bureaucracy, and it has \nbeen created by Washington Democrats in the health care law.\n  ObamaCare specifically targeted the Medicare Advantage Program, \nsignificant amounts of direct and indirect payment cuts totaling over \n$300 billion. That is 43 percent of the total Medicare cuts, just for \nthis one program. So 29 percent of America's seniors rely on Medicare \nAdvantage. Because about 29 percent of seniors on Medicare are in \nMedicare Advantage, they are responsible for 43 percent of the cuts.\n  Because of these cuts and other changes in the law, fewer private \nhealth care plans are going to be able to participate in Medicare \nAdvantage in the future. That means a number of things. It means some \npeople who rely on these plans are going to find out their plan is \nbeing canceled entirely. Some people in Iowa--thousands of people in \nIowa--have already gotten letters canceling their Medicare Advantage \nplan.\n  The Kaiser Family Foundation looked at what the President's health \ncare law does to seniors and they said that about a one-half million \npatients will lose their existing coverage--seniors on Medicare \nAdvantage. These seniors are going to have fewer options to get the \ncare they need from the doctor they choose at a lower cost. More of \nthese people are going to be forced into a one-size-fits-all government \nplan. They are going to lose the insurance they had, insurance they \nliked and that worked for them.\n  Some people may find their new insurance network doesn't include the \ndoctors they had before. We have seen this happening all across the \ncountry. As the major provider of Medicare Advantage had to try to make \nit all work, they had to eliminate many doctors from their plans, so \nthat those doctors are not going to be able to keep their patients and \nthose patients are not going to be able to keep their doctors, in spite \nof what the President told the American people when he looked into the \ncamera and said: If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.\n  A lot of these people are going to see their costs increase. The \nKaiser Family Foundation says the average out-of-pocket limit for \nMedicare Advantage plans is going to increase by $464 this year. The \nPresident and Washington Democrats said their health care plan was \ngoing to save people money. That is what the President told the \ncountry. That is why he said he did this whole health care law. He said \nit was going to save people money. That is what people wanted. The \nPresident told people what they wanted to hear, but he failed to give \nthem what he promised. That is why his credibility ratings are down. \nThat is why people believe he misled them intentionally, and that is \nwhy this administration is viewed to be incompetent by a majority of \nAmericans. It turns out costs continue to go up because of the law.\n  This new round of cuts to Medicare Advantage is just another example \nof how the health care law is wrecking our health care system, not \nfixing it. America's health care system wasn't working before, but the \nPresident and the law Democrats voted for has made it worse.\n\n[[Page S1034]]\n\n  Medicare is headed toward bankruptcy, but the Obama administration \nhas rejected bipartisan solutions to reform and to strengthen the \nprogram. Through cuts such as the ones announced last Friday, the \nPresident's health care law takes money from Medicare and uses it to \npay for something else.\n  There was actually a double data dump that occurred on Friday: the \nMedicare Advantage cuts that were announced late in the day, and then \nlater than that the CMS--the Medicare/Medicaid services for the \ncountry--came out with their report and it reported that two-thirds of \nsmall businesses that provide health insurance for their employees \nwould see their prices go up because of the health care law--two-thirds \nof small businesses. These are ones that by law don't have to provide \nhealth insurance--with employees of less than 50, they don't have to, \nby law, supply it, but they often do supply it. They do supply that \ninsurance. I think about 17 million people get insurance that way, \nthrough work--businesses that are not mandated to supply the insurance, \nbut they do it to get good workers. As a result, what they are seeing \nis that their rates are going up.\n  So that was part of the double data dump that occurred on Friday.\n  It was interesting to see a note that came out of the Democrats' \nlunch meeting today. It was just reported in Roll Call magazine. It \nsaid: ``A group of Senate Democrats is expected to launch a \ncounteroffensive in favor of ObamaCare on Wednesday, a response to \npersistent attacks on the law from their Republican counterparts.''\n  First, I will point out the attacks on the law are coming from \nAmerican citizens all around the country. It is what we hear at \ntownhall meetings and it is what we hear as we travel around the \ncountry, people whose families are noting that they are paying more and \ngetting less, losing their doctors and losing their insurance. But the \nreport in Roll Call says:\n\n       Democrats discussed the new endeavor touting benefits of \n     the Affordable Care Act during Tuesday's weekly caucus lunch \n     to a warm reception, according to Connecticut's Christopher \n     S. Murphy, who is one of the senators leading the effort. A \n     Senate Democrat aide said the formal rollout will come \n     Wednesday.\n\n  I welcome the opportunity to hear what the Democrats have to say \nbecause the damage being done by this health care law to people all \nacross the country is significant.\n  It is interesting because all we need to do is turn to Friday's New \nYork Times, Robert Pear, an excellent writer for the Times, who had, I \nthought, a fascinating story. He took two pages of the paper: ``Public \nSector Capping Part-Time Hours . . . '' Public sector capping part-time \nhours. Why? Right here in the headline: ``to Skirt Health Care Law.''\n  Let me start: ``Cities, counties, public schools and community \ncolleges around the country''--we are not talking about businesses or \nfast food chains; we are talking about cities, counties, public schools \nand community colleges around the country--``have limited or reduced \nthe work hours of part-time employees . . .'' Why? ``to avoid having to \nprovide them with health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, state \nand local officials say. The cuts to public sector employment, which \nhas failed to rebound since the recession''--it says right here--\n``could serve as a powerful political weapon for Republican critics of \nthe health care law, who claim it is creating a drain on the economy.''\n  It is creating a drain on the economy. We have two folks in the \npicture in Medina, OH, working on a trash truck. One of the gentlemen \ntalks about his hours being limited to 29 hours. He called it ``a hit \nto his wallet.''\n  The President is fighting to talk about raising the minimum wage, \nwhen people are actually losing take-home pay. It is impacting their \nwages, the health care law is. It is impacting how much money they take \nhome at the end of the week.\n  The next page talks about somebody who works as a clerk in the parks \ndepartment saw her hours drop from 38 a week to 35 and then to 29. Why? \nBecause of the health care law and the 30-hour limit.\n  It is interesting to go through the list of the different jobs of \npeople who are losing hours, who want to work. These are hard-working \nAmericans who are having their hours cut--public sector workers, people \nwho work for cities, counties, public schools, community colleges. The \nlist goes on: police dispatchers, prison guards, substitute teachers, \nbus drivers, athletic coaches, school custodians, cafeteria workers, \nand part-time professors; office clerks, sanitation workers, park \ninspectors--all in all, people who are being hurt because of the \nPresident's health care law and the mandates and the way it is put \ntogether by this President and the Democrats who voted for it.\n  It is interesting to see the Senator from Connecticut mentioned here \nas leading the effort, and I would recommend to him this article by \nRobert Pear in Friday's New York Times, who goes specifically to the \ncore of what is happening in Connecticut, in that Senator's home State. \nIt says:\n\n       Mark Benigni, the superintendent of schools in Meriden, \n     CT--a public school, public sector--and a board member of the \n     American Association of School Administrators said in an \n     interview that the new health care law is having ``unintended \n     consequences for school systems across the Nation.''\n\n  This health care law is full of unintended consequences. Now we have \nsomeone who is a board member for the American Association of School \nAdministrators saying that the health care law is having unintended \nconsequences for school systems across the Nation. He specifically \nsays, in Connecticut, as in many States--this is the article now:\n\n       In Connecticut, as in many States, significant numbers of \n     part-time school employees work more than 30 hours a week and \n     do not receive health benefits.\n\n  Quoting the superintendent in schools in Meriden, CT:\n\n       Are we supposed to lay off full-time teachers? Are we \n     supposed to lay off full-time teachers so that we can provide \n     insurance coverage to part-time employees?\n\n  The superintendent goes on to say:\n\n       If I had to cut five reading teachers to pay for health \n     benefits for substitute teachers, I am not sure that would be \n     best for our students.\n\n  So I would ask the President of the United States: What do you want? \nThese are the choices that because of your health care law, crammed \ndown the throats of the American people, you are asking the public \nsector of our country to make. Get rid of five reading teachers in \nMeriden, CT, to pay for expensive health insurance policies for \nsubstitute teachers. That superintendent is trying to say, I am not \nsure that what the law requires would be best for our students.\n  I think this law was not well-thought-out, was not well planned. So I \nwill be interested tomorrow to see Senate Democrats come to the floor \nwith their ObamaCare PR counteroffensive and explain to the American \npeople why they are being faced with a disastrous Web site rollout 4 \ndays after the President told the American people it will be easier to \nuse than Amazon and cheaper than your cell phone bill and you can keep \nyour doctor if you like your doctor. Let them explain why 5 million \npeople then got letters from insurance companies saying their insurance \npolicies have been canceled; why the Web site failure is just the tip \nof the iceberg that the American people are seeing right now in terms \nof premiums going up, canceled policies, can't keep their doctor, \nhigher out-of-pocket costs, higher copays, higher deductibles, all in \nspite of the President's glowing promises which, in my opinion, were \nmade to deceive the American people in an effort to pass a health care \nlaw which many people see as bad for patients, bad for providers, and \nbad for the taxpayers.\n  I will continue to come to the floor and talk about what I hear as I \ngo home to Wyoming each week in terms of a health care law which is not \nproviding the patients what they asked for, what they need, and what \nthey were promised.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I wish to thank my colleague Senator \nBarrasso for coming to the floor, and now I would like to give a second \nopinion to what he has just said.\n  He said he wants to wait until tomorrow to hear some success stories \nabout the Affordable Care Act. I am going to give him a preview \ntonight.\n\n[[Page S1035]]\n\n  Ray Romanowski--62 years old, city of Chicago, musician, part-time \nemployee, barrel-chested Polish guy who belongs in the city of \nChicago--sat next to me at a clinic, patted his wallet and said: Guess \nwhat, Senator. I have health insurance for the first time in my life, \nand it feels good.\n  Judy takes care of hotel rooms down in southern Illinois, a place \nthat I stay. She is over there in the hospitality room. Same story: 62 \nyears old, worked every day she could and never had health insurance \none day in her life. She was diagnosed with diabetes and, thank God, \nshe now has, because of the Affordable Care Act, health insurance.\n  Those are just a couple of stories.\n  What the Senator from Wyoming did not tell you is that there are \naspects of this Affordable Care Act which American families value. Do \nyou have a child in your family who is sick with maybe asthma, \ndiabetes? Is your wife a cancer survivor? In the old days before the \nAffordable Care Act, that meant it would be hard to get health \ninsurance and, if you could, it would be very expensive.\n  So we changed it. We said: You cannot discriminate against families \nbecause somebody happens to be sick. Those of us who have raised \nfamilies know that happens pretty regularly. So that protection is in \nthe law, and it is a protection which some of the absolutists want to \nrepeal. Get rid of it. Let's get back to the good old days when a sick \nchild would basically disqualify a family from health insurance.\n  It used to be that insurance companies had odd ways of basically \nrating people when it came to premiums. One of the disabilities they \nidentified was if the person seeking health insurance was a woman. They \nwould discriminate against women seeking health insurance because it is \npossible they would become pregnant and more expensive. We did away \nwith that discrimination as well.\n  Then there were lifetime limits. Madam President, $100,000 in health \ninsurance coverage may sound great, but if you go into the hospital or \nsee the doctor the next day and you are told you have cancer and have \nto face radiation, chemotherapy, and more, $100,000 will not last very \nlong, and pretty soon you are into life savings and pretty soon after \nthat you are into bankruptcy, something the Presiding Officer knows \nvery well.\n  So we eliminated the lifetime limits on health insurance policies as \npart of the Affordable Care Act. I do not hear the Senator from Wyoming \nand others suggesting they want to go back to those days. Do they?\n  The bottom line is this: The Affordable Care Act is a good law. We \nwrote it and passed it without the help of any Republicans. Not a \nsingle one of them would step up and join us in this effort. Now they \nhave done nothing for the last 4 years but criticize it.\n  I will say this. It is not perfect. It can be improved. I will invite \nthe Senator from Wyoming, who is a medical doctor and a man I respect, \nto join us in improving it. Let's find a way to make it better. Let's \nfix it. There are things that can be fixed into law. That is what \npeople sent us here to do. We can give speeches about how good or bad \nit is, but most Americans want it to work. They want health insurance \nthat is affordable and available and accessible, and they want to make \nsure they are going to be treated fairly once they buy it.\n  I think the marketplaces we will tell you about are working for a lot \nof families, and we are going to come to the floor to tell those \nstories. I know the other side spent a long time talking about what \nthey consider to be shortcomings, and there are some obvious \nshortcomings with the Affordable Care Act. The rollout was a disaster. \nAnybody who says otherwise was not paying attention. For 60 days we \nworked to get our Web sites up and running, and some of them still \nleave room to be desired, leave room for improvement.\n  But I talked to a businessman in Chicago last week, and he said: It \nis a good thing my business failures are not on the front page of the \npaper every day because I have made a lot of mistakes, but I keep going \nuntil I get it right. That is what we ought to do, keep going until we \nget it absolutely right.\n  We have a good start, trying to bring 60 million uninsured Americans \nunder protection of health insurance, to allow people to shop for the \nbest policy for their family. That is realistic.\n  I also want to add one thing. The critics of the Affordable Care Act \nassume that before we passed it, health insurance premiums did not \nincrease. We know better. Particularly for those who had small \nbusinesses and individuals, their policies were canceled on average \nonce every 24 months, and their health insurance premiums went up 12 to \n20 percent.\n  A friend of mine has a small trucking company. He tried to cover his \nemployees who worked for him and their families until one of the \nemployees had a sick baby, and then the health insurance premiums went \nthrough the roof and they all were out on their own. With the help from \nthe employer--what he used to pay each month--they had a helping hand \nlooking for health insurance.\n  He went to buy health insurance for himself--himself, the owner of \nthe company--and his wife. It turned out that if you turned in a claim \nthis year for a problem you had with your foot, next year that company \nhealth insurance plan--the one he bought--would not cover anything \nrelated to your feet. So you slowly exclude all the possible claims \nthat can be made for profitability. Then, in the end, you have a \nworthless health insurance policy.\n  Those were the old days. I would say to the Senator from Wyoming and \nhis friends, we are not going back to the old days. We can improve this \nlaw. Let's work together to do it. But we are not going back to the \ndays of discrimination based on preexisting conditions, lifetime limits \non policies, discrimination against women, excluding children from the \nhealth insurance of their families--the things that really were wrong \nwith the system.\n  Help us make it better, but do not just come here and complain. I \nthink people expect us to be more positive and constructive.\n  Madam President, I rise in strong support of the Comprehensive \nVeterans Health and Benefits Act of 2014. Chairman Bernie Sanders of \nVermont has put together a comprehensive improvement, which I support. \nHe is new as chairman, but he is off to a flying start.\n  The bill reminds us of our obligations to veterans. I especially \nappreciate that he worked with me on a few priorities. It authorizes a \nnew $10 million initiative in prosthetics and orthotics. Limb loss is \none of the signature wounds of Iraq and Afghanistan. There are not \nenough medical professionals with the expertise needed to fit veterans \nwith the best orthotic or prosthetic for their injuries.\n  Now the Department of Veterans Affairs can partner with universities \nto expand the number of master's degree programs so our wounded \nwarriors continue to receive the best care.\n  This veterans package also addresses a problem I have been working to \nfix that allows veterans to consolidate student loans or participate in \nstudent loan forgiveness without penalty.\n  Congress capped the interest rate for servicemembers at 6 percent \nseveral years ago, but a loophole has prevented servicemembers from \nkeeping that protection if they consolidate their student debt or \nenroll in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program. This bill closes \nthat loophole.\n  The bill makes sure veterans using their GI bill education benefits \nwill pay instate tuition rates. Senator Sanders has a good bill when it \ncomes to student loans.\n  There is one provision in it of special interest and importance to \nme. Several years ago one of our colleagues, a Senator from New York by \nthe name of Hillary Clinton, came up with a great idea. Senator Clinton \nsaid: We ought to help the caregivers for disabled vets. I liked the \nidea a lot and was kind of envious that she came up with it first. Then \nshe moved on to be Secretary of State. So I called her at the State \nDepartment and asked: Hillary, is it OK if I take up your bill on \ncaregivers? She said: Be my guest. And I did. I introduced the Hillary \nClinton caregivers bill, and ultimately, with the help of Senator Akaka \nand others, we passed it.\n  Here is what it says. If you had someone who was injured after 9/11 \nand disabled and you were prepared to give them care, we are going to \nhelp you. For that wife who stands by her husband, a husband who stands \nby his wife, a mother or father helping the disabled\n\n[[Page S1036]]\n\nvet, here is what we will offer to you: first, the very best in skilled \nnursing training so you know how to take care of your veteran and do it \nthe right way; secondly, a respite. Two weeks out of the year you get a \nvacation. We are going to send in some skilled nurses so you can go off \nand relax. You deserve it after spending 50 weeks caring for this \nveteran. Third, if you are in a bind economically, financially, we want \nto make sure you are going to have enough money to survive. So we \noffered a monthly stipend to those caregivers who are helping.\n  Let me tell you some stories that I think illustrate this so well, \nwhy it is important and why it is working.\n  In 2005, Eric Edmundson was a 26-year-old Army sergeant when he \nsurvived a roadside blast in Iraq. He went into cardiac arrest while \nwaiting for a transport to a military hospital. His brain was deprived \nof oxygen for almost 30 minutes. He became a quadriplegic as a result \nof the injuries.\n  The VA basically told Eric's parents Ed and Beth that there was no \nhope and no place to turn. The doctors said Eric would spend the rest \nof his life in a vegetative state and he should be sent to a nursing \nhome. His dad said not only no, but hell no, this is my 26-year-old \nson, and I am not giving up on him.\n  So Eric was transferred to the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, \nwhich is where I first met him. His recovery was incredible. His mom \nand dad stayed by their son's side until the day when we proudly \nwatched Eric, with a helping hand, literally walk out of the hospital \nin his dress uniform--a sign of dramatic progress in just a few months.\n  Today, he is living in North Carolina with his wife and two \nchildren--beautiful kids. His parents are his full-time caregivers, and \nthey share their home with Eric and his wife.\n  But even these family caregivers like Ed and Beth need a helping \nhand. They told me about Hillary Clinton's bill, and they got me \nstarted. I am glad they did. Because now that it has become the law, \n12,000 families just like theirs across America are getting the helping \nhand of the caregiver program. It helps the veterans from Iraq and \nAfghanistan, with their families, be where they want to be: at home \nwith their families. If you want to get down to the bottom line, it \nsaves the government money. It costs a lot more money to put people in \nVA facilities than to help these families keep the veterans at home \nwhere they want to be.\n  Let me show you one other one, which I think is a great story. This \nis the story of Yuriy Zmysly, who was a marine serving in Afghanistan \nand Iraq. He returned to the United States for what was going to be a \nroutine surgery at a military hospital, but because of complications \nfrom the surgery, from an appendix procedure, he was left with a severe \nbrain injury.\n  Aimee--who is shown right here in this picture--was his fiance at the \ntime. When Yuriy reached the point where he came out in a state where \nhe was in a wheelchair and struggling, Aimee said: I promised you I \nloved you and I was going to marry you and we are going through with \nit. And she did. She married Yuriy and stood by his side. They have a \nbeautiful daughter Adelina, whom I met just a couple weeks ago in \nChicago. She is 4 months old. It is for caregivers such as Aimee, who \ndropped everything and even dropped out of school to help care for this \ndisabled vet Yuriy that this program is designed.\n  I am proud of this program. I think the 256--I think that is the \nright number--caregiver families in Illinois have a special helping \nhand as they help our disabled vets. We need to expand it. Bernie \nSanders does just that. He expands this program beyond those veterans \nwho were afflicted after 9/11 to those who were afflicted before, from \nprevious conflicts, from previous service to our country.\n  This caregivers program is the right thing to do. These men and women \nwho care for our disabled vets are truly saints and angels, and we \nought to stand by them. Giving them a helping hand through this \nexpansion of the caregivers program is right for America, it is right \nfor our vets, and it is right for us to do for the men and women who \nrisked their lives for our country.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. BURR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I withhold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Illinois, and I \nshould have told him I was going to come out to be recognized. Let me \nthank him because he has raised a very important issue on caregivers.\n  I also want to thank him for the interest he took in Eric Edmundson, \nwho is from North Carolina. I might add to the story, for my \ncolleagues, there was not a caregiver program when Eric Edmundson's dad \ntook over his care. He did what I think parents have a tendency to do. \nHe said: It can be better for my son if I take control of it--and he \nended up in Illinois at his dad's request. Although he has not made a \nfull recovery, he has made a spectacular recovery from the prognosis. I \nknow my good friend from Illinois has to go, but I appreciate him \nhighlighting that.\n  Let me just say that I think all Members of the Senate would like to \nexpand the caregivers program. I wrote the caregivers program. Senator \nAkaka, who was then the chairman, came to the floor and it was passed. \nAs written, section 303 would expand the caregivers program to veterans \nof all eras. Let me say that again: Veterans of all eras we would \nextend the caregivers program to if the Sanders bill was passed.\n  I have the alternative bill, which is in the process of being filed. \nIt does not expand the caregivers program--a program I am passionate \nabout. I wrote it. It does not do it for a reason, and I want to turn \nto Senator Akaka's comments on the Senate floor when we passed this \nbill, where Senator Akaka, the chair of the Senate Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, said this:\n\n       [O]ne, the needs and circumstances of the newest veterans \n     in terms of the injuries are different--different--from those \n     of veterans from earlier eras; two, the family situation of \n     the younger veterans is different from that of older \n     veterans; and three, by targeting this initiative on a \n     specific group of veterans, the likelihood of a successful \n     undertaking is enhanced.\n\n  To me, the most important of these reasons mentioned by Senator Akaka \nwas the belief that the VA would not be able to implement a program of \nthat magnitude. That is why caregivers was crafted to be a program that \nwe ramped up over time. It was targeted at a very specific population, \nand we envisioned that as the VA got more proficient at actual training \nand implementation of this program, it would be ramped up.\n  The VA has proven us right. They have had trouble in implementing \nthis program in what is a very limited program. Their rollout and \nmanagement of the program has been flawed in several areas and has been \na disservice to those veterans in need of these critical services. \nSince the start of the program 2\\1/2\\ years ago, several problems have \nbeen brought to my attention. These problems include decisions \nregarding eligibility for the program which are inconsistent across the \ncountry--no quality assurance program to monitor the quality, \nconsistency and timeliness of those decisions, and no formal process to \nappeal the decisions of eligibility for caregiver assistance.\n  Let me highlight the issues with this program. I want to share some \nstories of veterans' experiences. A veteran applied to the program at \nthe VA in Colorado. His application was denied. Yet, after moving from \nColorado to Florida, he applied again using the exact same information \nhe had previously submitted in Colorado. The VA in Florida granted his \napplication. How can this happen? It is because we have an agency that \nhas yet to draw on the consistency needed to apply equally to our \nveterans.\n  Another veteran in Florida suffered from multiple gunshot wounds \nresulting in paraplegia. VA denied him entry into the program because \nhe did not require assistance with at least one activity of daily \nliving or ADL. He was being compensated through an aid and assistance \nor A & A program. I find it interesting that this veteran did not \nqualify for caregivers. He was actually compensated under the aid and \nassistance program because what he needs is ADL services, not just the \none required under the caregiver program.\n  In addition, I have also heard many veterans and their caregivers \nwere\n\n[[Page S1037]]\n\ntreated rudely by the VA staff when applying to these programs for a \nPTSD diagnosis. VA staff have told them that PTSD--get this--that PTSD \nis not a disability that requires assistance with ADLs or activities of \ndaily living.\n  Assistance with the activities of daily living is only one of the \nfour criteria needed as having a serious injury. Under the law, a \nveteran needs to meet one of the four. Even the appeals process does \nnot seem to be well thought through. You see, we can write the laws, \nbut it is the agency's regulations that they write that dictate how \nthese programs are run.\n  VA says that they have an appeals process. However, it is vastly \ndifferent from the appeals process at VBA, the Veterans Benefit \nAdministration. It leaves Veterans Service Officers or VSOs at a \ndisadvantage to help veterans and their caregivers. VSOs have been told \nthat VA considers it a medical decision and they cannot question the \ndenial. The only recourse veterans and their caregivers have is to \nappeal to the medical center director. The problem with this is that it \nwas the medical center director who denied the appeal in the first \nplace.\n  I am going to go on as the days go on, describing the things in this \nprogram that we would all like to embrace, things that I think every \nMember of the Senate says: Yes, we ought to do this for veterans. Here \nis the problem. If we have a broken system, jamming more people into it \nis actually the worst thing we can do.\n  As I said earlier, there is nothing in the Sanders bill to fix the \nthings that are broken at VA. There is nothing in the alternative bill \nto fix things in the VA. But the one thing that I do not do in the \nalternative bill is I do not jam millions more veterans into the \nsystem. Caregivers should be expanded as VA perfects how to implement \nit, to educate the caregivers, to be able to address the concerns, and, \nmore importantly, the intent of why we wrote the program.\n  Enrollment or access to VA should only open if we have the health \ncare professionals or the facilities to handle them, but not to crowd \nout those current veterans who leave the battlefield today and need the \nservices that only the VA can provide. So, even though in everybody's \nwish list we would like to expand to every veteran, in the caregiver \nprogram we would like to expand to everybody who wants to care for a \nloved one, the truth is, we do the ones who are in the system an \ninjustice if we are not prepared to be able to implement it, to handle \nit. That is the difference between the Sanders bill and my alternative. \nWe simply look at the things that have bipartisan support, but do not \nnecessarily grow the problem worse than it is today.\n  I said earlier, my regret--and I see my colleague from South Carolina \nis here. My regret in this debate is that we are not on the Senate \nfloor debating reforms to the Veterans' Administration. I think the \npresiding officer would agree that there are areas--these are areas \nthat do not have a partisan leaning. When we look at our Nation's \nveterans, we do not see one side of the aisle or the other. We see a \npromise we made to them and a commitment we have got to fulfill.\n  To ignore the things that need reform really is a mistake. To talk \nabout expanding the population without reforming these areas, quite \nfrankly, is disingenuous to the veterans to whom we owe so much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, one, I would like to compliment Senator \nBurr for trying to find a way to improve veterans health care. I think \nthe comment he made is pretty accurate. Before you expand a system that \nis clearly broken, it looks to me like you would want to fix it.\n  There is a bipartisan view that it is broken. A lot of solutions have \nbipartisan support. But we are where we are. I know Senator Sanders is \nvery genuine about wanting to expand veterans' benefits. I certainly \nunderstand where Senator Burr is coming from. We want to, one, pay for \nwhatever we do, because we are $17 trillion in debt. But, two, we have \nto look at the broken system. If you include another 14 million \nveterans, people who are not service connected and make them overnight \neligible for VA health care that is in short supply, you will frustrate \nthe ones who need it the most and take a weak system and completely \nbreak it. It seems to me that is not helping veterans at all.\n  But part of the package that Senator Burr has authored also deals \nwith another problem of great and immediate concern: imposing sanctions \non the Iranian nuclear program if the negotiations fail to deliver the \ndesired result.\n  This is an unfortunate moment for me. Senators Menendez and Kirk have \nbeen a team for a long time working to impose sanctions on the Iranian \ngovernment as they march toward a nuclear weapon. We have imposed 16 \nrounds of sanctions since 1987; 9 U.N. Security Council resolutions \nsince 2006, demanding the full and sustained suspension of all uranium \nenrichment related and reprocessing activities and its full cooperation \nwith the IAEA.\n  This body has been bipartisan when it comes to the Iranian nuclear \nprogram and our support for Israel. Senator Menendez has been one of \nthe leading voices in the entire Congress. He deserves lots of credit. \nHe is my friend. We have a new round of sanctions that are bipartisan. \nWe have 17 Democratic cosponsors. We have all but two Republicans. So \nwe have 59 cosponsors that would allow sanctions to be available and in \nplace if we do not reach a final deal in this round of negotiations in \nthe P5+1.\n  Why is it important that the Congress reimpose sanctions through new \nlegislation if there is failure? No. 1, the sanctions are designed to \nget the end game right. I believe that the only successful outcome \nthrough negotiations would be to dismantle the plutonium-producing \nreactor. The Iranians do not need a plutonium-producing reactor for a \ncivilian nuclear power program to comply with the U.N. resolution that \nrequires the removal of all highly enriched uranium. A lot of highly \nenriched uranium is now in the hands of the Iranian government. The \nU.N., of all bodies, has asked for it to be removed and turned over to \nthe international community.\n  I worry that if you leave this highly enriched uranium in place in \nIran, we will live to regret it. A dirty bomb becomes a real \npossibility. The other aspect of a final deal that has to be \naccomplished, in my view, is that the Iranian regime should be out of \nthe enrichment business.\n  There are 15 nations that have nuclear power programs that do not \nenrich uranium. Mexico and Canada are two of those nations. We are \nobjecting to the South Koreans who want to go into the enrichment \nbusiness. I do not mind South Korea having a nuclear power program, but \nwe really have to watch the spread of nuclear proliferation through the \nenrichment of uranium.\n  It is imminently possible to have a nuclear power program and have \nthe fuel cycle controlled. You do not need to enrich to have commercial \nnuclear power. If you were going to make a list of countries that are \nunreliable and dangerous, and you would not want to give the right to \nenrich, I think Iran would be at the top. Just look at how this regime \nhas behaved over the last 30 years. I do not have to time to go into \nall of the ``list of horribles,'' but our resolutions regarding the \nIranian nuclear program list them very well.\n  So we are at an impasse now. The Republican position is that we \nshould have a new sanctions vote on the bipartisan sanctions bill now \nwhile the negotiations are going on to reinforce to the international \ncommunity that we are very serious about pressure being applied to the \nIranians until we get the deal that we all can live with. I think it is \nfair to say that the Iranians would not be in negotiations without \ncrippling sanctions.\n  I want to give credit to the Obama administration for implementing a \nsanctions regime that really did cripple the Iranian economy, and it \nhas gotten them to the table. Unfortunately, the interim deal has \nabsolutely undercut all of our gains. I will give you some details as \nto why all we have accomplished has been undercut and the sanctions \nregime that got the Iranians to the table is crumbling before our eyes.\n\n[[Page S1038]]\n\n  Here is what our allies in Israel say. The prime minister of Israel \nsaid: ``Iran got the deal of the century, the international community \ngot a bad deal.'' I think he is absolutely right. Under the interim \ndeal, not 1 ounce of highly enriched uranium is required to be taken \nout of Iran. Some of it would be chemically altered, and you can \nreverse that chemical process so that it could be processed for weapons \nuse later down the road.\n  Not one centrifuge has been destroyed. Of the 16,000 to 18,000 \ncentrifuges, not one has been destroyed. The plutonium-producing \nreactor is not being dismantled. It has been mothballed, for lack of a \nbetter word. I am not so sure it is even in a mothball status.\n  So the prime minister of Israel says: ``Iran got the deal of the \ncentury, the international community got a bad deal.'' Again, I would \nagree. Nothing has been accomplished in the interim deal. The interim \ndeal is so far away from a final deal, I do not see how you get there.\n  We have to dismantle the plutonium reactor completely, not just stop \nits construction or delay its construction. We should remove all of the \nhighly enriched uranium out of the hands of the ayatollahs because it \nis too dangerous to leave it there. The U.N. agrees with that. That is \nthe end position. They should not be allowed to enrich. If the Iranians \nwant a peaceful nuclear power program, I will be the first to say: That \nis fine. Build a reactor in Iran. Build a couple of reactors if you \nlike. Have the Russians help the Iranians construct their reactor, as \nlong as the international community can control the fuel cycle.\n  There is no need to enrich in Iran for a peaceful nuclear power \nprogram. We would be crazy as a nation and a world to give this regime \nthe right to enrich uranium and have a breakout, to go from low-level \nenrichment to 90 percent, to make a nuclear weapon. I think that is \nwhat they are trying to do. I would like every Senator to be able to \nanswer a question from their constituents about this issue. Do you \nbelieve the Iranians have been trying to build a nuclear bomb rather \nthan a nuclear power program?\n  It is clear to me they have been trying to build a nuclear bomb for a \nvery long time. They get right up to the edge. They have one of the \nmost sophisticated enrichment programs in the world. I do not think it \nis designed to produce peaceful nuclear power.\n  Here is what the head of Iran's nuclear agency said last night:\n\n       The iceberg of sanctions is melting while our centrifuges \n     are also still working. This is our greatest achievement.\n\n  He is right. I mean, what more can I say? The head of the Iranian \nnuclear agency, said on Iranian state television:\n\n       The iceberg of sanctions is melting while our centrifuges \n     are also still working. This is our greatest achievement.\n\n  This is what the foreign minister said:\n\n       The White House tries to portray it as basically a \n     dismantling of Iranian's nuclear program.\n\n  The interim deal--\n\n       We are not dismantling any centrifuges, we're not \n     dismantling any equipment, we're simply not producing, not \n     enriching over 5 percent.\n\n  They are telling us and the world, with this interim deal, they are \nnot dismantling a damn thing.\n  President Rouhani, the new moderate--if you believe that, I have some \nproperty I want to sell you--said on CNN: ``So there will be no \ndestruction of centrifuges--of existing centrifuges?'' President \nRouhani said: ``No. No, not at all.''\n  Well, if you believe, as I do, they should be out of the enrichment \nbusiness, then all the centrifuges should be dismantled and destroyed. \nBecause to allow this regime to continue to enrich is dangerous and, \nquite frankly, will lead to a military conflict between Israel and Iran \nand maybe others.\n  President Rouhani tweeted:\n\n       Our relationship with the world is based on Iranian \n     nation's interest. In Geneva agreement, world powers \n     surrendered to Iran's national will.\n\n  Well, maybe that is bluster. When you look at the evidence, it's not \nso much bluster. The Deputy Foreign Minister said of the \ninterconnections between networks of centrifuges that have been used to \nenrich uranium to 20 percent, so that they can enrich only to 5 \npercent:\n\n       These interconnections can be removed in a day and \n     connected again in a day.\n\n  So he is basically saying all we have done is basically pull the plug \nand we will just put it back in if we need to.\n  Here is what has happened since the interim deal with the sanctions \nregime. President Rouhani declared:\n\n       We have struck the first blow to the illegal sanctions, in \n     the fields of insurance, shipping, the banking system, \n     foodstuffs and medicine and exports of petrochemical \n     materials.\n\n  He tweeted:\n\n       You are witness to how foreign firms are visiting our \n     country; 117 political delegations have come here.\n\n  France, Turkey, Georgia, Ireland, Tunisia, Kazakhstan, China, Italy, \nIndia, Austria, and Sweden. The French chamber of commerce led a \ndelegation to Iran not long ago with the head of Michelin Tire Company. \nI have been talking to the Michelin Company. They are not going to \nviolate the sanctions, but they do believe that after this interim deal \nthe smart money is that the sanctions are behind us.\n  The International Monetary Fund predicted Iran's economy could turn \naround due to the interim agreement. Listen to this:\n\n       The economy in Iran that was crippled because of the \n     sanctions could turn around based on the interim agreement \n     that doesn't dismantle or remove anything. Prospects for 2014 \n     and 2015 have improved with an interim P5+1 agreement. Real \n     GDP growing by 1 to 2 percent in 2014-2015. Inflation would \n     potentially climb 15 to 20 percent. India's oil imports from \n     Iran more than doubled in January from a month earlier. China \n     has emerged as Iran's top trading partner, with nonoil trade \n     hitting $13 billion over the last 10 months. U.S. aerospace \n     companies are seeking permission to sell airline parts to \n     Iran for the first time in three decades. Iran has signed a \n     deal to sell Iraq arms and ammunition worth $195 million, \n     according to documents seen by Reuters. At least 13 major \n     international companies have said in recent weeks they aim to \n     reenter the Iranian marketplace over the next several months.\n\n  These sanctions, my friends on the other side, are crumbling. If we \ndo not reset what is going on, the leverage we have gained is being \nlost. We are marching toward a disaster. Having a new round of \nsanctions passed by Congress would tell the international community \nfrom our point of view this is not behind us, we are not going to take \nthe pressure off until we get a result that makes our country and our \nallies in the region safe, particularly Israel. If we do not act now, \nit will be too late.\n  To our friends at the White House: When you threaten to veto \nlegislation and you accuse people who want to impose sanctions if the \ndeal fails as wanting to going to war, I am afraid you completely \nmisunderstand the situation as it really exists. I am willing to give \nyou credit for imposing the sanctions in a forceful way, but you are \nnaive and dangerous in your thought process if you think we can now \nnegotiate with the sanctions crumbling and get the right answer.\n  The Iranian monetary unit, the rial, has appreciated by over 25 \npercent. The Iranian economy is rebounding after the interim deal. They \nare back in business. Inflation is down, the value of their currency is \nup, people are lining up to do business in Iran, the sanctions are \ncrumbling, and the U.S. Senate sits quiet.\n  All I can say is that we have a chance to turn this around before it \nis too late. I believe the best thing we could do as a body is for \nRepublicans and Democrats to pass a new round of sanctions that would \nonly take place at the end of the 6-month period if a final deal is not \nachieved that results in the things I have outlined.\n  The bipartisan sanction bill reinforces the end game of basically \ndismantling the ability of the Iranians to develop a nuclear weapon. We \nhave specific language in the sanctions bill that would get us to a \ngood outcome. I am afraid by the time the 6 months is up, the economy \nin Iran will have rebounded and the will of the international community \nto go through this process again will have been lost.\n  Right now the smart money is that Iran is a place you can soon do \nbusiness, the sanctions are history, and our European allies, I am \nafraid, will accept a deal with the Iranians that is not in our \nnational interest and will certainly not be good for our allies.\n  I am very worried the P5+1 has already conceded in their own mind \nsome\n\n[[Page S1039]]\n\nenrichment capability in the hands of the Iranian regime for the \npurpose of face saving, supposedly. We should not worry about allowing \nthe Iranians to save face, given what they have done to our soldiers in \nIraq, the amount of terrorism they have spread throughout the world, \nand the way they have behaved. I am not in the face-saving business \nwhen it comes to Iran. I am in protecting America's national security \ninterest business.\n  I do not mind the Iranians having a nuclear power program for \npeaceful purposes, as long as you control the fuel cycle. But if they \nwant more than that, that tells you all you need to know about what \ntheir ambitions are.\n  I say to my colleagues on the other side: If you allow any enrichment \ncapability left in the hands of the Shia Persians in Iran, the Sunni \nArabs are going to insist on a like capability. And I am here to tell \nyou if you want to turn the Mideast into the ultimate powder keg, allow \nthe Iranians to have an enrichment program. Because every Sunni Arab \nnation that can afford one will want a like program. If you think you \ncan allow the Iranians to enrich uranium and the Sunni Arabs will sit \non the sidelines and do nothing, you don't understand the Mideast. If \nyou want to set the world on the road to Armageddon, that will be the \nend of nonproliferation in the Mideast. The interim deal is a bad deal \nfor the world, according to the Prime Minister, and a great deal for \nIran. The Prime Minister of Israel is right.\n  If this administration is contemplating a final agreement that does \nnot remove all the highly enriched uranium in Iran, consistent with the \nU.N. resolution, it is making a mistake for the ages. If this \nadministration is going to sign on to a deal that allows enrichment to \ncontinue in Iran, where they now have a class of centrifuges that can \ntake less than 5 percent uranium and spin it up to 90 percent, that \nwill be a mistake for the ages.\n\n  This is North Korea in the making. But unlike North Korea, where they \neventually went nuclear after the international community, through \ninspections and sanctions, tried to stop their program, Japan and South \nKorea have yet to feel the need to obtain a nuclear weapon to counter \nthe North Koreans. I can assure you the Sunni Arab nations in the \nMideast will not put themselves in that position. All you have to do is \nask them.\n  I challenge every Member of this body to get on the phone and call \nthe major Sunni Arab states and ask them a simple question: If the \nIranians are allowed to enrich, will you insist on the same right? See \nwhat they tell you.\n  We have a chance here, if we are smart, to reset the table before \nthese sanctions completely crumble, and they are. If you think you can \nwait 6 months, have them completely crumble and reimpose sanctions, you \nare kidding yourself, because the world is not going to go down that \nroad.\n  What will happen if this negotiation with Iran fails to deliver what \nI think is the right outcome--a peaceful nuclear power program without \nany capability to make a nuclear weapon--I think the people throughout \nthe region are going to respond forcefully and in kind and our friends \nin Israel and the world are hurt.\n  Can Israel tolerate the ayatollahs in Iran having the ability to \ndevelop a nuclear weapon and the only thing between the State of \nIsrael's security is a bunch of U.N. inspectors? Now think about that. \nWould you put America's national security at risk, and the only thing \nbetween a hostile nation having a nuclear weapon and threatening to \nwipe us off the map and success is a bunch of U.N. inspectors? How well \ndid that work in North Korea? That is not a viable outcome.\n  We have to stop this program completely. It must be dismantled, not \nmothballed. It has to be dismantled. If the Iranians want a nuclear \npowerplant for peaceful purposes, they can have one as long as somebody \nresponsible controls the fuel cycle.\n  We are headed toward a disaster if we don't act pretty quickly. I \ndon't mean to be so dire, but look at the Mideast. Look at the Syrian \neffort to contain the Syrian chemical weapons program. These thuggish \nregimes are not going to turn over the advantages they have until the \nregime itself is threatened. I believe the Iranians, after Syria, do \nnot believe anymore that our country has the will to use military force \nas a last resort to stop their nuclear program. No matter what \nPresident Obama says, his actions speak far louder than his words. We \ncould change things if the Congress would impose new sanctions, \nbipartisan in nature. It would actually allow the administration some \nleverage they do not have today.\n  The reason for the bipartisan bill, as in the Burr alternative to the \nSanders bill, is that many of us believe now that time is not on our \nside. And to my friends on the other side, I hate the fact we have now \nsplit on what to do about Iran and how to impose sanctions. I have \nenjoyed, as much as anything in my entire time in the Senate, working \nwith my Democratic and Republican colleagues to craft policies designed \nto get the right answer when it comes to the Iranian nuclear threat. \nBut we are now in a different spot.\n  As much as I hate it, I feel compelled, from my point of view, to use \nevery opportunity this body presents to bring up the issue. If you do \nnot believe the sanctions are crumbling, I would love to hear your \nexplanation as to why they are still working, given the information \nthat is overwhelming.\n  So I hope in the coming days we can regain that bipartisanship. The \nmajority leader, several months ago, promised a vote on Iran sanctions \nif we could find a bipartisan bill. He made that promise, and I will \nquote that later in the week. What has happened between then and now is \nthe President has weighed in. He has tried to lock his party down and \nhe has threatened to veto this sanctions bill.\n  Now is not the time to turn the Senate over to the Obama \nadministration, which does not have a very good track record when it \ncomes to policing the Mideast. Actually, we are helping them, whether \nthey believe it or not. The last thing I want is a conflict anywhere in \nthe world that can be avoided, but here are our choices: If the \nnegotiations fail, Israel will not stand for a nuclear-capable Iran. If \nyou attack Iran, you open Pandora's box and many bad things can happen.\n  I can tell you this, if there is a war between us and Iran, they \nlose, we win. This is not much of a debate militarily. But it is always \na terrible thing to go to war unless you absolutely have to. So if the \nIranians believe we are serious about sanctions and we are serious \nabout using military force as a last resort, we may actually still get \nthe right answer.\n  If they don't believe that, we are putting Israel and our allies in a \nterrible spot. If the Iranian program survives these negotiations and \nthey march toward a nuclear weapon as the North Koreans did, if the \nU.N. inspections fail and they achieve their goal of a nuclear weapon, \nthen we have emptied Pandora's box, because every Sunni Arab state will \nfollow in kind. Then only God knows what happens next. We have a chance \nto avoid that.\n  But Israel will never stand for the proposition that the only thing \nbetween the ayatollahs having a nuclear weapon and the State of \nIsrael's survival is a bunch of U.N. inspectors trying to control a \nprogram with a live capability; and Sunni Arab states will not allow \nthe Iranians to enrich without them claiming an equal right. All this \ncan be avoided if we act decisively. But if we continue to wait and \nallow the sanctions to crumble, God help us all.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, late this week, Vermont will recognize \nthe noteworthy legacy of Ed Koren, who\n\n[[Page S1040]]\n\nwas recently named Vermont's second Cartoonist Laureate. A resident of \nBrookfield, VT, Mr. Koren is best known nationally for his distinctive \ncreature cartoons that appear in the New Yorker. His work has also been \nfeatured in many other publications.\n  Mr. Koren grew up in Mount Vernon, NY, and attended Columbia \nUniversity, where he first began sketching cartoons for the \nuniversity's magazine. Encouraged by a favorable review of one of his \nearliest works, Mr. Koren then dedicated himself to drawing \ninvestigative and satirical cartoons. His hard work, quick wit, and \nunique social commentary are evidenced in his work. In true Vermont \ntradition, he has also found the time to volunteer as a firefighter in \nhis small community for the past 26 years.\n  I am proud to recognize Ed Koren's achievement as Vermont's Cartoon \nLaureate. The Vermont Digger recently published a profile of this \naccomplished man who has adopted Vermont as his home that captures all \nthat is so unique about his character and creativity. I ask that the \narticle, ``Cartoonist Ed Koren earns a Vermont laurel, but don't expect \nhim to rest on it,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Vermont Digger, Feb. 16, 2014]\n\n   This State: Cartoonist Ed Koren Earns A Vermont Laurel, But Don't \n                        Expect Him To Rest on it\n\n                          (By Andrew Nemethy)\n\n       From his rambling 1840s farmhouse in Brookfield in central \n     Vermont, Ed Koren looks out on Sunset Lake and a \n     quintessential Vermont village whose famed floating bridge is \n     an icon of the state. But as a cartoonist, Koren's off-beat, \n     pinballing mind is focused on a different view, as he scans \n     the strange landscape of human foibles, fads, social mores \n     and culture. It's a scene that has sustained him for more \n     than five decades.\n       ``There's something always new, or quirky or nutty or \n     outrageous,'' he says, describing the lode of material that \n     keeps inspiring his cartoons. ``To me, it never ends, and \n     it's great for that.''\n       By a cranial alchemy that even he is hard-pressed to \n     explain, what he sees out in the world gets distilled into \n     cartoons populated by fuzzy big-beaked creatures and captions \n     that capture the essence of whatever tickled his perceptive \n     fancy. What emerges in his cartoons is at once universal but \n     also artisanal and localvore because of the settings, which \n     reflect the terroir of his adopted state. Take a recent New \n     Yorker cartoon whose locale was instantly recognizable to any \n     patron of the Three Penny Taproom in Montpelier, from the \n     layout to the bartender to the list of beers, which included \n     ``Curtis India Pale Ale'' (his wife's name is Curtis) ``Onion \n     River Saison'' and ``Camel's Hump Imperial Stout.''\n       ``I kind of bring it home,'' he says simply. ``It's like a \n     tribute to friends. It's capturing what I like about living \n     here.''\n       It's entirely fitting, then, that on Feb. 27, Koren will be \n     recognized as Vermont's Cartoonist Laureate at the \n     Statehouse, and will give a talk at the Center for Cartoon \n     Studies in White River Junction, which nominated him for the \n     award. (Burlington's James Kolchalka was the first.)\n       Koren is honored and, typically, quick to riff humorously \n     about the nomination, quipping that he may have to wear a \n     neck brace. ``It's a weighty thing,'' he says of the honor \n     and a potential swelled head. He then dredges up a quote from \n     his literary mind, attributed to politician and UN ambassador \n     Adlai Stevenson: ``Flattery is all right so long as you don't \n     inhale.''\n       Truth is, there's little danger of flattery going to his \n     head. Koren lives a well-grounded rural life in Brookfield: \n     For 26 years he has served in the volunteer fire department, \n     a job he loves, though he admits at 78, hauling hoses and \n     pouring water on house fires, the ``real grunt work,'' is \n     beyond his capacity today.\n       ``I'm getting to be too old,'' he says.\n       When it comes to cartoons, few artists have a style as \n     distinctive and easily recognizable as Koren's squiggly \n     creatures, which have appeared all over Vermont, his donation \n     to nonprofits and other organizations he deems worthy. Koren \n     himself is small-beaked and not very large, with a bushy gray \n     mustache, a frequent twinkle in his eye and a sprightly gait \n     that reflects his exercise pursuits, which range seasonally \n     from cross-country skiing to biking and paddling. He's famed \n     for exercising daily, which he says refreshes his mind and \n     his sense of the beauty in the world.\n       Imagine a lean, fit fatherly elf with a curmudgeonly tinge, \n     and you're not far off (though it's more grandfatherly these \n     days, thanks to grandkids from his first marriage). He now \n     lives with his wife Curtis and an elderly Siamese feline \n     named Catmandu.\n       Koren, who was raised in Mount Vernon, N.Y., was doing a \n     teaching gig in graphic arts at Brown University when Vermont \n     beckoned and he moved here permanently.\n       ``I fell into this house in Brookfield from a year-old copy \n     of Country Journal,'' he explains. He saw an ad for the house \n     in the magazine, checked it out, fell in love with its \n     village location, and, while living in New York City, bought \n     the place in 1978 as a second home.\n       His ties to the Green Mountains go much further back, \n     however, to his teens when he attended a summer theater camp \n     in Waitsfield. The lush landscape and way of life was \n     beguiling. ``Like a lot of kids, it stays with you,'' he \n     says.\n       While Vermont offers fodder and settings for his cartoons, \n     he admits to living a yin and yang existence. ``I've always \n     been a New Yorker because I've spent so much of my life \n     there. I'm at a heart a city guy, but I'm at heart a country \n     guy,'' he says. And like many a Vermont country guy, he's \n     now, in mid-February, admitting to being weary of winter as \n     he lugs in firewood from the shed to keep his Vermont \n     Castings stove going and his house warm.\n       Koren was drawn to the arts early. As a kid, he was \n     inspired to draw by Al Capp's Li'l Abner, especially the \n     simple lovable cartoon characters known as ``Shmoos.'' He \n     began drawing cartoons in the mid-1950s at Columbia \n     University for the college humor magazine, ``Jester,'' and \n     then went on to study graphic arts in Paris and to receive an \n     MFA from Pratt Institute. He was feeling tugged in several \n     career directions--city planning, architecture, and graphic \n     arts--when a ``kindly response'' from The New Yorker about \n     looking at his cartoons put his future on course.\n       Koren landed in the magazine's pages in its literary heyday \n     when the legendary William Shawn was editor. His \n     illustrations and cartoons began appearing in The New York \n     Times, Time and Newsweek magazines, as well as in ads for \n     financial publications and Fortune 500 companies, and in a \n     wide range of books. Always a freelance artist, for a number \n     of years in the late 1990s he fell out of favor at the New \n     Yorker (it was ``an unreliable family member'') but now seems \n     to be back in the magazine's cartoon graces.\n       Koren is vague in describing how he came up with the \n     creatures in his cartoons, which he roughs out and then \n     refines in a lengthy process using pen and ink on large \n     pieces of art paper measuring about two feet on each side. \n     Those squiggly lined creatures of his just sort of happened, \n     he says, explaining his style had a ``lax way of evolving'' \n     and that he ``wasn't trying to do any of what I achieved.''\n       Koren draws in a spacious and cluttered studio at one end \n     of his house, with two tables, stacks of books and walls \n     pinned with illustrations, hand-written quotes and mementoes. \n     Underneath one table is a bank of 40 drawers that hold \n     decades of his life in pen and ink.\n       ``I save everything. I'm a pack rat. I hate to throw things \n     away,'' he admits.\n       As for his captions, which often nail smug and self-\n     important people and modern life in general, he says he keeps \n     his ears open ``like two giant antennas,'' especially when he \n     is visiting New York City. At home he reads a lot and listens \n     to radio (WDEV, VPR and NHPR.)\n       Does he ever think of retiring? ``Never!'' he says, \n     recoiling at the idea. Besides, humanity is constantly \n     providing inflated egos to puncture and trends to lampoon.\n       ``It's part of my life. If I didn't do that, what would I \n     do?'' he asks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/25/senate-section/article/S1040-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1040-S1041]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DAVID RUBENSTEIN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, in recent years, as difficult budget \nquestions have beset the debate in Washington about how best to rein in \nspending while meeting our shared responsibilities to Americans, our \ncommunities, and the world, our Nation's treasures--from the monuments \nthat dot the National Mall to the historic relics that line the halls \nof the Smithsonian museums--have had to shore up spending and face the \nreality that the government simply can't foot the bill the way it used \nto.\n  Tough decisions in Washington have led many with the means to \nincrease their charitable giving, but none compare to the generosity of \nDavid Rubenstein, businessman, family man, philanthropist. He is also a \nfriend to many. But most importantly, he is a friend to many of \nAmerica's national treasures. I cherish his friendship.\n  You need not walk far in Washington to find Mr. Rubenstein's mark. I \nhear often from Vermonters who have come to Washington, for work or a \nfamily vacation, who visit such iconic places as the National Zoo, the \nKennedy Center, the Library of Congress, and, of course, the \nSmithsonians. All bear some sign of Mr. Rubenstein's generosity.\n  The New York Times recently featured a profile of this man and what \nhe calls ``patriotic giving.'' I ask unanimous consent that a copy of \nthat profile be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordred to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S1041]]\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 21, 2014]\n\n  A Billionaire Philanthropist in Washington Who's Big on ``Patriotic \n                                Giving''\n\n                        (By Jennifer Steinhauer)\n\n       Washington.--The expansive reach of David M. Rubenstein \n     into the public life of the nation's capital can be seen \n     during a brief excursion from his downtown office at the \n     Carlyle Group , the private equity firm that he co-founded \n     and that made him a billionaire.\n       Begin across the street at the National Archives, the site \n     of the new gallery, named after him, where Magna Carta, which \n     he bought in 2007 for $23 million, is on permanent loan. Then \n     head to the Library of Congress, and see the first map of the \n     United States, also his, in the Great Hall.\n       Make your way to the earthquake-damaged Washington \n     Monument, which will reopen this spring after a $15 million \n     repair, half paid for by Mr. Rubenstein, then zip to the John \n     F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, where his $75 \n     million has bought, among other things, a new pipe organ. End \n     up at the National Zoo, where baby Bao Bao frolics in the \n     panda habitat Mr. Rubenstein endowed, part of a $7 million \n     Smithsonian gift.\n       Over the years, Mr. Rubenstein, who has a fortune estimated \n     at $3 billion, has made gifts to the usual array of \n     universities, hospitals and cultural organizations beloved by \n     wealthy donors. But he stands nearly alone in shoring up \n     institutions generally under the purview of the federal \n     government. About $200 million of the $300 million he has \n     given away has been what he calls ``patriotic giving.''\n       ``The United States cannot afford to do the things it used \n     to do,'' Mr. Rubenstein said, ``and I think it would be a \n     good thing if more people would say: 'My national zoo needs \n     money, the archives need money. I think we're going to have \n     to do more for them.' ''\n       And there is plenty more to do in a city that has not only \n     suffered from cutbacks in federal spending but which \n     historically has lacked both the wealth and the philanthropic \n     traditions of places like New York. While there were wealthy \n     and civic-minded men like Duncan Phillips and Eugene Meyer \n     who left their mark on Washington in the last century, it was \n     the federal government that built and maintained the parks \n     and museums that in other cities donors endowed, according to \n     Steven Pearlstein, a professor of public and international \n     affairs at George Mason University and a columnist for The \n     Washington Post. ``The federal government was the sugar \n     daddy,'' he said.\n       For the most part, according to Mr. Pearlstein, Washington \n     has been a place where the currency has been power more than \n     money. In the past two decades, that has begun to change as \n     government contracting, banking and the law have created a \n     new wealthy class in the city and its suburbs, but no one has \n     given his money away quite like Mr. Rubenstein.\n       ``This kind of giving is starting to happen more often \n     because governments are really suffering,'' said Stacy \n     Palmer, the editor of The Chronicle of Philanthropy. ``But \n     the extent of Rubenstein's giving sets him apart.''\n       Such giving, she said, is a subject of feverish debate in \n     the philanthropy world, where many believe that private money \n     should not permit government to abdicate responsibilities and \n     in turn drain cash from food banks, hospitals and other \n     services in need. There are ``concerns about whether it is a \n     good idea for philanthropy to step in for government,'' Ms. \n     Palmer said.\n       Mr. Rubenstein, 64, who first came to Washington to work in \n     government, offers a simple explanation for what he has done: \n     ``I felt I owed my country a lot. I also felt I owed the city \n     a lot. I built my company here; I met my wife here.''\n       He grew up in modest means in Baltimore; his father sorted \n     mail for the Postal Service and his mother was a homemaker. \n     After college and law school, he worked in a New York law \n     firm before getting a job on Capitol Hill for the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee. In 1977, he joined the Carter \n     administration, where he spent his days toiling over domestic \n     policy as a White House aide, and met his wife, Alice Rogoff, \n     who worked at the Office of Management and Budget. Newsweek \n     once called him ``the White House workaholic.''\n       After his stint ended, Mr. Rubenstein took another \n     corporate law job but reassessed and concluded that he was \n     ``a mediocre lawyer.'' With some partners, he set out to \n     found Carlyle, named after the hotel in New York City, \n     quickly accruing a fortune in the world of leveraged buyouts.\n       Ten years ago, Mr. Rubenstein said, he began to consider \n     his legacy, and after learning from some actuarial tables \n     that white Jewish males were likely to live to 81, decided to \n     start plowing a lot of his money--and his time--into \n     philanthropic causes. ``There are other wonderful donors in \n     Washington,'' said Michael M. Kaiser, president of the \n     Kennedy Center, ``but it's the range of his giving and his \n     collection of interests that is staggering.''\n       In choosing his beneficiaries, Mr. Rubenstein relies on his \n     interests and his gut. He has a passion for American history \n     and can lecture extemporaneously and at length about \n     presidents, historic documents, the civil rights movement and \n     beyond--and has no staff or foundation to vet requests.\n       He spends little time agonizing over a donation. ``To some \n     extent when you've made the money, you feel you can give it \n     away more rapidly,'' he said.\n       In January 2013, Curt Viebranz, the president of George \n     Washington's Mount Vernon, took Mr. Rubenstein around the \n     museum to show him how it had displayed some of his \n     documents.\n       Over lunch, Mr. Viebranz recalled: ``I felt emboldened to \n     ask him for a large gift, and much to my surprise and \n     happiness, he made that $10 million gift in February. It was \n     a remarkably efficient process.'' He added, ``It can take \n     years of cultivating a donor to get a gift of that size.''\n       If you don't call Mr. Rubenstein, he might call you. If you \n     do ``make the ask,'' expect to get an answer in weeks. While \n     Mr. Rubenstein likes to see results--and despite his \n     unassuming manner, is not averse to seeing his name on the \n     doors of his beneficiaries--he does not use the complex \n     success metrics of philanthropists like Eli Broad in Los \n     Angeles. He tends not to check in, but if beneficiaries send \n     an update, they hear back from him, no matter his time zone \n     (he travels roughly 250 days a year).\n       The donations can be transformative. Mr. Rubenstein will \n     endow the expansion of the Kennedy Center, which otherwise \n     would have had to go to Congress for an appropriation. At \n     Monticello, his $10 million gift allowed Leslie Greene \n     Bowman, president of the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, as she \n     puts it, ``to return the mountaintop of Monticello to \n     something Jefferson would have recognized in just a few years \n     what I would venture to say would have taken at least a \n     decade to accomplish.''\n       Mr. Rubenstein says he likes to apply the ``mother \n     standard'' to giving. ``When I built Carlyle, my mother \n     didn't call to say, `I'm so proud,' he said. ``When I give a \n     gift to some place of importance, she calls and says, `I'm \n     proud.'

Mr. President, today I remember a dear friend to Marcelle \nand me. Stratton ``Stratty'' Lines was for more than 40 years the \nproprietor of the Oasis Diner in Burlington, VT. Throughout its \nhistory, the diner was the center of many a political discussion over a \nhearty breakfast or tasty lunch and lots of laughs too. At the center \nof all the activity was Stratty, a first-generation American who, with \nhis family, built a successful business in downtown Burlington. One of \nStratty's sons, David, describes his father as the ``quintessential \nVermonter.'' Stratty was that and so much more. He was a good family \nman and a hard worker who cared about working people.\n  I have many fond memories of the Oasis Diner, perhaps chief among \nthem, eating breakfast there, celebrating with Stratty, and thanking \nvoters the morning after I was first elected to the Senate in 1974. The \ndiner was a popular stop among visitors to Vermont, including President \nBill Clinton and Vice President Walter Mondale. During their visits and \nduring my many trips to the diner, Stratty imparted the wisdom and \ncommon sense for which he was so well known and will be long \nremembered.\n  In memory of Stratty Lines, I ask that the article by Mike Donoghue \nof the Burlington Free Press, ``Oasis Diner proprietor Stratton \n`Stratty' Lines remembered as quintessential Vermonter,'' be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, Feb. 17, 2014]\n\n  Oasis Diner Proprietor Stratty Lines Remembered as ``Quintessential \n                              Vermonter''\n\n\n Stratty Lines, longtime owner of Burlington's Oasis Diner, remembered \n                       for food and conversation\n\n                           (By Mike Donoghue)\n\n       When Stratton ``Stratty'' Lines helped opened the Oasis \n     Diner more than 40 years ago, coffee was a dime, and \n     hamburgers cost 25 cents. Over the years, Lines served up \n     food to the rich and the poor, the famous and the infamous.\n       His customers included local politicians and the president \n     of the United States. The food was always good, and so was \n     the conversation.\n       ``I could learn more in 20 minutes with Stratty then I \n     could with any polls,'' said U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. \n     ``Stratty heard everything. He knew what was gossip and what \n     made sense.''\n       Lines often was spotted in a white short-order-cook hat \n     trimmed in red, a white shirt and an apron over his pants. He \n     also was a well-known Democratic supporter.\n       His health had been failing in recent months, one of his \n     sons, David, said, and he was found dead of natural causes \n     Friday at his Williston home. He was 84.\n       ``He was the quintessential Vermonter, a first-generation \n     American who established a small business that became an \n     institution in this community,'' David Lines said.\n       The Oasis Diner was a popular breakfast and lunch spot just \n     east of Church Street for\n\n[[Page S1042]]\n\n     the movers and shakers of greater Burlington, but also for \n     common folks. The draw was more than just the food--and more \n     than just politics. Stratty Lines would follow sports, \n     community events and all the other headlines of the day.\n       Leahy said a visit to Burlington was incomplete without a \n     stop at the Oasis to learn the latest. When he offered \n     condolences to David Lines, ``I said I loved going in \n     there,'' Leahy recounted. ``I could learn more going in there \n     by having breakfast.''\n       The Oasis remained a local institution until 2007, when the \n     business was sold to become a New York-style delicatessen. \n     The building now is home to El Cortijo.\n       Even in death, Lines sought to ensure people were properly \n     fed. The Chittenden County Meals on Wheels, along with the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs, are two organizations the \n     family has suggested people make donations in Lines' memory \n     instead of sending flowers.\n       Lines was born in Greece, graduated from Burlington High in \n     1947 and served as a military policeman in the U.S. armed \n     forces in Germany from 1951-53.\n       Leahy, Vermont's senior senator and a former Chittenden \n     County prosecutor, said lots of political debates were held \n     in the 17-by-40-foot diner. He said Lines enjoyed hearing the \n     hot-button topics of the day.\n       Lines was a gracious host, Leahy said, and always asked \n     about his wife, Marcelle, and their children before anything \n     else. Leahy said he believes he began frequenting the Oasis \n     as a student at St. Michael's College, where he graduated in \n     1961, but he became more of a regular following law school \n     and returning to Vermont in the mid '60s.\n       When he served as Chittenden County state's attorney, Leahy \n     said, he would sometimes run names of potential jurors past \n     Lines.\n       ``He'd say, `You might want to avoid that one,' or `That \n     would be a good one,' '' Leahy said.\n       Lines was as popular with house-painters as he was with \n     politicians. Alden Cadwell, 56, of Burlington said he always \n     enjoyed his stops at the diner.\n       ``Stratty was a big-hearted man with the biggest welcoming \n     smile in Burlington,'' Cadwell said. ``He ran a diner that a \n     regular patron came for the theater as much as the food.''\n       Cadwell said patrons got to hear cooks, waiters and other \n     customers exchanging orders and quips.\n       ``You did not leave the Oasis hungry or un-entertained,'' \n     Cadwell said.\n       Former federal Judge Albert W. Coffrin often could be seen \n     sitting on a revolving stool at the counter. Coffrin once \n     confided to a Burlington Free Press reporter that the Oasis \n     was among his favorite stops.\n       Lawyers, bankers, merchants, the clergy and others also \n     frequented the Burlington landmark.\n       Leahy said he brought President Bill Clinton into the diner \n     during a visit to Burlington on July 31, 1995, to speak at \n     the National Governors Association convention in South \n     Burlington.\n       After a picture-taking event that included Clinton, Leahy, \n     Lines and then-Gov. Howard Dean outside the diner, the \n     nation's commander-in-chief stepped inside to enjoy lunch. \n     The Oasis served up a hand-carved, overstuffed sandwich of \n     fresh turkey on seeded rye, a Diet Coke and a slice of apple \n     pie.\n       ``Thanks for a great lunch,'' Clinton said when he \n     departed.\n       ``This was the highlight of my life, after the birth of my \n     children,'' Lines would say later--especially significant, he \n     added, for the son of Greek immigrants who arrived in the \n     country without a dime.\n       His parents opened the diner in 1954, and Lines, who worked \n     briefly at General Electric, soon joined the family business.\n       Lines would later say proudly he picked up the tab for \n     President Clinton's meal.\n       ``I don't think he ever got over that,'' Dean said Monday \n     as he recalled the presidential visit.\n       ``Stratty was an important guy. The ordinary person \n     listened to him. He would rarely endorse somebody. He would \n     say, So and so was a good guy,''' the former Vermont governor \n     said.\n       ``He would be more blatant once he got to know you better. \n     He was the best of the old guard. He was socially \n     conservative and business conservative,'' Dean said. ``He was \n     very much for the working class. It was a family business, \n     and his kids were working in there. It was kind of cool.''\n       Clinton wasn't the only brush with greatness for Lines.\n       A picture of him shaking hands with President Jimmy Carter \n     also was displayed at the diner.\n       Vice President Walter Mondale stopped for pancakes shortly \n     before the March 1980 primary. Tipper Gore, wife of Vice \n     President Al Gore, enjoyed a slice of apple pie and ice cream \n     in July 1999. A few other celebrity customers included Susan \n     Sarandon, Tim Robbins, Lyle Lovett and Elliot Gould.\n       Lines was a longtime New York Yankees fan, but he said in \n     1977 that he converted to the Toronto Blue Jays after his \n     veteran sportscasting friend Tom Cheek left WVMT-AM in \n     Colchester and became the voice of the Blue Jays. Lines would \n     visit Cheek during spring training and during the regular \n     season.\n       Leahy said after he was elected to Congress, he would \n     receive phone calls from the White House or from ambassadors \n     and others while he was having breakfast at the Oasis. The \n     ambassador from Russia called once.\n       A few days later, a political friend called the diner and, \n     speaking with a put-on Russian accent, claimed to be a phone \n     operator in Moscow. He confirmed with Lines that Leahy had \n     taken the ambassador's call. The prankster told Lines the \n     politician's call was made collect, and he owed $437.84, and \n     then he hung up.\n       ``Stratty loved to tell the story to everyone about the \n     calls,'' Leahy said.\n       A celebration of Lines' life is planned for 4-7 p.m. \n     Thursday at the Corbin and Palmer Funeral Home in Essex \n     Junction.

Mr. President, in this age of digital readers and \nelectronic books, the fine craft of bookbinding may seem to some \narchaic. On the contrary: the fine skills, patience, and dedication \nrequired to mend the pages of some of our greatest treasures have \nbecome all the more critical to preserving printed books--for classics \nprinted decades or centuries ago, to cookbooks or children's books that \nhave been in our families for generations.\n  At Holzer Book Bindery in Hinesburg, VT, Marianna Holzer, a third-\ngeneration bookbinder, is doing just that. Her shop is lined with \nleather bound books, many restored by her own hand, and hand operated \ncast-iron presses that help her with her handcraft. Her clients range \nfrom towns and municipalities, to personal collectors, and extend far \nbeyond the mountains of Vermont.\n  In 1960, her father, 30 years her mother's senior, closed down his \nown bindery business in Boston to settle in Putney. Marianna was in \nhigh school when, years after her father passed away, her mother set up \ntheir own bindery in the basement. Here, Marianna learned the basics of \nbindery from her mother, using the storied tools of her father. After \nstudying plant and soil science at the University of Vermont, Marianna \nfound herself working at Four Seasons Garden Center in Williston before \nlonging for something new. She ultimately returned to her bookbinding \nroots, joining a small bindery in Jericho before opening her own shop \nin 2008.\n  Marianna now works alongside her husband and folk musician, Rik \nPalieri, who assists her. Today, her challenges are even greater, as \nshe battles multiple sclerosis. People send their books and heirlooms \nfrom around the country, seeking her dexterity and her expertise. For \nMarianna, it is her true love of preserving the past and the sentiment \nit brings others that makes her excel at her craft. She honors her \nfamily legacy by using her grandfather's logo as her own.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article \nabout this exceptional Vermonter who has dedicated her life to bringing \njoy to others by repairing those precious keepsakes we chose to pass on \nto our loved ones: ``At Holzer Book Bindery, Repairing Old Volumes Is a \nLabor of Love.'' [Seven Days, February 19, 2014]\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From Seven Days, Feb. 19, 2014]\n\n    At Holzer Book Bindery, Repairing Old Volumes Is a Labor of Love\n\n                          (By Ethan De Seife)\n\n       Any author who gets a publishing deal these days knows the \n     importance of e-books: Many readers now opt for pixels over \n     ink. At Holzer Book Bindery in Hinesburg, though, the book's \n     the thing. Owner Marianna Holzer, a third-generation \n     bookbinder, appreciates books as objects. Her love for \n     beautiful volumes and the increasingly rare craft of making \n     them by hand is evident in her shop, located on the ground \n     floor of her home. The place is filled with drawers of old \n     metal typesetting letters, rolls of buckram and leather, and \n     hand-operated, cast-iron book presses. Many of the hand tools \n     that Holzer, 58, uses were inherited from her father, Albert, \n     and grandfather, Ulrich, both of whom ran bookbinding shops \n     in Boston. Both men were known not only for the high quality \n     of their work, but for their personal investment in the books \n     they repaired. Said Holzer, ``My mom used to say that people \n     would bring their books to have them bound at the Holzer \n     Bindery, but they'd have to wait until everybody in the \n     family had read the book before they got it back.''\n       As a child, hanging around her father's shop, Holzer picked \n     up many of the finer points of this specialized art. A career \n     shift in the early 1980s brought her to Brown's\n\n[[Page S1043]]\n\n     River Bindery, an operation that started in Jericho, then \n     moved to Essex. Holzer worked her way up to various \n     supervisory positions within the company.\n       When Brown's was reorganized and folded into a larger \n     bindery called Kofile, Holzer decided the time was right to \n     set up her own business. As it happened, her mother had \n     recently moved out of the downstairs apartment in Holzer's \n     home. That freed up the cozy space that, in 2008, Holzer \n     turned into her own bindery. To honor her family's craft \n     legacy, she still uses the logo from her grandfather's shop.\n       Though Holzer can and does create entire bound volumes from \n     scratch, most of her projects are repairs, often on the \n     beloved literary heirlooms of private clients. She can fix \n     torn pages or create new ones for old books, trimming new \n     folios, stitching them into signatures and assembling them \n     into custom bindings.\n       During Seven Days' visit to the bindery, Holzer was \n     performing surgery on some old, careworn, hardback copies of \n     two of L. Frank Baum's Oz novels. The client who'd brought \n     them wanted to resuscitate the books for sentimental reasons, \n     and they needed a great deal of attention. Nearly all of both \n     books' pages were brittle, tattered and detached from their \n     bindings, from which the glue had long since cracked and \n     flaked off. Still, Holzer estimated the job would take her \n     just a couple of days of mending, and only an hour or two to \n     sew the pages back together.\n       Holzer has multiple sclerosis, which can make such detailed \n     work difficult, so she's glad, she said, to have assistance \n     from her husband, folk musician Rik Palieri. In between his \n     concert tours, Palieri helps out on the larger binding \n     orders, including the municipal records of a number of \n     Vermont towns. (Holzer is reluctant to say which ones.)\n       Palieri professed admiration for the kind of beautiful, \n     hand-bound books that Holzer Bindery produces. The couple has \n     preserved and bound their own cherished keepsakes, such as an \n     original program from one of Buffalo Bill's Wild West shows. \n     Palieri's own daily journal is a huge, green, handcrafted \n     volume that would look right at home on the shelves of a city \n     planning office.\n       Repair jobs come into the bindery in what Holzer described \n     as a ``steady but not overwhelming supply.'' Every one is \n     different, and, she said, without first inspecting the book, \n     it's difficult to estimate the cost of the repairs. Prices \n     per piece range from about $100 to more than $1,000.\n       ``It will depend on what needs to be done, what the \n     customer wants, if we are trying to save all the original \n     material or make a new cover, and then that will depend on \n     whether it is in leather or imitation leather,'' Holzer \n     explained.\n       Demonstrating her craft to a visitor, Holzer smiled and \n     laughed frequently. She took particular delight in the gold \n     stamper, with which she embosses books' spines and covers \n     with shiny letters and designs. With this device, Holzer can \n     also turn strips of scrap leather into personalized \n     bookmarks, mementos that she gives visitors to the bindery.\n       Holzer's shop--along with the handful of other small \n     bookbinders scattered around the state--embodies the spirit \n     of quality artisanship associated with Vermont. Case in \n     point: Holzer mentioned a client from Houston, Texas, for \n     whom she bound a memorial Bible. Its owner had found Holzer \n     Bindery online and chosen the company specifically because of \n     its Vermont location, she said; to him, this guaranteed \n     careful craft.\n       Over cups of tea served beneath the cuckoo clock in her \n     kitchen, Holzer talked with Seven Days about the fine art of \n     fine books.\n       SEVEN DAYS: How did you get started in the bookbinding \n     business?\n       MARIANNA HOLZER: My father was 70 when I was born--30 years \n     older than my mother. I was pretty young when [his bindery] \n     was still going in Boston. He closed the business in 1960, \n     when he was 80, and moved to southern Vermont, to Putney. He \n     passed away when I was 11, and my mom set up a little bindery \n     later, when I was in high school, in the basement of our \n     house. She taught me a few basic things.\n       I went to UVM, [where I] studied plant and soil science. I \n     got a job at Four Seasons Garden Center [in Williston]. I \n     kind of got sick of that, and found out that there was this \n     small bindery [Brown's River Bindery] in Jericho, and went to \n     see them. That's how it began.\n       SD: What are all these tools used for?\n       MH: The board shears are basically a huge paper cutter; the \n     guillotine, which needs to be super-sharp, is for trimming \n     the edges of a book's pages. I use a lot of mending tissue, \n     which is a Japanese tissue used to fix rips and tears. The \n     rounding or backing hammer--one of my father's tools--I use \n     for rounding a book's spine. One of my favorite things to do \n     is the gold stamping, which presses down on a thin piece of \n     Mylar covered with 22-carat gold. That's how you decorate a \n     binding, letter by letter.\n       SD: What services do you offer?\n       MH: One thing I do here is deacidify paper. Anything before \n     the mid-1800s was printed on rag paper, which holds up quite \n     well. Newer paper is made with wood pulp, and we didn't know \n     until more recently how acidic it was. It gets really brittle \n     and cracks when you turn the pages. So we can deacidify the \n     paper, and it'll stop the progression of [the decay]--though \n     it won't bring it back [to its original condition].\n       SD: Bookbinding is such a niche field. What challenges does \n     your business face?\n       MH: It seems to me, in some ways, books are becoming more \n     precious as people realize they have certain books that they \n     want to preserve and pass on. Bibles are one thing. It's \n     cheaper to buy a new one, but [the owner has] written all \n     over it. Children's books--people have grown up with a book. \n     And cookbooks! People have written in them, or they have \n     their mother's cookbook. The newer versions they don't like \n     as much.\n       These days, newer bindings are single sheets that are just \n     glued in. When you open them up, they sometimes crack and \n     fall apart. And those are kind of hard to fix, because they \n     don't have enough of the margin that's necessary to drill the \n     holes for stitching. Older books tend to be in better shape.\n       SD: How does having MS affect your work as a binder?\n       MH: I just get really tired sometimes. It's almost like I'm \n     walking through mud or something. It's a big effort to do \n     things. It's also dexterity, fine motor control.\n       SD: Are you concerned about the new all-in-one machines \n     that can print a book from a digital file and then bind it?\n       MH: Not particularly. You see a book, and you never think \n     what goes into making it. They [bind books] by machine \n     nowadays. But if you want to repair a book, you can't do it \n     by machine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/25/senate-section/article/S1043-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1043]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO REVEREND LEONARD ROBINSON\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I wish to speak about one of Wyoming's \ngreatest World War II heroes, the Rev. Leonard Robinson. Leonard is a \nspecial man whose sacrifice speaks louder than his words.\n  In 1942, less than 1 year after shipping out from Fort Bliss, TX, \nRobinson found himself among 75,000 American and Filipino soldiers and \ncivilians surrendered to the Imperial Japanese Army. He was one of the \nfortunate to survive the barbaric 65 mile, 5-day Bataan Death March. \nThose who were unable to keep up with the march were either beaten or \nshot by Japanese soldiers.\n  Robinson was held as a prisoner of war for almost 3\\1/2\\ years. He \nsurvived the Bataan Death March, disease, malnutrition, slave labor and \ntorture through his faith in God. Both spiritually and physically, \nReverend Robinson credits the Bible with saving his life during his \ntime as a prisoner of war. It is through his faith that he persevered \nthrough one of the greatest atrocities committed against our soldiers.\n  As a prisoner of war, Leonard would often recite Psalm 23 to get him \nthrough his struggle. Rev. Leonard Robinson's life has been a journey \nof war, suffering, hope and peace. Leonard embraced faith in his \ndarkest hours, showed a commitment to duty when all else was lost, and \nheld dear to the memory of his brothers in arms who did not return. In \nhis battered billfold, Leonard kept a roster of his unit and the names \nof the fallen soldiers. He is a living testament to the often \noverlooked sacrifices that make our men and women in uniform America's \ngreatest treasure.\n  Today, Reverend Robinson is being honored at the Casper Area Chamber \nof Commerce ``Hiring a Hero'' luncheon. The event's goal is to promote \nveteran employment through recognizing our service men and women who \nhave triumphed over adversity with a proven ability to overcome \nchallenges and obstacles through strength and determination. I do not \nknow of a better example than my friend and my surgical patient Rev. \nLeonard Robinson. He epitomizes the service and sacrifice of our men \nand women in uniform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/25/senate-section/article/S1043-2", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1043-S1044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   STRENGTHENING SOCIAL SECURITY ACT\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have spoken on the floor of this body on \na number of occasions about the impending retirement crisis facing this \ncountry. I know from my constituents that the dream of a secure \nretirement is growing fainter and fainter. In fact, the retirement \nincome deficit--meaning, difference between what people have saved for \nretirement and what they should have at this point--is a staggering \n$6.6 trillion and growing. Today, half of Americans have less than \n$10,000 in savings, and only 14 percent are ``very confident'' they \nwill have enough money for a comfortable retirement.\n  I am deeply concerned by these statistics. That is why, in 2013, I \nintroduced legislation to tackle this challenge head on. My \nlegislation, S. 567 the Strengthening Social Security Act\n\n[[Page S1044]]\n\nof 2013, would improve the most efficient, most effective retirement \nprogram we have--Social Security--in three ways. First, it would \nincrease benefits by about $65 per month for all beneficiaries. Second, \nit would ensure that annual cost of living adjustments more accurately \nreflect the cost of living experienced by seniors by adopting the CPI-\nE. And, finally, it would remove the wage cap so that the payroll tax \napplies fairly to every dollar of wages. According to the Social \nSecurity actuaries, my proposal would increase benefits for current and \nfuture beneficiaries while also extending the life of the Social \nSecurity Trust Fund through 2049.\n  Recently, an organization that I have worked closely with for many \nyears, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, \nlaunched a campaign in support of a proposal that would boost Social \nSecurity benefits, including my legislation. I deeply appreciate the \nsupport of the national committee, and commend them for their work to \nstrengthen and expand Social Security. I look forward to continuing to \nwork with them, and other supportive organizations, to confront our \nNation's retirement crisis. Strengthening and expanding Social Security \nis the crucial first step.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/25/senate-section/article/S1044-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FREEDOM OF THE PRESS IN CHINA\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, today I would like to draw attention to \na disturbing trend impacting the work of journalists in China.\n  On January 30, 2014, New York Times reporter Austin Ramzy was forced \nto leave China due to processing delays for his press credentials. \nUnfortunately, this is not an isolated event. In 2013, Reporters \nWithout Borders ranked China 173rd out of 179 countries in terms of \npress freedoms. Over the past year, we have seen China increase efforts \nto curb the work of foreign news organizations, including extended \ndelays in processing journalist visas, restrictions on access to \n``sensitive'' locations and individuals, pressure on local staff, \nblocked Web sites, and reports of cyber hacking of media organizations.\n  To call attention to this suppression, I, as chairman of the Senate \nForeign Relations Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs, along \nwith subcommittee ranking member Marco Rubio, Senate Foreign Relations \nchairman Bob Menendez, and ranking member Bob Corker, introduced S. \nRes. 361. This resolution urges the People's Republic of China to take \nmeaningful steps to improve freedom of expression in China as fitting \nof a responsible international stakeholder.\n  The ongoing crackdown on journalists and members of the press \nreporting in China is of grave concern to me. A country that engages in \nroutine censorship and online blocking; harassment, reprisals, and \ndetention of journalists; and visa delays or denials for journalists \nnot only fails its own people but also fails the international \ncommunity. A vibrant and free press instills trust in one's government, \ncreates a more transparent environment for business investments, \ndevelops an engaged community, and builds legitimacy as a secure, \nglobal leader. We expect our partners to strive for these standards.\n  As we look to rebalance our policy toward the Asia-Pacific region, \nthe United States has a responsibility to promote respect for universal \nhuman rights. We urge President Obama to use all appropriate tools to \nimprove and promote freedom of the press in China.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues for joining me in support of \npress freedom in China.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/25/senate-section/article/S1044-2", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR. MOHAMMAD YOUSAF\n\n Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I wish to recognize one of West \nVirginia's finest cardiologists, Dr. Mohammad Yousaf, on receiving the \n2013 Heart of Gold Award, which was presented by the West Virginia \nAmerican Heart Association on February 23, 2013. There is truly no one \nmore qualified, more compassionate or more devoted than Dr. Yousaf, who \nhas been practicing in West Virginia for more than 20 years.\n  A native of Pakistan, Dr. Yousaf made his way to West Virginia to \ncomplete his residency at Marshall University. During his fellowship, \nhe was assigned rotations in our beautiful State's capital, Charleston. \nThankfully, he never left and his unwavering commitment to the \ncardiology field at South Charleston Cardiology, where he continues to \npractice today, has consistently saved West Virginian lives across our \nState.\n  With the help of Dr. Yousaf's momentous contributions and medical \nexpertise, the quality of West Virginia's medical community has \nstrengthened throughout the years and the health and well-being of the \npeople of West Virginia continue to improve.\n  There are a myriad of doctors across this Nation that diagnose and \ntreat patients every day. However, what distinguishes a good doctor \nfrom a great doctor starts and stops with patient care. Dr. Yousaf \nalways puts his patients first and takes the time to build the trust \nand confidence necessary that leads to positive and long-lasting \ndoctor-patient relationships. Long days and sleepless nights never \nobstruct from the compassion and dedication Dr. Yousaf devotes to each \none of his patients.\n  Dr. Yousaf is also no stranger to prestigious awards, including the \nDistinguished West Virginian award, which was created to honor those \nwho have contributed significantly to West Virginia and those who have \nbrought positive attention to our great State. After more than two \ndecades practicing as a cardiologist in the Mountain State, it is \nunquestionable that his integrity and work ethic know no bounds. And \ntoday, I am proud to commemorate the success of such a wonderful person \nand such a talented physician.\n  It is fitting that Dr. Yousaf was presented with the Heart of Gold \nAward last year, for he once described ``the personal satisfaction you \nget'' as a physician who has the means and opportunities to save lives \nevery day. So today, I congratulate a remarkably intelligent and gifted \ncardiologist on receiving such an esteemed honor. I know he will \ncontinue to save lives in the great state of West Virginia for years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/25/senate-section/article/S1044-3", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1044-S1045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING MICHAEL A. STEPOVICH\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I wish to give tribute to \nAlaska's last Territorial Governor, Michael A. Stepovich, who \nunfortunately died early on Valentine's Day, Feb. 14, at the age of 94.\n  Mr. Stepovich was a war veteran, a legislator, a local government \nleader, the first Governor of the Territory born in Alaska and the last \nprior to statehood in 1957 and 1958, a lawyer, a civic leader, \nbusinessman and a true statesman. He also was a good man, and great \nfriend to my entire family. When my family moved to Fairbanks, AK in \nthe early 1970s, Mike and his wife Mathilda and their children were our \nearliest and closest friends. The Stepovics raised a large and loving \nfamily, and while most Alaskans will remember Mike as an Alaskan \nstatesman, I will always think of him first as a true family man.\n  Michael was born in Fairbanks on March 12, 1919, the son of Michael \nA. and Olga S. Stepovich. He graduated in 1940 from Gonzaga \nUniversity--which in 1966 honored him with the DeSmet medal for being \nan ``outstanding graduate and layman.'' He earned a law degree from \nNotre Dame in 1943, and after service in the Navy, he completed \npostgraduate work at Santa Clara College in 1946.\n  Stepovich opened a private law practice in Fairbanks in 1948, serving \nas the city attorney of Fairbanks from 1950 to 1952, as a delegate to \nthe Territorial House of Representatives from 1951-1953 and in the \nTerritorial Senate from 1953-1957. While in the Senate he served as \nminority leader and was a strong supporter of statehood. He worked \ntirelessly on the 1956 referendum for statehood. President Dwight \nEisenhower appointed Stepovich to be Territorial Governor after \nAlaskans went to the ballot box in support of joining the Union. He was \nto be Alaska's last Territorial Governor--within a year Congress would \napprove Alaska as the 49th State.\n\n[[Page S1045]]\n\n  After statehood, Governor Stepovich turned his attention to \nrepresenting Alaska in the U.S. Senate. He lost his bid in 1958 to be \none of Alaska's first Senators to Ernest Gruening, who had served in \nWashington as one of Alaska's fir two ``shadow'' Senators since 1956. \nStepovich later ran and lost races to be Governor, first against \nWilliam A. Egan and later against Walter Hickel. But his defeats did \nnot diminish his interest in or dedication to Alaska. And he remained \nespecially committed to Fairbanks and the rest of the Interior region.\n  From chairing the Fairbanks Planning and Zoning Committee in 1952 and \n1953, through the 1980s, Mike Stepovich was always ready to serve to \nbetter Alaska. He was active in the Pioneers of Alaska, the Elks, \nEagles, American Legion and the Tanana Valley Bar Association. And that \nwas not always easy given that he was a devoted family man to his wife \nMatilda and 13 children: Antonia, Maria Theresa, Michael, Peter, \nChristopher, Dominic, Theodore John, Nicholas Vincent, James, Laura, \nNada, Andrea and Melissa. All 13 of the Stepovich children were able to \nbe together with Mike before he passed.\n  While I could tell many stories about Mike, let me just say to my \nfellow Senators that Mike Stepovich was a man who would have given the \nshirt off his back to help a neighbor in need. He was one of the most \nhonorable, decent, and wise men I have had the distinct honor to know \nin my life. I can only offer my sincere condolences to his family upon \nhis death, just a month shy of his 95th birthday.\n  Alaska is a much better place because of Mike Stepovich. Those of us \nwho were lucky enough to know him understand how great a loss this is \nfor Alaska. We will always remember his efforts that helped make \nAlaska, and his hometown of Fairbanks, what it is today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/25/senate-section/article/S1045-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1045-S1046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               REMEMBERING ELIZABETH AND ROY PERATROVICH\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I wish to honor Elizabeth \nPeratrovich, her husband Roy Peratrovich, and their relentless pursuit \nof equal civil rights in the territory of Alaska. Elizabeth and Roy \nlived and worked long before Alaska became a State and still longer \nbefore the United States passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. February \n16, 2014 marked the 25th year Alaskans celebrated Elizabeth and the \npassage of the Alaska Anti-Discrimination Act of 1945. I would like to \ntake a moment today, to once again, share the Peratroviches' story and \nreflect on the legacy of their work.\n  Elizabeth, a member of the Lukaaxadi clan, in the Raven moiety of the \nTlingit tribe, was born on Independence Day in Petersburg, AK in 1911. \nOne year later, Alaska gained a territorial legislature in Juneau made \nup of 8 senators and 16 representatives, none of whom were Alaska \nNative. In the same year a group of Alaska Natives from Southeast \nformed the Alaska Native Brotherhood to advocate for a right to U.S. \ncitizenship for Alaska Natives. In 1915, Alaska Native women came \ntogether and established the Alaska Native Sisterhood to work alongside \nthe brotherhood. Although Elizabeth was very young for the creation of \nthese bodies, each came to play a great role in her fight for equal \nrights.\n  Many Americans are familiar with the history of discrimination and \npresence of Jim Crow laws at this time in the South. Probably fewer \nAmericans are familiar with the existence of similar discrimination \ntowards Alaska Natives. In Juneau, Alaskan Natives were restricted to \npurchasing homes in only certain parts of town and their children \nrestricted to segregated Indian schools. Local business displayed signs \nin their store fronts reading, ``No Natives Allowed,'' ``We cater to \nwhite trade only,'' or ``No Dogs, No Natives'' and restaurant signs \nread, ``Meals at all hours--All white help.'' The U.S. Congress granted \ncitizenship to Native Americans in 1924, yet signs like these and the \ndiscrimination they perpetrated endured.\n  Elizabeth grew up and attended school in Petersburg, Sitka and \nKetchikan. After graduating she continued her education at the Western \nCollege of Education in Bellingham, WA. In 1931, Elizabeth married Roy \nPeratrovich, a fellow Western College student and Tlingit from Klawock, \nAK. In 1940, Roy was elected to be the Alaska Native Brotherhood's camp \npresident and the following year Elizabeth was elected grand president \nof the Alaska Native Sisterhood.\n  Together, with their young family, the Peratroviches moved to Juneau, \nonly to experience discrimination against Alaska Natives first-hand. \nElizabeth and Roy picked out a home together and tried to purchase it, \nbut once the owners realized that the Peratroviches were Alaska Native, \nthey would not sell. Their children felt unwelcome at school. Their \nclose family friend, Henrietta Newton, who was not Alaska Native \nherself but married an Alaska Native man, was told by a local beauty \nparlor, ``I'm sorry we don't cater to Indian trade.'' When an Alaska \nNative child had an altercation with the law, their local newspaper \npublished it as front page news. Discrimination towards Alaska Natives \nremained prevalent. On December 30, 1941, in their capacities as \npresident and grand president of the Alaska Native Brother and \nSisterhoods, Roy and Elizabeth wrote a letter to Ernest Gruening, then \nGovernor of the Territory of Alaska. The letter drew attention to the \ndiscrepancy between Alaska Natives paying taxes for a public school \nsystem from which their children were excluded and also between Alaska \nNative men fighting in World War II, who upon return were denied rights \nthat other locals enjoyed. Thus began their public pursuit of equal \nrights for all people in Alaska.\n  Elizabeth began to call upon her friends and family to involve \nthemselves in the anti-discrimination movement. She recruited women to \nmeet with a Senator from Nome in order to express to him what it felt \nlike to be discriminated against, left out of the United Service \nOrganization, and forced to read signs in local businesses barring them \nfrom entry. Elizabeth and Roy met with Governor Gruening to strategize \ntheir movement, and then traveled around Native communities bringing \nwith them sample anti-discrimination legislation from the lower 48. In \n1943, State Senator Norman Walker introduced an act that would provide \nfull and equal accommodations to all people within the Territory of \nAlaska. The vote was defeated, but the Peratroviches were not.\n  In 1945, the antidiscrimination bill was reintroduced. It passed the \nhouse and moved to the senate. The gallery was full, the doors were \nopen and spectators filled the halls outside. Once on the senate floor, \nthe debate began. As senators stood to speak, Elizabeth, along with \nmany other community members listened. They listened as one Senator \nrose to say:\n\n       Far from being brought closer together, which will result \n     from this bill, the races should be kept further apart. Who \n     are these people, barely out of savagery, who want to \n     associate with us whites with 5,000 years of recorded \n     civilization behind us?\n\n  Elizabeth looked on as another senator claimed, ``Mixed breeds are \nthe source of trouble, it is they only who wish to associate with the \nwhites,'' and as a church leader declared that it would take at least \n30 years before Alaska Natives were equal to white men, Roy rose to \nspeak on behalf of the bill noting that Governor Gruening recognized \ndiscrimination in Alaska. He addressed the legislature with these \nwords, ``Either you are for discrimination or you are against it \naccordingly as you vote on this bill.''\n  Once debate on the bill concluded, the public was given a chance to \nexpress their views in front of the legislature and a crowd gathered \nthat day. Given this chance, Elizabeth took it. Once on the senate \nfloor, Elizabeth sat next to the president of the senate, where she \naddressed the predominantly white and all-male body of legislators. ``I \nwould not have expected that I, who am barely out of savagery, would \nhave to remind gentlemen with five thousand years of recorded \ncivilization behind them of our Bill of Rights.''\n  When asked if she thought the bill would eliminate discrimination, \nElizabeth replied:\n\n       Do your laws against larceny and even murder prevent those \n     crimes? No law will eliminate crimes but at least you as \n     legislators can assert to the world that you recognize the \n     evil of the present situation and speak your intent to help \n     us overcome discrimination.\n\n\n[[Page S1046]]\n\n\n  As Elizabeth finished speaking, the gallery broke out in applause. \nThe senate voted and passed the anti-discrimination bill by a vote of \n11 to 5. On February 16, 1945, Elizabeth earned her spot as our fighter \nwith velvet gloves, and as she's respectfully remembered in our State, \nAlaska's Martin Luther King.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/25/senate-section/article/S1046-1", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING AMY S. PERKINS\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I wish to celebrate the life and \nlegacy of a great New Hampshire public servant--State representative \nAmy S. Perkins of Seabrook.\n  I was deeply saddened to learn of Amy's passing earlier this week. At \nage 43, she was taken from us far too soon. My heart is broken for her \nfamily and friends, as well as her constituents in Seabrook.\n  Amy represented the very best of New Hampshire's ``citizen \nlegislature.'' She and her husband Koko, also a State representative, \nrepresented Seabrook together at the State House while also giving back \nto their beloved community in so many other ways.\n  Amy was active in her church in Seabrook and was a member of the \nRaymond E. Walton American Legion Post 70 Women's Auxiliary. Koko, who \ncontinues to serve in the legislature, is the deputy chief at the \nSeabrook Fire Department. As a husband and wife team, they committed \nthemselves to giving back to others--embodying New Hampshire's \ndistinctive spirit of community.\n  In addition to her public duties, Amy was also a devoted mother who \nleaves behind two children--her son Daumanic Fucile and her daughter \nKatelyn Perkins. She was also a daughter and a sister--and I extend my \ndeepest sympathy to the family members who are mourning her loss.\n  Amy was a leader who refused to sit on the sidelines. She is someone \nwho cared deeply about her town and her State, and she selflessly \nstepped up to serve. Amy leaves behind a legacy of service that I know \nher husband Koko will carry on--and her children will always be able to \nlook to the example she set as a model of how to give back to others.\n  Amy Perkins will be deeply missed by those whose lives she touched. \nHer family and many friends will remain in my thoughts and \nprayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/25/senate-section/article/S1046-2", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING CAMILLE BECKMAN\n\n Mr. RISCH. Madam President, countless American businesses find \ntheir start in the living rooms, backyards, and garages of aspiring \nentrepreneurs. Harnessing individual creativity and work ethic, a hobby \ncan grow into a lasting enterprise. Today I wish to recognize and \ncommend the Camille Beckman corporation, a company from my home State \nof Idaho whose hard work and dedication to quality has seen growth and \nprosperity in a unique and thriving market.\n  Susan Beckman Roghani learned the value of homemade goods from her \nmother, who sold soaps, creams, and original art at local events. In \n1986, Susan built on the work of her mother and founded the Camille \nBeckman cosmetics brand in Boise, ID, which uses wholesome ingredients \nand natural herbs to produce high-quality creams and lotions. From \nproduction and ingredients to design and marketing, every aspect of the \nCamille Beckman brand is produced from American-made materials and the \ncompany consistently exceeds the Federal Trade Commission's Made in the \nUSA standard.\n  After relocating in 2001 to a larger facility in Eagle, ID, Camille \nBeckman continued to grow and expand. Today, Camille Beckman's \nhandcrafted luxury body products are sold in over 10,000 locations \nacross the country, along with many retailers globally. Their factory \nheadquarters prides itself on being an energy-efficient, state-of-the-\nart, architecturally beautiful 105,000 square foot facility that, \nthrough their ``reduce and recycle'' production policies, consumes only \naround 30 percent of energy used by similarly sized facilities.\n  The company's positive and energetic culture has contributed \ntremendously to Camille Beckman's continued success. Thanks to an \nongoing commitment to its workers, Camille Beckman has many employees \nthat have been with the company since its formative years. In 1995, the \nCamille Beckman Foundation was formed as a way to help charities at the \nlocal, national, and international levels. From food banks to \norphanages to medical care, the foundation gives money to dozens of \ncharities in Idaho and across the world.\n  I congratulate Camille Beckman on their success, continued growth, \nand exemplary reputation for quality. Camille Beckman represents the \nbest aspects of American craftsmanship and is a credit to both Idaho \nand the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/25/senate-section/article/S1046-3", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO \n CUBA AND OF THE EMERGENCY AUTHORITY RELATING TO THE REGULATION OF THE \n                ANCHORAGE AND MOVEMENT OF VESSELS--PM 30\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nwithin 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the \nPresident publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date.

Con. Res. 32\n\n       Whereas the Government of Syria is reported to have engaged \n     in widespread torture, rape, and massacre of civilians, \n     including by means of chemical weapons, most recently on or \n     about August 21, 2013;\n       Whereas other groups involved in civil war in Syria, \n     including the al-Nusra Front, are reported to have engaged in \n     torture, rape, summary execution of government soldiers, \n     kidnapping for ransom, and violence against civilians, \n     including Christians and others who are not Sunni Muslims;\n       Whereas these and other actions perpetrated by the \n     Government of Syria and other groups involved in civil war in \n     Syria may constitute war crimes, crimes against humanity, and \n     genocide;\n       Whereas Syria is not a state-party to the Rome Statute of \n     the International Criminal Court, done at Rome July 17, 1998, \n     and is not a member of the International Criminal Court;\n       Whereas the international community has previously \n     established ad hoc tribunals through the United Nations to \n     bring justice in specific countries where there have been war \n     crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide;\n       Whereas ad hoc tribunals, including the International \n     Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, the \n     International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, and the Special \n     Court for Sierra Leone, have successfully investigated and \n     prosecuted war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, \n     and there are many positive lessons to be learned from these \n     three ad hoc tribunals; and\n       Whereas any lasting, peaceful solution to civil war in \n     Syria must be based upon justice for all, including members \n     of all factions, political parties, ethnicities, and \n     religions: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring),\n\n     SECTION 1.

SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States Government should urge the Government \n     of Syria and other groups involved in civil war in Syria to \n     implement an immediate cease fire and engage in negotiations \n     to end the bloodshed;\n       (2) the United States Government should publicly declare \n     that it is a requirement of basic justice that war crimes, \n     crimes against humanity, and genocide, whether committed by \n     officials of the Government of Syria, or members of other \n     groups involved in civil war in Syria, should be investigated \n     and prosecuted;\n       (3) the President should direct the United States Permanent \n     Representative to the United Nations to use the voice and \n     vote of the United States to immediately promote the \n     establishment of a Syrian war crimes tribunal, an ad hoc \n     court to prosecute the perpetrators of such serious crimes \n     committed during the civil war in Syria;\n       (4) in working with other countries to establish a Syrian \n     war crimes tribunal, the United States Government should \n     promote judicial procedures that enable the prosecution of \n     the most culpable persons guilty of directing such serious \n     crimes;\n       (5) the United States Government should make an immediate \n     priority the collection of information that can be supplied \n     to a Syrian war crimes tribunal for use as evidence to \n     support the indictment and trial of any person involved in \n     civil war in Syria and responsible for war crimes, crimes \n     against humanity, or genocide in Syria; and\n       (6) the United States Government should urge other \n     interested states to apprehend and deliver into the custody \n     of a Syrian war crimes tribunal persons indicted for war \n     crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide in Syria and \n     urge such states to provide information pertaining to such \n     crimes to the tribunal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/02/25/senate-section/article/S1050-2", "month": "02", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1050]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2744.

and\n       (ii) the current or intended residence of such member or \n     former member (including an option for members or former \n     members who are willing to reside in various locations).\n       (B) A means of permitting qualified prospective employers \n     to post employment openings and seek contact with members or \n     former members based on their profile for the purposes of \n     requesting the initiation of arrangements or negotiations \n     concerning potential employment.\n       (C) A means of presenting other employment resources, \n     including resume preparation, to members or former members \n     seeking employment.\n       (2) Matters considered.--In developing the consolidated \n     Internet portal, the Secretaries referred to in subsection \n     (b) should consider, at a minimum, the following:\n       (A) Public and private sector resources on matters relating \n     to the portal.\n       (B) Opportunities to incorporate local employment networks \n     into the portal.\n       (C) Methodologies to determine the most effective \n     employment resources and programs to be incorporated into the \n     portal.\n       (D) Means for streamlining processes through the portal for \n     employers to find and employ former members of the Armed \n     Forces.\n       (d) Member Participation.--\n       (1) In general.--Participation in the consolidated Internet \n     portal under subsection (b) shall be limited to members of \n     the National Guard and Reserves, members of the Armed Forces \n     on active duty who are transitioning from military service to \n     civilian life, former members of the Armed Forces, and \n     veterans.\n       (2) Voluntary.--Participation by a member or former member \n     of the Armed Forces described in paragraph (1) in the \n     consolidated Internet portal shall be voluntary. A member or \n     former member participating in the portal may cease \n     participation in the portal at any time.\n       (e) Reports by Implementing Secretaries.--\n       (1) Preliminary report.--Not later than six months after \n     the effective date specified in subsection (h), the \n     Secretaries shall submit to the appropriate committees of \n     Congress a report on the consolidated Internet portal under \n     subsection (b).

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON NUCLEAR WEAPON CAPABILITIES OF \n                   IRAN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Government of Iran continues to expand the nuclear \n     and missile programs of Iran in violation of multiple United \n     Nations Security Council resolutions.\n       (2) The Government of Iran has a decades-long track record \n     of violating commitments regarding the nuclear program of \n     Iran and has used diplomatic negotiations as a subterfuge to \n     advance its nuclear weapons program.\n       (3) Iran remains the world's foremost state sponsor of \n     terrorism, having directed, supported, and financed acts of \n     terrorism against the United States and its allies that have \n     resulted in the thousands of deaths, including the deaths of \n     United States citizens and members of the Armed Forces of the \n     United States.\n       (4) The Government of Iran and its terrorist proxies, \n     particularly Lebanese\n\n[[Page S1127]]\n\n     Hezbollah, continue to provide military and financial support \n     to the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, aiding that regime \n     in the mass killing of the people of Syria.\n       (5) The Government of Iran continues to sow instability in \n     the Middle East and threaten its neighbors, including allies \n     of the United States, such as Israel.\n       (6) The Government of Iran denies its people fundamental \n     freedoms, including freedom of the press, freedom of \n     assembly, freedom of religion, and freedom of conscience.\n       (7) Strict sanctions on Iran, imposed by the United States \n     and the international community, are responsible for bringing \n     Iran to the negotiating table.\n       (8) President Hassan Rouhani of Iran has in the past \n     admitted to using diplomatic negotiations to buy time for \n     Iran to make nuclear advances.\n       (9) Based on Iran's current stockpile of uranium enriched \n     to 3.5 percent and 20 percent and its current centrifuge \n     capacity, Iran could produce a sufficient quantity of \n     weapons-grade uranium for a bomb in one to 2 months' time.\n       (10) If the Government of Iran commences the operation of \n     its heavy water reactor in Arak, it could establish an \n     alternate pathway to a nuclear weapon through the production \n     of plutonium.\n       (11) As of the date of the enactment of this Act, 19 \n     countries access nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without \n     conducting any enrichment or reprocessing activities within \n     those countries.\n       (12) The Government of Iran could likewise access nuclear \n     energy for peaceful purposes without conducting any \n     enrichment or reprocessing activities within Iran.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Government of Iran must not be allowed to develop \n     or maintain nuclear weapon capabilities;\n       (2) all instruments of power and influence of the United \n     States should remain on the table to prevent the Government \n     of Iran from developing nuclear weapon capabilities;\n       (3) the Government of Iran does not have an absolute or \n     inherent right to enrichment and reprocessing capabilities \n     and technologies under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \n     Nuclear Weapons, done at Washington, London, and Moscow July \n     1, 1968, and entered into force March 5, 1970 (commonly known \n     as the ``Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty'');\n       (4) the imposition of sanctions under this title, including \n     sanctions on exports of petroleum from Iran, is triggered by \n     violations by Iran of any interim or final agreement \n     regarding its nuclear program, failure to reach a final \n     agreement in a discernible time frame, or the breach of other \n     conditions described in section 931;\n       (5) if the Government of Israel is compelled to take \n     military action in legitimate self-defense against Iran's \n     nuclear weapon program, the United States Government should \n     stand with Israel and provide, in accordance with the law of \n     the United States and the constitutional responsibility of \n     Congress to authorize the use of military force, diplomatic, \n     military, and economic support to the Government of Israel in \n     its defense of its territory, people, and existence;\n       (6) the United States should continue to impose sanctions \n     on the Government of Iran and its terrorist proxies for their \n     continuing sponsorship of terrorism; and\n       (7) the United States should continue to impose sanctions \n     on the Government of Iran for--\n       (A) its ongoing abuses of human rights; and\n       (B) its actions in support of Bashar al-Assad in Syria.\n\n           Subtitle A--Expansion and Imposition of Sanctions\n\n     SEC. 911.
