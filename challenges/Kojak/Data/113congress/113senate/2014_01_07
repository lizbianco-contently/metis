Over the last 45 months America's private sector has done \nOK--not great but done pretty well. Eight million jobs have been \ncreated. The stock market is booming and even the housing market is \nstarting to show signs of life.\n  A number of States were hit so hard with the decline of the housing \nmarket. Nevada was hit the hardest, and California, Florida, Michigan--\na number of States--were hit very hard. But even in those States the \nhousing market is turning around a little bit--not enough but turning \naround. It is clear that the economy is picking up steam--not enough \nsteam but picking up steam.\n  But for far too many Americans these bright headlines that I have \njust announced touting good economic news don't match the darker \nreality of their lives. They sit at the kitchen table--if they are \nlucky to have a kitchen table--and they are juggling their bills.\n  It was brought to my attention on the way to work this morning about \nhow hard it is for so many people. On Constitution Avenue, as we were \nwaiting for a light, I could see off to the left a news camera and a \nreporter trying to wake up somebody who had been spending the night on \nthe pavement--not on the grates where the heat comes up. They kept \npushing and pushing. I could see they were talking to him. He or she \ndidn't come out of that bundle of material on that sidewalk.\n  I don't know if this man is one of the long-term unemployed. I don't \nknow. But there are lots of people who are in desperate shape. They may \nnot be sleeping on a sidewalk on Constitution Avenue 14 blocks from the \nWhite House, but there are people in America who are desperate for \nhelp.\n  There are 1.3 million people who have already lost their unemployment \ninsurance benefits. This is not good for the country. We are told by \neconomists that for every $1 we spend on unemployment benefits it gets \n$1.50 back to us just like that. So we have to start understanding that \nwe have a country where not everyone is benefiting from what is going \non with these headlines I just reported.\n  Over the last 30 years the income and wealth of the top 1 percent has \nincreased 300 percent. The middle class dropped almost 10 percent. \nThink about it, 300 percent; the middle class about a 10-percent drop.\n  I haven't even mentioned the poor. They have been hit harder than \nanyone else. When I say this, it is true. The rich are getting a lot \nricher and the poor are getting poorer. The middle class is being \nsqueezed.\n  I have nothing against people of wealth. It is great we live in a \ncountry where people can make a lot of money, but we have to understand \nthere are people who are really hurting. For those who have lost their \njobs through no fault of their own--and millions of them have struggled \nfor months to find new work--a booming stock market of increasing \ncorporate profits is of little comfort to them.\n\n[[Page S36]]\n\n  Fortunately, Americans looking for work have been able to rely on \nunemployment insurance to get them through the tough times. But for 1.3 \nmillion people, no deal; 20,000 are veterans returning from wars in \nAfghanistan and Iraq.\n  At the end of last year, only a few days ago, Congress failed to \nextend unemployment emergency insurance for Americans who have been \nlooking for work for more than 6 months. We have never in the history \nof our country had long-term unemployment such as today--never in the \nhistory of our Republic. Yet we are turning 1.3 million people away. \nAre they going to be the next ones sleeping on some street--wherever \nthey come from--trying to stay warm?\n  For many Americans these benefits make the difference between being \nable to live a decent life--not a good life, a decent life--and going \nhungry or becoming homeless.\n  Let us go back to 2012. In 2012 unemployment insurance helped 2.5 \nmillion people, including 600,000 children, from going into the rolls \nof poverty. We don't have all the results from last year. These \nfamilies live in red States, blue States, Republicans, Democrats, or \nIndependents. We shouldn't turn our backs on them.\n  In the past, we have worked together. Did we complain when President \nBush came to us? Unemployment was nowhere near where it is now. There \nwere enough long-term unemployed, and we automatically together \nextended those benefits. Not today. We are not doing it because we \ncan't get the Republicans to help us. We have reached out the hand to \nhardworking Americans struggling to get by.\n  I would hope we can get a few Republicans to join Dean Heller of \nNevada, a conservative Senator. Join with Dean Heller, a junior Senator \nfrom Nevada, and help get this legislation passed.\n  In the latest round of emergency assistance, George Bush was the \nperson who signed that bill. At the time the unemployment rate was \nabout 5.5 percent. Today in Nevada and Rhode Island--the State of \nSenator Jack Reed, who will speak--it is about 9 percent.\n  The long-term unemployment rate today is more than double what it was \nat the time that we let emergency job assistance expire. Senator Heller \nunderstands. I am troubled that most of Senator Heller's Republican \ncolleagues, according to what we are hearing in the press, callously \nturned their backs on the long-term unemployed.\n  I am saddened. I hope that we can get them to move over and help us \nto help these people who need it so very much. Failing to restore \nemergency assistance would not only be a crushing blow to the long-term \nunemployed, it would be a blow to our economy.\n  Americans use their unemployment benefits to buy food and fuel at \nlocal gas stations, to pay their landlords or to purchase for a child a \nwinter coat. That is why for every dollar we spend on unemployment \nbenefits, I repeat, the economy grows by $1.50. This investment in our \nfellow Americans is one of the most effective ways to spark and sustain \nan economic recovery.\n  Last night the senior Senator from Texas, a Republican, asked that we \ndelay this vote until today. I was pleased to do that. He called this a \nserious issue, and he is very correct. The senior Senator from Texas is \ncorrect. This is a serious issue. It is as serious to people outside \nNevada as it is to those people from Nevada who have been out of work \nfor so long. People from Nevada have written and called my office, \ncalling and begging for a little more time.\n  For every job that is available, there are three that are unemployed \nin America. We Democrats stand united in support of this extension. \nRepublicans need to take this seriously as well as we.\n  I hope Republicans remember that during hard times, that during times \nof high unemployment--regardless of who is in the White House or who \nled this Chamber--Congress is always willing to put politics aside and \nput American families first.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I indicated to the majority leader I \nwas going to ask unanimous consent, which I am prepared to do at this \npoint. I have to admit, I am a little surprised at the fervor with \nwhich the majority is dedicated to reviving the expired emergency \nunemployment benefits after they ignored the issue all of last year. I \nam sure there are many on my side who would like to see these \nadditional weeks of benefits extended if--as the Speaker of the House \nindicated he supported--we could find a way to extend them without \nactually adding to the national debt.\n  To that end I would like to propose that we be allowed--my side be \nallowed--to offer an amendment to pay for these benefits by lifting the \nburden of ObamaCare's individual mandate for 1 year and take care of \nour veterans who were harmed by the recently agreed-to budget deal \nwhile we are in the same amendment, and once that is disposed of we can \nhave an actual debate on this issue and an amendment process in the \nSenate, which hasn't happened very often in recent times.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that if cloture is invoked on the \nmotion to proceed to S. 1845, all postcloture time be yielded back and \nthe Senate proceed to the consideration of the bill and that my \namendment with Senator Hatch be the first amendment in order and that \nthere be up to 1 hour of debate on the amendment divided in the usual \nform; that following the use or yielding back of that time, the Senate \nthen proceed to a vote in relation to that amendment. I further ask \nunanimous consent that following the disposition of that amendment, it \nbe in order for the majority leader or his designee to offer an \namendment and it be in order for the leaders or their designees to \ncontinue to offer amendments in alternating fashion, which used to be \nthe way we did business around here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object--and I appreciate how candid \nmy Republican counterpart is and I say that seriously--I do speak with \nsome, or I try, though I am not real good at speaking with a lot of \nfervor, as everyone knows--but I feel very strongly about this issue. \nFor people who are unemployed and can't find a job, it is a tough deal. \nI have, fortunately, always had a job. I can't say the same for my \nfamily, especially my dad. So I do speak with as much fervor as I am \ncapable on this issue.\n  The reason I mention I am glad my friend is being so candid is--\nlisten to this--no one can in any way dispute my facts. For every $1 \nspent, we get $1.50 back. That doesn't add to the deficit. So as I see \nthis picture from the consent request, I am seeing that we are going to \ntake away ObamaCare, which 9 million new people have and are signing up \nat the rate of thousands every day. We are going to take away their \nbenefits, in some form or fashion, and we are going to trump the \nbipartisan agreement we have with Mikulski and Rogers. They are coming \nup with an omnibus bill. I know my friend has already stated he \ninitially was against the budget deal, but I would bet that is \naddressed in this deal Mikulski and Rogers will come up with--this \nhelping of veterans.\n  So this is a guise to obstruct, as has been happening during the 5 \nyears President Obama has been President of the United States, and I \nobject with as much fervor as I can.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, over the past several days, we have \nseen a number of stories about how Democrats plan to spend the year \ngearing up for the November elections by making an issue out of \neconomic hardships faced by Americans; in other words, instead of \nworking on reforms that would actually help people overcome the \nchallenges so many of them\n\n[[Page S37]]\n\nface in this economy, Democrats plan to exploit those folks for \npolitical gain. It is pretty amazing when you think about it.\n  We are now in the sixth year--the sixth year--of the Obama \nadministration. We all know the stock market has been doing great, so \nthe richest among us are doing fine. But what about the poor? What \nabout working-class folks? What about folks who work in industries \nliberals don't approve of, such as coal? How many of these Americans \nhave been doing well during the Obama economy?\n  Record numbers of them are having a perfectly terrible time. One \nindicator is the growth of the Food Stamp Program. Consider this: Since \nthe President took office, the number of Americans who have signed up \nfor food stamps has literally skyrocketed--skyrocketed. It is up almost \nhalf. Nearly 4 out of 10 unemployed Americans are trapped--literally \ntrapped--in long-term unemployment. What is worse, the poorest \nAmericans are the ones who have often had the hardest time recovering \nin this economy.\n  Yes, the President took office in the midst of an economic crisis. No \none disputes that. But for many Americans, a terrible situation seems \nto have only gotten worse over the course of this administration. For \nthe President to turn around and try to blame his political opponents \nfor the suffering we have seen out there takes a pretty good amount of \nnerve. It also assumes a collective case of national amnesia. It would \ntake a collective case of national amnesia to reach those conclusions \nbecause, remember, these are the same folks who gave us the stimulus, \nwho gave us tax increases, who gave us ObamaCare, and all of it was \ndone in the name of helping the little guy, in the name of greater \nequality.\n  What has it given us? It has given us this mess we have in our \ncountry: record numbers of long-term unemployed, record numbers on food \nstamps, people losing their health care plans, others seeing the \npremiums shoot up when they can least afford it, and now another call, \none more call, for a government fix.\n  Washington Democrats have shown almost no interest for 5 years in \nworking together on ways to create the kind of good, stable, high-\npaying jobs people want and need. This is a real disservice, first and \nforemost, to those who are struggling the most out there--from the \ncollege graduate who suddenly finds herself wondering why she has huge \nstudent loan debts but no prospects of work to the 50-year-old dad who \nhas worked his whole adult life but suddenly can't find a job that \nmeets either his needs or his potential. Yet this administration's \nproposed solution is just to slap another bandaid from Washington on it \nand call it a day.\n  Yes, we should work on solutions to support those who are out of work \nthrough no fault of their own, but there is literally no excuse to pass \nunemployment insurance legislation without also finding ways to create \ngood, stable, high-paying jobs and also trying to find the money to pay \nfor it. So what I am saying is, let us support meaningful job creation \nmeasures and let us find a way to pay for these UI benefits so we are \nnot adding to an already completely unsustainable debt.\n  Unfortunately, the administration seems almost totally disinterested \nin solutions that don't put government in the lead, and it seems nearly \nincapable of working with those who don't share that belief. That, in \nmany ways, is precisely why we are in the situation we are in--because \nit is only when one believes government is the answer to all of our \nproblems that we talk about unemployment insurance instead of job \ncreation and the minimum wage instead of helping people reach their \nmaximum potential.\n\n  It is time to get away from ``temporary government programs'' and \ngive the American people the tools they need to drive an economy that \ntruly works for them and for their families. We could start with one of \nthe real bright spots in our economy; that is, energy, a field that is \npoised to help our economy create literally millions of jobs, if only \nthe administration would get out of the way.\n  Another area in which we should be able to work together is health \ncare. By almost any metric--affordability, accessibility, even the \nratio of cancellations to enrollments--this law has imposed more pain \nand more distress than many had ever thought possible. Centrists, \nmoderates, conservatives, just about any sensible person outside the \ncongressional Democratic leadership in Washington has long understood \nthis. But now even the left is starting to come to grips with the \npainfully obvious fact that the law it fell in love with can't possibly \nwork.\n  Last week one of the great pooh-bahs of the left admitted that \n``ObamaCare is awful,'' calling it ``the dirty little secret many \nliberals have avoided saying out loud.'' I don't agree with that man on \nmuch else, including his broader ideas on health care, but it is good \nto hear a grandee of the left at least admit this isn't working.\n  His words point to a larger truth, that the President's amen chorus \nhad ample opportunity to speak truth to power when it mattered and that \nmost--most--chose to remain silent. For that the law's apologists have \nleft the American people to pay the price.\n  Let me read part of a letter I recently received from Jennifer Bell, \na constituent of mine in Hopkinsville. This is what she said:\n\n       I have less coverage than I did before. I didn't get to \n     keep my policy that I was happy with. Every dollar I have to \n     pay more is a dollar taken from my family. I never thought \n     that in America we would be forced to purchase something we \n     cannot afford. We worked hard to get where we are. Now we are \n     being forced to pay more in order to pay for somebody else's \n     insurance. How is that fair?\n\n  I hear you, Jennifer. Everyone on this side of the aisle hears those \nconcerns.\n  Here is something else. Many Kentuckians are finding ObamaCare is \nabout more than just higher premiums and cuts to Medicare. It is also \nabout a lack of access to doctors and hospitals. One of the most \nleftwing papers in my State recently ran a big story about how many \nObamaCare coverage networks exclude--exclude--so many of the hospitals \nmy constituents want to use.\n  A few weeks ago, the majority leader basically said criticisms of \nObamaCare amounted to jokes. He might like to think this is all some \njoke, but the constituents who have been writing me about the \nconsequences of this failed law don't see it that way.\n  I know this must weigh heavily on our Democratic colleagues. I know \nthey can't see so many Americans hurting because of decisions they made \nand feel absolutely nothing.\n  Let me say this to our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. It \nis a new year and a time for new beginnings. If you are ready to work \nwith us, we are here. Together we can start over on health care. \nTogether we can give the American people the kind of health care reform \nthey deserve--reform that can lower costs and improve the quality of \ncare.\n  But as with solving the problems of joblessness and unemployment, it \nis something we can only do together.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/07/senate-section/article/S37-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S37]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I listened carefully to the Republican \nleader today. Here is what he said.\n  If we are going to give 1.3 million Americans unemployment insurance \nwhich has now expired, we have to pay for it. Then he suggested how he \nwould pay for it. He would pay for it by attacking ObamaCare. That is \nno surprise. But the provision he would attack is the individual \nmandate--the mandate that people buy health insurance. Well, what is \nthe impact of that? The mandate that people have the responsibility to \nbuy health insurance is necessary if we are going to protect Americans \nfrom being discriminated against who have preexisting conditions in \ntheir families. Follow me now. In order to make sure a parent with a \nchild who has asthma or a child who has diabetes can still buy health \ninsurance, we needed to expand the insurance pool. We expanded the \ninsurance pool by saying to everyone across America: You have the \nresponsibility to buy health insurance.\n  So what Senator McConnell, on behalf of Senate Republicans, is \nsuggesting is this: If we are going to give 1.3 million Americans \nunemployment insurance, we have to say to everyone living in America we \ncan no longer keep our promise that health insurance will not \ndiscriminate against your family because of a preexisting condition. \nWow. What a tradeoff, 1.3 million people get unemployment benefits over \n300 million Americans lose the protection of discrimination in their \nhealth insurance because of a preexisting condition in their families. \nThat is the Republican logic: Help the unemployed but at the expense of \n300 million American families and their health insurance protection.\n  It is interesting to note that we have had a dramatic increase in \npeople living in the Commonwealth of Kentucky--represented by Senator \nMcConnell--when it comes to the Affordable Care Act. Governor Beshear, \na Democrat, is promoting affordable care in Kentucky and has one of the \nmost successful efforts under way across America. Yet every day the \nSenators from Kentucky both come to the floor and criticize the very \nprogram that is so popular in their State.\n  The second point I want to make is this: All we are asking for this \nmorning is a vote to start the debate on unemployment insurance \nbenefits. We are asking 5 Republicans to join 55 Democrats to let us \ndebate whether we extend unemployment benefits across America. It is \nthat simple. At about 11:00 that vote will take place.\n  This used to be a bipartisan issue.\n  The Presiding Officer of New Jersey is the newest Member of the \nSenate, and I welcome him again.\n  There was a time when Republican Presidents thought unemployment \ncompensation was a pretty good idea. Why? Because families with \nbreadwinners who are out of work need to feed their children, need to \nfeed themselves. Senator McConnell criticizes this program as a \ntemporary government handout. Let me tell you, if you don't have food \non the table, you need a temporary helping hand so you can put food on \nthe table so you are strong enough tomorrow to look for jobs again. \nThat is what it is all about, and they don't get it. They say we should \nbe talking about creating jobs. What about creating some food in the \nbellies of children? What about paying the utility bill or the rent or \nkeeping the lights on or keeping the place that you live warm enough \nwhile you are out looking for a job? That is part of the reality facing \npeople across America. There were 81,867 individuals in my home State \nof Illinois who lost their benefits between Christmas and New Year. \nThey have written me letters.\n  Ryan, a 35-year-old man with two children from Antioch, IL, writes to \nme about how difficult it is for him to keep his family together as he \ncontinues day after weary day looking for a job. What I hear from the \nRepublican leader is: Well, isn't it a shame that Ryan doesn't have a \njob? But we can't let government come in and provide the solution.\n  Well, historically government has stepped up when the private sector \ncannot or will not. In this case, we know it is absolutely essential.\n  What we need to have is five Republicans to at least give us a chance \nthis morning at 11 to move forward on the debate on unemployment \ninsurance. This is basic and it is humane. It used to be bipartisan \nbefore the tea party takeover of the Republican Party. I hope there are \nenough moderates left on the Republican side to join us to make this a \nbipartisan issue again. Helping people keep their families together, \nthe lights on, the heat in their homes, and food on the table while \nthey are looking for a job is not a government giveaway. For goodness \nsake, it defines who we are as a nation. If we can't stand and help \nthese people looking for work, then it is a sad commentary on who we \nare, where we are, and our principles.\n  Finally, this notion of thrashing out at ObamaCare every time there \nis an issue coming up on the floor has reached its extreme today, when \nthe Republican leader would eliminate the protection against \ndiscrimination for preexisting conditions for 300 million Americans in \norder to provide unemployment benefits for 1.3 million.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, could the Presiding Officer instruct me when \nI reach the 4-minute mark?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise with my colleagues to support this \nmotion to bring this legislation to the floor to begin a debate.\n  There were 1.3 million Americans who were pushed off an economic \ncliff on December 28 when their extended unemployment benefits ended. \nThey are searching for work. They have to search for work. They are in \na market where there are typically two or three applicants for one job.\n  Yesterday I read a story from the Washington Post that talked about \nthe opening of a new dairy plant in Maryland. They were expecting a lot \nof interest in the 36 jobs: 1,600 applicants. I would wager that many \nof those applicants never thought in their lives, after being a vice \npresident of sales in a company or a sophisticated manager of the \nfinancial aspects of a company, that they would be applying for work in \na dairy. Some of them might even be on extended benefits, and that is \nthe only thing keeping them whole. And they are looking for work, 1,600 \napplicants for 36 jobs.\n  This is not unique to Maryland. It is in my home State of Rhode \nIsland. It is in States all across this country, Nevada, Tennessee, \nArizona, States with unemployment numbers above the national average of \n7 percent. In my case, it is 9 percent. We have to help these families. \nAnd as Senator Durbin pointed out, we have done this on a bipartisan \nbasis until very recently.\n  This is a smart economic program. This program, according to CBO, \nwill create 200,000 jobs next year if we extend it. Those are 200,000 \njobs we are going to give away. And the minority leader was talking \nabout how we have to do more to create jobs around here. Well, if we \ndon't pass this measure, CBO has told us we are going to forfeit \n200,000 jobs. So from an economic basis in this country, this is smart. \nBut from a human basis, this helps people who have worked--and the only \nway you qualify for this program is if you worked and then you are let \ngo through no fault of your own. So we have to do that.\n  Colleagues on the other side are talking about: Well, we have to pay \nfor these benefits. This is a selective sort of notion, because, \nfrankly, the last time we extended these benefits in January of 2013, \nit was not offset and the vote was 89-8. It included tax provisions and \nother provisions, but we extended these benefits, unpaid for, 89-8. Yet \nnow we have to pay for these benefits.\n  What Senator Heller and I have done is said: Listen, we need to help \nthese people now. Let's do a 90-day extension, provide retroactive \nrelief, and help these 1.3 million--and it will grow, because several \nmillion more people will lose their benefits this year. Let's do it, \nand then let's sit down and work on this program.\n  But let me also remind my colleagues, we have made significant \nchanges to the unemployment insurance program. In early 2012, we had a \nconference report between the House and the Senate which made changes \nin unemployment insurance. We reduced the total time from 99 weeks to \n73 weeks. We created the work-sharing\n\n[[Page S39]]\n\nprogram, a very innovative program which allows people to collect for \npart of the week but also stay employed the rest of the week. It is a \nprogram which has helped companies all across the country, small \ncompanies in particular. We have given States more flexibility on job \ntraining. We have given States more flexibility in oversight of their \nprograms. We have made changes. We are willing to listen to thoughtful \nproposals again. But we can't do it on the backs of 1.3 million \nAmericans who have lost the only benefit they have.\n  If we really want to talk about job training, if we want to talk \nabout cooperation, why haven't we been able to reauthorize the \nWorkforce Investment Act since 1998? We have not made the changes in \nworkforce training that affect this whole country--not just the \nunemployed but those young people who are trying to move out of high \nschool and junior college into the workforce. We haven't done it. Why? \nWell, from 1998 until 2007, we had a Republican Congress. Since 2007, \nwe have been struggling very mightily with an economic crisis. And we \nhave made progress.\n  But if we want to start cooperating, let's bring the Workforce \nInvestment Act to the floor. It has passed the committee on a \nbipartisan basis. Let's bring it to the floor. Let's help people.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 3\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Rhode Island under that time to \nyield for the following question.\n  I don't know if the Senator was on the floor when the Republican \nleader said he wanted to pay for the cost of these unemployment \nbenefits by eliminating the individual mandate under the Affordable \nCare Act--which is the key element in protecting families who have \nchildren with preexisting conditions--cancer survivors, children with \ndiabetes, children with asthma. As I understood the Republican leader, \nhe believes that the best way to take care of people who are unemployed \nand can't feed their children is to deny the protections of the \nAffordable Care Act for those families who have children with \npreexisting conditions. Would the Senator from Rhode Island comment on \nwhether that is a good trade for either side?\n  Mr. REED. I think it is a terrible trade. It is not just about \nfamilies with children, it is about many of these working adults who, \nif they have a preexisting condition, lose their coverage. It is not \njust a question of children. That I think is very sensitive. Without \nthe Affordable Care Act, if you get sick, you can't get coverage. The \nonly way you can get coverage if you are middle-aged is if you are \nhealthy and you don't need it. When you needed it, the insurance \ncompanies took it away--before the Affordable Care Act.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I might ask another question to the Senator from Rhode \nIsland from the time allotted on our side, I listened carefully to the \nspeech given by the Republican leader this morning.\n  I see my colleague from New York here, so I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my friends from Illinois and Rhode Island.\n  How much time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute 30 seconds.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I see what is going on here. Our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle know the power of this issue \nbut don't really want to vote for it, and so they are putting \nimpossible logjams in the path.\n  Who would believe that on this side of the aisle we would delay an \nimportant part of the ACA which would hurt--as my colleagues from \nIllinois and Rhode Island brought out--parents who have kids with \ncancer? We are not going to do that, and we are not going to do it on \nthe fly.\n  So what I would say to my colleagues is if you believe in \nunemployment benefits and extending them, pass them clean and simple. \nDon't play games. Don't put obstacles in their path that you know would \nbe insurmountable. Get it done.\n  I make one other point. The bottom line is very simple: People want \nto work. People who have lost their jobs after working decades for a \ncompany are knocking on doors every day. They are going online. They \nare desperate to work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. This idea that unemployment benefits encourage them not \nto work is balderdash.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I yield back all time on the Republican side.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/07/senate-section/article/S39-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S39-S45]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S40]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am so pleased that six Republicans--six \nout of all the Republicans--joined with us--every Democrat present--to \nreach that magic 60 votes we needed to proceed to consider the \nunemployment compensation bill.\n  I think it is so important to recognize that Federal unemployment \nprograms have been extended no less than 28 times since 1958--15 times \nunder Republican Presidents and 13 times under Democratic Presidents. \nSo this is nothing new--this is nothing new--and the fact that it has \nbeen made such a big deal is incomprehensible given the circumstances \nof us recovering from the greatest recession since the Great \nDepression, with a very special number, a very large number. The fact \nis we have a long-term unemployment rate that is very high, way higher \nthan normal.\n  The fact is, since we have extended Federal unemployment benefits so \nmany times it should not be a problem, it is shocking it is a problem. \nIn November 2008, unemployment insurance was extended with bipartisan \nsupport without an offset, which seems to be the excuse the Republicans \nhave for not voting with us.\n  What is very interesting about that is these are the same Republicans \nwho voted to go to war twice and put those wars on the credit card--\nnever paid for them. These are the same Republicans who voted for tax \ncuts to billionaires and multimillionaires and never paid for it. Yet \nstill, when it comes to the middle class, oh, they cannot possibly \nextend unemployment benefits without paying for it. If anyone knows \nanything about economics, they should know that when we are trying to \nstimulate jobs and stimulate the economy--not depress jobs and lose \njobs--we do not contract spending.\n  We have already dealt with deficits, and we continue to deal with \ndeficits. I want to show the progress we have made under President \nObama. This is something we never hear from the Republicans. They would \nmake us feel deficits are raging, as they were under George W. Bush.\n  When President Obama took over, he inherited a $1.4 trillion deficit \nfrom George Bush. George Bush inherited surpluses from Bill Clinton. It \ntook him--and I am exaggerating--15 minutes to change it: two wars on a \ncredit card, no problem, no offsets; tax cuts to billionaires, no \nproblem, no offsets--and the deficits soared to $1.4 trillion.\n  When President Obama came in, he not only had to deal with raging \ndeficits, he had to deal with the worst recession since the Great \nDepression, and all we hear from the Republican side is: This President \ndid not do enough here, did not do enough there. Nothing is enough.\n  We are now in a situation where this deficit has been cut in half--\ncut in half--down to $560 billion, and we want to see it disappear, \njust as we did when Bill Clinton was President and the Democrats passed \na budget that balanced and set in motion a surplus, which was destroyed \nwhen George W. Bush was President. Let's be clear on the history. There \nare facts. There are stubborn things. They are real. These are the \nfacts.\n  Now we come to a place where we want to extend long-term unemployment \nbenefits for those who got deeply hurt in this great recession, and we \nhear that we have to offset it, which goes against the economic experts \nwho say it is important that we stimulate this economy and keep these \njobs rolling.\n  Remember, in the President George W. Bush recession, we had a similar \nextended benefit. It was not offset. It was extended twice in 2003 with \nstrong bipartisan support and no offset. So why is it when a Republican \nis President the Republicans say: OK, let's help the unemployed without \nan offset, without spending cuts. But when a Democrat is President, oh \nno, we could not do it?\n  Honestly, it just is so political on its face. Democrats have been \nconsistent. Whether a Republican is President or a Democrat is \nPresident, we want to help the middle class. We want to help the \nunemployed. That is the difference between the parties. I say God bless \nthose six Republicans who joined with us today so we can do our job and \nhelp the long-term unemployed.\n  The long-term unemployment rate is 2.6 percent--the long-term \nunemployment rate, twice as high as it was at any other time that these \nextended unemployment benefits were allowed to expire. Let me say that \nagain, how urgent this is. The long-term unemployment rate--that means \npeople who have been out of work for a long time, 6 months or more, is \n2.6 percent, twice as high as it was at any other time in our history \nwhere we have extended unemployment benefits.\n  There are almost three unemployed people for every job opening \nnationwide. Let me repeat. There are almost three unemployed people for \nevery job opening nationwide. We need to understand, while some of our \nRepublican colleagues are blaming the unemployed and saying it is a \ndisservice to give them unemployment compensation, that these folks are \nactively looking for jobs. That is part of the deal.\n  First of all, this is insurance. Second of all, they are looking for \nwork. Third of all, they are stuck in the situation where it is not \ntheir fault. A Christmas present was given by the Republicans to the \n1.3 million unemployed. That Christmas present was: Sorry, you are not \ngetting your unemployment benefits. We left here without being able to \ndeal with it.\n  But today we have a chance, a chance to do the right thing. In \nCalifornia, my State alone, there are 222,000 people who have lost \ntheir extended unemployment benefits. An additional 1.9 million people \nare projected to lose their benefits over the next 6 months if \nunemployment insurance is not extended.\n  What are these grandiose amounts of money that people get when they \nare long-term unemployed: $300 a week, on average--$300 a week, on \naverage. So for our colleagues to say that people want to be \npurposefully unemployed to collect $300 a week, could I tell you, try \nliving on $300 a week. If you are lucky, you can keep a roof over your \nhead but you have to be pretty lucky. If you are lucky, you can get \nmaybe a little bit of nutrition. That $300 a week is a lifeline. They \ncan put some groceries on the table, pay their rent, and cover the \nexpenses they have in looking for a job.\n  This keeps American families afloat at a critical time. I want to \ngive you a few stories from my home State of the real face of long-term \nunemployment and why we have to vote to extend these benefits. One \nwoman wrote:\n\n       I am 58 years old and am receiving unemployment benefits \n     for the first time in my life. I am currently receiving my \n     first federal extension. I was laid off because the non-\n     profit I was working for lost a major portion of its state \n     funding.\n       Getting unemployment benefits is not preventing me from \n     looking for work. In fact, people getting extended \n     unemployment benefits are required to prove they're looking \n     for work. I spend hours every week filling out applications \n     and posting my resume without result.\n       Tell me, how am I, and thousands like me supposed to pay my \n     rent and eat? I agree that Washington should ``focus on job \n     creation'' but that should be in addition to, not instead of, \n     extending benefits. I beg you,--\n\n  She writes to me--\n\n     Please extend unemployment benefits. Thank you.\n\n  Another Californian wrote from Los Angeles:\n\n       After working 27 years for one employer, the bad economy \n     finally led to my layoff and my first time ever on \n     unemployment.\n\n  Remember, this person worked 27 years for one employer.\n\n       I was told that because of the bad economy, I would get up \n     to 63 weeks with the Federal Extension. Now I'm being told \n     without further action from Congress and the President, my \n     benefits end at the end of the year even though that leaves \n     me 3 months short. After paying into the system for 32 years, \n     this is the only time I have ever asked for anything back and \n     this is how I'm treated.\n\n  There are other stories. Kaitlyn of Twentynine Palms, 24 years old, \nlost her $450-a-week benefit when the Federal extension expired. She is \na Marine Corps veteran, the mother of two young kids. She has been \nsearching for work. The family cannot move because her husband, a \nveteran of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars must remain near the combat \ncenter until he is discharged from the Marines.\n  The loss of her benefits will cut deeply into the couple's income. \nSmith said, ``The family is already skimping on basics, including \nheat.''\n  Including heat.\n  ``I have to keep the house at 55 degrees even though I have two \nlittle girls, ages 2\\1/2\\ and 1\\1/2\\.''\n\n[[Page S41]]\n\n  Keeping the house at 55 degrees. That is a story which appeared in \nthe Los Angeles Times on New Year's Eve.\n  Laura Walker, a 63-year-old paralegal has been looking for work since \nJanuary when she was laid off from a California law firm. She counted \non her benefits that have now run out.\n\n       Not all of us have savings and a lot of us have to take \n     care of family because of what happened in the economy, said \n     Walker, of Santa Clarita, who said she has applied for at \n     least three jobs a week and shares an apartment with her \n     unemployed son, his wife and two children. It's going to put \n     my family and me out on the streets.\n\n  That appeared in Bloomberg News on December 31.\n  We have a story of a software engineer who lives in San Diego County. \nShe is one of 18,000 San Diego County residents to lose their payments. \nShe says her $450 weekly unemployment payment goes to food, dental \ninsurance, and other living necessities. She has tried zealously to \nfind work. She has volunteered. She has attended meetings. She has cold \ncalled. She has written letters. She has joined the Project Management \nInstitute of San Diego. She said:\n\n       I haven't been sitting here watching soap operas. I would \n     go to work tomorrow, or today. I really am tired of this.\n\n  That story appeared in the San Diego Tribune. I ask unanimous consent \nthat several additional stories be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Cindy Snow, of Beaumont, CA, lost her job as a social \n     worker in April when the San Bernardino school system \n     terminated the child-care program where she worked. Her \n     husband, employed in the construction industry, has been \n     without a job since 2009. They have been relying on \n     assistance from the California Housing Finance Agency to \n     cover a $1,424-a-month payment on their home.\n       When she loses her unemployment benefits, she said, the \n     family will no longer qualify for the housing assistance. \n     ``Why are they using us as pawns? They're playing games with \n     people's lives,'' Snow said, referring to politicians in \n     Washington.\n       --Bloomberg News, 12/30/13\n                                  ____\n\n       Steven Swanson of Madera Ranchos, CA, worked for 33 years \n     in wholesale, mostly in beverage sales, before losing his job \n     in 2011. Since then, he estimates that he's submitted resumes \n     for more than 500 positions and in the last six months filled \n     out more than 200 job applications--all to no avail.\n       ``I want a job, I want to work,'' said Swanson whose \n     daughter and son-in-law live with him and pay rent to help \n     him keep up the mortgage on the house he owns. ``As a \n     taxpayer, I paid into the system for a lot of years. For them \n     to just shut it off and say, `These people need to get weaned \n     off and get a job'--well, yeah, I need to get a job. But for \n     them to suggest that I just go get welfare or go get food \n     stamps--that's why I'm frustrated with the Republican Party. \n     They just don't get it.''\n       --Fresno Bee, 1/2/14\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. So here you have the facts. I will just recap them. We \nhave a situation where the long-term unemployment rate--those looking \nfor work and out of work for more than 6 months is higher than it has \never been, 2.6 percent.\n  We have a situation where we are coming out of the worst recession \nsince the Great Depression. Even though President Obama has done an \namazing job on job creation, creating 8 million private sector jobs in \nhis time--8 million private sector jobs under President Obama. We lost \nmore than 600 million private sector jobs by the end of 8 years under \nGeorge W. Bush. But we still have a problem. How many private sector \njobs were lost in the recession? More than 8 million. So we need to \nrestore those jobs.\n  So this is not the time--when you go for a job and there are three \napplicants for one job--to tell people they are cut off from \nunemployment.\n  Here is the issue. In a State that has a really good economy with a \nvery low unemployment rate, less than about 5 percent, the full \nextension does not go forward. It only goes forward to States that have \na high unemployment rate. So it is targeted. It is not going to States \nwhere there is a boom going on or a really strong economy. It goes to \nStates that have a tough unemployment rate, and have all these people \ncoming for one job opening.\n  In some States it is five to one. Remember, the average is almost \nthree to one, three people for every job. In some States they are doing \nbetter. Maybe there is just two people for every job. But there are \nthree nationally. In some States it is way higher. So we are just \nsaying at this particular point in time: Let's extend this for a 3-\nmonth period. Do it without offsets, because when you offset you cut \nsomething else and you constrict the economy at a time when you should \nbe expanding it. Two-thirds of the time we have never paid for \nunemployment extensions. Under George W. Bush, who started the current \nprogram, we never did--at least in the beginning we did not.\n  We care about jobs in this country. Everybody does. If we extend \nunemployment insurance, we would prevent the loss of 240,000 jobs. You \nsay: Why? That is because when folks get their checks, what do they do \nwith it? They go down to the store, and they spend it buying food for \ntheir families. They do not hold back. They pay their rent. The \nlandlord gets that check and spends that check. So it is an immediate \nboon to the economy and an immediate fact that we can definitely prove \nthat jobs are not lost because economic activity in those communities \ngoes down.\n  We are talking, in my State, of 46,000 jobs that will be lost if we \ndo not correct this problem. The Congressional Budget Office has said \nanother year-long extension, if we do this and do it for a year--this \nparticular bill is only a few months extension--if we did it for a \nyear, we would add two-tenths of 1 percent to our gross domestic \nproduct.\n  Extending unemployment insurance is one of the most cost effective \nways to grow the economy and create jobs. In the end, that reduces the \ndeficit. So all of this talk to cut this and cut that to pay for this, \nit is counterproductive because you will pull back on gross domestic \nproduct growth, and there will be less revenue coming into the \ngovernment.\n  So I do not see how this extension of unemployment is anything but a \nwin-win. It is an obvious win-win. If you took the politics out of it, \nyou would do the right thing, Republicans, because you have done it in \nthe past. When Republicans were President, you did it without an \noffset. You did not hold up a bill. You passed it. You stimulated the \neconomy. You create more jobs. The deficit then goes down even faster \nthan it is going down. Look at how it is coming down.\n  There is no reason why we have to cut something that then depresses \nspending over here, while doing unemployment over here. It does not \nmake sense. I was an economics major a long time ago. So I am not \nsaying that I am up to date on the latest theories. But one thing we \nknow makes sense: When you are trying to create jobs, when you are \ntrying to get out of a recession, you do not turn to austerity, \nespecially since we have wrapped our arms around this deficit. It has \nbeen hard to do. But who would have thought we could have done it. We \ndid it.\n  So we do not have to say now that, while we give an unemployment \nextension on the one hand, we are going to cut something on the other \nhand and lose those jobs over there. It does not make sense. Then you \nput those people on unemployment. It really does not make sense.\n  Would I vote to give a little higher tax rate to the billionaires? I \njust watched a documentary called ``Park Avenue.'' This is what they \nsaid. I have not fact-checked it, so we have to fact check this. But \nthis is what the documentary said: Approximately 400 or 500 families \nare worth more than 150 million Americans--net worth. That is what they \nsaid. We are going to fact-check it this afternoon. If I am wrong, I \nwill correct the Record.\n  That is what the movie said: 450, 500 families have more net worth \nthan half the population of America.\n  That is the income inequality.\n  So would I pay for this by putting a little tax on the billionaires? \nOh, yes, I would. But I don't wish to start cutting programs: \neducation, housing, health care, whatever they come up with, which then \nmeans people would be laid off.\n  We can do this. We are not afraid to cut spending. We are not afraid \nto reduce the deficit. We did it under Bill Clinton. We got a surplus, \nand we are doing it under Barack Obama.\n  I defy any Republican to show me how this shapes up in a bad way with \nthe Bush record, which was taking surpluses that George Bush inherited \nand turning it into massive deficits and literally no job creation. It \nwas 1.1 million jobs created, compared to cutting\n\n[[Page S42]]\n\nthe deficit in half after President Barack Obama inherited the worst \nrecession since the Great Depression, creating 8 million new jobs in \nthe private sector alone and reducing the deficit by half.\n  We know what we are doing, despite what they say, and it is OK, \nbecause at the end of the day the facts are the facts. I didn't make up \nthis chart. This is a chart that comes from the Congressional Budget \nOffice. These are their numbers.\n  The stories I have told and that I have put in the Record are \npoignant. There are people out there who are at their wit's end holding \ntheir lives together, keeping their homes at 55 degrees when they have \nlittle children in them, not knowing if they can pay the rent, not \nknowing if they can go to the grocery store, not knowing if they will \nbe homeless, not knowing what the future holds.\n  The least we can do, the least we can do in this Chamber is stand and \nfight for them.\n  What are we here for anyway? Are we here for the Koch brothers? I \nhope not. The billionaires are doing just fine. This country is a great \ncountry. It is a great country because everyone can dream to go to the \ntop. But if we lose the middle class and we are not there with the \nsafety net when they fall, we will lose everything and this country \nwill not resemble the America I grew up in and that I knew. I had \nnothing and my husband had nothing. He lost his father when he was only \na young boy. His mother was a school crossing guard and raised three \nboys.\n  In this country, my husband went to college, to law school, and \nstarted his own law firm, his own small business. That is what America \nis.\n  But when we were in trouble when we were young, we knew we had the \nhope and the dream. It was real. It wasn't unreachable. It was \nreachable because there was a safety net, and part of that safety net \nis unemployment insurance. Part of that safety net is extending it for \nthe long-term unemployed.\n  I am going to close with a couple of facts about health care because \nI am so tired of the ``bad news bears'' coming out here every day \nwhining about ObamaCare. I wish to tell everyone some of the good news \nabout health care because we don't hear it enough.\n  Across this country, over 2.1 million Americans have enrolled through \nthe exchanges in private health insurance--2.1. It is pretty amazing, \nand I wish to state some more facts.\n  In California, I wish to tell you what is happening. We have our own \nexchange, Covered California, coveredCA.com. What has happened so far \nwe don't hear around the beltway. All we hear is: ObamaCare is bad. \nObamaCare is bad.\n  I wish to tell some stories of what is truly happening and these \nfacts will catch up as well, such as 400,000 Californians now have \ncoverage through the California exchange, private coverage.\n  We have more than 200,000 Californians on Medi-Cal, which is \nCalifornia's Medicaid Program.\n  A truly great number is more than 1 million California families--not \npeople, families, so we are talking about probably a few million \npeople--have begun the process of applying for coverage.\n  Across the country, I can state--and we know we have had our bumps in \nthe road--today we are resolving some of those bumps. We had about 2 \npercent of the people who wound up in a problem where they couldn't get \nthe insurance they wanted. President Obama fixed that problem.\n  Now we have that 2-percent problem down to way less than .2 percent, \nvery few families. Let's get that clear. Will there be more bumps? Yes. \nWill we fix them, yes. Are we still worried about the few thousand \nfamilies who need our help? Yes. We will fix it.\n  I don't shy away from this. If we have a problem, we fix it. Somebody \npoint out to me any business that doesn't have a few problems in the \nrollout, and I will say that is pretty amazing.\n  We had problems with the rollout. It was bad. We are fixing it, and \nthe proof is in the pudding. Today, 9 million Americans have new secure \nhealth insurance; 2.1 million, on that other chart, have received it \nthrough all the different exchanges, 2.1 million; 3.9 million have \nenrolled in Medicaid; and 3 million young adults can now stay on their \nparents' plans. There were bumps in the road, we fixed them, and we \nwill continue to do so, but this is a good story.\n  I wish to read from some constituents who have written to me about \nthe Affordable Care Act. These are real people speaking, not \npoliticians, not I--them.\n  Mary Natwick of Monrovia signed up for a platinum plan for her family \nof three through the Covered California Web site. Even though she makes \ntoo much to qualify for a subsidy and even though she purchased the \nhighest level plan, she is saving $1,000 a month on her premiums and \nshe has a lower deductible.\n  Mary wrote:\n\n       Needless to say, we are thrilled beyond belief. Please \n     accept our gratitude, and pass on our thanks to all who voted \n     for this bill.\n\n  This is a constituent who likes ObamaCare and she thanks the Senator \nfrom Oregon, Mr. Merkley.\n  David Specter of Ventura and his wife are young retirees, 62 and 58. \nTheir old premiums cost $882 a month. Now because David and his wife \nqualify for subsidized premiums on the Covered California exchange, \nthey will pay a total of $434 a month with lower deductibles. That is \n$400 a month in savings. Calculate what that means in 1 year, $400 a \nmonth. They can spend it in the neighborhood, in the movies, at a \nrestaurant, in the grocery store, on a vacation, gifts for their \ngrandkids.\n  David wrote:\n\n       Thank you so much for supporting the Affordable Care Act. \n     It may not be perfect, but it sure makes a big difference for \n     us.\n\n  I think that sums it up for me. The Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, \nmay not be perfect, but it sure is making a difference for Americans--\nso far 9 million strong, and it will be way more than that.\n  Maya Walls of San Diego was diagnosed with breast cancer at 27 years \nof age. Since that diagnosis 20 years ago, she has either kept working \nto maintain insurance or paid very high COBRA premiums in between her \njobs to keep her coverage and to avoid preexisting condition \nexclusions. That is because, as we know, until ObamaCare became the law \nof the land, insurers could walk out on people once they got sick.\n  Two years ago, Maya lost her job. In September she held her breath \nand went without coverage. On October 1, she found out she finally \nqualified for California's new expanded Medicaid Program, which she had \nnever qualified for before.\n  She wrote:\n\n       Please do not give an inch on the ACA. This is the first \n     time I have taken a deep breath in 20 years. Thank you.\n\n  I see we have a new Presiding Officer, and I wish to retell this \nstory.\n  This is a story of one of my constituents who was diagnosed with \nbreast cancer at 27 years of age. Since that diagnosis she was so \nscared she would lose her insurance because of her preexisting \ncondition that she kept paying very high COBRA premiums. When she \nfinally ran out of options, she lost her insurance and just found out \nshe qualifies for the new expanded Medicaid.\n  She wrote:\n\n       Please do not give an inch on the ACA. This is the first \n     time I have taken a deep breath in 20 years.\n\n  I say to the American people--I hope a few will hear my voice--\nnothing in life is perfect. No bill is perfect. No business is perfect. \nNo one is perfect; no individual, no President, no Senator for sure. \nBut we see a problem, and we do our best to step up to the plate.\n  If things go wrong, as it did with the rollout, we get mad about it, \nbut we fix it, and we don't go back to the problems we had before of \nkids being kicked off their parents' insurance and having no insurance, \nof people being told: Sorry. You have asthma or you have cancer or you \nhave high blood pressure. We can't help you.\n  Those days are over. Being a woman was a preexisting condition. \nHaving been a victim of sexual assault was a preexisting condition. If \nsomeone was in an abusive relationship, they said: You are just too \nhigh of a risk, and they walked away.\n  There were lifetime caps on our policies. There were annual caps on \nour policies, gender discrimination, preexisting condition \ndiscrimination, all of that.\n  I am going to say anyone who wants to repeal ObamaCare or the \nAffordable Care Act will go back to those days.\n  I will never forget reading a New American Foundation study that \nsaid,\n\n[[Page S43]]\n\nif we hadn't changed health care in this country, we were getting to a \nplace where premiums would have risen to about 50 percent of our \nincomes, on average, for at least half of American households. At that \npoint, who is going to be able to afford insurance?\n  I met people who were praying on their hands and knees to turn 65. As \nwe get older we say: Oh, my God. I want to stay young.\n  People were saying: Let me get to my 65th birthday so I can get \nMedicare because I have no insurance.\n  That is what I heard from my constituents.\n  What I hear may not be perfect, but it is saving their lives: Fix \nwhat is a problem, Senator. You can.\n  I thank the President for acting to make sure the people who got \nthose cancellation notices--it was about 2 percent of all Americans--\nwere able to stay on similar insurance for an extended period of time.\n  Yes, we will fix what the problems are, but we will also rejoice when \nwe get letters such as I am getting from all over my State. I ask \nunanimous consent to have three additional stories printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       John Nunnemacher is a 43-year-old freelance graphic artist \n     from San Jose and the last time he had health insurance was \n     15 years ago, when his employer paid for his coverage. But as \n     of January 1, John is covered by a plan he can finally \n     afford. He told the San Jose Mercury News, ``I hoped this day \n     would come. I worried that it wouldn't. And I'm very glad \n     that it finally has.''\n                                  ____\n\n       Amy Torregrossa, 27, is from San Francisco. She has been \n     without insurance since July, when coverage through her \n     partner's company ended because he changed jobs. She has a \n     congenital heart defect and a history of high blood pressure. \n     She no longer runs, she said, because ``if I twist my ankle \n     or get hit by a car. . .any doctor visit is so expensive.'' \n     She signed up on Covered California for a silver plan costing \n     $310 a month. She made sure her cardiologist was in the \n     insurer's network and plans to schedule a checkup for early \n     next year.\n                                  ____\n\n       Michel Stong, 57, is a self-employed product designer. For \n     many years, she could not afford any insurance at all because \n     of a false-positive test for lupus, which incorrectly flagged \n     her as someone with a pre-existing condition. For the past 15 \n     years, she could afford only catastrophic insurance. Now, \n     thanks to a tax credit, she will pay $55 a month with no \n     deductible and a $3 copay for doctor visits. ``It just blows \n     my mind that I can get health insurance for this price! I can \n     finally afford checkups, tests, and age-related visits.''\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we will tell those stories and we will \ncounteract the stories we hear.\n  In closing, I wish to say--because I know the Senator from Oregon has \nbeen waiting patiently--the reason I took to the floor to talk about \nhealth care is to make the point that it is the middle class and the \nworking poor who are truly being helped--that is so important in this \ntime of income inequality--and make the point that we make sure we \nextend the unemployment compensation to the long-term unemployed as \nthey, through no fault of their own, are trying to keep their house and \nhome together, which is so critical.\n  I thank my six Republican colleagues who showed courage, stepped up, \nand allowed us to get on this bill. I hope we pass it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Heitkamp). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I wish to make a few very brief \ncomments, and the first is this: In the budget agreement that was \nhammered out right before we left for the holidays, a provision was \ninserted by Congressman Ryan that changed the COLA details for our \nveterans. This provision is outrageous. It is changing the retirement \ndeal in the middle of a person's service or, for many of our veterans, \neven after they have retired--between the time they have retired and \nthe time they reach age 62. In the coming days of this week, I hope \nthis body can come together and reverse this provision which unfairly \nchanges the terms of retirement for our veterans. Our veterans stood up \nfor us as a nation when they were overseas, and we must stand up for \nthem here at home.\n  Secondly, I would like to express hope for the bipartisan spirit that \nled to an agreement to debate the bill regarding restoring emergency \nunemployment. I had eight townhalls over the weekend, and I can tell \nyou that it strikes people as fundamentally unfair that States with \nhigh unemployment, such as my home State of Oregon--that these weeks of \nemergency unemployment, which was a deal hammered out in a bipartisan \nfashion under a Republican President, President Bush, should be set \nasunder.\n  Indeed, on December 28, 18,000 Oregon families got a lump of coal in \ntheir stockings, and in the course of this coming year another 58,000 \nOregon families will be thrown out in the cold, if you will, due to the \nfailure to reauthorize this program. Indeed, the failure to reauthorize \nit not only affects directly those families who need a longer bridge to \nthe next job because of the high unemployment levels, but it also \naffects the economy, destroying an estimated 4,000 jobs. Our citizens \nwant to see us create jobs, not destroy jobs.\n  So I hope the bipartisan spirit that led to our agreeing to debate \nrestoring the emergency unemployment program will lead to our actually \nreauthorizing the emergency unemployment program.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, this new year represents an opportunity \nfor us to refocus and plan for our year ahead. Unfortunately, for \nmillions of Americans their focus will be on trying to stay afloat over \nthe next year while they search for work. All of us here know there is \nno more important issue for middle-class families across America right \nnow than jobs and the economy. This is what they want their elected \nofficials to be focused on, and it is exactly what I think we ought to \nbe working on every day.\n  By reaching a bipartisan agreement last month, we did a number of \nthings to work toward that goal. First of all and importantly, we \nshowed the American people that Members of Congress can work together, \nthat we can listen to each other, and that we can get into a room and \ntalk frankly without trying to hurt each other politically. Second, by \nbreaking through that partisanship, we finally ended that seemingly \nnever-ending cycle of lurching from crisis to crisis. Third, we showed \nthat ``compromise'' isn't a dirty word and that there is a big \ncoalition that is ready to make some sacrifices politically to get \nthings done. Finally and importantly, for our efforts to continue to \ngrow our economy, we gave American families and businesses the \ncertainty they need to grow.\n  Of course, there is much more to do. As much as we are heartened by \nthe headlines that predict a strong economy this year, we understand \njust how fragile our recovery still is, with millions of Americans \nstill out of work.\n  Now is the time to redouble our efforts, not shrink from the \nchallenges we face, because the truth is that all the economic \npredictions in the world mean nothing if we don't continue to support \npolicies that help our middle class. That work absolutely starts with \nextending unemployment benefits for the millions of Americans who have \nbeen losing their benefits since December 28.\n  Because unemployment assistance goes right back into the economies of \ncommunities large and small, nonpartisan economists have found it is \none of the most effective ways to build a recovery that lasts. Those \nsame economists have said that failure to continue these benefits will \ncost us over 200,000 jobs. And renewing these benefits is simply the \nright thing to do at a time when millions of American families continue \nto teeter on the brink in States where unemployment remains stubbornly \nhigh.\n  I have come to the Senate floor today with the hope that we can \ncontinue with the bipartisan momentum we saw with today's cloture vote \nand that we have seen over the last few weeks and take a final vote to \nprovide a lifeline for millions of Americans. This should be an easy \nissue. It would be simply wrong to cut off the support while our \neconomy continues to struggle and so many workers are really having \ndifficulty finding work. Right now, in fact, there are three unemployed \nworkers for every single job opening. If every opening were filled \ntomorrow, we would still have more than 7 million American workers \nacross the country without a job to even apply for. More\n\n[[Page S44]]\n\nthan one-third of all unemployed workers have been out of a job for 6 \nmonths or longer--above historic averages and higher than in past \nrecoveries.\n  Millions of Americans are unemployed today not because they do not \nwant to work, not because they do not have valuable skills, but simply \nbecause they found themselves in an economy that isn't creating jobs as \nquickly as needed. These unemployed workers are desperate to get back \non the job, and unemployment benefits make all the difference for them \nand their families while they scour the want ads, pound the pavement, \nand send out resume after resume.\n  I have received story after story from workers and families across my \nhome State of Washington about what unemployment benefits have meant to \nthem and what losing them would mean for their future. These men and \nwomen can't afford to have the rug pulled out from under them and are \nnow struggling with each day that passes.\n  One of these stories came from a woman named Carol from Puyallup in \nmy home State. She is a nurse. She was laid off from her job. She \ndecided that in order to make ends meet she would start her own legal \nnurse consulting business, so she enrolled in classes to help her hone \nher entrepreneurial skills. While taking those classes, Carol relied on \nher unemployment benefits to get by. Then, not only were her benefits \nslashed significantly due to sequestration, but Carol just found out \nshe was one of the 25,000 people in Washington State whose benefits \nwere completely cut off on December 28.\n\n  As a leader in the classroom, Carol has spoken to many other soon-to-\nbe business owners who are suffering. In the face of unexpected job \nloss, they now feel as if they are being punished for deciding to chart \na new course in their lives. They are creating work for themselves and \npotentially others but now have to decide whether they can continue \nfollowing that dream without the critical support unemployment benefits \nprovide them.\n  Carol is not alone. I heard from a woman who was laid off from her \njob at a plant in Keyport, WA, early last year. She told me:\n\n       Living in Kitsap County, we are geographically isolated, \n     and finding work with so many qualified applicants right now \n     is much more difficult. This year, I have applied for over \n     200 jobs and in spite of a stellar resume, have only gotten \n     four phone interviews. I have lowered my standards throughout \n     the year and applied for jobs far below my pay grade to no \n     avail . . . my husband and I have had to claim bankruptcy . . \n     . and I truly worry about losing my home and displacing my \n     children.\n\n  Madam President, that is what people are facing today.\n  Finally, there is Traci, a woman from Everett. She is a former \nexecutive assistant with 20 years of experience. After taking time off \nfrom work to care for her dying mother and a daughter who was suffering \nfrom bipolar disorder and drug addiction, Traci found herself without a \njob. Shortly after her mother passed, Traci fell ill, making it \ndifficult for her to look for work.\n  While Traci was receiving unemployment benefits, they were barely \nenough to cover the care her daughter required. Traci told me that she \nnow can't afford food and has lost over 50 pounds. She even asked that \nI send her a video of the speech I am making right here as she won't be \nable to tune in today because she had to get rid of her television in \nthe process of finding savings. Like so many others, Traci is searching \nhigh and low for that one break, and she told me, ``I just need time \nfor someone to give me a chance.''\n  For Traci, unemployment benefits are not the solution. A job is what \nshe wants. But they provide her with some critical support while she \ntakes care of her family and tries to find that work.\n  Those are just a few of the stories I have heard, but there are a lot \nlike them. Millions of people across America, including an almost \nadditional 28,000 in my State, stand to lose the benefits they count on \nif Congress doesn't act soon. These workers are not looking for a \nhandout. They do not want to be a burden. But they need support while \nthey work to get back on their feet and back on the job.\n  In this struggling economy, renewing these benefits is truly crucial. \nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said that renewing \nunemployment benefits is one of the most effective policy tools we have \nto boost the economy and get money in the pockets of consumers. So I am \nreally hopeful the Senate will act quickly, without political games, \nbecause failure to do so wouldn't just be devastating for the families \nwho count on this, it would also hurt many small businesses and \ncommunities to have the billions of dollars pulled away from consumers \nwho spend it every month on food and rent and clothing.\n  Last month's budget deal provided us with a glimmer of bipartisan \nhope coming into this new year. However, we have to continue working \ntogether to focus on improving the economy for middle-class Americans. \nWe cannot afford to allow this lifeline to be cut off.\n  The stories I shared today, like so many others, are heartbreaking, \nbut they also show the fierce determination exhibited by so many who \nare out of work in the struggle to get back on their feet. They are the \nstories of people who are applying for work far below their own \nqualifications, going back to school to earn the skills needed to \nchange careers or waking up every day to scour for jobs in their \ncommunities that all too often lack opportunity. I believe it is \nCongress that needs to match their determination and grit. We took an \nimportant first step today, and I know unemployed workers I have heard \nfrom are watching. Today's vote is a glimmer of hope for them. We can't \nlet it fade. We need to move on and pass this extension quickly, and \nthe House needs to follow suit.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in postcloture on the motion to \nproceed to S. 1845.\n\n\n                          Farm Bill Conference\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I congratulate Senator Reid, who I know \nworked extraordinarily hard to get the votes for this.\n  I read something someone wrote in the press, saying they are afraid \nthat Senator Reid didn't talk about these issues enough yesterday on \nthe floor. I would point out that you can either talk or do. I thought \nhe spoke quite well, but he basically spent the time lining up the \nvotes and won. A lot of people talk about what they want to do. Senator \nReid usually gets it accomplished. As one who has served here longer \nthan anybody else in this body, I would rather see people get things \ndone, and he did.\n  Speaking of things to get done in this new year, the farm bill \nremains as one of the Nation's top legislative priorities. Yet it has \nlanguished in Congress's in-box. As the Senate begins this new session, \nit is a relief--at last--to be able to say that there are new glimmers \nof hope that Congress is nearing the point of being able to complete \nwork on a farm bill.\n  We passed this farm bill twice in the Senate. I compliment the chair \nof the Agriculture Committee, Senator Stabenow. She brought together \nDemocrats and Republicans, many of us who served at one time or another \nas either chair or ranking member or both on that committee, and said: \nWhy don't we just do it the old-fashioned way? Instead of just talking \nabout it, why don't we actually sit down, write it, and bring something \nto the floor that can pass? We did, and it passed twice. While over in \nthe House, the bill languished for quite some time before they decided \nto move forward.\n  Chairwoman Stabenow and Chairman Lucas from the House worked \nthroughout the holiday break. My own staff, Adrienne Wojciechowski and \nRebekah Weber, have worked very hard with them to produce a bipartisan, \ncomprehensive bill that addresses the needs of farmers, families, \ncommunities, and taxpayers.\n  A farm bill is a dynamic element of our agriculture economy, and of \nour overall national economy. A farm bill touches every family, in ways \nlarge and small. It has now been more than 460 days since the last farm \nbill expired. That is well over a year ago. Since then, American \nfarmers have\n\n[[Page S45]]\n\nstruggled to make long-term planting decisions, and more than 20 \nprograms--such as those affecting organic certification cost-sharing, \nbeginning farmers, relief from livestock disasters, renewable energy, \nand rural small businesses--all have been stranded without funding. \nRural small businesses are a major part of my State and the Presiding \nOfficer's State. But every State has some rural area that is extremely \nimportant.\n  This farm bill limbo is part of a string of artificial made-by-\nCongress dilemmas. Farm bill limbo hurts not only farmers, but their \ncommunities, and our economy. It hampers efforts to help those who are \nstruggling the most in our communities, with food security for their \nfamilies. It holds us back from making greater gains toward energy \nsecurity.\n  Last month, the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives \nproposed a short farm bill extension. Short extensions are nothing new \nhere on Capitol Hill. Most of us know them by the term ``kicking the \ncan down the road.'' They patch things over from one crisis to the \nnext. But just as a temporary extension to fund government offers \nneither certainty nor meaningful change, a short extension of the farm \nbill would not provide farmers the certainty they need to plan, or \nfunding for stranded programs. Farming is a business, and saddling \nfarmers with this needless uncertainty makes their difficult work even \nmore difficult. Even worse, the proposed House extension would prolong \ndirect payment subsidies for another year, senselessly costing \ntaxpayers untold millions of dollars. At this point, the only \nacceptable path forward is to deliver a full, five-year, comprehensive \nfarm bill by the end of January. Moving forward on the farm bill not \nonly will avoid the so-called ``dairy cliff,'' but it also will help \nfamilies put food on the table, improve conservation efforts, support \nregional farming, and put an end to wasteful subsidies.\n  This farm bill marks the seventh time that I have served as a member \nof a Farm Bill Conference Committee. I know how difficult it is to \nbring complex, five-year bills to the floor and ultimately to final \npassage after a conference. I don't in any way diminish the difficulty \nin that. I know; I have been there, and I have done that.\n  While there have been many significant changes in agricultural policy \nsince the 1981 farm bill, which I had the privilege to write, one thing \nhas remained the same: No farm bill is easy, and no farm bill is \nperfect. But to finalize a farm bill, the Senate and House must work \ntogether to reach bipartisan agreement. It means, whether you are a \nRepublican or Democrat, forget the symbolism and start dealing with the \nsubstance. Stop rhetoric and go to reality.\n  The conference committee is making steady progress, and Chairwoman \nStabenow and Chairman Lucas deserve credit, and our appreciation, for \nworking closely together to bridge the wide differences between our two \nbills. The cuts it includes will not go unnoticed, as we have already \nseen spending reductions from the sequester, followed by the end of the \nRecovery Act nutrition benefits. We can talk here on the floor. We are \nall going to collect our paycheck every month. But we sometimes forget \nthese cuts and policy changes affect real people in real ways. So we \nhave to continue to do the best we can.\n  Speaking as a Vermonter, I would note that every farm bill is \nimportant to Vermont, just as every farm bill is important to every \nState represented in this body. Farm bills make real differences in our \nquality of life, and the fact that Congress every 5 years or so would \nrenew and pass a farm bill was once something Americans could take for \ngranted. This is the first time we have not been able to do so.\n  The delays have been unfortunate, and they have been needless. But I \nam increasingly hopeful that this recent dark chapter is coming to a \nclose. Farmers and families around the Nation are looking to us to pass \nforward-looking, fiscally responsible, and regionally sensitive food \nand farm policy--and the two have to be together, both the food and the \nfarm policy. Farmers have to be able to plan, but families have to \nknow, when their children go to school, they are going to be fed. Every \nteacher will tell you that a hungry child doesn't learn. If children \naren't learning, what are we doing for the next generation? That is our \nresponsibility.\n  Now is the time, without further delay, to enact a farm bill that \nwill strengthen the Nation and support the economy. I know we are up to \nthis challenge. We have done it twice already in this body, forging a \nbipartisan coalition. I am hoping the other body, notwithstanding some \nof the Republicans who tried to block it, will come forward and speak, \nnot just for a small part of one political party, but speak for all \nAmericans.\n  Before I yield, I ask unanimous consent that all the time during the \nrecess count postcloture on the motion to proceed to S. 1845.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, last month the President of the United \nStates gave a speech on what has come to be known by the code words \n``income inequality,'' which means different things to different \npeople. He also talked about a very important aspect of that, and that \nis upward income mobility. In other words, we want to make sure that \nsomebody who goes to work in a restaurant bussing tables can work their \nway up the income and education ladder to where they can actually own \ntheir own restaurant and create jobs and opportunities for other \npeople. The President called it ``the defining challenge of our time.''\n  Well, the timing, coming as it has, one might be forgiven from \nwondering whether the President and his allies want to change the \nsubject from ObamaCare. We know that the rollout of ObamaCare has been \nan unmitigated disaster, and, frankly, there is more to come. We can \ncertainly understand why the President might want to change the \nsubject. But while he is changing the subject, Republicans should \nembrace the challenge of discussing this: What are the policies that \nhave resulted in income inequality and insufficient upward mobility \nwhen it comes to jobs in America?\n  Of course, the President, you might predict, has talked about his \nproposed solutions, which are creating more government programs and \nmore spending, including up to $6 billion of money that we have to \nborrow from China and our other creditors just to extend the \nunemployment insurance program by 3 months. My question is: What \nhappens after that 3 months? I don't want to be rash, but I will make a \nprediction that the Democrats will say: We need another 3 months. After \nthat, they will say: We need another 3 months. Before you know it, \nunemployment insurance has been extended beyond the half-year mark, \nwhich is the basic program, to another full year beyond that at a cost \nof $25 billion.\n  Just to put all of this in context, the Federal Government spent $250 \nbillion for extended unemployment insurance benefits since 2008. Of \ncourse, the President did not mention some of the primary causes for \nincome inequality and the loss of upward mobility because he is \nresponsible for a lot of that, along with his allies. He failed to \nmention that under his administration America has suffered the longest \nperiod of high unemployment since the Great Depression, and he failed \nto mention his signature health care law. I mentioned that a moment \nago. He is trying to pivot to another subject, but inevitably we find \nourselves coming back to ObamaCare and its negative impact on job \ncreation and the 40-hour workweek.\n  We know that ObamaCare has done a number of things in the short \nperiod of time since it began the rollout, which was October 1st. \nMillions of people have lost their existing insurance coverage. In \nfact, more people have lost their insurance coverage than have\n\n[[Page S46]]\n\nsigned up for ObamaCare or even Medicaid. Then there is the issue of \nskyrocketing insurance premiums. So I thought the idea was: How do we \nmake health care more affordable? In fact, instead of making health \ncare better and more affordable, it has become less affordable.\n  We are not just talking about the insurance premiums, we are talking \nabout deductibles. We have all heard the stories of people signing up \non the ObamaCare exchanges only to find out: Yeah, they have health \ninsurance, but you know what, the first $5,000 per person is the \ndeductible, which effectively means--for all practical purposes--that \nperson is self-insured. That is a deal breaker for many hard-working \nmiddle-class Americans.\n  We know, of course, that even organized labor has complained about \nthe fact that ObamaCare has turned full-time work into part-time work. \nWhy is that? For employers who put their employees on a 30-hour \nworkweek, they are not required, under the law, to pay for health care \nbenefits. But if you have a full-time worker, you are required to pay \nfor health care benefits. So what is happening is that many employers \nare cutting people back from 40 hours to 30 hours with a commensurate \nloss of income.\n  Recently, I was in Tyler, TX, sitting around a table at a restaurant \nwhen one gentleman who owns a restaurant said that because of ObamaCare \none of the single moms who works in his restaurant lost her 40-hour \nworkweek job. He had to cut her down to 30 hours. So she had to get two \n30-hour jobs in order to get by. In other words, she now has to work 60 \nhours instead of working 40 hours, and obviously she is worried about \nthe lack of time she has with her children in addition to having lost \nher full-time job.\n  The President has also failed to mention a number of other items \nwhich have contributed to income inequality and the loss of upward \nmobility, such as the medical device tax that is a feature of \nObamaCare. In Texas we have a number of medical device companies that \ncame to see me after the ObamaCare legislation passed.\n  They said: We have a duty to our shareholders not to spend their \nmoney inefficiently, and so our only alternative is to expand our \nexisting facility in Costa Rica rather than in Texas. So the jobs that \nwould have been created in Texas effectively moved to Costa Rica \nbecause of the medical device tax. So much for job creation and \nreducing income inequality and enhancing upward mobility.\n  The President also declined to talk about his refusal to approve the \nKeystone XL Pipeline. Of course, this is a pipeline that would start in \nCanada and end up in Port Arthur, TX, in an area we call the Golden \nTriangle. We happen to have a lot of refineries there that can refine \nthat oil into gasoline, jet fuel, and other products for Americans \nconsumers.\n  The President promised the country he would make a decision by the \nend of 2013. I may have missed something during the holidays, but I \ndon't recall the President making any announcement whatsoever on the \nKeystone XL Pipeline. Not only would it produce thousands of good well-\npaying jobs, it would also produce a dependable supply of energy from a \nfriendly country--the nation of Canada.\n  What else did the President fail to mention in his income inequality \nand upward mobility speech? He failed to mention how the impact of his \nregulatory policies are piling hundreds of billions of dollars of \nadditional costs on small businesses.\n  For example, the small banks in Texas have told me that they have \nhired new people, but the people they hired are the people who help us \ncomply with the Dodd-Frank regulations. This bill--just to remind \neverybody--was filed to address the abuses on Wall Street that led to \nthe subprime loan crisis and collapse in 2008. As we now know, while \nWall Street was the target of Dodd-Frank and these regulations, Main \nStreet is the collateral damage. Yes, people are being hired but not \nfor the purpose of loaning more money and helping small businesses \nstart and grow their businesses but, rather, just to comply with new \ngovernment regulations.\n  What else did the President fail to mention in his discussion about \nthe lack of jobs and upward mobility? He failed to mention his proposed \ngreenhouse gas rules, which will kill jobs and drive up energy costs.\n  He failed to mention that during the so-called Obama economic \nrecovery--the President has now been President for 5 years. He can't \nblame this on George Bush anymore. But during the so-called Obama \neconomic recovery, real median household income has fallen more than \n$2,500. At the same time that real household median income has fallen \nby $2,500, households are finding that their health care insurance \ncosts have gone up by $2,500, for a net loss of $5,000 for most hard-\nworking American families.\n  The President has failed to acknowledge--in his discussion of slow \neconomic growth--high unemployment. He has failed to mention that the \neconomic recovery following the 2008 recession has been the weakest \nU.S. recovery since World War II.\n  Economists ordinarily say that after a recession there will be sort \nof a V-shaped recovery--once you hit the bottom, you come out of it \nvery quickly and the economy grows fast. Under the Obama recovery, that \nhas been flatlined to anemic growth, which is not fast enough or strong \nenough to hire more American workers.\n  Indeed, we have the lowest percentage of Americans actually in the \nworkforce in the last 30 years. What that means is that even though the \nunemployment rate is roughly 7 percent--that is on a national basis--\nmillions of people have simply dropped out of looking for a job because \nthey see the prospects for finding work so dim.\n  The President also failed to mention that his 2009 stimulus package--\nat that time you may remember that Speaker Pelosi said: Our goal is to \nmake timely, targeted, and temporary investments in government spending \nto help stimulate the economy and help bring down the unemployment \nrate.\n  The President later joked and said--we found out it wasn't a funny \njoke--that ``shovel ready'' didn't actually mean it was shovel ready, \nwhich was absolutely true. He failed to add that his 2009 stimulus \npackage added more than $1 trillion to the national debt, which now \nstands at $17.3 trillion. That is equivalent to more than $54,000 worth \nof debt for every man, woman, and child living in America today.\n  I don't think anyone in their right mind believes we can continue \ndown this same path of racking up more and more debt by borrowing more \nand more money without having some negative consequences at some point \nin the future. One thing we do know will occur is that the present \ngeneration that is racking up all of this debt will probably not be \naround to have to pay it back, but the next generation and beyond will.\n  If the President wants to have an honest debate about income \ninequality, he needs to be honest about his own record, and he needs to \ntalk about it in a holistic context.\n  A few months ago, the New York Times reported that the trend of \nrising inequality ``appears to have accelerated during the Obama \nadministration.'' Indeed, according to one measure of the income gap, \ninequality has increased about four times faster under President Obama \nthan it did under President George W. Bush.\n  Here is the reality: If we want to reduce income inequality, we need \nto boost economic growth. That is the debate we should be having and \nwhich this side of the aisle embraces--not how we can pay more \ngovernment benefits to people who can't find work or artificially fix \nthe price of wages. We need to figure a way to benefit the entire \ncountry by growing the economy.\n  Largely--at least where I come from--people say there are three \nthings that the Federal Government can do to help grow the economy: Get \nout of the way, get off our back, and get your hand out of our pocket. \nThose are three things the Federal Government could do which would help \nthe economy grow, create more opportunity, and deal with this issue of \nincome equality in an effective sort of way.\n  So we need to boost economic growth. That is the debate we should be \nhaving--how do we create more jobs, or actually how do we allow the \nprivate sector to create more jobs? We tried having the government \nspend borrowed money to create more jobs, and that did not turn out so \nwell. So now we need to figure a way to get out of the\n\n[[Page S47]]\n\nway so the private-sector economy can create the jobs that will put \nAmericans back to work and deal with this issue of income inequality \nonce and for all.\n  As we saw last night, instead of trying to actually solve the \nproblem, sometimes I am tempted to think that the majority leader and \nhis allies really want a political issue rather than a solution to the \nproblem, because we saw last night the majority leader was ready to \nhave a vote with 17 Senators missing because of the storms around the \ncountry. We know people could not get back because of cold weather and \nstorms and flight cancellations and the like, and I predict if we had \nhad the vote last night, the cloture vote that we had today would have \nfailed, and that would have fit very nicely into the majority leader's \nand the President's desire to change the subject from ObamaCare to \nRepublicans blocking this unemployment compensation bill.\n  It did not turn out that way because we had the vote here this \nmorning. We embrace the opportunity to talk about our progrowth \nalternatives, which will actually make life better for the American \npeople, not worse, as the policies of this administration have over the \nlast 5 years.\n  Basically, we know that the demand is this: to extend long-term \nunemployment benefits beyond the half year, which is the basic program, \nanother 3 months, and to put the entire $6.5 billion tab on our \nnational credit card. But I ask you, What is going to happen after 3 \nmonths? Will the President and his allies be back asking for another 3 \nmonths and another $6.5 billion in deficit spending that will be added \nto the debt? I think so. How about in 9 months? If we extend it for two \n3-month periods, we will be here for another one that will extend it to \n9 months and beyond, ad infinitum--$25 billion in added deficit and \ndebt spending--unless we solve the root of the problem.\n  Republicans would prefer that we offset any real extension with \nspending cuts that would make it revenue neutral. We would also like to \nreform the unemployment insurance program so it delivers better results \nto the unemployed.\n  For example, if there is one thing that most people who are \nunemployed need it is the opportunity for job skills training. We ought \nto make sure things such as Pell grants are available for people during \nthat 26-week period of time they are on unemployment, that they can go \nto a community college in their own town and learn new job skills, and \nso they do not have to be stuck in the same old position. They could \nlearn new job skills, which will open a whole new world of opportunity \nfor them when it comes to jobs.\n  Before I conclude, I want to mention a few numbers that help put the \nObama economy in perspective. According to the Joint Economic \nCommittee, the economy grew during the first 4 years of the Reagan \nadministration by 22.3 percent--22.3 percent. During the first 4 years \nof the Obama administration, it was about 9 percent--less than half. \nWhy is that? Why is it that the economy grew during the first 4 years \nof the Reagan administration by 22 percent; in the first 4 years of the \nObama administration by about 9.2 percent?\n  As I pointed out, there are some good reasons why this recovery has \nbeen anemic and so slow and why so many people are still struggling to \nfind work. If the Obama recovery had been as strong as the Reagan \nrecovery, we would have millions more private-sector jobs. Isn't that \nwhat we want? The recipients of unemployment insurance compensation do \nnot want to receive a government check. What they want is the dignity \nand the self-confidence and the opportunity to provide for their family \nthat comes with a good job. That is what is missing in this whole \nequation and this transparent political exercise to play gotcha at \ntheir expense.\n  We know it was President Reagan's economic strategies, combined with \npermanent, broad-based tax cuts and sensible regulatory policies that \nhelped grow the economy. By contrast, President Obama's strategy is to \ncombine massive tax increases--including the payroll tax, a year ago \nJanuary--with a regulatory bonanza. We do not have to speculate about \nwhat the impacts of President Obama's policies are. We are living with \nthem today.\n  So I would say to President Obama, if you really want to reduce \nincome inequality and promote upward mobility, we want to have that \nconversation. Let's get back to the policies, though, that have worked \nso well in the past, not those which have failed us and the American \npeople during the last 5 years. Let's put a stop to regulations that do \nnot pass a cost-benefit test. Let's do what we need to expand domestic \nenergy production and create jobs.\n  Do you know where the two lowest unemployment rates in the country \nare? Bismarck, ND, and Midland, TX, and that is because of the shale \nenergy renaissance that has created jobs. If you can pass a commercial \ndriver's license test, you can get a job driving a truck with a high \nschool degree in both of those places and earn between $75,000 and \n$100,000 a year; the lowest unemployment in the country but this \nadministration's policies have made it harder and harder for those jobs \nto be created, along with the Keystone Pipeline and the jobs that would \ncreate.\n  We need also to reform our Tax Code to encourage more investment. We \nneed to reward earned success so that small businesses can be started, \nso existing small businesses can expand. All of the President's \npolicies, including, of course, most notably, ObamaCare, have made that \nharder. We need to do what we can, as I said, to expand domestic energy \nproduction and create jobs. We need to reform unemployment insurance to \nget more people back into the workforce by making sure they have the \njob training they need to learn employable skills.\n  Then, of course, the subject that will not go away--notwithstanding \nthe President's most earnest desire--that is, we need to dismantle \nObamaCare before it does any more harm to our health care system and \nour broader economy. We need to replace it with more affordable \ncoverage that lets consumers keep the doctor they trust--a promise that \nObamaCare made, but a promise that has been broken, as too many people \nalready know.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I was just walking through the Chamber and I had the \nopportunity to visit with some of my colleagues in the back, and I \nheard what my colleague from Texas was saying, and I just want to add a \ncouple things, if I could. One is to say he is absolutely right in \nterms of the underlying problem here, which is a weak economy, and \nreally a historically weak economy. Never coming out of a recession \nhave we had a recovery this weak.\n  The Senator made that point well--that typically we go into a \nrecession in sort of a V formation. We go in and then come back out \nwith a relatively strong recovery from a relatively deep recession. \nThat certainly happened in 1981, where at this point in Ronald Reagan's \nrecovery we had created over 8 million new jobs. Unfortunately, we are \nnot creating the new jobs that we created in these other recoveries. As \na result, we do have these problems with folks who are both unemployed \nand long-term unemployed.\n  I think it is important to note that we now have historic levels of \nlong-term unemployment, people who have been out of work for more than \na half year, more than 26 weeks--the highest levels ever. So something \nis not working. It is different this time. I think what is not working \nis that some of our basic structural institutions--such as our tax \nsystem, our regulatory system, the regulations that have come from \nObamaCare, and so on--are adding more and more burdens to the economy.\n  The historic debt and deficits the Senator talked about are also \nadding to our economic woes. It is hurting the economy today, and it is \ncertainly unfair, I would say even immoral to put that burden on future \ngenerations. Some of the young people who are here today are going to \nget left holding the bag for the $17 trillion national debt we now \nhave--$145,000 for every family in Texas or Ohio.\n  So the Senator makes the right points. We have to get this economy \nmoving. There are some very specific policy proposals the Senator has \noutlined that we ought to turn to. The President has talked about tax \nreform, he has talked about regulatory relief,\n\n[[Page S48]]\n\nbut he has not delivered. If we do not get at those issues, we are not \ngoing to ultimately solve the problem.\n  But here we find ourselves within a few hours of having voted to \nproceed on a debate on whether we do extend unemployment insurance for \npeople for the next 3 months beyond the normal unemployment insurance \nthat would be out there. Most States provide about 6 months of \nunemployment insurance, about 26 weeks; some States a little more, some \nStates a little less. What we are talking about is how much do you add \nat the Federal level as emergency unemployment benefits? I did vote, \nalong with some of my other colleagues on both sides of the aisle, to \nproceed to this debate. As the Senator said earlier--I heard him--\nperhaps that was not what the majority leader was hoping for because \nmaybe he wanted more of a political issue. But I did so because I took \nto heart what was said on the other side of the aisle about the fact \nthat we are going to now have a debate.\n  I think this debate breaks down into a couple things. One is, how do \nyou deal with paying for this? Because, as we indicated, this economy \nis not going to grow until we deal with these historic levels of debt \nand deficit.\n  How ironic would it be if we were saying: We are going to help those \nwho are unemployed by making it harder to get the economy moving--by \nnot doing anything with regard to the debt and deficit, in fact, adding \nto it.\n  So what I am going to be filing is an amendment. It is a very simple \namendment that says let's pay for this extension for 3 months. I just \nheard my colleague from Texas saying he would support that. Others, I \nhope, on both sides will support this. The specific idea that we have \nis let's take the proposal out of the President's budget that says if \nyou are on Social Security disability and, therefore, not working, you, \nof course, should not be getting unemployment insurance. It is in the \nPresident's budget. I would also say trade adjustment assistance, of \ncourse, should not be available to you because you are not working by \ndefinition.\n  So it is basically tightening up some of the provisions in current \nlaw to make them work better. That provides the funding to be able to \nsay: OK, let's go ahead and extend unemployment insurance, but only for \na few months while we do sit down and work on these bigger problems \nthat the Senator from Texas has taken a lead on and talked about today. \nI hope that is where we will end up, that we will actually pay for this \nrather than adding to the burden and making the economy even weaker by \nadding to our deficit.\n  Second, I think we need to have an honest discussion, even in the \nnext couple of days here, as to how to make the unemployment system \nitself work better. Unemployment insurance, as has been noted, is not \nconnecting people to jobs. That is the reason we have these historic \nlevels of long-term unemployment.\n  The Senator mentioned the Pell grants, for instance, being available \nto people who are on unemployment insurance. That is incredibly \nimportant, but also having our worker retraining programs at the \nFederal level work better for those folks who are uninsured. I think we \nshould engage in that topic now--not only on how do we pay for this, \nbut how do we actually make the unemployment insurance system work for \nthe people who are unemployed?\n  The Federal Government spends over $15 billion a year in worker \nretraining programs--47 programs spread over 9 different departments \nand agencies. Often the right hand does not know what the left hand is \ndoing. The GAO, which looks at these issues--the General Accountability \nOffice--has said there is duplication in most of these programs, and \nonly a handful--four or five--are seeing the kind of performance \nmeasures you would want to have in a Federal program.\n  So there is a great opportunity here on a bipartisan basis for us to \nget those worker retraining programs working better and into the hands \nof the people who really need the retraining to match skills with jobs. \nIn Ohio--and I am sure the same is true in Texas--we have a lot of jobs \ngoing wanting right now. We have about 100,000 jobs available. We have \nabout 400,000 people out of work. How do you connect those? A big part \nof that is providing the skills to those workers to be able to access \nthose jobs that are available that do require a higher skill--maybe it \nis advanced manufacturing, maybe it is biotechnology.\n  The Federal Government is not providing that help right now. Those \nworker retraining skills that are needed are not being provided. So I \ndo think there is an opportunity here for us to pay for this, to be \nsure we are not adding to the debt and deficit, at a time when the \neconomy is too weak already, and, second, to provide the skills workers \nneed--Pell grants and so on--to actually give people some hope and give \npeople some additional tools to be able to access this economy and \nthese jobs that are available and get this economy moving again.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Before the distinguished Senator from Ohio leaves the \nfloor, I did not know he was coming down, but I am delighted he did. \nNot only is he an expert and former Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget, distinguished Member of the House, now the \nSenate, and a great new addition since 2010, he understands these \nissues, particularly the fiscal issues, better than most of us.\n  But the Senator makes a very important point. I am worried, based on \nwhat the majority leader did last night, that they preferred to have a \n``gotcha'' moment, have the bill fail at the very outset, rather than \nhave a fulsome debate and a realistic discussion about what the \nalternatives are to basically permanently paying people not to work, \nthrough virtually a permanent extension of unemployment.\n  More than most people, the Senator from Ohio, when he came to this \nChamber, said what we need is a jobs program. So he advocated among \nthose in our Republican conference. He said: We need a positive program \nfor how do we facilitate the economy, the private sector, creating \nthose jobs. Of course, he described the amendment that he intends to \noffer on this bill, not only to pay for this 3-month extension, which \nwould be a welcome measure, but also to reform the unemployment system \nso that people can learn skills that actually match them with the jobs \nthat do exist.\n  I would add, while the Senator is on the floor, that as he knows, \nthere are a lot of other good ideas that will be offered this week by \nthis side of the aisle, but it is entirely dependent upon the majority \nleader allowing that sort of fulsome debate and those ideas to come to \nthe floor and be available for a vote, things such as the Forty Hours \nIs Full Time Act that Senator Collins has promoted, the medical device \ntax which I talked about, the repeal sponsored--the chief sponsor, \nSenator Hatch of Utah.\n  Senator Barrasso from Wyoming has got one that would repeal the \nhealth insurance tax from ObamaCare, which is a direct passthrough to \nconsumers. Senator Paul, Senator McConnell have their economic freedom \nzones idea to help blighted areas where unemployment is high, and to \ncreate a way for the private sector to be incentivized to come in and \nstart jobs and to create opportunity.\n  We have got regulatory reform bills and proposals. We have got the \nKeystone XL Pipeline idea. I know Senator Lee and Senator Rubio have \nboth recently come up with some very visionary ideas about how do we \nfight the war on poverty in a realistic sort of way. But my point is \nthat whether we are going to get into that debate and give a full and \nfair consideration of all of these ideas about how to solve this \nproblem depends on the majority leader allowing amendments to be \noffered and voted on.\n  I would ask the Senator from Ohio what his expectation is in that \nregard, and what the consequences would be if the majority leader \ndecides to deny any amendments and basically shut down this process?\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I appreciate the Senator yielding. I would say that \nhaving listened to some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nspeak earlier today prior to the vote about what their intentions were, \nincluding one of the authors of the legislation, and one of the leaders \nin the Senate, it seems to me they are interested in a debate. They \nencouraged those from the Republican side to vote yes on the motion to \nproceed, with the understanding that there would be the opportunity \nthen to at least discuss these issues\n\n[[Page S49]]\n\nand to therefore offer amendments and to have what the Senate typically \nhas had over the years, which is the opportunity for some give-and-\ntake, and the opportunity to have voices heard, people representing \nboth the States on the Democratic side and the Republican side of the \naisle. So I am hopeful we will have that debate. That is my \nexpectation.\n  I plan to file an amendment to pay for the unemployment insurance \nextension, and I know a lot of support will come from both sides of the \naisle for that. I also hope to be able to offer other amendments that \nhave to do with growing the economy in a more direct way. The Senator \nmentioned regulatory reform, for instance.\n  We have bipartisan proposals on this side of the aisle that are \nintended to take the unemployment situation and deal with it in a \nbroader context of reducing the burdens on small businesses, for \ninstance. When you try to get a permit, for instance, from the Federal \nGovernment right now, sometimes with an energy project, sometimes there \nare as many as 34 different permits you have to obtain. That is one \nreason we are not seeing investment in some of the energy projects we \nwould like to see. It is a great potential for our economy right now. \nWe can make the potential even greater and achieve it if we can do \nsomething on the regulatory reform side. So these are all issues that \nought to be part of the broader discussion as to how to increase \neconomic growth and therefore to increase jobs and opportunity for \npeople who find themselves unemployed and are looking for those job \nskills and are looking for the jobs that are open.\n  I look forward to that debate over the next few days. That is \ncertainly my expectation. I hope that Members on both sides would come \ndown to the well and offer their amendments, have them voted up or down \nin the great tradition of the Senate.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Senator for responding to that question.\n  I would point out, in conclusion, that this bill extends unemployment \nbenefits for 3 months at a cost of $6.5 billion, right now which is \nunpaid for. But if the amendment of the Senator from Ohio is adopted, \nthere is the solution to that problem, along with reform of the job \ntraining components of our current unemployment compensation system.\n  But if we are unable to have this broader debate, we will find \nourselves right back here in 3 more months because none of the \nunderlying problems, of which high unemployment and low growth are \nsymptoms, will have been addressed. So what I hope--and I would love to \nbe optimistic about the majority leader's willingness to allow those \namendments and allow those votes and have that fulsome debate. If he \ndoes not, then we have had a 3-month patch and we will be right back \nhere with the same problems confronting us, with the underlying \nsymptoms of an anemic economy, with slow economic growth and high \nunemployment.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. I rise today on behalf of over 37,000 unemployed \nNebraskans and nearly 21 million Americans who are searching for work. \nThe vast majority of these men and women are jobless through no fault \nof their own. They are the real-life casualties of failed Washington \npolicies. They are our friends, our neighbors, and in many cases they \nare our family members. They are decent people, and they are desperate \nto regain the dignity of a full day of labor.\n  We have had 5 years of economic fits and starts--glimmers of hope \ndashed by the harsh reality of persistent economic headwinds. But the \nweak job reports and the Pollyanna claims of recovery don't tell the \nfull story. Our real unemployment rate or the total percentage of \nunemployed and underemployed workers tops 13 percent, significantly \nhigher than the 7 percent reported by the Department of Labor in \nNovember. That is nearly 21 million people out of work. At the same \ntime our labor force participation rate is at 63 percent, a near 35-\nyear low.\n  The greatness of a nation cannot endure without work for its people. \nIt is not only about putting food on the table. It is about the ability \nof families to buy a home, to save for their kids' college education, \nand to retire with a modest nest egg. It is about hard-working moms and \ndads in need of the simple assurance that their government isn't going \nto pass laws that intentionally make life harder for them.\n  I am interested in promoting thoughtful economic policies that \nincrease employment opportunities and make life a little bit easier for \nour people. But instead of a laser focus on job creation, politicians \nin Washington seem to pivot from issue to issue, frantically chasing \nthe topic du jour. Jobless Americans aren't interested in who is to \nblame; they are interested in who is going to fix this mess and how.\n  Congress has returned to Washington for a new year, a new chance to \ntake on daunting challenges, such as joblessness in America. We have \nall been informed by the media and the so-called wise men of Washington \nthat 2014 will be a year in which very little is accomplished. The \npundits point to election-year politicking, and some Members are \nfretting about taking those very tough votes. There is no will for \naction, they say. There is no chance for any kind of compromise, they \nclaim.\n  The 21 million Americans without jobs are counting on us to do our \njob. They expect and they demand that we do better. Promoting policies \nto create jobs is not election-year rhetoric; it is the duty of the \npeople's government.\n  The best way to support the unemployed is not to just extend the \nbenefits; we need to grow the economy, and we need to provide paychecks \nfor families.\n  Lately, there has been a lot of talk about income inequality or the \nneed to bridge the gap between rich and poor. Some argue that deficit \nspending is the way to go, while others insist on increasing the \nminimum wage.\n  Arthur Brooks, the president of the American Enterprise Institute, \noffers a different take on how to best conquer the income divide. In a \nJuly 31, 2013, opinion piece published in the Wall Street Journal, \nBrooks notes:\n\n       Again and again, the president offers a higher minimum wage \n     as a solution. Yet as the overwhelming majority of economists \n     have argued for decades, the minimum wage actually harms the \n     poorest and most marginalized workers--those with the most \n     tenuous grip on their jobs.\n       In January, a study from the National Bureau of Economic \n     Research surveyed the most recent studies and concluded: \n     ``The evidence still shows that minimum wages pose a tradeoff \n     of higher wages for some, against job losses for others.''\n\n  Brooks continues:\n\n       The story for strivers and entrepreneurs is no better. \n     Scott Shane of Case Western Reserve University has shown that \n     business formation fell by 17.3% between 2007 and 2009. \n     Launching a business is never a walk in the park, especially \n     given the explosion of red tape at all levels of government.\n       While it is still possible for the educated and \n     comfortable, government bureaucracy can crush \n     entrepreneurship entirely for those at the bottom of the \n     income scale.\n       As a pro-poor rule of thumb, I suggest this: If you want to \n     start a landscaping business, all you should need is a lawn \n     mower, not an accountant and a lawyer to help you hack \n     through all the red tape before setting up shop.\n\n  I think Brooks is right.\n  Regulatory overreach is also holding back American business. \nRegulations can be helpful. They ensure the health and safety of \nAmericans. However, overregulation places unnecessary burdens on small \nbusiness owners, and it does stifle economic growth. A homebuilder in \nNebraska once told me that he was fined $7,000 for leaning a ladder \nagainst a wall.\n  There is solid legislation out there to address the rampant redtape. \nHere are a few examples.\n  The Regulatory Responsibility for our Economy Act of 2013 is a bill \nthat was introduced by Senator Pat Roberts that I am cosponsoring. It \nrequires the executive branch to repeal duplicative and onerous rules \ncurrently hindering our Nation's job creators. It also requires Federal \nagencies to modify, streamline, or repeal significant regulatory \nactions that are unnecessary or overly burdensome. The legislation \nensures that regulations put forth by the administration account for \ntheir economic impact on American businesses. It ensures stakeholder \ninput and promotes innovation.\n\n[[Page S50]]\n\n  These simple commonsense policies are a good start toward relieving \nbusiness owners of some of the unnecessary challenges they face in \nthese already difficult economic times. I believe and I know many \nNebraskans believe that executive agencies should be held accountable \nfor the rules they put in place which directly affect our economic \ngrowth and our job creation.\n  Another key way we can spur economic growth is through broad-based \ntax reform. Our current tax system is arcane and riddled with loopholes \nfor special interests from the eighties. It is time that we simplify \nour Tax Code so that we can encourage progrowth behavior.\n  Whenever I travel in my State and I meet with Nebraska's business \nowners, both large and small, I hear the same message over and over: We \nneed more certainty. We need more certainty.\n  They need more certainty in the Tax Code, they need more certainty in \nhealth care, and they need more certainty in the regulatory \nenvironment. A business cannot grow today if it cannot adequately \npredict its needs for tomorrow.\n  This is especially true for small business owners, who are \nresponsible for 64 percent of all net new private sector jobs. Jobs \nwill come when these entrepreneurs have confidence that the bureaucrats \nare going to get off their backs. Jobs won't come from just another DC \nGovernment program.\n  I believe we must shift the focus of economic growth from government-\ndriven regulation to private sector innovation. The great government-\ncontrolled experiment has failed us yet again, so it is time for a \nchange of course.\n  There is no shortage of good ideas out there. My colleagues and I \nhave introduced dozens of bills to directly address job creation by \nrepealing specific regulations, preventing new burdensome mandates, and \nencouraging a fairer tax system. But so far we haven't had any form of \nmeaningful debate. Why? Why can't we debate in this body in a \nmeaningful way? I believe it is because we are restricted in this \nSenate by what we can actually vote on. It is a radical form of \ncontrol, and we are tired of it. Rather than allowing an open amendment \nprocess, the majority leader has locked this place down. We hear \nconstant calls to end obstruction, but if we are being honest, we would \nall acknowledge that the primary obstruction here is in the broken, \nnonexistent amendment process.\n  My friend and colleague Senator Coburn recently noted in the Wall \nStreet Journal:\n\n       Mr. Reid had already used Senate rules to cut off debate \n     and prevent the minority from offering amendments 78 times--\n     more than all other Senate majority leaders combined.\n\n  Why?\n  It appears designed to advance a partisan political agenda--show \nvotes in an election year. In other words, let's airdrop bills on the \nfloor and prevent any form of modification or improvement. That seems \nto be routine business around here these days, and it is shameful.\n  It is my hope that in this new year all thoughtful ideas will get a \nvote. It is my hope that in this new year we will actually get a chance \nto amend bills. That is the only way we can actually pass legislation \nto improve the lives of the American people.\n  I look forward to putting forth my own proposals to fulfill my duty \nto the people of Nebraska to get our friends and our neighbors back to \nwork. Rather than focusing on issues that divide us, I hope my \ncolleagues, Republicans and Democrats, will come together to support \npolicies that promote opportunities for all.\n  Show votes might make for good election-year politics, but make no \nmistake--they are bad policy. And unfortunately it is ``we the people'' \nwho pay the steep price for politics over policy.\n  I am excited for another year here in the Senate where I can \nrepresent my friends and neighbors, Nebraskans from back home, and I \nlook forward to helping put Americans back to work in the year ahead. \nOur citizens send us here to do a job and they are counting on us, so \nlet's not let them down.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, the Chair and I earlier today were \npart of a historic majority--a very bipartisan majority--that voted 60 \nto 37 to extend unemployment insurance for millions of Americans across \nthis country who are struggling to make ends meet, to keep their \nfamilies together, to keep a roof over their heads--basic essentials \nnot only to continue living but to continue searching for work. These \nAmericans are not without a work ethic. In fact, they are devastated by \nbeing out of work for so long with such destructive results for their \nsense of self-worth and their family.\n  This measure is limited in its scope and significance. It is only a \nprocedural vote on a temporary measure for 3 months, and only a partial \nsolution to the grave and pressing issue of putting Americans back to \nwork, restoring employment for Americans who want to work and keep \ntheir families together, but it is profoundly important.\n  I want to thank my colleagues, Senators Reed of Rhode Island and \nHeller of Nevada, as well as all of our colleagues who voted for it, \nand even many of my colleagues who may have voted against it but were \ntorn and, hopefully, will vote for it on final passage. I urge all my \ncolleagues to get this job done so we can send it to the House of \nRepresentatives and make sure it is approved there.\n  What is significant about this measure is in fact it was bipartisan. \nIt was overwhelming. It shows Congress is listening; that it is heeding \nthe calls for action from those 4 million Americans, including over \n60,000 of them in my home State of Connecticut, who need this measure \nso they can continue seeking work, hopefully successfully.\n  It is a temporary fix, but it is a measure with profound significance \nfor those men and women who courageously are facing the searing facts \nof life during long-term joblessness. One of those individuals, in \nfact, from Connecticut, very courageously appeared with the President \nearlier today. Katherine Hackett of Moodus, CT, is the parent of two \nsons in the military, who herself is struggling to keep the heat on and \nput food on her table. She described her situation in introducing \nPresident Obama when he spoke about this problem earlier today. I am \nproud she is at the forefront of this fight, and I am proud to be \nfighting with her so that Americans have the benefit of unemployment \ninsurance when they are unemployed for longer than the 26 weeks that is \nrecognized under the statute.\n  This story is one of numbers. We can't deny the statistics. The great \nrecession may have ended for a lot of Americans, but it continues for \nthe unemployed, the jobless, particularly long-term jobless. Those \nnumbers have become almost mind-numbing, but they are very significant. \nAccording to a report recently released by the Joint Economic \nCommittee, 3 years after the recession ending in 1991, long-term \nunemployment was at 1.3 percent. Three years after the recession ending \nin 2001, long-term unemployment was also at 1.3 percent. Today, long-\nterm unemployment is double those numbers, at 2.6 percent.\n  Here we are, 4 years after the supposed end of the recession in 2009 \nwith double the percentage of long-term unemployed that we had in \nprevious recessions. Our economy simply is not growing fast enough or \ncreating enough jobs to end that persistently high rate of long-term \nunemployment. About 4 million Americans, more than one-third of \nunemployed Americans, have been looking for work for 6 months or more.\n  In my home State of Connecticut, long-term unemployment has become \neven more prevalent among those who have lost their jobs. In fact, 43.6 \npercent, or almost half of Connecticut's overall unemployed population, \nare long-term unemployed. That means over 60,000 people.\n  But those numbers are less convincing and compelling than the human \nstories. I was proud and moved to sit with a number of my fellow \nConnecticut citizens--hard-working, dedicated people of all ages, some \nof whom have spent lifetimes working for a single employer only to find \nthemselves rejected and released. Many of them told me they expected to \nfind work right away, within a couple of weeks, and here they are--more \nthan 6 months later, many of them--still struggling to find work and \nworking to improve\n\n[[Page S51]]\n\ntheir skills so they can match the job opportunities that may exist.\n  Rosa Dicker, who has been out of work for almost a year, is a former \nhealth insurance project manager who also has experience with health \ncare reform implementation in Massachusetts, our neighboring State. \nRosa has sent out 500 job applications in the past year. I almost \nmisstated that figure. I thought it was 50. It is 500 job applications \nin the past year. And she has been granted how many interviews? She has \ninterviewed three times.\n  Nyrsa Cruz, an experienced social worker with a master's degree, has \nalso been unemployed since early 2013. Despite hours and hours she has \ndevoted to countless job applications, she has been unable to find \nwork.\n  Michael Kubica, unemployed after years of experience in the insurance \nand publishing industries, went back to school to pursue an MBA. Yet \ndespite his educational experience, despite his degrees, despite his \ndedication, he has been unable to secure more than temporary holiday \nseason work.\n  Anyone who suggests the long-term unemployed are somehow content or \nhave decided to stay out of work or have abandoned the search ought to \ntalk to people in their own communities--people such as Rosa, Nyrsa, or \nMichael, who have struggled and worked to find suitable jobs. They are \ndriven, passionate, and absolutely dedicated.\n  One woman I met, Erin London, described it this way:\n\n       My whole family is impacted. My son asks, ``Am I going to \n     be able to go to college?'' I don't know how to answer. I \n     don't want him to know I am scared.\n\n  Imagine yourself as a parent thinking--and we have all thought it--I \ndon't want him or her to know I am scared.\n  Another Connecticut woman, Alicia Nesbitt, was proud to be working \nand to have worked continuously since the age of 16, until she was \nunemployed. Now she depends on food stamps and heating assistance.\n\n  These stories are powerful and compelling, even more so than the \nnumbers and statistics, shocking as they are. I hope we will heed those \nhuman stories when we come back tomorrow and the next day to vote on \nthis bill.\n  In the long term we need measures such as targeted tax credits and \nskills training so people can be matched with jobs and so they can \nprepare for the jobs of the future. Pathways Back to Work is a bill I \nhave introduced that supports creation of new jobs as well as training \nfor the ones that exist. I have introduced it with my colleagues \nSenators Murphy and Gillibrand, and I think it would do a great deal to \naddress the fundamental underlying challenges that are keeping \nunemployed people from reconnecting with the world of work. But these \nmeasures are for next week or the week after. Right now, the urgency of \nthis week is passing a measure that is fundamentally important to keep \npeople moving forward, searching for work, and to keep our economy \nmoving forward.\n  Those folks who receive unemployment insurance use it to buy clothes \nor food or a car that drives the economy, provides for the kinds of \nconsumer demand we need to enable our economy to continue moving \nforward. So we are helping these folks avoid the precipice of poverty \nand homelessness, which makes their job search even more difficult, but \nwe are also helping our economy. All of us who want job creation and \neconomic progress want it to be our Nation's priority and success.\n  I am proud to stand and join Senators Reed and Heller, and thank also \nour majority leader Senator Reid for their leadership, because our most \nurgent task is to move our economy forward, provide these unemployment \nbenefits as soon as possible, and then look toward more permanent \nmeasures--skills training, the Pathways Back to Work Act, veterans \nprograms that will enable all Americans to enjoy more equally the \nbenefits of the greatest nation in the history of the world.\n  The challenge of our growing inequality is also our growing inequity. \nThis measure is a start--a temporary, limited start--in the right \ndirection toward making America fulfill its great promise for the \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today, and as I do \nso, Washington has an incredible opportunity for a new beginning--a \nbeginning that would begin by listening to the American people and what \nthe American people want, and not just what Washington and the \nDemocrats in this body think is best for all the American people.\n  According to a new Associated Press poll, most Americans say health \ncare reform is the top issue they want the government to work on this \nyear--the top issue they want government to work on this year. Fifty-\ntwo percent of people have said that is what they are asking us to work \non.\n  People have seen--and I heard about this all around Wyoming over the \nChristmas holiday--the complete failure of the health care law's big \nrollout last year. They saw President Obama and they saw Washington \nDemocrats break one promise after another. As a matter of fact, one of \nthe President's promises was designated ``the lie of the year.'' The \nAmerican people have lost faith this administration can ever get health \ncare reform right.\n  It wasn't just a bad Web site. The President said: Well, the Web site \nwas bad. He said: The health care law is more than a Web site.\n  In spite of what the Obama administration has said, it wasn't all \nfixed last year because the Web site is just the tip of the iceberg. \nAnd huge Web site failures? Absolutely. I heard it everywhere I went \naround Wyoming, and I actually even heard it brought up when I was in \nAfghanistan visiting the troops on New Year's Day.\n  So it is not just the Web site, with the higher premiums, canceled \ncoverage, can't keep your doctor, fraud and identity theft, higher \ncopays and higher deductibles; the Web site continues to be just the \ntip of the iceberg.\n  Beyond all of those things we have been talking about coming down the \nline and hitting the American people, we have also seen even more \nproblems surface already this year.\n  Here is a headline from the Wall Street Journal, January 3: \n``Consumers Hit Snags as Health Law Kicks In.'' The snags? We can \nimagine what they are. People have been going to the doctor, going to \nthe pharmacy looking for help, and even though they signed up for \ninsurance in the new exchange, it turns out they can't be found. They \nare not in the system.\n  So Web site failures? Absolutely. Insurance companies aren't sure who \nis signed up with them. People aren't sure if they are covered. Doctors \naren't sure who is covered.\n  Doctors, as a result of their training, their compassion, their care \nfor human beings, are trying their best to help their patients. They \nhave been fighting a losing battle against the exchanges and all of the \nproblems with the new Washington-mandated health insurance. One Chicago \ndoctor tried for 2 hours to verify the new insurance for a patient who \nwas scheduled for surgery. The office manager finally gave up. The \ndoctor went ahead with the surgery without what should have been a \nroutine approval from the insurance company.\n  Here is another problem some people are going to have to deal with \nthis year. The Associated Press ran an article headlined ``Adding a \nbaby to health plan is not easy.'' Every day, babies are born and need \nto be included in the family's health plan. For common life changes \nsuch as having a baby, you would normally just call your insurance \ncompany and they would take care of it from there. Not under this law. \nIf you have to buy your insurance through one of the new health care \nexchanges, it is not that simple. According to the article, ``the \nHealthCare.gov website can't handle new baby updates, along with a list \nof other life changes including marriage and divorce, a death in the \nfamily, a new job or a change in income, even moving to a different \ncommunity.'' Yet the Obama administration and the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services says the Web site is fixed. It can't handle a baby \nbeing born, marriage, divorce, moving, change in income. It can't \nhandle any of those things, and they claim it is fixed.\n  Here is another problem that has turned up. Washington Democrats said \nthe law would lead to fewer people visiting emergency rooms--I heard it \nright here on this floor: fewer people getting their care in emergency\n\n[[Page S52]]\n\nrooms--and that would reduce expenses. The reality is very different. \nThe New York Times, Friday morning, January 3: ``Emergency Visits Seen \nIncreasing With Health Law. Doubt Cast on Savings.'' But Democrats on \nthis floor said that emergency visits would decrease and that it would \nsave money. That is not what the New York Times says. They said, \n``Oregon Medicaid Test at Hospitals Found Rise of 40 Percent.'' The \nWall Street Journal, in the same issue, talks about how the Medicaid \nexpansion drives up emergency room visits. The Washington Post said, \n``Study: Expanding Medicaid Doesn't Reduce ER trips. It increases \nthem.''\n  Democrats don't want to talk about all these problems. They don't \nwant to talk about all of the reform bills which Republicans passed in \nthe House last year but which never got a vote in the Senate in spite \nof our efforts to try to get votes on those bills. Democrats hope \npeople believe what they are saying, accept their claims that the Web \nsite is working fine and that all the law's problems have been fixed. \nThe American people see through this. They know that what has been done \nto them by this administration is not right.\n  It is time for Washington Democrats to play it straight with the \nAmerican people and to make a new beginning on health care reform. I am \nnot talking about more fake fixes like the one we saw right before \nChristmas. That was the Obama administration quietly announcing that \npeople whose insurance had been canceled because of the law could apply \nfor a hardship exemption to avoid the individual mandate.\n  Well, the newer numbers have come out. There are now more than 5 \nmillion health insurance cancellations in 35 States. And we don't even \nknow how many were canceled in Texas, Ohio, Virginia, South Carolina, \nMissouri, and Wisconsin. We don't know those numbers yet. So we know \nthat a minimum of 5 million people have received cancellation notices \nand the anxiety that comes with that, as well as the anger. When people \ntried to replace the plans they lost, many found that their premiums \nwould skyrocket and their deductibles would be higher than ever.\n  I find it interesting that Democrats I have talked to said: Well, \nJanuary 1 has come, so the numbers aren't going to go up anymore. That \nis just not true. I was just in my office and got off the phone with a \nfriend in Douglas, WY. He is a pharmacist and provides health insurance \nfor employees. He has fewer than 50 employees, so it is not mandatory \nunder the law that he do so, but he does it anyway and he has done it \nfor years. But Gary is in a situation where he has now received a \nletter of cancellation of his own insurance policy, and it was dated \nJanuary 1. This is not something from last year; this is something \ndated January 1, 2014. It is a letter from the Madison National Life \nInsurance Company to Gary Shatto at Shatto's Frontier Drug in Douglas, \nWY.\n  ``Important Notice.'' Can you imagine getting this letter and opening \nit? ``Important Notice'' in bold print. ``This Affects Your Insurance \nContract Rights. Please Read Carefully.'' That would get your \nattention.\n\n       This notice is to inform your company that Madison National \n     Life Insurance Company . . . will be exiting the employer \n     small group major medical insurance market in Wyoming \n     effective June 30, 2014 at midnight.\n\n  Exiting June 30, 2014, at midnight.\n  So what this tells us is these numbers are going to go up because, at \n3,000, the numbers in Wyoming are such that we know more people are \ngoing to get cancellation notices. And this isn't just for Gary; this \nis for everybody who works there.\n  They ``will be exiting the employer small group major medical \ninsurance market in Wyoming effective June 30, 2014 at midnight. This \ndecision was prompted by the increased regulation since the federal \ngovernment's passage of its recent federal health care reform, commonly \nreferred to as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \n(``PPACA'').\n  ``The increased regulation will make it difficult for Madison \nNational to continue to operate and compete meaningfully in Wyoming's \nsmall group major medical market. As such, your referenced insurance \ncoverage will terminate at midnight on June 30, 2014.''\n  This is what people are going to continue to deal with, letters like \nthis continuing to go out, a new round of letters going out January 1.\n  The President of the United States needs to be honest with the \nAmerican people about the significant damage his health care law is \ndoing to families all across the country. And as the employer mandate--\nwhich the President has delayed for a year--kicks in this year, we are \ngoing to see more and more letters like this and more and more people \ndumped, losing their insurance, in spite of the President's claim that \n``if you like your coverage, you can keep your coverage.'' No wonder \nthe folks who look into these things have labeled it the ``lie of the \nyear.''\n  The White House continues to try to do this little bandaid approach. \nNow they say they are going to let some Americans buy catastrophic \ncoverage. That is an idea I proposed to the President at the White \nHouse health care roundtable back in February of 2010. After 25 years \nof practicing medicine, I know that for some people catastrophic \ncoverage is the right option. For many people it is, and it encourages \npatients to be smart consumers of medical services. But at our meeting \n4 years ago President Obama said that these plans were suitable only \nfor the wealthy, that they weren't good ideas. He said that letting \npeople be smarter consumers wouldn't help. Now he has changed his mind.\n  Don't expect him to admit that Republicans were right all along. The \nPresident said: Well, the Republicans have no ideas. If they have some \nideas, they can bring them to him. There were a number of different \nbills and proposals by Republicans. The President seems to want to \nignore that just as much as he wants to ignore the problems and the \nmisery his health care law has caused for so many people all around the \ncountry.\n  Instead of trying to patch this terrible health care law together \nwith chicken wire and duct tape, it is time for Democrats in Washington \nto admit that this entire law is failing the American people because it \nabsolutely hurts so many American families. Then we can move on to \ntalking about real reforms to give people access to quality, affordable \nhealth care. That is the year's top priority of the American people, \nand it needs to be our top priority in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nEmergency Unemployment Compensation Extension Act. That would be S. \n1845. This is legislation that will continue to be a critical safety \nnet for workers who have fallen on tough times through no fault of \ntheir own. Just a few short hours ago, as you know, the Senate sent a \nstrong message by voting to move forward on this vital legislation to \nrestore unemployment insurance for the more than 1 million Americans \nwhose benefits expired on December 28.\n  I wish to thank Senator Jack Reed and Senator Heller for their \nbipartisan leadership on this issue. This is a very important step in \nproviding economic security for the millions of Americans who lost \ntheir unemployment benefits at the end of the year or who will lose \nthem this year if Congress does not act.\n  By helping people to stay on their feet after an unexpected job loss, \nunemployment insurance has kept millions of Americans out of poverty. \nRather than removing the safety net these people rely on, we should be \nfocused on policies that help the long-term unemployed get back to \nwork, including the help that will allow them to pay their rent and \nfill their gas tanks while they are searching for jobs.\n  Yesterday I released the Joint Economic Committee report making the \neconomic case for extending the Federal support for our unemployment \ninsurance, designed to keep long-term unemployed Americans above water \nas they search for work. Approximately 1.3 million workers, as we know, \nlost their unemployment benefits on December 28. Barring Congressional \naction, benefits will expire for an additional 3.6 million over the \nnext year. In\n\n[[Page S53]]\n\nmy home State of Minnesota, roughly 8,500 people lost benefits at the \nend of last year and about 65,000 Minnesotans will lose benefits by the \nend of December of 2014.\n  These are people who may have had a plant close in their town. Maybe \ntheir position was eliminated and no one is hiring. Either way, these \nare people who have been paying into the system for their working lives \nand we need to see them through to their next job.\n  This is especially important at a time of stubbornly high long-term \nunemployment. For most Americans, State-funded unemployment insurance \nlasts 26 weeks. Yet the average unemployment spell lasts 10 weeks \nlonger. In 2008, as our country went into the worst downturn since the \nGreat Depression, Congress authorized Federal support for extended \nunemployment benefits for those who were out of work for more than 26 \nweeks. For people struggling to find work during those dark days, the \nextension was a lifeline. For the millions of Americans still searching \nfor work as our economy recovers, it is a critical safety net.\n  Our economy, as we know, has come a long way since the downturn \nbegan, with the national unemployment rate now lower than it has been \nin 5 years. In my home State of Minnesota we are doing even better. The \nunemployment rate is more than two points below the national average. \nWe are proud of that for our businesses. We are proud of that for our \nworkers.\n  But there is a problem that remains. While the overall workforce is \ngrowing stronger every day, we are still facing significant challenges \nwith long-term unemployment. At 2.6 percent, that is people long-term \nunemployed more than 6 months, it is more than twice what it was when \nCongress last allowed Federal unemployment insurance to expire after \nthe recessions of 1990-1991 and 2001. In fact, in our report we have a \ngraph that shows that literally this unemployment rate we are facing \nnow for the long-term unemployed is twice what it has been in any other \nyear when we faced a decision in Congress and decided in fact to \nterminate those benefits.\n  Literally, that long-term unemployment rate is now twice what it was \nin those other years. That is why there is so much concern about \nstopping the benefits at this point.\n  In Minnesota, our long-term unemployment rate is 1.4 percent, much \nbetter than it is in many States in the country, but too many Minnesota \ncommunities are still hurting, with unemployment rates reaching as high \nas 9.5 percent in Clearwater County in Minnesota.\n  Given the numbers, Federal support for unemployment insurance is more \nimportant than ever for the long-term unemployed. Extending this \ncritical safety net is fair. American families, struggling against \nlong-term unemployment, are working hard to find a job, to put food on \nthe table, to pay their bills. They are not exactly the ones who have \nseen the upturn from the stock market that many people have seen in the \nlast years. They are not the ones who have seen their stocks rise. They \ndon't have stocks. They are just trying to put food on the table for \ntheir families. They are not faceless, nameless charity cases. They are \nour neighbors, they are our family members, and they are our friends. \nIn fact, nearly one out of every five Americans has either received or \nis living with someone who has received Federal unemployment benefits \nsince 2008. That is 69 million people. Almost 24 million long-term \nunemployed workers have directly benefited and another 45 million \nAmericans, including nearly 17 million children, are living with \nsomeone who is receiving unemployment insurance.\n  These benefits help carry families through long unemployment spells, \npay the mortgage, rent, utilities. While the average unemployment \ninsurance benefit of $300 per week only replaces about one-third of an \nindividual's average weekly wage, unemployment insurance benefits have \nkept 11 million Americans out of poverty; 2.5 million in 2012 alone. \nThat is 2.5 million Americans kept out of poverty because of this \nprogram.\n  In 13 States, over 40 percent of those who are unemployed have been \nout of work for more than 26 weeks and have exhausted their State-\nfunded benefits. Nationally nearly 38 percent of unemployed workers are \nlong-term unemployed. These are the workers, the 4.9 million Americans \nwho will lose their unemployment insurance if we fail to pass this \nbill. These benefits help them to keep looking for work, support their \nchildren and families, and contribute to the economy.\n  The longer a person is unemployed, the more difficult it is for that \nperson to find a job. Skills atrophy and professional networks dry up. \nBut you can't go on a job interview if you cannot even fill up your car \nwith gas, so we also need to make sure the long-term unemployed are not \nleft high and dry after State-funded unemployment benefits run out.\n  Addressing long-term unemployment is a problem that calls for an all-\nof-the-above solution. We need to do more to support American workers.\n  This is the right thing to do. We also know it is better for the \neconomy. The CBO has found that each dollar of unemployment insurance \nincreases the GDP by as much as $1.90, and extending the Federal \nunemployment benefits through 2014 would boost GDP by a .2 percentage \npoint and increase employment by 200,000 jobs. Failing to extend \nFederal unemployment benefits will cost the economy 240,000 jobs, \naccording to the Council of Economic Advisors. Those are the numbers \nwith which we are dealing.\n  We also know if we look at the suggestions of the debt commission--\nsomething that I think is a very important body of work and has some \nvery good ideas in it--their idea is trying to get about $4 trillion in \ndebt reduction. We are something above $2.6 trillion of the way there \nwith more to do, but the point is there are ways to get there. One of \nmy favorite ways is to pass the immigration bill. CBO has found that in \nthe second 10 years that will actually save $700 billion on the debt by \nmaking people pay taxes, by bringing them out of the shadows so they \npay fines. That is what we are dealing with.\n  If we want to look at ways to reduce our debt, I don't think we \nshould be doing it on the backs of the most vulnerable, those kids, \nthose people who are long-term unemployed who still have not been able \nto find a job. In many States it is still a very difficult economy. \nEspecially for the long-term unemployed, this is the right thing to do. \nWe shouldn't leave these Americans in the lurch. We need to restore \nthis critical safety net and focus on getting Americans back to work.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about an \namendment I will seek to offer on the pending bill, amendment No. 2603.\n  We all sympathize with those who are struggling to find work in a \ndifficult economy, and I want to see people get back to work. Certainly \na short-term extension for those who are relying on unemployment \ninsurance--if it is paid for--will allow a transition for those who are \nout of work. What we need to do most in this Chamber is to give them an \nopportunity to get a good-paying job. The focus in this Chamber, most \nof all, needs to be on enacting progrowth policy that will encourage \nboth small and large businesses to thrive and grow in our economy and \ncreate jobs.\n  I have voted today to begin debate on the legislation to provide a \ntemporary extension of unemployment insurance. I voted to begin this \ndebate because I believe both sides of the aisle can find a way to \ngrant this temporary extension to those who are struggling to find work \nin this difficult economy while making sure we don't add to the $17 \ntrillion of debt that also threatens our country and our economy.\n  I continue to believe that any temporary extension in a long-term \nunemployment benefit should be paid for in a responsible manner. So I \nhave submitted an amendment, Ayotte amendment No. 2603. I think it is \nan amendment that makes a ton of sense.\n  Let me tell you what this amendment does. This amendment pays for\n\n[[Page S54]]\n\nthe 3-month extension of unemployment insurance. It fixes the unfair \ncut to the military cost of living that was just enacted in the budget \nI voted against. I felt this was unfair to those who have served in our \nmilitary and were singled out for cuts to their retirement benefits, \nunlike anyone else, and it included, by the way, those who were retired \nbecause they had a medical retirement. In other words, those who many \nof us--I know the Presiding Officer has visited Walter Reed, as have I; \nthose who have lost arms, legs--they have received a medical \nretirement, and their cost of living was cut under this budget as well.\n  So my amendment not only would pay for this temporary unemployment \ninsurance for those who are struggling to find work, to give them a \ntransition to get them back to work, but it would also pay to fix and \nreverse this unfair cut in military retirement benefits--many who, by \nthe way, have served multiple tours for our country and have sacrificed \na tremendous amount because they moved around, because they served both \nin Iraq and Afghanistan, on behalf of our country.\n  It would also give approximately $7 billion toward reducing our \ndeficit.\n  The way I pay for this is to fix an egregious problem in our Tax \nCode. It is a problem that was identified by the Treasury IG. It is, \nfrankly, egregious. This is a problem in our Tax Code that has allowed \nillegal immigrants to claim a refundable tax credit for children who \nshould not be entitled to it--children that do not even live in the \nUnited States of America or may not even exist. Why? Because when \nsomeone claims this refundable tax credit, they do not have to include \na Social Security number on their return. A Treasury IG report \nidentified this problem.\n  This amendment--a simple fix that would require a Social Security \nnumber for anyone who is claiming the additional child tax credit on \ntheir tax return--is estimated to save approximately $20 billion over \nthe next 10 years. So paying for reversing the cost-of-living increase \nfor those who have sacrificed so much for our country, paying for a \ntemporary unemployment insurance extension for those who are struggling \nto find work, and reducing our deficit by approximately $7 billion over \n10 years--all three of those things are done by fixing an egregious \nproblem in our Tax Code.\n  The audit of the Treasury IG in 2011 reported that individuals who \nare not authorized to work in the United States of America received \n$4.2 billion by claiming this additional child tax credit. The audit \nfound that the payment of Federal funds through this tax benefit \nappears to provide an additional incentive for aliens to enter, reside, \nand work in the United States without authorization, which contradicts \nFederal law and policy to remove such incentives.\n  The audit was based upon an analysis of tax returns filed by persons \nwith individual taxpayer identification numbers which are issued to \nindividuals who are required to have a taxpayer ID number for tax \npurposes but are not eligible for a Social Security number because they \nare not authorized to work in the United States of America.\n  Again, this saves approximately $20 billion over the next 10 years.\n  Let me tell you how egregious this is. Here are some of the reports \nabout this problem in our Tax Code. It is fraud. This is fraud we are \ngoing to fix here. This is good government. We should fix this now, \nregardless. This $20 billion is money that should not be going out the \ndoor over 10 years.\n  Here are some examples from Indiana. In fact, I just saw walk into \nthe Chamber one of my colleagues from Indiana, Senator Coats. In \nIndiana, a local television station found that an undocumented worker \nwho was interviewed at his home in southern Indiana by a reporter \nadmitted his address was used this year to file tax returns by four \nother undocumented workers who do not even live there. Those four \nworkers claimed 20 children who live in one residence, and, as a \nresult, the IRS sent the illegal immigrants tax refunds totaling over \n$29,000.\n  The local station has found many undocumented workers are claiming \ntax credits for children who live in Mexico. Many children who do not \neven live in this country are being used by those committing fraud on \nthe IRS to claim this tax credit.\n  In Indiana, a tax preparer who acted as a whistleblower to an Indiana \nnews station said: ``We've seen sometimes 10 or 12 dependents--most \ntimes nieces and nephews--on these tax forms. The more you put on \nthere, the more you get back.'' The whistleblower had thousands of \nexamples.\n  Another example from the whistleblower: ``We've got an over $10,000 \nrefund for nine nieces and nephews,'' he said, pointing to the words \n``niece'' and ``nephew'' listed on the tax form nine separate times. \n``We're getting an $11,000 refund on this tax return.'' ``There are \nseven nieces and nephews,'' he said, pointing to another set of \ndocuments. ``I can bring out stacks and stacks. It's just so easy, it's \nridiculous.''\n  In North Carolina, investigators uncovered more than 1,000 tax \nreturns linked to eight addresses in that state last May, with refunds \nworth more than $5 million. Investigators tied at least 17 tax returns, \ntotaling more than $62,000 in refunds, to a Charlotte, NC, apartment \none woman leased. At another apartment nearby, investigators discovered \n153 returns, valued at over $700,000 in refunds.\n  Another address in the same apartment complex had 236 returns worth \n$1.1 million in refunds.\n  At another Charlotte apartment complex, investigators traced 398 \nreturns to two apartments, totaling more than $1.9 million in \nadditional child tax credits, with no guarantee that the children even \nexisted or lived in the United States of America.\n  Another North Carolina woman owned a tax preparation business. A \nsearch of that business and her home turned up more returns, dozens of \nuncashed U.S. Treasury checks, a FedEx box containing dozens of foreign \nbirth certificates, and a notary public stamp and signature stamp \nlisting her as a notary. That fraud case by the IRS totaled over $5 \nmillion.\n  In Tennessee, a search warrant prepared by the IRS claims that a \nMurfreesboro, TN, tax company encouraged undocumented workers to lie on \ntheir tax returns by claiming children who live in Mexico as \ndependents. The IRS says that the Tennessee tax preparer has filed \n6,000 tax returns over the last 3 years and although his clients only \npaid $3.3 million in taxes, they were able to claim more than $17 \nmillion in refunds. The refunds left the United States on the hook for \n$14 million.\n\n  So here is the question in this Chamber. The question is, Should we \nfix egregious fraud in our Tax Code, where we have people, who are not \nentitled to work in this country, claiming tax refunds for children, \nsome of whom have not been determined to exist, some of whom do not \neven live in our country? Should we fix that in our Tax Code? Isn't \nthat good government?\n  And if we fix it, we can use the pay-for, the $20 billion that the \nJoint Tax Committee has estimated to save over the next 10 years, to do \nthe following: to provide for a 3 month temporary extension of \nunemployment insurance to those Americans who are struggling for work \nright now; to fix the unfair cut to our military retirees, including \nthose who have gotten a medical retirement, those who are our wounded \nwarriors who have been injured, many of them serving in Afghanistan and \nIraq; and return $7 billion to the Treasury.\n  So here is the choice. Only in Washington would this be the choice: \nWe can fix the egregious problem with the Tax Code, where there is all \nkinds of fraud and save billions of dollars; we can fix it for those \nwho have sacrificed the most--the unfair cuts to their cost-of-living \nincrease--those who have served our country admirably, and our wounded \nwarriors; and return money to reduce the deficit or what? We can be \ndenied a vote. I hope I will get a vote on this amendment. It is pretty \noutrageous if I am not granted a vote on this amendment to prevent tax \nfraud that needs to be fixed on behalf of the taxpayers in this \ncountry.\n  If I cannot get a vote to take that $20 billion to help struggling \nworkers and to fix the unfair cuts to those who have sacrificed the \nmost and taken the bullets for this country and also to help fix our \ndeficit--only in Washington would that be a tough choice for anyone. \nHow do you vote against doing that?\n  I really hope the majority leader will allow a vote on this \ncommonsense\n\n[[Page S55]]\n\namendment that will allow us to help struggling workers without adding \nto the $17 trillion debt, that will allow us to say to our men and \nwomen who have sacrificed the most: We are not going to continue to \ntarget you with these unfair cuts to your cost of living, when no one \nelse has sacrificed under this budget agreement like that--and \nparticularly our wounded warriors--and to say to the American public: \nWe are going to fix fraud in our Tax Code, and also take some money and \napply it to the deficit.\n  It makes so much sense that only in Washington would I even be asking \nthe question on the Senate floor: Will I get a vote on this commonsense \namendment that allows us to do important things for the Nation and \nfixes egregious fraud in our Tax Code, putting taxpayer dollars to uses \nthat they should be put to.\n  I end with the hope that I will get a vote on this commonsense \namendment and that my colleagues will support this amendment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I would like to discuss today's vote, as \nothers who have come down here.\n  First of all, it is important to understand that this was a vote on \nwhether to start debate. I was one of those who joined several of my \ncolleagues saying: Yes, this ought to be debated. It was not a vote to \npass or not pass the legislation. That will come.\n  But the frustration that so many of us have had over this past year \nin particular of not being able to participate in the process of \nlegislating boiled over at the end of the year and ended with a change \nin the rules in the way the Senate has operated for more than 200 years \nand stuffed the desires of the minority to be able to participate in \ncertain areas regarding nominations. Now there is some talk about doing \nthe same for legislation.\n  That frustration has led many of us to try to rethink: How can we get \nback to what is called regular order--the way the Senate has always \noperated in the past, the way it operated when I came here in my first \ntranche in the Senate.\n  I started in the House of Representatives back in 1980. I was part of \na minority for four straight terms. There are majority rules. If one is \nin the minority, they do not have a whole lot of authority. Maybe at \nthat time we held the White House under Ronald Reagan. He had the \nability to go above a Congress which did not support him but went to \nthe American people, and through their efforts many changed their minds \nin the majority party and supported the policies of President Reagan.\n  When I came to the Senate in 1989, I was asked: What is the \ndifference between the House and the Senate? You are in the minority in \nthe Senate. You were in the minority in the House. I said: The \ndifference is like going to legislative heaven from a place a lot lower \nthan that in the House, because any Senator, majority or minority, had \nthe opportunity to offer an amendment, to offer an alternative, to \noffer a statute, to participate in the effort to pass better \nlegislation.\n  Any Senator had that in the minority. The majority leader, then-\nSenator George Mitchell, the Democratic leader, honored that. It was \nhonored throughout my term in the Senate. I was then gone for 12 years \nand came back. I thought I was coming back to that same process, only \nto find that, no, the whole process has been changed.\n  We do not have the rights we once had. We do not have the \nopportunities we had. I came here to represent the people of Indiana \nand their wishes. Yet now I am in a position where I do not even have a \nchance to offer an amendment. I do not have even have a chance to offer \nan alternative or a substitute saying: Look. This may be a legitimate \nissue. I cannot support what is being handed to us take it or leave it. \nIt deserves debate. It deserves alternatives. It deserves to give us an \nopportunity to try to convince our colleagues that a majority of us can \nwork together to pass legislation.\n  That is the kind of legislation that works, as opposed to some of the \nlegislation we are dealing with now that has been enacted simply by \none-party rule. I think looking back on the Affordable Care Act, so-\ncalled ObamaCare, those who supported it wish now that it did have \nbipartisan support, that it was worked out, that some of the \nalternatives that were presented by Republicans were debated and \nperhaps supported. Maybe we would be in a different position now.\n  It is not right to characterize a vote on a procedural motion to say \nlet's go forward and open this for debate, the opportunity to have \namendments. That is why I voted for it. Unemployment insurance is a \nlegitimate issue, policy issue to debate. I cannot support the proposal \nthat was brought before us. But I can support going forward to discuss \nthat proposal, to look at the alternative, to offer my own amendments \nand see if our thoughts, our ideas prevail.\n  I am hoping that is what will happen. That is up to the majority \nleader Senator Reid. Mr. President, 2013 did not offer us very many--in \nfact, very few--opportunities to do that. We ended up on a very sour \nnote in 2013. It was good we had that break and we are back, the second \nday of a new session of Congress. I hope Members on both sides of the \naisle reflected over this period of time on how we can return the \nSenate to its original intent, how we can get back to so-called regular \norder, so we can have legitimate debate on the floor, we can go back \nand forth with our colleagues.\n  I think if we amend this, it will be a better bill. We do not think \nthat bill is the one that ought to address this problem, but here is a \nsubstitute. Let's debate it. Then let's have a vote. Some of us will \nwin and some of us will lose. But every one of us will have the \nopportunity to have their voice heard, their amendment voted on, their \nalternative evaluated, and perhaps work in a bipartisan way to come up \nwith something constructive.\n  So that was the purpose for leaving most of my party and voting for \nthe motion to proceed, to go forward. Here we are. Now we have a chance \nto debate it. Senator Ayotte was on the floor speaking before me, \nSenator Portman, Senator Cornyn, all proposing ways in which we can \noffset the cost.\n  We all know we are adding to our debt and deficit on a daily basis. \nWe have not come to grips with that. Yet the future consequences for \nthis country, our economy, our children, our grandchildren, future \ngenerations is something we are all going to be ashamed of if we do not \ntry to impose some discipline. How do we do that?\n  We made many efforts going all the way back to Simpson-Bowles. All of \nthe major efforts, we were unable get the President's support for any \nof those, even though he commissioned the Simpson-Bowles group, which \nwas bipartisan. But nevertheless, we have not yet to this point been \nable to get that large effort in place that will put us on the path to \nfiscal health.\n  But one thing we can do is when we have programs--new programs, an \nextension of programs such as this--come before us, we can say: Let's, \none, reform this so we achieve what we want to achieve, and, No. 2, \nlet's make sure we do not add more taxpayer dollars to our deficit \nspending and our debt. Let's offset it with something.\n  For those who say we cannot cut a penny more, for goodness' sake, the \norganizations--the Federal organizations, the Office of Management and \nBudget, the Congressional Research Service, on and on, GAO and others, \nhave proposed numerous ways of billions of dollars, hundreds of \nbillions of dollars in savings for programs that are deemed wasteful \nand fraudulent.\n  Senator Ayotte just mentioned specific examples, some in my State, of \nabuses of the system. There are concerns about abuse of the \nunemployment insurance, people seeing this not as a help to getting a \njob and getting back into the workforce but seeing this as yet another \nentitlement benefit they can receive without putting the effort in to \nget meaningful employment.\n  We have the responsibility to bring forward measures that I think \ngive people a connection between unemployment and their ability to get \nemployed. That has been suggested by Senator Portman and others here. \nSenator Cornyn also talked about that. So whether it is an offset in \norder to pay for this so we do not go further in debt and use taxpayer \nmoney for excess\n\n[[Page S56]]\n\nspending, when we know over here is waste and fraud and abuse in \nprograms that have been deemed dysfunctional, unnecessary, the Federal \nGovernment never should have been involved in this process in the first \nplace, why not take those programs that have been recommended to us by \nnonpartisan agencies of the Federal Government?\n  Senator Coburn has spent his career down here pointing out excessive, \noutrageous, egregious waste that has gone on and a misuse of taxpayer \ndollars. That is not how to run a government. My State has had to face \nthis. They have faced up to it. We made the tough decisions. Of course, \nthere have been interest groups supporting every possible item we spend \nmoney on. But we separated the necessary, the efficient, the effective \nfrom the unnecessary, ineffective.\n  We now have been rated as the most taxpayer conscious friendly State \nin the Nation. Our per capita tax impact on Hoosiers in Indiana is the \nlowest of any State in the Nation. We have an efficient, effective \ngovernment that has a AAA credit rating, that has been deemed business \nfriendly, taxpayer friendly, residential friendly, family friendly. It \nis a good place to live because we are not wasting taxpayer dollars. \nPeople are tired of spending money on what does not work.\n  I have gotten way off my intended statement. But I guess I am \nexpressing my frustrations over the inability to participate in the \nprocess that can bring about better use of the taxpayers' dollars and \nmore effective government. I think I speak for a lot of people on both \nsides of the aisle, that the way to do this is simply not to freeze out \ndebate, not to freeze out amendments, not to freeze out the opportunity \nto offer alternatives. By moving through this motion to proceed, I am \nhoping this is a step forward to returning to a process in which we are \nable to do what I just suggested.\n  This decision is going to be up to the majority leader. If he wants \nhonest debate, if he wants the American people and all of us in this \nChamber to know--to examine alternatives, if he wants to be \nconscientious about spending taxpayer dollars, allow us the opportunity \nto offer some offsets.\n  Senator Ayotte had a specific and I think very compelling offset. If \nwe took a fraction of the money that we would save, we can cover the \ncost of this extension, if that is where we think we should go. I think \nmajor reforms need to be made to this program, and we ought to be \nemphasizing getting people back to work rather than how to keep \nextending unemployment. But the two go somewhat hand in hand.\n  There are people in Indiana and other places who have made every \npossible effort to get a job and have come up short. We need to be \nsensitive to the plight of those people, but we do not need to be \nsensitive to those who have taken advantage of this program and are \nabusing this program who simply say: I do not have to work because the \ngovernment will send me a check; when I add up all of my benefits, I am \ndoing as well as I could if I worked. That is not the kind of policy we \nought to be advocating or enabling in the Senate.\n  As I said, there are numerous alternatives or ways in which we can \nfind a way to pay for this, if we can also put the reforms in place \nthat mean we ought to go forward with this particular program. Let me \nsuggest three. My colleagues have suggested others also, which I \nsupport. Any one of these could work. This program is scored at about a \ncost of six point something billion dollars.\n  This is a program, a policy, which requires taxpayers, in order to \nclaim refundable portions of the child tax credit, it would require \nthem to provide a Social Security number. I mean, this is so \nelementary, it is unbelievable to discover that a government agency has \nsaid: This is not in place. In other words, if you want to qualify for \na refundable child tax credit, you have to verify who you are by giving \nthem your Social Security number, so they can check to see if this is \nlegitimate or not legitimate.\n  Senator Ayotte laid out a situation where people were claiming 10, \n15, 20 exemptions for children who did not even live in the United \nStates, who were not even citizens. I was embarrassed that one of \nexamples came from my State. But I think it is true of all States. But \nthe savings to put a good bit of common sense into a program is scored \nnot by Dan Coats, not by a Republican Senator but by a government \nagency. It is scored at $27 billion.\n  So here is a program that wants to spend $6.6 billion. Republicans \nsay: First of all, we have problems with the program. I may or may not \nsupport extending this. But if it does get extended, surely we do not \nwant to dump more money, more future debt, onto our children and \ngrandchildren. So let's take this $27 billion, or a fraction of that \n$27 billion, and pay for this.\n  Let me offer another option: a delay for 1 year of the individual \nemployer mandates under ObamaCare, the legislation I introduced in the \nSenate. If the President has delayed the mandates for businesses, \nshould not he offer the same delay to families and individuals as a \nsimple issue of fairness? What is the score--$30 billion.\n  A third option: Prohibit those who are eligible for unemployment \ninsurance from claiming Social Security disability benefits. Under the \nlaw, one must be able to work to qualify for unemployment benefits.\n  Yet some people claiming unemployment benefits are also claiming \nSocial Security disability benefits. We can't make some of this stuff \nup. Savings: roughly $6 billion, maybe more, that, if we want to \nsupport this bill, would be a pay-for. So whether it is a pay-for or \nwhether it is the necessary policy changes to make the program more \neffective--including, and I would suggest, a number of efforts that \nhave been proposed by my colleagues in terms of better connecting the \nunemployed with those who are seeking, with the employers.\n  I can't tell you how many employers I have talked to in Indiana who \nhave said: I have jobs.\n  I have talked to others, but the bottom line is this. There are \npeople out there who look at what I have to offer. It is not the \ngreatest, but it is a job. It covers benefits, and it is a step forward \nfor them.\n  But they say: It doesn't match what I am getting from the government, \nso I think I will take a pass.\n  This is not America and not the principles that made America the kind \nof country it is. We should not be enablers in that regard through \nlegislation that we pass.\n  I hope that we can have a full and open debate on this bill and move \nto policies that will grow and create jobs, and that we will adopt a \npractice of paying for new spending with offsets from known waste, \nfraud, and abuse that has been documented by government agencies.\n  Can't we at least do that? Can't we at least agree, in the future \ninterest of our country, both fiscally, domestically, on a number of \nissues, for all of the reasons that I have articulated or tried to \narticulate, this makes sense?\n  Breaking with some of the past ways I have given my vote, I have said \nI am going to vote for the motion to proceed, and I going to challenge \nthe majority leader to look at this and say let's run this place \ndifferently in 2014 than it was in 2013. Let's not be afraid of debate. \nLet's not be afraid of amendments. Let's let the yeas be yeas and the \nnays be nays. Let's give everybody an opportunity to state their case, \nto offer an alternative, and to be recognized. As a Member of the \nSenate, and the way this Senate was designed to be and traditionally \nfor over 200 years it has been, let's move back to that.\n  What happens next is now up to the majority leader. The ball is in \nhis court.\n  Had we not passed the motion to proceed with the support of \nRepublican help, then we wouldn't have given the majority leader the \nneed to make a decision.\n  What kind of a Senate do we want in 2014? A Senate that is doing what \nthe American people want us to do, representing the people of our State \nwith their interests, representing our beliefs about how government \nshould be run, how it should be funded, having an open and honest \ndebate, not afraid to take votes, trying to construct good policy for \nthe future of this country? We can't do that if this body is run by one \nperson saying: My way or the highway. You are in the minority. Tough \nbreak.\n  This is a chance for the majority leader. Let's give us the \nopportunity and return this back to the Senate it was once and always \nhas been until lately. It is up to the majority leader.\n\n[[Page S57]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. I am here today with some good news. This week the \ngovernment will fix something that was broken. I know that some people \nwish to deny that is possible, but hear me out.\n  Five years ago, during the 2008 financial crisis, we witnessed \nfirsthand that the market for home mortgages was badly broken. The \nfundamental problem was that many lenders issued mortgages without any \nconcern about whether the borrower would be able to repay those \nmortgages in the long run. Why would they do that? They did it because \nthey could immediately sell the mortgage to another financial \ninstitution. If the borrower couldn't pay, that would turn out to be \nsomebody else's problem.\n  We all know what happened next. Millions of these dangerous mortgages \nwere bundled together, sliced, diced, slapped with AAA ratings, and \nthen sold to retirement funds, local governments, and investors all \nover the country. When borrowers couldn't make their monthly payments, \nthose bundles of mortgages began collapsing, and the effects were felt \nin every corner of the economy.\n  This Friday, that basic business model will change, thanks to the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau's new mortgage rules. When these \nrules go into effect, lenders will be able to issue a mortgage only \nafter they determine that the borrower has the ability to repay it.\n  Lenders will no longer be able to make loans they know will blow up \nand then feed those dangerous loans into the financial system. Because \nof the consumer agency's new rules, families will be safer. Pension \nfunds and other investors will be safer. Our whole economy will be \nsafer--not completely safe, but with a new cop on the beat, it will be \nsafer.\n  The new rules will fix other problems as well. Before the crisis, \nsome mortgage brokers who were supposed to be helping consumers find \nthe best mortgage were actually taking money from lenders to steer \nthose consumers into higher-cost loans. The CFPB's new rules will \nprohibit this sort of under-the-table dealing and protect consumers \nfrom being tricked by people they think they can trust.\n  The rules will also address many of the mortgage servicing problems \nthat emerged during the crisis. After mortgages were sold off, bundled, \nand cut up into pieces for various investors, too many borrowers were \nunable to track down clear information about their accounts. Some of \nthe companies responsible for servicing their loans took days or even \nweeks to give them credit for their payments.\n  When borrowers fell behind, these servicers often began foreclosure \nproceedings without giving people full information about the options \nthey had to modify their loans. The consumer agency's new rules will \nhelp clean up the mortgage servicing industry so more families can keep \nup with their payments and stay in their homes.\n  CFPB Director Rich Cordray and his hardworking and incredibly \ntalented staff have worked for a long time to put these new rules \ntogether, and its rules will reshape the mortgage market for the \nbetter. They will give people a better chance to buy homes and a better \nchance to keep those homes. They will force mortgage lenders and \nservicers to compete by offering better rates and customer service, not \nby tricking and trapping people. These rules will help markets work \nbetter, and they will reduce the risk that the economy will crash \nagain.\n  Our work is not done. The march toward financial reform has been too \nslow, and the chances of another crisis, while dialed back in some \nareas, remain unacceptably high in others. Even today, the too-big-to-\nfail banks that nearly crashed the global economy in 2008 are nearly 40 \npercent bigger than they were back then.\n  Yes, we have more work to do on dangerous banking practices, but this \nweek marks an important milestone. Six years ago, I noted that it was \nimpossible to buy a toaster with a one-in-five chance of bursting into \nflames and burning your house down, but it was possible to take out a \nmortgage that had the same one-in-five chance of putting a family out \non the street.\n  The point was that consumers had the Consumer Products Safety \nCommission to keep people safe from dangerous toasters, and they needed \nthe same kind of agency to keep people safe from dangerous and \ndeceptive financial products.\n  In the years since, we have built that agency. It has already \nreturned nearly $1 billion to consumers who were cheated, and it has \nhelped tens of thousands of consumers resolve complaints against \nfinancial institutions. Now, this Friday, that agency will put in place \nsome commonsense rules that will make a real difference for millions of \nfamilies who own--or someday hope to own--their own home.\n  The consumer bureau's new mortgage rules show, once again, that \ngovernment can fix problems. Sure, we have to work hard. We have to \nfight against those who benefit from the broken system, and we have to \nstick with it even when the odds are against us. But when we do those \nthings, real change is possible in this country. We are seeing that up \nclose this week.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          The Federal Reserve\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, last night here in the Senate we \nconfirmed Janet Yellen to be the next Chairman of the Board of \nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System. I firmly opposed her \nconfirmation. In 2010 I also voted against Dr. Yellen's nomination to \nserve as Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve. I want to explain.\n  At that time I stated my deep concerns about Dr. Yellen's Keynesian \nbias toward inflation as a member of the Federal Open Market Committee \nand her poor record of bank regulation as president of the San \nFrancisco Federal Reserve. Those concerns have not faded; rather, they \nare magnified in light of the importance of the position to which Dr. \nYellen has now been confirmed, and that is the Chairman of the Board of \nGovernors of the Federal Reserve.\n  It is not just that the Chairman of the Fed is perhaps the most \npowerful individual in the global economy; it is that the institution \nitself is in utterly uncharted waters. I believe we need a Federal \nReserve Chairman with the record and resolve to navigate our economy \nthrough this incredibly delicate situation. In my judgment, I thought \nDr. Yellen was not that person.\n  The Federal Reserve's balance sheet currently stands at $4 trillion.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the \nbalance sheet as of January 1 of this year.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       8.

A recent Bloomberg analysis contains figures that help us \nput this staggering number--$4 trillion--into perspective.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record that \nBloomberg article.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From Bloomberg, Dec. 17, 2013]\n\n          Fed's $4 Trillion in Assets Draw Lawmakers' Scrutiny\n\n                            (By Jeff Kearns)\n\n       The Federal Reserve's balance sheet is poised to exceed $4 \n     trillion, prompting warnings its record easing is inflating \n     asset-price bubbles and drawing renewed lawmaker scrutiny \n     just as Janet Yellen prepares to take charge.\n       The Fed's assets rose to a record $3.99 trillion on Dec. \n     11, up from $2.82 trillion in September 2012, when it \n     embarked on a third round of bond buying. Policy makers meet \n     today and tomorrow to decide whether to start curtailing the \n     $85 billion monthly pace of purchases.\n       Among Fed officials, ``there's discomfort in the sense that \n     the portfolio could grow almost without limit,'' former Fed \n     Vice Chairman Donald Kohn said last week during a panel \n     discussion in Washington. Kohn said there was ``discomfort in \n     the potential financial stability effects'' and added: \n     ``There's some legitimacy in those discomforts.''\n       Fed Governor Jeremy Stein has said some credit markets, \n     such as corporate debt, show signs of excessive risk-taking, \n     while not posing a threat to financial stability. \n     Representative Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the House \n     committee that oversees the Fed, last week said he plans \n     ``the most rigorous examination and oversight of the Federal \n     Reserve in its history.''\n       While any effort to rewrite the law establishing Fed powers \n     lacks support from Democrats who control the Senate, the \n     scrutiny is undesirable for central bankers who believe \n     ``independence is priceless,'' said Laura Rosner, a U.S. \n     economist at BNP Paribas SA in New York.\n\n\n                              Not Welcome\n\n                  The Fed Approaches a Taper on Tiptoe\n\n       ``It's not a welcome development that a lot more time and \n     focus is spent on answering questions'' from Congress, said \n     Rosner, a former researcher at the Federal Reserve Bank of \n     New York. Lawmakers may also use the size of the balance \n     sheet to ``draw attention to concerns they have about the \n     Fed's responsibilities and growing role in financial \n     regulation.''\n       Chairman Ben S. Bernanke, whose second four-year term ends \n     next month, has quadrupled Fed assets since 2008 with bond \n     purchases intended to lower long-term borrowing costs and \n     reduce unemployment. Vice Chairman Yellen, who may win Senate \n     confirmation this week to replace Bernanke, has been a \n     supporter of the policy.\n       The Fed has said it will keep buying bonds until the \n     outlook for the labor market has ``improved substantially.'' \n     Thirty-four percent of economists surveyed by Bloomberg Dec. \n     6 predicted the Fed will start reducing purchases this month, \n     while 26 percent forecast January and 40 percent said March.\n\n\n                              Assets Held\n\n       The Fed's balance sheet exceeds the gross domestic product \n     of Germany, the world's fourth-largest economy. It's enough \n     to cover all U.S. federal government spending for more than a \n     year. It could pay off all student and auto loans in the \n     country with $2 trillion to spare, Fed data show. The central \n     bank's assets are set to exceed the $4.1 trillion held by \n     BlackRock Inc. (BLK), the world's largest asset manager.\n       The third round of quantitative easing probably will total \n     $1.54 trillion before it ends, bringing the balance sheet to \n     $4.3 6 trillion, according to economists in the survey.\n       ``This is a stimulus of the first order. It's just \n     unprecedented,'' Alabama Republican Senator Richard Shelby \n     said in an interview last week. ``The Fed is an independent \n     body, but we can point out what they're doing.''\n       Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Richmond Fed and a critic \n     of the Fed's bond buying, said in a Dec. 9 speech he expects \n     the Fed policy makers to discuss reducing purchases at this \n     week's meeting. Adding to the balance sheet ``increases the \n     risks'' associated with exiting stimulus, he said.\n\n\n                              `Real Risk'\n\n       Shelby, a five-term senator and past chairman of the \n     Banking Committee sees ``a real risk'' the balance sheet will \n     ignite inflation. So far, there's little sign that's \n     happening: a measure of prices watched by the Fed rose 0.7 \n     percent in October from a year earlier, below the central \n     bank's 2 percent target and the least in four years.\n       At 22 percent of the $16.9 trillion U.S. economy, the \n     balance sheet is surpassed by those of other major central \n     banks as a percentage of gross domestic product, according to \n     third-quarter data compiled by Haver Analytics in New York. \n     In the euro zone, the figure is 24 percent, and in Japan, \n     it's about 44 percent.\n       That doesn't mollify Republican critics. When Yellen \n     started to make global comparisons at her Senate confirmation \n     hearing last month, Shelby interrupted her.\n       ``I'm asking about the Federal Reserve of the United States \n     of America,'' he said.\n\n\n                             Warning Signs\n\n       Yellen is set to take over amid warnings that assets from \n     leveraged loans to farmland are showing signs of froth.\n       The Fed and other U.S. banking regulators have said they \n     want to crack down on underwriting standards in the market \n     for high-risk, high-yield loans.\n\n[[Page S59]]\n\n       Non-bank lenders such as mutual funds, hedge funds and \n     pools of collateralized loan obligations, bought $630 billion \n     of the loans this year, surpassing the 2007 peak of $581.5 \n     billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n       Sales of high-yield, high-risk bonds, rated below Baa3 by \n     Moody's Investors Service and lower than BBB- at Standard & \n     Poor's, soared to an annual record of $373.2 billion this \n     year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with \n     $149.2 billion in 2006, the year before the start of the \n     credit crisis.\n       The extra yield investors demand to hold speculative-grade \n     bonds rather than government debt reached 411 basis points, \n     or 4.11 percentage points, last week, the least since October \n     2007, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. \n     Spreads ended the week at 412 basis points.\n\n\n                              Record Loans\n\n       Sales of institutional loans have also reached an annual \n     record, soaring 71 percent from 2012 to $627.1 billion, \n     according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n       Potential losses on the Fed's investments are also cause \n     for concern and ``something we will be watching,'' \n     Representative John Campbell, a California Republican who \n     leads the House Financial Services subcommittee on monetary \n     policy and trade, said in February.\n       The Fed sent a record $88.4 billion to the Treasury in 2012 \n     and $75.4 billion in 2011, up from $31.7 billion in 2008. \n     Most of the income was from interest on assets bought under \n     the quantitative easing program.\n       The risk for the Fed is that rising interest rates reduce \n     the value of its bond holdings, potentially causing losses if \n     the central bank had to sell the securities back into the \n     open market.\n       ``Losses are dangerous for the Fed from a political \n     perspective because they would be a risk to its \n     independence,'' said Roberto Perli, a partner at Cornerstone \n     Macro LP in Washington.\n\n\n                            Deficit Spending\n\n       Campbell and Hensarling also say the Fed's purchases of \n     government debt are encouraging deficit spending by allowing \n     the government to borrow cheaply. The yield on the 10-year \n     Treasury note has averaged 2.31 percent this year, compared \n     with a 6.61 percent mean over the past half century.\n       ``The Fed's additional extraordinary purchases of Treasury \n     bonds have supported the Obama administration's trillion-\n     dollar deficits,'' Hensarling said at a Dec. 12 hearing.\n       Yellen says bond purchases have put Americans back to work. \n     Asset purchases helped the private sector add 7.8 million \n     workers since 2010 and boosted home prices and auto sales, \n     Yellen said in her confirmation hearing, adding that the \n     progress will let the central bank get back to more normal \n     monetary policy.\n\n\n                              Jobless Rate\n\n       The jobless rate has fallen to 7 percent from a 26-year \n     high of 10 percent in October 2009. Since then, the economy \n     has regained most of the jobs it lost during the 18-month \n     recession ended in June 2009.\n       ``The balance sheet is growing because that's how the \n     Federal Reserve thinks it's going to accomplish the mandates \n     that Congress gave to it'' for full employment and price \n     stability, Kohn, now a senior fellow at the Brookings \n     Institution's Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy \n     in Washington, said in an interview last week.\n       Still, policy makers haven't spurred the growth they \n     expected. Officials forecast 2013 growth of 2 percent to 2.3 \n     percent in September, down from a 2.3 percent to 2.8 percent \n     estimate in March.\n       ``QE turned out to be a safety net, a floor, a way to catch \n     the economy to keep it from crashing,'' said Steve Blitz, \n     chief economist at ITG Investment Research Inc. in New York. \n     ``A safety net to catch a falling economy is not the same \n     thing that can springboard the economy to a higher rate of \n     growth.''\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. The article contains the following three comparisons that \nI found more than interesting. Four trillion dollars is equivalent to \n24 percent of the U.S. GDP. That is greater than the GDP of the world's \nfourth largest country--Germany. Think about it. Four trillion dollars \nis twice the amount of all student and auto debt in this country. Yes, \n$4 trillion far surpasses even the amount of money the Federal \nGovernment spends in an entire year.\n  This brings me to my next point. Many hold the misconception in this \ncountry that China is the world's largest owner of U.S. debt. That is \nnot true. In fact, the Federal Reserve's balance sheet shows the \nFederal Reserve itself is by far the largest holder of U.S. Treasury \nbonds. With $2.2 trillion in Treasury debt, the Fed holds nearly $900 \nbillion more than China does, if you can think in those terms. The Fed \nholds more in Treasury bonds than do China and most of the eurozone \ncombined.\n  The rate of acceleration with which the Federal Reserve is purchasing \nTreasuries should be alarming to all Americans. On the day of President \nObama's first inauguration, the Federal Reserve held $475 billion in \nTreasuries. Today it holds $2.2 trillion in Treasuries. That represents \na 363-percent increase in the past 5 years.\n  It is no coincidence that President Obama has greatly accelerated our \nnational debt over that same period of time. There is a connection. \nWhen he took office, the national debt stood at a large $10.6 trillion. \nThat is a lot of money. Today it stands at $17.3 trillion--5 years \nlater. I believe the Federal Reserve is aiding and abetting the failed \npolicies and the reckless spending of the Obama administration.\n  But the Fed's binge on Treasuries alone doesn't tell the full story \nof its exploding balance sheet. The Federal Reserve's portfolio is also \nloaded with nearly $1.5 trillion of mortgage-backed securities. I have \nlong been concerned that this aggressive and extraordinary purchasing \nprogram is artificially propping up home prices, and this is especially \npertinent since an overheated housing market greatly contributed to the \nfinancial crisis that caused this situation in the first place.\n  Taken altogether, the Federal Reserve has added more than $3 trillion \nto its balance sheet since early 2008, just before the investment bank \nBear Stearns failed and the Federal Reserve stepped in.\n  I realize that sometimes it is easy to become lost in all of these \nhuge figures I have been sharing. I brought a simple chart that \nillustrates the magnitude of the Federal Reserve's actions. It shows \nhere the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet by decade, from \nits creation in 1913, 100 years ago, to present day. As we can see, it \ntook 95 years for the Federal Reserve's balance sheet to reach $1 \ntrillion. But look at the incredible spike in just a few years since, \nin the red here. Here we are today, just 5 years later, at $4 trillion \nand growing.\n  Let's call this what it is: a backdoor stimulus program through \nmonetary policy. Very complicated, yes, but very important. It dwarfs \neven the fiscal stimulus package President Obama rammed through \nCongress during his first days in office about 5 years ago. President \nObama's fiscal stimulus package totaled $787 billion--a lot of money--\nand I have just described the Fed's monetary stimulus package as nearly \nfour times larger and growing.\n  This highly unconventional monetary policy poses huge risks to our \neconomy--namely, inflation in the future and a devaluation of our \ncurrency. I realize that current inflation expectations are relatively \nlow and anchored. However, again we are in completely uncharted \nterritory. Should inflation expectations become unglued, prices could \nincrease uncontrollably. There is simply no playbook that I am aware of \non how to deal with such a situation successfully.\n  Yes, I also understand that the Fed has recently announced it will \nmodestly scale back its so-called quantitative easing program. The Fed \nwill still purchase tens of billions of dollars of securities each \nmonth.\n  Make no mistake--the Fed's balance sheet will continue to expand \nrapidly. How long will this continue? We don't know. How large will the \nFed's balance sheet ultimately grow? We don't know. Will the Fed be \nable to contain inflation if it does begin to rise? Again, we don't \nknow. And when will the Federal Reserve actually begin to unwind the \nbalance sheet--which will be tricky? Again, we don't know. How exactly \ndoes the Federal Reserve plan to unwind the balance sheet? Again, we \ndon't know, and I don't believe they know.\n  I raise these points because I met with Dr. Yellen in my office and \nattended her confirmation hearing in the Banking Committee. I received \nno meaningful answers to any of those questions, only the usual \nplatitudes that so often mark such meetings.\n  If I may, I will now turn briefly to the subject of bank regulation, \nwhich is very important in this country--a primary and critical \nfunction of the Federal Reserve.\n  I have been a member of the Banking Committee since I first came to \nthe Senate in 1987. I served on the committee through many difficult \ntimes in the financial markets, including the savings and loan crisis \nand the 2008 financial crisis. In all of my experience, I have never \nseen a financial institution fail that was well managed, well \ncapitalized, and well regulated. The\n\n[[Page S60]]\n\nfact is that so many financial institutions failed in 2008 and 2009 in \nno small part because the Federal Reserve failed spectacularly in its \nrole as their regulator. I think that is a given.\n  As President of the San Francisco Fed from 2004 to 2010, Dr. Yellen \npresided over a regional housing bubble and failed to restrain the \nexcesses in the market. Yet, despite this record of failure, she now \nruns the most powerful bank regulatory institution in the world--the \nFederal Reserve. I guess failure begets promotion in President Obama's \nview. We have seen it time and again.\n  This is all the more important considering that the Fed gained even \ngreater power under the Dodd-Frank financial regulation law despite the \nfact that the Federal Reserve's own failures contributed to the need \nfor financial reform in the first place.\n  In light of Dr. Yellen's weak touch as a bank regulator and her \nstrong inclination to print more and more money, I firmly opposed her \nnomination. Only time will tell, but I believe a vote in the \naffirmative is one many of my colleagues will come to regret.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I presume we are in a quorum call. I \nask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Global Warming\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I am back today for the 54th time to \nurge my colleagues to wake up to what carbon pollution is doing to the \nEarth's climate and oceans. We see the facts all around us, but can't \nseem to penetrate the politics of Congress.\n  We, in this body, are willfully ignoring changes we have never seen \nbefore, changes that threaten our planet and its rich array of plant \nand animal life, our homes, farms, and factories, and our very health \nand well being.\n  Carbon-driven climate change can be seen in warming surface \ntemperatures and shifting seasons, but perhaps nowhere is carbon \npollution doing more harm than in our oceans. The year 2013 brought \nample new evidence of these changes in our oceans.\n  People often talk about climate change as if it were a theory. Here \nis what we know. We know that the oceans are warming. That is not a \ntheory; that is a measurement. It is done with thermometers. It is not \ncomplicated. Sea level, we know, is rising; that is another \nmeasurement. It is very simple. We could do it with a yardstick. Oceans \nare becoming more acidic. Every American with an aquarium measures \nacidity with litmus paper. Again, it is simple measurement and proven \nfacts.\n  If we put those proven facts into context, let's look at geologic \ncontext. According to an article published in 2012 in the journal \nScience, our current rate of carbon dioxide emissions--mainly from \nburning fossil fuels--is enough to cause the most severe changes to the \nchemistry of our oceans in 300 million years, and 300 million years ago \nis before the dinosaurs.\n  We know the oceans are warming. The oceans have absorbed more than 90 \npercent of the excess heat in the atmosphere between 1971 and 2010, \naccording to a 2013 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange.\n  Here is where the heat goes: 93.4 percent goes into the ocean. The \nrest we are seeing, 2.3 percent, goes into the atmosphere. Our oceans \nare really taking the brunt of the added heat.\n  We also know that sea level is rising. We know this. It is driven not \nonly by melting glaciers carrying water into the seas and raising their \nlevel, but also by ocean water expanding. As water warms, it expands. \nThe principle of thermal expansion is known in every science class in \nthis country.\n  At the Newport tide gauge in Rhode Island, sea level is up almost 10 \ninches since the 1930s. So that means that storms driving the sea \nagainst Rhode Island's coast have 10 more inches of sea to throw \nagainst our homes and infrastructure.\n  Recent satellite measurements from the University of Colorado Sea \nLevel Research Group show 3.2 millimeters of sea level rise per year \nfrom 1993 to 2013. Between 1901 and 2010, that rate was estimated at \n1.7 millimeters per year. So the rate of increase has nearly doubled, \nand that means sea level rise is very likely speeding up. That is all \nstuff we measure. That is not theory.\n  The IPCC report also projects--conservatively, in my view--that sea \nlevel will likely rise one-half to one full meter by the year 2100 if \nwe do nothing to dial back carbon pollution. Obviously, the other \nestimates are for far more extreme sea level rise.\n  We know the oceans are becoming more acidic. Oceans not only absorb \n90 percent of the heat that has come from climate change, they are \nabsorbing about 30 percent of the carbon itself. The carbon itself goes \nto the surface of the ocean, and it is absorbed there. Roughly 600 \ngigatons worth of carbon have been pumped into our oceans as a result. \nAs all that carbon dissolves into the oceans, what happens? Ocean water \nbecomes more acidic. It is a chemistry experiment you can duplicate in \nany simple lab. Indeed, if you do the measurement, we have gotten about \n26 percent more acidic--the seas have--since the Industrial Revolution. \nThat was reported, again, last year by the International Programme on \nthe State of the Ocean.\n  The rate of change in ocean acidity--we can see it is speeding up--is \nalready faster than at any time measured in the past 50 million years \naccording to research published in the journal Nature Geoscience. Yet \nwe sleep walk here in Congress, narcotized by polluter money.\n  Ocean acidification and warming are fundamentally altering our \nundersea environment--what Pope Francis in his recent exhortation \ncalled the ``ocean wonder world.'' These changes, among other things, \nhave made the world's coral reefs extremely vulnerable to decay and \nbleaching. Areas such as the Great Barrier Reef--one of the great \nglobal wonders of the world off the coast of Australia--has already \nexperienced large-scale bleaching.\n  As a boy, I used to scuba dive in the Andaman Sea. If you go back \nnow--30 years later--it is heavily bleached. These are pictures that \nwere taken in 2002 by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, and \nthey clearly show a once lush and vibrant reef now gone and barren.\n  Worsening this bleaching would be particularly hard on countries \nwhose people depend on the bounty of the reef for their protein, \nsustenance, and economy. Remember, the reefs are the ocean's nurseries, \nand they support food and economic stability as well as pretty tropical \nfish.\n  New research also suggests that even the most remote depths of the \nocean will suffer the consequences of climate change. A study published \nin the journal Global Change Biology looked at various climate models \nto predicate changes in food supply throughout the world's oceans. The \nmodels predict that the changes to our ocean could lead to a worldwide \ndrop in sea floor dwelling life by the year 2100.\n  The North Atlantic--off our shores in Massachusetts and in Rhode \nIsland--may lose more than one-third of all deep-sea marine life. These \ndrastic changes from our carbon pollution are daunting ones--\nparticularly for our ocean State of Rhode Island. Our way of life in \nRhode Island, like the Presiding Officer's in Massachusetts, has always \nbeen closely tied to the sea. Yet here in Congress we ignore all of \nthat and continue perilously sleepwalking through history.\n  The Obama administration has at last put forward a Climate Action \nPlan, the cornerstone of which will be EPA regulations to limit \ngreenhouse gas emissions from new and existing powerplants. Our 50 \nworst powerplants--in terms of emission--put out more carbon pollution \nthan the entire country of Canada and the entire country of Korea. So \nsolving that problem is vitally important.\n  The plan also directs executive branch agencies to take concrete \nsteps to safeguard the American people and our interest in the world \nagainst the harmful effects of excessively high temperatures, melting \nice, ocean acidification, and sea level rise.\n  These are important steps, but they must ultimately be backed up by \ncongressional action. EPA regulations and executive orders will never \nhave the same economy-wide effect as a congressionally approved carbon \nfee, for instance.\n\n[[Page S61]]\n\n  The sweeping changes taking place in our oceans make adapting to \nthese changes particularly important along our coastlines. Warmer \nwaters and higher seas load the dice for more damaging storms. Our \ncoastal counties in this country harbor 39 percent of the country's \npopulation and account for 41 percent of our GDP.\n  Let's look at our ports, for example. According to a 2009 National \nOcean Economics Program report: ``Three-quarters of all United States \ntrade passes through estuary ports.'' No wonder, then, that the \nAmerican Association of Port Authorities is taking climate change \nseriously--working to reduce carbon pollution and stave off its \neffects, rather than waiting for Congress to awaken from our slumber.\n  American ports are switching trucks and cranes from diesel to \nelectric and installing onshore power supply to ships, thus reducing \nemissions from the port and from idling vessels. Likewise, the \nInternational Association of Ports and Harbors has launched the World \nPorts Climate Initiative to reduce the CO2 output from port-\nrelated activities.\n  In my State, the Rhode Island Climate Change Commission reported:\n\n       Inundaton of the state's ports and railroads may reduce \n     interstate access, affecting economic viability and \n     potentially limiting imports and exports. Sea level rise may \n     also reduce navigational clearances for the State's bridges, \n     additionally limiting access.\n\n  These changes will be particularly harmful for the Port of \nProvidence, which today brings hundreds of millions of dollars to the \nregion.\n  We need strong Federal action to reduce the carbon emissions that are \nthreatening our coastal communities. We must also take firm Federal \naction to adapt ourselves, and our States and our coastal communities, \nto the changes that we can no longer avoid because of what we have \nalready pumped into the atmosphere and the harm we have already done.\n  This is a real threat. It is embarrassing, and it is wrong for \nCongress and the Senate to continue to ignore it. Somebody who knew \nsomething about looming threats was Sir Winston Churchill. He gave this \nadvice:\n\n       One ought never to turn one's back on a threatened danger \n     and try to run away from it. If you do that, you will double \n     the danger. But if you meet it promptly and without \n     flinching, you will reduce the danger by half.\n\n  That is good advice. What's embarrassing and wrong is that not only \nare we failing to meet it promptly--and flinching--but that failure and \nthat flinching is the result of special interest influence in this \nbody.\n  We face uncommon challenges and they demand uncommon resolve. America \nhas not overcome past crises by pretending they did not exist; that \nstate of play is preposterous for us to embark from. We actually have \nclear scientific understanding of the problem. The doubt is passed, the \njury is in, and the verdict has been delivered. Yet we lack the will of \nleadership to forge a solution. Another great leader who knew something \nof leadership in times of crisis was President Lincoln. He understood \nthat the greatest challenges require clear vision and brave thinking. \nWhen faced with a crisis, President Lincoln said:\n\n       The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must \n     rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think \n     anew, and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then \n     we shall save our country.\n\n  It is past time to disenthrall ourselves of the corrupt thrall of \npolluting special interests. It is time, at last, to wake up and get to \nwork on the job we have before us.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I want to share in some remarks \nSenator Ayotte had relative to the amendment she submitted that would \npay for the unemployment insurance extension and veteran pensions \nbenefits. I will just say her pay-for is an issue that I have had some \nexperience with. I offered several years ago an amendment to fix the \nsame problem, and I was disappointed when the majority leader, Senator \nReid, objected to that amendment.\n  Senator Ayotte's amendment would pay for the jobless benefits of \nunemployed Americans and restore veterans' pensions by cutting off \nfraudulent tax payments to illegal aliens. This is a very simple \nconcept. There is a clear abuse going on here that needs to be fixed, \nand it should have been fixed a long time ago.\n  The amendment contains an offset of $20 billion--$20 billion--by \nclosing this loophole and ending this abuse of American tax dollars. \nRemember, the veterans' retirement benefit reductions in their \nretirement plans that were voted on recently in this body--part of the \nRyan-Murray budget agreement--only saved $6 billion over 10 years by \naltering the retirement benefits of veterans. So this amendment--\nclosing the tax loophole--would save $20 billion over 10 years.\n  In 2011--this is when the matter first came to my attention by the \nTreasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. Each Department has \nan inspector general. The inspectors general are part of the Obama \nadministration, but they take pride in their independence, and they are \nby and large a very valuable part of the American Government.\n  So this Treasury Inspector General made this statement in a report:\n\n       Millions of people are seeking this tax credit who, we \n     believe, are not entitled to it. We have made recommendations \n     to the IRS as to how they could address this, and they have \n     not taken sufficient action in our view to solve the problem.\n\n  A clear statement by the Inspector General of the U.S. Treasury \nDepartment that there were problems with this policy, and they could be \nfixed, and the Internal Revenue Service was failing to take steps to \nfix the problem.\n  One press report that highlighted the abuses occurring within this \nprogram reported that an illegal alien admitted that his address was \nused to file tax returns by four other illegal workers. All were in the \ncountry working illegally, and they filed tax returns. Did they file \nthe tax returns to pay taxes? No. They filed the tax returns to get a \ntax credit back from the government, a check from the government. They \nclaimed 20 dependents living inside their residence, and the Internal \nRevenue Service sent the illegal tax filers $30,000--direct checks from \nthe U.S. Government, from the U.S. Department of Treasury, went to \nthem. They filed a return, they said they had all these children, and \nthey were given $30,000.\n  According to the report, none of those dependents lived in the United \nStates or had even visited the United States. The illegal alien in the \nstory justified the enormous tax fraud by saying: ``If the opportunity \nis there and they can give it to me, why not take advantage of it?''\n  Well, this is an interesting development. Let's go along a little \nfurther. As the Treasury Inspector General himself said: ``The payment \nof Federal funds through this tax benefit appears to provide an \nadditional incentive for aliens to enter, reside, and work in the \nUnited States without authorization, which contradicts Federal law and \npolicy to remove such incentives.''\n  So the inspector general took the obvious position that it is the \ngovernment's position that people who enter the country illegally ought \nnot to receive tax credit checks from Uncle Sam and that this policy \nnot only encouraged that, it encouraged more people to come to America \nto claim benefits, as this person who entered the country illegally \nsaid: If they can give it to me, why not take advantage of it?\n  Now one of the things I have learned as I have traveled the world is, \na lot of people have an exaggerated opinion of the wealth and power of \nthe United States. You meet good people in underdeveloped countries, \nand they say: Why doesn't the United States do this, that, and the \nother--as if we had unlimited power, unlimited money, and unlimited \nability to solve the problems they face at any given time.\n  So a lot of people, maybe, when they come to the country do not \nrealize we are a nation of limited resources and we cannot be wasting \nmoney, we cannot be having people enter our country contrary to the \nlaw, undocumented, working, taking jobs that Americans need, and then \nsending them big checks--$30,000 for children who do not even exist or \ncertainly have never been in the United States.\n  How do they do it? They use an ITIN, an individual tax identification \nnumber. They do not have Social Security numbers. They have a tax ID \nnumber. Why? That is a tax number that the Treasury Department came up \nwith to\n\n[[Page S62]]\n\nallow noncitizens who do not have Social Security numbers to pay taxes \nto Uncle Sam. That is what it was supposed to be used for. These clever \nindividuals have figured out a way--they do not qualify for a Social \nSecurity number, so they get an ITIN number, and then they immediately \nstart filing a tax return, claiming benefits, tax credits for children \nthey may not even have or are not in the country, and they are not \nentitled to it. It is billions of dollars. According to the best \nestimates we have, if this loophole were closed--that the Treasury \nDepartment themselves has identified--it would save $20 billion over 10 \nyears. Well, that is a lot of money.\n\n  In fact, in 2011, they claimed--and I do not know why it is not \nmore--that illegal aliens received a staggering $4.2 billion in \nrefundable tax credits in 2010. So in 2010, they received illegally \n$4.2 billion under this program. Can you imagine that? That is more \nthan the budget of the State of Alabama--the general fund budget of the \nState. This was in 2010, and it has been growing substantially. It is \nprobably more than that now.\n  So the legislation Senator Ayotte proposes would fix this problem, \nand it is time we fixed it. I cannot imagine why anyone would oppose \nit. The House has passed legislation already that would fix this \nproblem and it died in the Senate. Senator Reid refused to bring it up. \nHe obstructed its passage. It should have long since been passed.\n  So I pose a question to my colleagues: Which would you rather do? \nWould you cut the retirement benefits of men and women who served this \ncountry for 20 years or more in the U.S. military, being deployed in \nharm's way, placing their lives at risk--even those who are disabled as \na result of service in the U.S. military in combat zones; they have \ntheir retirement cut too--would you choose to cut their pay to save $6 \nbillion, when you could cut out a totally unjustified claim of tax \ncredits of $20 billion? Is it political correctness run amok that we \nare dealing with here? Why can't we fix this? So I think this is \nsomething that needs to be fixed. It is past due to be fixed.\n  Senator Ayotte is correct to raise it as a legitimate pay-for for \nunemployment compensation and veterans' retirement, and I salute her \nfor it. It is something I pushed for, and I offered a very similar \namendment when the Murray-Ryan bill moved through the Senate. I think \nit is something we need to work on.\n  We are not talking about as much as we should now the chatter has \nreceded a little bit--but our deficit situation is still very grim. We \nnow have a current debt of $17 trillion. That is unprecedented in the \nhistory of the United States. It has doubled in recent years. They are \nthe kind of deficits we have never seen before, and it is something we \nhave to address.\n  Mr. J.T. Young, in the Washington Times, a former member of the \nDepartment of Treasury, I believe, in the Bush administration, and a \nformer staffer on the Budget Committee, wrote that what we are seeing \nin our budgeting is a tip of the iceberg. The interest payments we are \nmaking now--some $250 billion a year on the $17 trillion we owe--is a \ntip of the iceberg. Because if interest rates return to their 40-year \naverage, we are going to see a dramatic increase in interest payments \non that debt.\n  When we say we have $17 trillion, we are talking about money the U.S. \nGovernment has borrowed so it could spend. That borrowed money comes \nfrom a source. Much of the source of that money are foreign nations. \nThe largest creditor is China. They loan us money, and we pay them \ninterest every year.\n  Right now interest rates are low, unusually low, exceedingly low \naccording to historic averages, and most people expect they are not \ngoing to stay low. The bond market is already slipping because people \nexpect interest rates to go up, making their bonds less valuable. All \nthe experts--virtually all--expect we will have a rising interest rates \nin the year to come.\n  Our Congressional Budget Office analyzes the debt of the United \nStates and our whole fiscal policy--taxing and spending and income and \noutgo and has calculated that 10 years from today, under their baseline \nbudget plan, with interest rates increasing, and the increased \ndeficits--the deficits every year that we will have that will add to \nthe $17 trillion--in 10 years we will be paying interest, each year, of \nover $800 billion.\n  Mr. Young refers to that as a ``third entitlement.'' Actually, under \nthese figures, it looks as though that interest payment will exceed \nSocial Security's payment and Medicare's payment and the Defense \nDepartment. Not together, but each. This is a stunning danger that we \nface. So it is not mean-spirited to say that before we pass an \nunemployment compensation extension beyond our historic levels that we \nneed to ask: Will we just borrow all the money, or will we look around \nthis government and find places to save money such as the child tax \ncredit going to people without Social Security numbers illegally in the \ncountry? What should we do?\n  The challenge we face is how to confront the rising debt. Every year, \nevery month , virtually, some other issue rises before the Senate. It \nsounds persuasive and it is something we want to do, sometimes it is \nsomething we really need to do. Certainly Americans are hurting today. \nThere is no doubt about that. There are a lot of reasons for it. We \nneed to work to reverse those trends. Middle America, poor America are \nnot doing well financially.\n  One reason is, there are millions of people in the country illegally \ntaking jobs, pulling down wages and reducing the employment prospects \nof American citizens. There is no doubt about that. President Obama \nproposed, and this Senate voted by a sizable majority, to double the \namount of guest workers who come into America. Meanwhile, they come \nbefore the Senate and say: We need another $7 billion in unemployment \nbenefits because we have too much unemployment in America. How can that \npossibly resonate logically with the American people? We should control \nimmigration in America. We are a very generous nation of immigrants. We \nsupport immigration. One million people enter our country every year \nlegally. We have guest workers who come every year.\n  The immigration bill that was before us, that was voted on by this \nbody, would have not ended the illegality it would reduce it only by 40 \npercent or so, according to the Congressional Budget Office. But it \nwould have doubled the legal flow of guest workers to America. What a \nstunning number, at a time of high unemployment, low wages, and the \nlowest workplace participation rate this country has seen since the \n1970s.\n  Americans are having a hard time finding work. So we have our \ncolleagues, our Senate majority, who voted for that immigration bill, \nranting to the Senate, demanding now that we extend unemployment \ninsurance, demanding that we raise the minimum wage. Well, I would like \nto see the wages of Americans go up, all of them. I would like to see \npeople make $15, $18, $25, $30 an hour. We need more of that kind of \ngrowth and prosperity in America. But I am not comfortable with the \nFederal Government setting wages and price controls in this country. It \nhas never worked effectively.\n  We should do things that make sense. We should create economic \npolicies that create prosperity. We should not import large increases \nin labor in America when we have huge numbers of people here that are \nunemployed. That is just common sense.\n  I want to share with our colleagues some thoughts about where we are \nwith regard to the unemployment insurance extension legislation that is \nnow before us. Since 2009, the Senate has required that any extension \nof unemployment insurance benefits be paid for because we agreed that \nwe need to reduce the amount of money we are borrowing. We are spending \nconsiderably more than we take in. We are going to have to raise the \ndebt ceiling again next month so we can borrow even more money. So all \nof the money my colleagues want to spend on extending unemployment \ninsurance, unless some savings are found elsewhere in the government, \nwill be borrowed. The legislation that is before us now borrows every \ncent of it. Every cent of the $7 billion that is proposed will be \nborrowed.\n  We are $17 trillion in debt, much owed to foreign creditors. It does \nnot seem wise to do this. This is the wrong thing. In the past, \nCongress has paid for unemployment insurance extensions. This is \nunprecedented, an\n\n[[Page S63]]\n\nextranormal unemployment insurance extension. The current amount is \nalways out there, but because the unemployment rate has been high, we \nhave extended it up to 99 weeks. We paid for this in 2009. We paid for \nit in 2011, and we paid for it in 2012.\n  So clearly the Senate's policy approach has been consistent in recent \nyears to pay for this. Many remember our former colleague, Jim Bunning, \nthat Hall of Fame baseball pitcher, who stood right back here and \nobjected to this one time before, I think it was in 2009, all alone and \nhe insisted that it be paid for, and eventually he prevailed. It caused \nquite a stir. He stopped the train until there was an agreement to pay \nfor this.\n  According to a report yesterday in National Journal, some Senators \nwant to rush this bill through now and will worry about paying for it \nlater. They will promise to pay for it later. This ``spend now, pay \nlater'' policy is how we racked up $17 trillion in debt. It is smoke \nand mirrors. If you do not in this Congress agree to pay for something \nbefore it is spent, it is not going to be paid for later. We have got \ndebt in the hundreds of billions of dollars every year and we are \ncertainly not going to go back and pay for more, pay down the money we \nspent the year before. We have got to deal with the year we are in. If \nwe do that, it would be helpful. This is how we go broke.\n  But what I want to say is, fundamentally, the spending provided for \nin this extension of unemployment insurance violates the spirit of the \nBudget Control Act of 2011. It spends money above what we agreed to \nspend. It should not be done. We need to know, every one of us, that by \nvoting for this bill, you are voting to violate the promise you made to \nthe American people in August of 2011 that we would limit the growth in \nspending, not cut spending, but limit the growth in spending, that we \nwould raise the debt ceiling $2.1 trillion so that money could be \nborrowed and be spent, but we would reduce, over 10 years, the growth \nin spending enough to offset that increase. That was the bargain that \nwas made.\n\n  More importantly, this legislation violates the budget agreement that \nwas passed into law, the Murray-Ryan bill that was signed by President \nObama just before Christmas--just a few weeks ago. The ink is barely \ndry on that agreement and my colleagues now are proposing to bust it \ncompletely. This has become too common. This is too much how we operate \nhere. Some of our Members take umbrage at the fact that millions of \nAmericans are unhappy with us in Washington. People complain about how \nwe are doing our jobs. They say the Tea Party people are angry and \ntherefore they are evil people. Well, why should they not be angry with \nus? We promised not to spend over a certain amount of money and we have \nrepeatedly voted to do that since 2011.\n  We voted in December to contain spending and maintain spending \nlevels. Now, in January, as soon as the year began, we have a proposal \nto add $7 billion to the debt above what we agreed to spend. So I think \nthe American people have a right to be hot with us. We need to vote \nsome people out of here. If we do not change the spending habit, this \ncountry is going to be facing a fiscal catastrophe as independent \nobservers have warned us for years.\n  Next month, the President is going to ask Republicans for our help in \npassing a bill that raises the debt ceiling. We have already hit the \ndebt ceiling again. So he will be asking for us to raise it again, \nbecause we need to borrow more money because we haven't cut spending. \nWe are spending more money than comes in. We are spending that every \nyear. The President wants to keep spending and not reduce spending. So \nhe is asking us to raise the debt ceiling to let him borrow even more \nthan the $17 trillion we have. They are going to threaten, cajole, and \ntry to scare Americans with horror stories of imminent financial \ncollapse if we do not agree to raise the debt ceiling. We know that is \ncoming. Hopefully we will reach an agreement that will raise the debt \nceiling but get some real reforms in this government and bring down the \nrate of growth in spending in this country.\n  But how can we talk about promise to contain spending in the future \nwhen we have got a bill before us right now that blatantly violates the \nBudget Act? All we are doing is spending more money, borrowing more \nmoney, and raising the debt ceiling even faster than otherwise would be \nthe case. This is the wrong direction for America. We need to be \nreducing our deficit, not voting to increase deficits. This is simple \nand plain. We need to be reducing deficits.\n  We need to be working every day, as the American people have told us, \nto bring our spending under control. Wasteful Washington spending is \nthreatening America. The Federal Government already taxes too much, \nspends too much, borrows too much, regulates too much. It is time for \nus to live within our means, to balance our budget. That includes \nfinding offsets and spending savings to pay for any extension of \nunemployment insurance or really any other proposal for new spending.\n  This Congress has not been doing that. I would note that in the New \nYork Times recently, Jonathan Weisman wrote this:\n\n       The drive to extend unemployment insurance has put both \n     parties into awkward political positions. Mr. Reid opened the \n     second session of the 113th Congress Monday by declaring: \n     `The rich keep getting richer. The poor keep getting poorer, \n     and the middle class are under siege.' It was hardly an \n     endorsement for an economy entering its sixth year under \n     President Obama's watch.\n\n  Gene Sperling, the President's economic advisor, just said this \nrecently. ``Three people are looking for every one job open.''\n  So what are we to do about this? What do we say about this? I would \nsay, colleagues, that while hopefully we can help unemployed Americans \ntoday with some sort of a benefit that we will pay for in a financially \nsound manner, hopefully we will see wages rise. We need to see wages \nrise, in my opinion, because I think the middle class is under siege. I \nthink poor people are getting hammered in this current economy.\n  But I will ask this question: Who has been setting the agenda \neconomically for America for the last 5 years? Has not President Obama \ntaxed more? Hasn't he regulated more? Has he not spent more? Hasn't he \nborrowed more? Hasn't ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act, hammered \nAmerican businesses and caused them to lay off workers and hire people \npart time rather than full time?\n  Actually two-thirds of the people hired in 2013 were hired part time. \nThis is not healthy. Things are not going well. The model that is \nplanned that we are seeing overall is not working.\n  How much longer will it take for people to recognize that? The \npromises were made. If we just send out more checks, if we pass more \nstimulus bills, if we spend more money, if we do all these things, \nsomehow this will create growth and prosperity in America. But all this \ntime, we have been increasing the debt dramatically, trillion-plus-\ndollar deficits for 4 years. We have never seen anything like this in \nAmerican history.\n  The debt itself is a detriment and a depressant to economic growth in \nAmerica. It causes fear and concern throughout the entire American \npopulace and the world, unease about the future of the United States \nwith these kinds of debts.\n  The point I would make is let's do some things that fix the disease, \nand the disease is an excessive government domination of the economy \nthat is suppressing growth and prosperity, suppressing wages, and \ngovernment actions that create more unemployment and part-time \nemployment than is necessary and should be happening. That is the \nproblem we need to be addressing. The symptoms of that are being \naddressed when we deal with unemployment insurance or mandatory wage \nrates.\n  I thank the Chair and my colleagues for the opportunity to share \nthese thoughts. I really do believe Senator Ayotte's proposal to deal \nwith the waste and fraudulent abuse of tax money through the improper \nuse of the ITIN--the individual tax identification number--is very \nreal. It is very effective, would save billions of dollars, and would \nhelp us pay for some of the things we would like to do. That is what we \nshould be doing, not adding more debt to the people of America.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S64]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. I come to the floor this evening to express my hope that \nthe bipartisan effort that brought this 3-month bill to the floor can \nbe sustained as we go forward so that we can swiftly help the 1.3 \nmillion long-term unemployed workers who were cut off from these \nbenefits on December 28. As many of my colleagues have discovered from \ngoing back to their home States, in many cases these folks are \ndesperate. This benefit was the difference between things we take for \ngranted--having a car to be able to get to a job, having a cell phone \nso they can get a message saying they have a job interview, paying for \nheat in the cold weather, putting groceries on the table. For many \npeople, this is truly an emergency.\n  That is why working with Senator Heller, whom I applaud for his \nvision, collaboration, and for his sense in terms of the difficulties \nof his constituents and, nationally, many people, and for his effort--\nhe did a superb job. What we sensed was we needed to provide relief \nimmediately. Longer term, there are issues to address, and my \ncolleagues have been on the floor discussing these issues, but \nimmediately we have 1.3 million Americans, and every day many more who \nneed help go off the rolls.\n  I hope we can move very expeditiously and provide at least this \nshort-term aid. Then, of course, we have very significant issues going \nforward for the entire-year extension, which I hope ultimately we can \nresolve.\n  In addition to Senator Heller, I wish to thank all of my colleagues. \nParticularly, I thank Senators Collins, Murkowski, Portman, Ayotte, and \nCoats for their support, along with all of our Members of the \nDemocratic caucus who came together.\n  Now we have the challenge of providing this relief and then thinking \ncreatively, constructively, and collaboratively about how we provide \nthis relief at least through the full year. I hope we can extend the \nprogram for the next 90 days immediately and quickly, but that other \nissue is certainly before us.\n  I understand also that my colleagues have raised issues about the \nstructure of the program, about whether this spending--even the short-\nterm spending--should be offset. Again, I go back to the point that we \nhave 1.3 million Americans--and growing each day--who are looking for \nimmediate help, not thoughtful, careful, long-term deliberation. That \nwas the logic behind moving to a 90-day extension, getting it done, and \nthen going forward and dealing with inherently more difficult issues \nfor a full-year program.\n  We already understand that short-term lapse from the 28th until today \nhas already had dramatic impacts on families. This is what I think my \ncolleagues have heard, seen, and read about when they have gone home. \nMen and women who worked for decades, never thinking they would ever \nuse their unemployment benefits, which they have earned since they \nstarted working, are now suddenly facing a weakened job market where \nthere are nearly three people for every one job, where there are issues \nof skill training for the new jobs that are emerging. These are very \ndifficult challenges.\n  I think what finally led us to at least this point of moving forward \nwas the perception that this program is not subject to some arcane \nabuse by people in the system; this is for working men and women who, \nthrough no fault of their own, lost their jobs, who are desperately \nlooking for jobs, and they are our neighbors and our constituents--many \nof whom we thought and they thought would never be in this predicament. \nThey have families, elderly parents, and young children. They have \nresponsibilities.\n  They have something else too, which I think we sometimes don't give \nenough credit for: They want to work. They have spent a life, many of \nthem, working to a position of responsibility where they are using all \nof their talents. The idea that they are just going to give that up for \nthe only available job, which might be working at a counter at a fast-\nfood restaurant--that is a challenge not only to your pocketbook, but \nthat is a challenge to your person, to who you are--we have to \nrecognize that also.\n  These benefits are usually helpful to people in so many different \ncapacities.\n  As I said, we are trying to deal with a situation where people have \nbeen let go through no fault of their own. If someone quits, they don't \nqualify. If they are fired, they don't qualify. Many of these people \nare unemployed as a result of the new economy--information technology \nthat makes their job something that can be done away with; mergers, \nacquisitions, and downsizing that caused the bottom line of a \ncorporation to grow, but they are out of a job. We have to deal with \nit, and we have to deal with it as we have done so many times before by \nproviding these long-term unemployment benefits.\n  We also have to do it because it is good for our economy. The CBO \nestimates that if we do not renew UI for the full year 2014, we will \nlose 200,000 jobs because the weekly benefits, which are rather \nmodest--$300 to $350 a week--go almost immediately from the recipient \ninto the economy. It is the reason some grocery stores can keep two or \nthree extra people on, because the demand is still there. It is the \nreason some service stations can keep the extra mechanic on, because \nthe demand is still there. If we shut down that demand, we will have \n200,000 more people--ironically--who will qualify, at least initially, \nfor State unemployment benefits.\n  This is about our economy.\n  I would like to draw our attention to the report our colleague \nSenator Amy Klobuchar did as the vice chair of the Joint Economic \nCommittee. It was very thoughtfully done. It is not a surprise given \nthat it was authored in large part by Senator Klobuchar. This report \ntouches on these important issues and notes that ``unemployment \ninsurance (UI) has kept more than 11 million people out of poverty \nsince 2008--including 1.8 million adults and 620,000 children in 2012 \nalone. People of all demographic and socio-economic backgrounds have \nbeen helped by unemployment insurance following a job loss.''\n  This cuts across the whole spectrum. Again, how does someone get to \nqualify? They have to work. I would suspect that every one of my \ncolleagues would say this country should be all about work, rewarding \nwork, and if someone loses a job through no fault of their own, give \nthem a chance to get back in the workforce.\n  The reality of this economic downturn has been so pervasive that it \nhas affected virtually every American. And so unemployment insurance \nhas been a key part of the recovery. We all know that economists who \nhave looked at this program suggest there is anywhere from a $1.50 to \n$1.60 benefit for every $1 we put in the economy. Economically, for the \nnational economy as a whole, this is a very powerful tool to keep \neconomic growth, expansion, and demand moving forward. That is exactly \nwhat we need to keep the economy growing.\n  Indeed, one of the aspects of this recession and one of the aspects \nhighlighted very insightfully by the report from the Joint Economic \nCommittee is the long-term rate of unemployment. This might be a new \nstructural phenomenon in our economy, but definitely something is \nhappening out there.\n  I will go back to when I was a kid. Someone is on the third shift \nbecause they are the junior person. The recession comes and guess who \ngets laid off. The third shift. The second shift, the middle people, \nand the first shift, the most senior people, typically weren't touched. \nThe economy came back, and that third shift got rehired, but those \nworkers with 10, 15 years' experience were pretty safe.\n  Now that is not the case. Now we are seeing first, second, and third \nshift gone. Now we are seeing, well, this is a great opportunity, with \ninterest rates at in some cases 1 percent--at least for the major \nfinancial institutions--to replace a lot of workers with a lot of \nmachines. Let's do that. Let's get value. Let's downsize. Let's make \nsure we invest in capital. This is the phenomenon we are seeing, and it \nis causing some of this significant increase in long-term unemployment.\n  In the JEC report, they note:\n\n       The current long-term unemployment rate of 2.6 percent is \n     twice as high as it was when Congress allowed emergency \n     federal UI programs to expire after the 1990-91 and 2001 \n     recessions.\n\n\n[[Page S65]]\n\n\n  Let me say that in my terms. Previously, we have never taken away \nthese benefits when long-term unemployment has been so high, and these \nbenefits are not directly responsible for long-term unemployment. The \n26 weeks of the State benefit programs is for people who lose work and \nfind it relatively quickly. This program, the one we are debating \ntoday, is specifically designed for those people who are having a \ndifficult time finding work over a long period of time.\n  We are now at twice as high a level of unemployment as we were in \nprevious recessions when we ended these benefits, which would suggest \nthis is not the time to end these benefits.\n  Let me continue from the JEC report:\n\n       While employment prospects have improved for many jobless \n     Americans (the national unemployment rate is 7.0 percent--the \n     lowest rate in five years), finding work is challenging for \n     the long-term unemployed. More than one-third of unemployed \n     workers (roughly 4 million Americans) have been searching for \n     work for more than 26 weeks, when state-funded UI benefits \n     typically run out, and 2.8 million unemployed people have \n     been searching for work for more than one year.\n\n  This is a phenomenon we have to deal with. This program we are \ndiscussing today is specifically designed for those long-term \nunemployed. So if there is one program that is responsive to one of the \nmost salient aspects of this current recession, it is the long-term UI \nprogram because long-term unemployment seems to be the most difficult \nissue to resolve, even as our overall employment numbers continue to \ngrow--not fast enough, but they are growing.\n  I want to also dispel the belief of some of my colleagues that these \nbenefits only flow to one or two distinct constituencies. That this is \na targeted program that provides some benefits, but it doesn't apply \nacross the board. That is not the case. This is about every American \nfrom virtually every type of education, income, and ethnic background.\n\n  As the JEC report documents:\n\n       The 23.9 million Americans who have directly benefited from \n     the EUC program since 2008 include people of all demographic \n     and socioeconomic backgrounds . . . [I]n 2012, more than 60 \n     percent of the recipients were between the ages of 25 and 54.\n\n  Let me stop. There is a stereotype out there that a lot of these \nfolks are 18 year olds who had a job for a while but decided they would \nrather go skiing in Utah or snorkeling in the Caribbean, and what \nbetter way to do that than just essentially sort of perform so that \nwhen the layoffs come you get one--but so what, I am not going to look \nfor work; I'm going to just go. Sixty percent of these people are 25 \nyears old to 54 years old. They are starting the prime or are in the \nprime of their work career. They have responsibility. They typically \nhave families. They have, probably, if they are in their 50s, been \nworking for 30 years.\n  So this notion this is just a convenient time to take a vacation \nsubsidized by the government is erroneous.\n  Let me continue from the report:\n\n       The remaining recipients were about evenly split between \n     those younger than 25 and those 55 and older.\n\n  Again, the 55 and older--and this is very close to home--for these \npeople it is a desperate struggle because they are caught right in the \nmiddle. They have a 75-year-old or 80-year-old mother or father; they \nhave 30-year-old children and some younger who are going to school or \nthey need the help. They have been working for 30-plus years. They have \nreached positions of responsibility in their firm and now, suddenly, \nfor the first time--many is the case--they are without a job. That is \nnot just economic, as I suggested. That also goes deeply to who they \nare, their value, and how they can help their family if they can't \nwork. What is the effect on the family? How do they come home every day \nfrom looking for work without a job and not have it affect the family? \nThis is the reality we are dealing with.\n  That is why, frankly, I have been pleading to at least get this \nprogram restored for 90 days. That will give us the time--not on the \nbacks of the unemployed--but give us the time to do the work for a \nlonger extension.\n  Now let me continue:\n\n       More than half the recipients in 2012 were white, while 22 \n     percent were black, and 19 percent were Hispanic. The vast \n     majority (85 percent) lived in households with more than one \n     adult, and 43 percent lived in households with at least one \n     child.\n\n  So these are not single transients who move around and are used to \nbeing unemployed and could work if they wanted to. These are people \nwith real family responsibilities.\n\n       People of all levels of education have received EUC \n     benefits. The majority of recipients in 2012 had earned a \n     high school diploma, and almost one-fifth held a 4-year \n     college degree.\n\n  These are people that have skills. They have at least got the \ncredentials, which, again, 20 or 30 years ago put you into the \nworkplace and probably kept you there, if you were diligent.\n  So I hope my colleagues take time to review this report. It is \nextremely useful. It shatters some stereotypes and reinforces the point \nthis is about helping working Americans who need help.\n  I think the facts are clearly on the side of continuing this program, \nand I think the reality is they need the help now. If we can get them \nthat help, then we will have the time to deliberate the very serious \nquestions that my colleagues have raised; and they have raised them \nconstructively and raised them sincerely about the long-term approach \nof this program. But to continue to trade legislative ideas on the \nfloor while millions of Americans either are losing their benefits or \nare seeing the end come within days, weeks or months is not the right \nresponse.\n  So I urge my colleagues to move forward through these procedural \nhurdles. Let's get this bill done as Senator Heller and I have proposed \nit. Let's get it done, and then we have another huge challenge because \nwe want, frankly, and I think the sentiment is across the board--if we \nare going to do this, let us at least continue it through the year \n2014.\n  We are beginning to sense some positive economic shifts. We hope \nthose materialize. We hope they come forward to the point where the \nunemployment rate, which has fallen--I heard the President today say \nwhen he took over we were losing 800,000 jobs a month. It was rocketing \nup into the stratosphere in some states, 12 percent, 14 percent. In \nRhode Island it is still 9 percent. We have seen some progress--not \nenough in my State, in Nevada, and other States. But we have seen \nprogress, and we hope that progress continues.\n  Indeed, one of the other aspects of this program, if we pass these \nbenefits--and the economists have pointed it out, particularly if we \npass them on an emergency basis--it will add more fuel to our economy, \nnot less. It will add more demand. It will, in fact, increase growth at \na time when everyone is on the floor talking about the fact that we \njust have to grow more jobs. Of course we do. But this program is, in a \nway, the proverbial two-fer. You help people who need help, and you \nhelp the economy grow faster--200,000 jobs at least.\n  So I really do think we should move forward as quickly as we can to \nget this Reed-Heller bill completed, and then we have a lot of careful, \nthoughtful, collaborative effort to engage in. Because if we want to go \nforward for a full year, which we do, we have other significant \nissues--not just the size of the program, but other issues as were \nbrought up by my colleagues, and brought up very fairly, very \nconstructively, and very thoughtfully.\n  So Madam President, my message is: No. 1, I thank my colleagues for \ngiving us the chance to seriously debate this bill, and I urge them to \npass it quickly, and then we will set ourselves up for another serious, \nthoughtful and constructive debate. That is my wish.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/07/senate-section/article/S65-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S65-S66]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REED.

Madam President, I rise today to bid farewell to a \nKentucky son who became half of one of the most enduring and \ninfluential acts of country and rock and roll music. Phil Everly, of \nthe hit-making duo the Everly Brothers, passed away this weekend at the \nage of 74.\n  Phil and his older brother Don brought their trademark close harmony \nsinging, modeled in the Appalachian country and bluegrass music \ntradition, to rock and roll beginning in the late 1950s. With songs \nincluding ``Bye Bye Love,'' ``Wake Up Little Susie,'' and ``All I Have \nto Do Is Dream,'' they consistently scored hits at the top of the \ncharts.\n  The Everly Brothers are famous the world over and influenced \nmusicians such as the Beatles, the Beach Boys, Bob Dylan, Simon and \nGarfunkel, and many others. But they were especially beloved in their \nfamily's home State of Kentucky, and particularly in Central City, in \nMuhlenberg County, western Kentucky, which was the site of the Everly \nBrothers' Labor Day Homecoming Music Festival every year.\n  This festival included many famous country and rock and roll music \nstars from the Everly Brothers themselves to Chet Atkins, Keith Urban, \nBilly Ray Cyrus, and Tammy Wynette. Money raised went to local \ncharities.\n  Phil and Don Everly's musical career was the result of a lifetime \nspent singing. Phil and Don were born the sons of a Kentucky coal miner \nturned country musician, Ike Everly, and his wife Margaret. The family \nmoved to pursue musical opportunities and ended up playing live country \nmusic on the radio in Shenandoah, IA. The whole family was spotlighted, \nfrom Mom and Dad Everly to Little Donnie and 6-year-old ``Baby Boy \nPhil.'' Don and Phil spent their summers in their parents' home of \nMuhlenberg County.\n  As teenagers the Everly Brothers started their own careers, first as \nsongwriters, then as performers. In 1957 they scored a No. 1 hit with \n``Bye Bye Love.'' In their trademark style, Phil sang the high harmony \nnotes while Don sang baritone, their voices intertwining in a way that \nsounded easy but was difficult to duplicate.\n  They continued to have best-selling songs for several years, \nincluding 12 Billboard top 10 hits, and released the landmark country-\nrock album ``Roots'' in 1968 that included snippets of their old family \nradio show. The Beatles have said that the vocal harmonies from their \nfirst No. 1 hit, ``Please Please Me'' of 1963, were modeled after the \nEverly Brothers' 1960 hit song ``Cathy's Clown.'' Phil was the author \nof one of the duo's best loved songs, ``When Will I Be Loved?,'' which \nwas a top 10 hit for Linda Ronstadt in 1975.\n  While older brother Don was born in Kentucky, younger brother Phil \nwas actually born in Chicago on January 19, 1939. Nearly 50 years \nlater, in 1988, the mayor of Central City gave Phil Everly an honorary \nKentucky birth certificate. ``I really appreciate you making me a full-\nblown Kentuckian,'' Phil said as he received it. ``I've been lying for \na lot of years.''\n  The Everly Brothers' Labor Day Homecoming Music Festival began in \n1988 as a way for the Everly Brothers to show their gratitude to their \nhometown fans. In 2010, the Central City Tourism Commission opened the \nMuhlenberg County Music Museum, which showcases a complete collection \nof Don and Phil's albums and features a 1950s-style jukebox that plays \ntheir biggest hits.\n  Sadly, just before Phil's death, local western Kentucky fans of the \nEverly Brothers were planning a celebration of what would have been \nPhil's 75th birthday on January 19. Instead, the Central City Tourism \nCommission will host a memorial service at the museum on that day to \ncelebrate Phil's life and music. Phil is survived by many family \nmembers and beloved friends, including his brother Don.\n  I know my colleagues will join me in expressing gratitude and \nappreciation for the wonderful music that Phil, along with his brother \nDon, provided the world. The music of the Everly Brothers continues to \nprovide joy to people to this day. Kentucky is honored to have played \nsuch a role in the shaping of this extraordinary musical family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/07/senate-section/article/S66-2", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S66]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                         California Casualties\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Madam President, I rise to enter into a colloquy with \nthe Senator from Ohio, Mr. Portman, to discuss section 114(c) of the \nBipartisan Budget Act of 2013, which establishes a deficit-neutral \nreserve fund to replace sequestration.\n  Before I turn to Senator Portman for his questions, I would like to \nnote that the Senate has relied on reserve funds for nearly 30 years to \nhelp it carry out its priorities as part of the annual budget process. \nIn fact, during debate on the 2014 budget resolution, the Senate \nconsidered or filed over 300 reserve funds. These included multiple \namendments from Members of both parties to create new reserve funds. \nThis particular reserve fund, section 114(c), was included and voted on \nas part of both the Senate Budget Committee-reported resolution and the \nSenate-passed budget resolution.\n  I would now like to turn to my colleague for his questions.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I would like to thank the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee for the opportunity to engage in this colloquy with her. As I \nunderstand it, the intent of the reserve fund under section 114(c) is \nto be available to adjust certain budgetary levels for deficit-neutral \nlegislation that would replace sequestration. Do I have that correct?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Yes, the bipartisan budget agreement reached between the \nHouse and Senate replaces some of the sequester cuts that otherwise \nwould occur in 2014 and 2015. By avoiding sequestration and reaching \nagreement on bipartisan funding levels for 2014 and 2015, this \nagreement will provide relief to our families, servicemembers, and the \neconomy. Sequestration, however, continues to remain in place, \nunmodified, for fiscal years 2016 through 2021. Assuming legislation \nmet the necessary requirements specified in section 114(c), this \nreserve fund would be available to further address the harmful effects \nof sequestration.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I thank the chairman for her response. There is a \nconcern that the reserve fund in section 114(c) could deprive the \nminority of an opportunity to require 60 votes for legislation that \nwould modify the statutory limits on discretionary spending and pay for \nsome or all of that cost with new revenue. Is that concern accurate?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator for his question. No, that concern \nis not accurate. While a useful tool to help the Senate carry out its \npriorities under the budget process, a reserve fund is limited in what \nit allows me to do, in my capacity as chairman of the Budget Committee. \nIn general, for legislation that meets the required criteria, reserve \nfunds allow me to revise the levels adopted in a budget resolution and \nenforced in the Senate, such as committee allocations and the budgetary \naggregates.\n  A reserve fund, however, does not have any impact on the standing \nrules of the Senate, including the cloture process and the need for 60 \nvotes to end debate. Nothing in the Bipartisan Budget Act would change \nthat process.\n  A reserve fund also does not waive budget points of order. I can use \na reserve fund to revise the committee allocations and budgetary \naggregates, such that legislation that meets the criteria of the \nreserve fund, including deficit neutrality, can be brought into \ncompliance with the allocations and aggregates. But, it does not allow \nme to waive budget points of order that still may lie against the \nlegislation following the reserve fund adjustment. Budget points of \norder generally can only be waived by unanimous consent or with 60 \nvotes. Nothing in the Bipartisan Budget Act would change that.\n  Further, the Senator from Ohio proposed the specific hypothetical \nexample of legislation that would increase the statutory limits on \ndiscretionary spending and offset some or all of those costs with new \nrevenue. Recognizing this is a hypothetical scenario, I believe in that \nsituation the legislation would be subject to a 60-vote point of order \nfor violating section 306 of the Congressional Budget Act, which \ncreates a point of order against legislation dealing with matters \nwithin the jurisdiction of the Budget Committee that has not been \nreported out of the Budget Committee. Ultimately, the Parliamentarian \nof the Senate determines whether points of order under section 306 lie \nagainst legislation, but legislation to alter the statutory limits in \ndiscretionary spending has historically been within the jurisdiction of \nthe Budget Committee. A reserve fund would have no impact on a section \n306 point of order and nothing in the Bipartisan Budget Act would \nchange that.\n  In addition, legislation increasing the statutory caps on \ndiscretionary spending above the existing levels, as the Senator from \nOhio outlines in his question, would also violate section 312(b) of the \nCongressional Budget Act, which prohibits consideration of legislation \nthat would exceed any of the statutory limits on discretionary \nspending. The reserve fund in 114(c), like other reserve funds, deals \nonly with Senate enforcement and would have no impact on that point of \norder. Again, nothing in the Bipartisan Budget Act would change that.\n  Finally, I would suggest to my colleague that legislation originating \nin the Senate rather than in the House of Representatives that raises \nrevenue would likely be subject to a ``blue slip'' and returned back to \nthe Senate by the House of Representatives. Again, nothing in the \nBipartisan Budget Act would change that process.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I thank the Chairman for her answer. I understand that \nwe were discussing a hypothetical example. I thank her for engaging \nwith me in this colloquy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/07/senate-section/article/S67-2", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S67]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. THUNE.

Madam President, today I wish to recognize the women of \nthe U.S. Cadet Nurse Corps. Approximately 125,000 American women served \nas Corps members during World War II, providing comfort and care at \nhospitals across the country, including in New Hampshire. Most of the \nformer Corps members are now in their eighties, and it is incumbent \nupon us to ensure that the lessons of their service are remembered for \nthe benefit of future generations.\n  In March of 1943, Congresswoman Frances P. Bolton of Ohio, a strong \nbeliever in the power of nurses in the healing process, introduced \nlegislation to ensure that the supply of nurses in the United States \nwould be large enough to meet the increasing demands of the war effort, \nespecially as large numbers of experienced nurses left the country to \nserve overseas. The Bolton Act promised a free nursing education in \nexchange for a commitment to serve in the Cadet Nurse Corps for the \nduration of the war.\n  Driven by the immediate need for more nurses, Corps members worked \novertime to finish their studies within a compressed study schedule and \nbegan to perform nursing duties even before they had formally \ngraduated. This on-the-job training ensured that civilians and \nrecovering servicemembers continued to receive necessary medical care \neven as much of the medical community was focused on the war front.\n  Members of the U.S. Cadet Nurse Corps took an oath to dedicate \nthemselves to the triumph of life over death at a time when this \nperpetual struggle took on previously unseen dimensions. Like many of \nthe American soldiers fighting overseas, these women were predominantly \nyoung, recent high school graduates who, when confronted with the call \nto serve their country,\n\n[[Page S68]]\n\nanswered unhesitatingly and in large numbers.\n  I ask my colleagues in the Senate to join me in thanking all former \nCadet Nurse Corps members for their service to the country and for \ntheir the selfless commitment to the nursing profession.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/07/senate-section/article/S68-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S68]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/07/senate-section/article/S68-2", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S68]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/07/senate-section/article/S68-3", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S68]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n PROPOSED AGREEMENT FOR COOPERATION BETWEEN THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE IN \nTAIWAN (AIT) AND THE TAIPEI ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE \n   IN THE UNITED STATES (TECRO) CONCERNING PEACEFUL USES OF NUCLEAR \n                             ENERGY--PM 26\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit to the Congress, pursuant to sections 123 b. \nand 123 d. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. \n2153(b), (d)) (the ``Act''), the text of a proposed Agreement for \nCooperation Between the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) and the \nTaipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States \n(TECRO) Concerning Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy (the ``Agreement''). \nI am also pleased to transmit my written approval, authorization, and \ndetermination concerning the Agreement, and an unclassified Nuclear \nProliferation Assessment Statement (NPAS) concerning the Agreement.

In my judgment, it meets all applicable \nstatutory requirements and will advance the nonproliferation and other \nforeign policy interests of the United States.\n  The proposed Agreement provides a comprehensive framework for \npeaceful nuclear cooperation with the authorities on Taiwan based on a \nmutual commitment to nuclear nonproliferation. The proposed Agreement \nhas an indefinite term from the date of its entry-into-force, unless \nterminated by either party on 1 year's written notice. The proposed \nAgreement permits the transfer of information, material, equipment \n(including reactors), and components for nuclear research and nuclear \npower production. The Agreement also specifies cooperation shall be in \naccordance with the provisions of the Agreement and applicable legal \nobligations, including, as appropriate, treaties, international \nagreements, domestic laws, regulations, and/or licensing requirements \n(such as those imposed by the NRC in accordance with 10 CFR 110 and the \nDepartment of Energy in accordance with 10 CFR 810). It does not permit \ntransfers of Restricted Data, sensitive nuclear technology and \nfacilities, or major critical components of such facilities. The \nproposed Agreement also prohibits the possession of sensitive nuclear \nfacilities and any engagement in activities involving sensitive nuclear \ntechnology in the territory of the authorities represented by TECRO. In \nthe event of termination of the proposed Agreement, key \nnonproliferation conditions and controls continue with respect to \nmaterial, equipment, and components subject to the proposed Agreement.\n  Over the last two decades, the authorities on Taiwan have established \na reliable record on nonproliferation and on commitments to \nnonproliferation. While the political status of the authorities on \nTaiwan prevents them from formally acceding to multilateral \nnonproliferation treaties or agreements, the authorities on Taiwan have \nvoluntarily assumed commitments to adhere to the provisions of \nmultilateral treaties and initiatives. The Republic of China ratified \nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in 1970 \nand ratified the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, \nProduction and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin \nWeapons and on Their Destruction (the ``Biological Weapons Convention'' \nor ``BWC'') in 1972. The authorities on Taiwan have stated that they \nwill continue to abide by the obligations of the NPT (i.e., those of a \nnon-nuclear-weapon state) and the BWC, and the United States regards \nthem as bound by both treaties. The authorities on Taiwan follow \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency standards and directives in their \nnuclear program, work closely with U.S. civilian nuclear authorities, \nand have established relationships with mainland Chinese civilian \nauthorities with respect to nuclear safety. A more detailed discussion \nof the domestic civil nuclear activities and nuclear nonproliferation \npolicies and practices of the authorities on Taiwan, including their \nnuclear export policies and practices, is provided in the NPAS and in a \nclassified annex to the NPAS submitted separately. As noted above, an \naddendum to the NPAS containing a comprehensive analysis of the export \ncontrol system of the authorities on Taiwan with respect to nuclear-\nrelated matters is being submitted to you separately by the Director of \nNational Intelligence.\n  I have considered the views and recommendations of the interested \nagencies in reviewing the proposed Agreement and have determined that \nits performance will promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable \nrisk to, the common defense and security. Accordingly, I have approved \nthe Agreement and authorized its execution and urge the Congress to \ngive it favorable consideration.\n  This transmission shall constitute a submittal for purposes of both \nsections 123 b. and 123 d. of the Act. My Administration is prepared to \nbegin immediately the consultations with the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee as provided in \nsection 123 b. Upon completion of the 30 days of continuous session \nreview provided for in section 123 b., the 60 days of continuous \nsession review provided for in section 123 d. shall commence.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \n  The White House, January 7, 2014.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/07/senate-section/article/S68-4", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S68]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. BROWN:\n       S. 1896.

                         S.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to Calendar No. 270, S. Res. 288.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 288) supporting unenhanced maritime \n     security in the gulf of Guinea and encouraging increased \n     cooperation between the United States and West and Central \n     African countries to fight armed robbery at sea, piracy, and \n     other maritime threats.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 288) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 288\n\n       Whereas, although the number of armed robbery at sea and \n     piracy attacks worldwide dropped substantially in recent \n     years, such acts in the Gulf of Guinea are increasing, with \n     more than 40 reported through October 2013 and many more \n     going unreported;\n       Whereas the United States imported more than 315,000,000 \n     barrels of oil through the region in 2012, and United States \n     businesses have extensive fixed assets in the region that are \n     important to United States energy security;\n       Whereas the nature of attacks in the Gulf of Guinea \n     demonstrates an ongoing pattern of cargo thefts and robbery, \n     often occurring in the territorial waters of West and Central \n     African states;\n       Whereas there are countries in West and Central Africa that \n     are susceptible to acts of armed robbery at sea and piracy \n     that lack adequate law enforcement and naval capabilities to \n     stop or deter such attacks;\n       Whereas acts of maritime crime raise the costs and risks of \n     trade and commerce in Africa and beyond because the security \n     of vessels, crews, and cargoes cannot be guaranteed;\n       Whereas shipping insurance premiums increase after such \n     attacks, and in so doing, create disincentives for local, \n     regional, and international investors and companies seeking \n     to do business in the region;\n       Whereas imports provide indispensable goods and services \n     for the people of West and Central Africa, generate port fees \n     and customs duties for their governments, and are essential \n     in spurring economic growth and development in the region;\n       Whereas the U.S. Strategy Toward Sub-Saharan Africa issued \n     by President Barack Obama in June 2012 states, ``It is in the \n     interest of the United States to improve the region's trade \n     competitiveness, encourage the diversification of exports \n     beyond natural resources, and ensure that the benefits from \n     growth are broad-based.'';\n       Whereas a vibrant trade relationship between Africa and its \n     partners, including the United States, can lead to expanded \n     economic opportunities that can spur competition, raise \n     productivity, and facilitate job creation in the economies of \n     all participating countries;\n       Whereas the African Union, in collaboration with numerous \n     official and nongovernmental stakeholders, developed the \n     ``2050 Africa's Integrated Maritime Security'' strategy (the \n     2050 AIM STRATEGY) which seeks ``to address contending, \n     emerging and future maritime challenges and opportunities in \n     Africa . . . with a clear focus on enhanced wealth creation \n     from a sustainable governance of Africa's oceans and seas'';\n       Whereas the African Union's 2050 AIM STRATEGY seeks to \n     combat ``diverse illegal activities which include . . . arms \n     and drug trafficking, human trafficking and smuggling, \n     piracy, and armed robbery at sea'', among other objectives;\n       Whereas the June 24-25, 2013, meeting of the Gulf of Guinea \n     Maritime Security Heads of State Summit held in Cameroon \n     marked the culmination of a United States Government-\n     supported Economic Communities of Central African States \n     (ECCAS) and Economic Community of West African States \n     (ECOWAS)-led initiative and process that produced an approved \n     ECOWAS-ECCAS Memorandum of Understanding for regional \n     cooperation, and adopted a Gulf of Guinea Code of Conduct to \n     address maritime crime and a Heads of State Political \n     Declaration;\n       Whereas ECOWAS and ECCAS states are working to cooperate \n     and build their joint capacities in order to increase \n     maritime security in the Gulf of Guinea and are working to \n     achieve this goal with such partners as the United Nations \n     Offices for West and Central Africa, the Gulf of Guinea \n     Commission, the International Maritime Organization,\n\n[[Page S82]]\n\n     the Maritime Organization for West and Central Africa, and \n     the African Union;\n       Whereas the United States Government in the Gulf of Guinea \n     has focused on encouraging multi-layered regional and \n     national ownership in developing sustainable capacity \n     building efforts, including working with partners through the \n     G8++ Friends of Gulf of Guinea Group, to coordinate United \n     States Government maritime security activities in the region;\n       Whereas the United States Government has assisted the \n     countries of West and Central Africa to enhance regional \n     maritime security through programs such as the ``African \n     Partnership Station'', operated by United States Naval Forces \n     Africa ``to build maritime safety and security by increasing \n     maritime awareness, response capabilities and \n     infrastructure'', and the ``African Maritime Law Enforcement \n     Partnership'', which ``enables African partner nations to \n     build maritime security capacity and improve management of \n     their maritime environment through real world law enforcement \n     operations, and through provision of diverse types of \n     training and equipment assistance and participation in \n     diverse regional maritime military exercises'', as well as by \n     employing analytical tools such as the Maritime Security \n     Sector Reform Guide; and\n       Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 2039, \n     ``expressing its deep concern about the threat that piracy \n     and armed robbery at sea in the Gulf of Guinea pose to \n     international navigation, security and the economic \n     development of states in the region'', was unanimously \n     adopted on February 29, 2012: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns acts of armed robbery at sea, piracy, and \n     other maritime crime in the Gulf of Guinea;\n       (2) endorses and supports the efforts made by United States \n     Government agencies to assist affected West and Central \n     African countries to build capacity to combat armed robbery \n     at sea, piracy, and other maritime threats, and encourages \n     the President to continue such assistance, as appropriate, \n     within resource constraints; and\n       (3) commends the African Union, subregional entities such \n     as the ECOWAS and ECCAS, and the various international \n     agencies that have worked to develop policy and program \n     frameworks for enhancing maritime security in West and \n     Central Africa, and encourages these entities and their \n     member states to continue to build upon these and other \n     efforts to achieve that end.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url":

Res. 318\n\n       Whereas the nation of Bangladesh was established in 1971 \n     after a bitter war in which it split from Pakistan, and for \n     many of the ensuing years until 1990, it was ruled by \n     military governments;\n       Whereas political tensions have at times turned to violence \n     in Bangladesh, undermining the democratic process;\n       Whereas the last parliamentary elections in Bangladesh \n     originally scheduled for January 2007, were postponed \n     indefinitely after the military intervened amid rising \n     violence and questions about the electoral process's \n     credibility;\n       Whereas a military-backed civilian caretaker government \n     held power until December 2008 when Bangladeshis returned to \n     the polls to elect a new parliament for the first time in \n     many years;\n       Whereas ongoing antagonism between the country's two ruling \n     parties, the Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist \n     Party, distracts from the important needs of the country;\n       Whereas concerns have grown about religious extremism in \n     the otherwise usually tolerant country;\n       Whereas the United States-Bangladesh relationship is strong \n     and involves many shared interests, including regional \n     economic integration, counterterrorism, counter-piracy, \n     poverty alleviation, food security, regional stability, and \n     mitigation of natural disasters;\n       Whereas bilateral trade between the United States and \n     Bangladesh now tops $6,000,000,000 annually, with major \n     United States companies making significant long-term \n     investments in Bangladesh;\n       Whereas the economy of Bangladesh has grown six percent per \n     year over the last two decades, despite a range of \n     challenges;\n       Whereas the poverty rate in Bangladesh dropped from 40 \n     percent to 31 percent between 2005 and 2010--a notable \n     accomplishment in a country in which poverty has been deep \n     and widespread;\n       Whereas the Grameen Bank's revolutionary microfinance \n     lending to the poor has helped reduce poverty not only in \n     Bangladesh, but has served as an innovative and powerful \n     model for helping the poor elsewhere in the world;\n       Whereas the Department of State, Congress, and other high \n     profile international voices have recognized the Grameen \n     Bank's innovative work and expressed great concern over \n     actions by the Government of Bangladesh that undermine the \n     Bank's independence;\n       Whereas Bangladesh, an example of a moderate and diverse \n     Muslim-majority democracy, is scheduled to have national \n     elections on January 5, 2014;\n       Whereas, in 2013, hundreds of Bangladeshis died in violent \n     clashes as a result of political violence and unrest, and \n     some opposition and human rights activists have been \n     arrested;\n       Whereas trials held by the International Crimes Tribunal in \n     Bangladesh--set up to prosecute those responsible for \n     atrocities committed during Bangladesh's war of liberation \n     with Pakistan in 1971--have fallen short of international \n     standards;\n       Whereas the Government of Bangladesh eliminated a \n     constitutional provision requiring the governing party to \n     cede power to a neutral caretaker government three months \n     before an election;\n       Whereas the 18-member opposition coalition in Bangladesh \n     called for numerous nationwide strikes and transportation \n     blockades in 2013, resulting in dozens of deaths;\n       Whereas Bangladeshi students cannot attend school and \n     complete mandatory exams due to the strikes and blockades and \n     related violence;\n       Whereas many citizens of Bangladesh have had their work and \n     daily activities disrupted due to the strikes and related \n     violence, which come at a cost to the economy and stability \n     of Bangladesh;\n       Whereas a stable, moderate, secular, Muslim-majority \n     democracy with the world's seventh-largest population, and \n     the world's fourth-largest Muslim population, will have \n     lasting positive impacts in the region and beyond;\n       Whereas the success of the democratic process in Bangladesh \n     is of great importance to the United States and the world; \n     and\n       Whereas during the week of December 8, 2013, United Nations \n     Assistant Secretary General Oscar Fernandez-Taranco visited \n     Bangladesh to foster political dialogue between Bangladeshi \n     political parties and leaders in order to bring a halt to \n     violence and allow for a credible peaceful election: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the political violence in Bangladesh and urges \n     political leaders in that country to engage directly and \n     substantively in a dialogue toward free, fair, and credible \n     elections;\n       (2) expresses great concern about the continued political \n     deadlock in Bangladesh that distracts from the country's many \n     important challenges;\n       (3) urges political leaders in Bangladesh to take immediate \n     steps to rein in and to condemn the violence as well as to \n     provide space for peaceful political protests;\n       (4) urges political leaders in Bangladesh to ensure the \n     safety and access of observers in its upcoming elections;\n       (5) supports ongoing efforts by United Nations Assistant \n     Secretary General Oscar Fernandez-Taranco to foster political \n     dialogue between political factions in Bangladesh;

Res. 319\n\n       Whereas, according to a poll conducted in November 2013, a \n     majority of the people of Ukraine supported signing a \n     historic trade and political agreement with the European \n     Union;\n       Whereas a closer association between Ukraine and the \n     European Union has been supported by Ukrainian civil society, \n     business leaders, and politicians across the political \n     spectrum and would bring lasting political, democratic, and \n     economic benefits to the people of Ukraine;\n       Whereas Ukraine successfully passed much of the legislation \n     required to conform to European Union standards for signing \n     an Association Agreement;\n       Whereas, on September 22, 2012, and November 18, 2013, the \n     Senate unanimously passed resolutions calling for a \n     demonstrable end to selective justice in Ukraine and \n     expressing its belief that Ukraine's future lies with \n     stronger ties to Europe, the United States, and others in the \n     community of democracies;\n       Whereas the experience of countries such as Poland, \n     Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia provides a positive example of \n     increased economic opportunity, enhanced personal freedom, \n     and good governance. which can also be realized by Ukraine;\n       Whereas the Government and people of Ukraine have the \n     sovereign right to choose their own foreign policy and \n     economic course, and no other country has the right to \n     determine their political and economic orientation, nor \n     decide which alliances and trade agreements they can join;\n       Whereas, on November 21, 2013, President Viktor Yanukovych \n     suspended Ukraine's preparations for signing the Association \n     Agreement one week before a critical European Union Summit in \n     Vilnius, Lithuania;\n       Whereas the abrupt reversal on the eve of the summit \n     following Russian economic coercion and to protect the narrow \n     interests of some officials and individuals in Ukraine \n     prompted hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians all across the \n     country, especially young people and students, to protest the \n     decision and stand in support of furthering Ukraine's Euro-\n     Atlantic integration;\n       Whereas international nonprofit and nongovernmental \n     organizations provide essential care to needy Ukrainians, yet \n     face direct threats and challenges to their existence and \n     administrative and regulatory impediments, including \n     challenges to operating with the tax-exempt status necessary \n     to maximize the use of funds on the ground and threats to the \n     fabric of civil society vital to democracy in Ukraine;\n       Whereas, on November 30, 2013, at Independence Square in \n     Kyiv, special division police dispersed a peaceful \n     demonstration of students and civil society activists who \n     were calling on President Yanukovych to sign the Association \n     Agreement;\n       Whereas approximately 35 individuals were detained or \n     arrested, and dozens were hospitalized, some with severe \n     injuries;\n       Whereas, on December 9, 2013, raids were conducted on three \n     opposition media outlets and the headquarters of one \n     opposition party;\n       Whereas, on December 11, 2013, Ukrainian authorities \n     conducted an overnight police operation in an attempt to \n     forcefully take control of Independence Square, but were \n     resisted by brave Ukrainians who filled the square and \n     rebuffed the police action;\n       Whereas all three former Presidents of Ukraine have \n     underscored the need to refrain from violence and the \n     importance of engaging in a dialogue with the opposition; and\n       Whereas Ukraine faces an impending economic crisis that can \n     only be solved with long-term economic reforms: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n         Resolved, That the Senate--\n         (1) stands with the people of Ukraine and supports their \n     sovereign right to chart an independent and democratic future \n     for their country;\n         (2) urges leaders in the United States and the European \n     Union to continue working together actively to support a \n     peaceful and democratic resolution to the current crisis that \n     moves Ukraine toward a future in the Euro-Atlantic community \n     and a long-term solution to Ukraine's economic crisis;\n         (3) encourages demonstrators and members of the \n     opposition and civil society in Ukraine to continue avoiding \n     the use of violence and engage in a dialogue of national \n     reconciliation;\n         (4) urges all political parties to refrain from hate \n     speech or actions of an anti-Semitic or other character which \n     further divide the Ukrainian people when they need to be \n     united;\n         (5) calls on the Government of Ukraine to refrain from \n     further use of force or acts of violence against peaceful \n     protestors, and to respect the internationally recognized \n     human rights of the Ukrainian people, especially the freedoms \n     of speech and assembly;\n         (6) condemns the decision by Ukrainian authorities to use \n     violence against peaceful demonstrators on November 30, \n     December 1, and December 11, 2013, and calls for those \n     responsible to be swiftly brought to justice and all detained \n     nonviolent demonstrators to be immediately released; and\n         (7) notes that in the event of further state violence \n     against peaceful protestors, the President and Congress \n     should consider whether to apply targeted sanctions, \n     including visa bans and asset freezes, against individuals \n     responsible for ordering or carrying out the violence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/07/senate-section/article/S83-1", "month": "01", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S83]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NATIONAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY WEEK\n\n  Mr. REED.
