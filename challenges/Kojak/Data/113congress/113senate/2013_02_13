Madam President, last night the President of the United \nStates laid out an agenda to strengthen the middle class and expand \nupon our economic progress. He outlined an agenda that will restore the \ncore value that makes this Nation great: fairness.\n  Senate Democrats stand ready to work with the President to make this \nvision--a vision in which every American shares the prosperity as well \nas the responsibility--a reality. President Obama's agenda calls for \ncommonsense investments in our future, investments which will breathe \nnew life into a struggling middle class, investments which will make \nAmerica a magnet for jobs and manufacturing once more, investments \nwhich have been deferred for too long due to the worst recession since \nthe Great Depression.\n  The President's plan will give American manufacturers the support \nthey need to thrive, while ending giveaways to companies that ship jobs \noverseas. His plan will create jobs building world-class roadways, \nrailways, and bridges which our economy may rely upon tomorrow.\n  The plan will prepare current and future workers to compete in a \nglobal economy by making K-12 schools the best in the world again and \ncollege affordable for every graduate. His plan will break our \naddiction to foreign oil and encourage investments in reliable energy, \na change which will be good for the environment and for the economy.\n  As he said last night, it will be done without adding a single penny \nto the deficit. These investments in a strong middle class are not just \nright for our country, they are right for our economy as well. Our \nefforts to restore prosperity will mean little unless Congress acts \nimmediately to deal with arbitrary, across-the-board spending cuts set \nto take effect.\n  If the looming sequester strikes, 70,000 young children would be \nkicked off Head Start and 10,000 teaching jobs would be at risk. The \nSmall Business Administration will be forced to reduce loan guarantees \nto small businesses by up to $540 million. Democrats believe we should \nreplace this harsh austerity with a balanced approach that targets \nwasteful spending, tax loopholes, and asks the wealthiest among us to \ncontribute a little more to reduce the deficit.\n  The American people know we can't cut our way to prosperity. They \nagree. We can't ask the middle class to bear the burden of the entire \ndeficit reduction. Later this week Democrats will release a plan to \navert the so-called sequester.\n  Republicans say they agree the deep cuts they voted for will be \ndamaging to\n\n[[Page S664]]\n\nour economy and to national security. Republicans would rather cut \nMedicare, education, and medical research than close a single wasteful \ntax loophole or ask a single millionaire to contribute a little more. \nThe Republicans should stop protecting millionaires, billionaires, and \nwealthy corporations and start working with us to pass an alternative \nto these terrible cuts that protect the middle class. We want to start \nto do something to begin changing this so we protect the middle class. \nWe must not jeopardize the progress of the last 4 years.\n  Even though our work to restore economic prosperity must continue, we \nshould take pride in the 35 months of private sector job growth and 6.1 \nmillion new American jobs. Imagine how many more jobs could be created \nwith just a little cooperation from our Republican colleagues.\n  Now our friends across the aisle have another opportunity to engage \nconstructively. They have a second chance to work with Democrats to \nrebuild the middle class by investing in that which in the past has \nmade Americans strong--world-class roads, bridges, dams, peerless \nschools, industrial factories, and creative entrepreneurs who are the \nbest in the world.\n  President Ronald Reagan, in his first address of a joint session of \nCongress, spoke of these building blocks of prosperity. Ronald Reagan \nsaid:\n\n       Substance and prosperity of our Nation is built by wages \n     brought home from the factories and the mills, the farms, and \n     the shops. They are the services provided in 10,000 corners \n     of America: the interest on the thrift of our people and the \n     returns for their risk-taking. The production of America is \n     the possession of those who build, serve, create, and \n     produce.\n\n  He didn't say the substance of our Nation is built on profits gleaned \nfrom shipping jobs overseas. He didn't say the prosperity of America is \nthe possession of investment banks or wealthy oil companies alone. \nRather, he said, our substance and prosperity are earned in factories, \nmills, farms, and shops. The rewards belong to all those who build, \nserve, create, and produce--not only to the few strong enough or rich \nenough to take for themselves.\n  It is time to return to those roots. It is time to remember fairness \nis not just a principle for which to strive but a powerful engine of \ngrowth and prosperity for all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/13/senate-section/article/S664-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S664]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I would like to say a word about last night's State of \nthe Union. To me, at least, the occasion cried out for bold and \ncourageous leadership from a reelected President who has run his last \ncampaign. It called for a President who was willing to stare down \nAmerica's challenges, reject the easy choices, and step outside his \npolitical comfort zone to unite a deeply divided public behind a common \ngoal.\n  Sadly, history will record no such moment. An opportunity to bring \ntogether the country instead became another retread of lip service and \nliberalism.\n  For a Democratic President entering his second term, it was simply \nunequal to the moment. Following 4 years of this President's \nunwillingness to challenge liberal dogma, we have more of the same. The \nPresident spoke about energy infrastructure but didn't even mention the \nKeystone Pipeline. He chose the Nation's biggest stage to promote \nsomething that is inefficient and costly, such as solar panels, instead \nof something that is proven, reliable, and domestically produced, such \nas coal.\n  He advocated tax reform but mostly as a way to increase the size of \ngovernment, not as a way to increase our competitiveness. He spoke of \nworkers' minimum wages instead of their maximum potential.\n  In short, with the exception of his impressive delivery and trademark \nstyle, last night's speech was pedestrian, liberal boilerplate that any \nDemocratic lawmaker could have given at any time in recent memory. Gun \ncontrol, cap and trade, tax increases, and spending programs are \nexactly what we have come to expect from a liberal President who seems \nperfectly content to preside over a divided country and a stagnant \neconomy.\n  Of course, everyone recognizes the President is a very good \ncampaigner. We all acknowledge his skill in that area. He will be doing \nmore of that today down in North Carolina.\n  A State of the Union Address should be about something bigger. \nInstead of dividing Americans, it should unite them. Instead of \ninflaming passions, it should show what is possible when the two \nparties actually work together.\n  I am glad he mentioned things such as expanding trade opportunities \nwith Asia and Europe. That is an area where we can cooperate, and I \nlook forward to working with colleagues from both parties to do just \nthat.\n  Overall, I am disappointed. I am especially disappointed he chose not \nto seriously address the transcendent issue of our time, which is \nfinding a way to control our spiraling debt before it controls us. If \nwe don't do that, we will not be able to leave our children the kind of \ncountry our parents left us; that is, a goal all of us should share.\n  Take the Obama sequester as just one example. The President had a \nchance last night to offer a thoughtful alternative to his sequester, \none that could reduce spending in a smarter way. That is what \nRepublicans have been calling for all along, and it is the kind of \nthing the House has already voted to do not once but twice. We want to \nwork with him to actually make that happen.\n  Instead we just heard gimmicks and tax hikes, just one more plan from \nthe President that is designed to fail so he can blame others when it \ndoes fail. It is too bad for the country. It truly is.\n  The American people, in their collective judgment, decided to send \ndivided government to Washington. I am sure the President wishes that \nweren't so, but it is the reality, and Americans look to him to use \nforums such as the State of the Union to bring people together and get \nthings done with the government we have, not the one the President \nwishes he had. That is what Ronald Reagan did, and he accomplished \ngreat things. President Clinton was able to get quite a bit done with \ndivided government too.\n  Why is it this President can't seem to demonstrate the same kind of \nleadership? He says he wants balance--balance. His approach so far has \nbeen anything but. Just as ``investment'' has become a Washington code \nword for more spending, ``balance'' has now become a code word for my \nway or the highway.\n  Remember, the President already received the additional revenue he \nwanted in January. He didn't agree to a single cut in spending then, \njust revenue. Obviously, the balanced thing to do now would be to look \nat cuts. Last night the President didn't propose any real cuts; he just \ndemanded more and more taxes. With a $16 trillion debt, he actually \ncalled for more spending too, although he didn't say how he would pay \nfor it or even how much it would cost. Pretend, for a moment, the \nRepublicans agreed to go along with all those taxes and all that \nspending. What do you think he would demand the next time and the time \nafter that? Of course, more taxes and more spending. And we all know \nWashington uses tax increases to fund even more spending on things such \nas robosquirrels and Solyndra, not to reduce the deficit. That is what \nhistory shows us. It is how we got in this mess in the first place.\n\n  So we are not going to play the Washington game. The stakes for \nAmerican families are too high to keep taking the easy way out, with \nmore taxes and more wasteful spending. Republicans believe taking on \nthis massive burden of debt should be more important in this town than \nwinning the next election. That is why we need commonsense reforms, \nsuch as a balanced budget amendment. All Republicans support it, and \nDemocrats should too. But we won't get anywhere as a nation if the \nPresident refuses to lead. We just can't. So the question is, Will he \nlead or will he continue this endless campaign?\n  I want to end on a positive note, so I would like to point out that \nthere were areas of agreement last night, and I particularly \nappreciated the President's reference to Burma. And Senator Rubio did a \ngreat job with the Republican address. I hope the President\n\n[[Page S665]]\n\nwill actually listen to some of the things Senator Rubio said, and I \nhope he will come back to Congress with some different ideas. We can \nget important things done in his second term, and if he is ready to \ncome to the center, to the political center, we will.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/13/senate-section/article/S665-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S665]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, after listening to President Obama's \nState of the Union speech last night, I was left scratching my head. \nEssentially, the President wants us to pretend the last 4 years never \nhappened. He wants us to pretend his economic policies have delivered a \nstrong recovery from the recession of 2008; he wants us to pretend his \nadministration has made real progress on reducing the national debt; \nand he wants us to pretend that more taxes, more spending, and more \ndebt are the key to middle-class prosperity. In other words, the \nPresident is hoping we all have a case of amnesia.\n  He wants us to forget about $5.8 trillion in new debt that was racked \nup during his first term--$5.8 trillion. He wants us to forget our \ngross national debt is now larger than our entire economy--100 percent \nof our gross domestic product. He wants us to forget the debt is \nprojected to grow even further, to $26 trillion, by 2023; and he wants \nus to forget his health care bill will increase taxes by $1 trillion \nover the next 10 years. He wants us to forget America's credit rating \nhas been downgraded for the first time in our history.\n  He also wants us to forget we have been suffering through the weakest \neconomic recovery since the Great Depression, as well as the highest, \nlongest period of high unemployment since the Great Depression.\n  He wants us to forget that nearly 4 out of every 10 unemployed \nAmericans have been jobless for at least 6 months. He wants us to \nforget that the average family median income has fallen by nearly \n$2,500 since the official end of the recession. He wants us to forget \nthat the cost of health insurance for the average American family has \nincreased by more than $2,300. And he wants us to forget that as part \nof the fiscal cliff negotiation, the payroll tax went back up, taking \nan additional bite out of the check of middle-class workers.\n  Last night President Obama said we should ask ourselves three \nquestions every day--those of us with the privilege of serving here in \nthe Nation's Capital in the Congress and in the administration. He \nsaid: No. 1, how do we attract more jobs to our shores? No. 2, how do \nwe equip people with the skills they need in order to get those jobs? \nAnd No. 3, how do we make sure hard work leads to a decent living? I \nmay have my differences with President Obama on a number of policies, \nbut I actually think those are really good questions.\n  If the President is truly serious about finding the answers to those \nquestions, this may not surprise my colleagues, but he need look only \nto the model reflected in my home State of Texas.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article \nentitled ``The Texas Growth Machine'' at the end of my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. The fact is our State relies on a simple economic model \nthe Federal Government could emulate if it would like to have similar \npositive results: lower taxes, limited government, sensible \nregulations, and progrowth energy policies.\n  I know the occupant of the chair comes from a State that I believe is \nthe second largest producer of oil and gas in the country--second only \nto Texas--and I know the Presiding Officer has seen the economic engine \nthat is created when we unleash our potential when it comes to our \nenergy resources. These are policies that recently helped Texas turn a \n$5 billion deficit during the recession into an $8.8 billion surplus. \nThese are the policies that made our State a robust engine of job \ncreation that is attracting Americans from all across the country. The \ntotal number of jobs in Texas since 1995 has grown at the rate of 32 \npercent. When we compare that with the rate of growth of jobs in \nAmerica nationwide, we see it is 12 percent--32 percent to 12 percent. \nThat is not an accident.\n  Texas is also a leader in the creation of high-paying jobs. Between \n2002 and 2012, our State accounted for close to one-third of all U.S. \nprivate sector job growth in industries that pay more than 150 percent \nof the average wage, even though we have only 8 percent of America's \ntotal population.\n  Last night the President talked about, How do we get middle-class \nwages up? His prescription was an increase in the minimum wage, but I \nsay why don't we look at ways to achieve a maximum wage by creating \nprivate sector, high-paying, good jobs, as we have been successful in \ndoing in Texas and as a few other States have done as well.\n  After 4 years of trillion-dollar deficits and historically high \nunemployment--right now our unemployment rate is roughly 7.9 percent, \nbut that doesn't really account for all of the people who have since \ngiven up looking for work, and it is estimated that more than 20 \nmillion Americans either are out of work or they are working part time \nwhen they would like to work full time, but they can't find those kinds \nof jobs.\n  I believe it is time for the President and this Congress to try a new \napproach. The great thing about our system of government--of shared \nsovereignty between the States and the National Government--is that we \nhave essentially laboratories of democracy all around our country where \nwe can try different things to see what works and what does not work. I \nonly hope the President and Congress will look at those places around \nthe country where the policies actually work in creating jobs and \neconomic growth.\n  I believe it is time for the President to embrace policies that will \nencourage private entrepreneurship, private sector job creation, income \ngrowth, and greater domestic energy production. In short, it is time \nfor him to embrace the Texas model.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                        The Texas Growth Machine\n\n                            (By Wendell Cox)\n\n       The American economy has had little to cheer about since \n     the 2008 financial meltdown and the resulting recession. \n     Recovery has been feeble, and many states continue to \n     struggle. One bright spot in the general gloom, however, is \n     Texas, which began shining long before 2008. Not only has \n     Texas created jobs at a stunning rate; it has also--pace \n     critics like the New York Times's Paul Krugman--created lots \n     of good jobs. Indeed, the rest of the nation could turn to \n     the Lone Star State as a model for dynamic growth, as a close \n     look at employment data shows.\n\n[[Page S666]]\n\n       The first thing to point out is that Texan job creation has \n     far outpaced the national average. The number of jobs in \n     Texas has grown by a truly impressive 31.5 percent since \n     1995, compared with just 12 percent nationwide, according to \n     Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Texas has also lapped \n     California, an important economic rival and the only state \n     with a larger population. The Texas employment situation \n     after the financial crisis was far less spectacular, of \n     course, with the number of jobs growing just 2.4 percent from \n     2009 through 2011. But that was still six times the anemic \n     0.4 percent growth rate of the overall American economy.\n       The National Establishment Time-Series (NETS) Database, \n     which provides detailed information on job creation and loss \n     for firms headquartered in each state, can tell us more about \n     Texas's employment growth. NETS data are divided into two \n     periods--the first from 1995 to 2002, the second from 2002 to \n     2009. During the 2002-09 period, small businesses of fewer \n     than ten employees were the Texas employment engine, adding \n     nearly 800,000 new jobs; of those, about three-quarters were \n     in firms with two to nine employees. Larger Texas companies--\n     those with 500 or more employees--lost a significant number \n     of jobs over this span, and medium-size firms likewise \n     shrank, trends that also showed up on the national level.\n       Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows that many of the new \n     Texas jobs paid well. Indeed, Texas did comparatively better \n     than the rest of the United States from 2002 through 2011. \n     For industries paying over 150 percent of the average \n     American wage, Texas could claim 216,000 extra jobs; the rest \n     of the country added 495,000. In other words, the Lone Star \n     State, with 8 percent of the U.S. population, created nearly \n     a third of the country's highest-paying positions. Texas also \n     added 49,000 positions paying 125 percent to 150 percent of \n     the U.S. average; the rest of the country lost 174,000 jobs \n     in that category. Two sectors in which Texas employment did \n     particularly well during the same period were natural-\n     resource extraction (in fact, the state gained 80 percent of \n     all new jobs in the country in that field) and professional, \n     scientific, and technical positions. Both job categories \n     boast average wages far higher than the national overall \n     average. As happens whenever an economy grows, Texas also \n     added hundreds of thousands of positions in food services, \n     health care, and other lower-paid fields, in addition to the \n     more lucrative jobs. Texas did lose 10,000 construction jobs, \n     but that was a modest downturn, in light of the massive \n     national slowdown in building caused by the crisis of 2008.\n       Vital to the economic health of Texas is that people are \n     moving to its cities in droves. In 2011, Houston surpassed \n     Philadelphia in population and became the country's fifth-\n     biggest metropolitan region, with 6.1 million people. Dallas-\n     Fort Worth, with 6.5 million, was already the country's \n     fourth-biggest. The two cities trail only New York City, Los \n     Angeles, and Chicago, marking the first time that a single \n     state has had two metros in the country's top five since the \n     Census Bureau began designating these areas a century ago. \n     Meanwhile, of all metropolitan areas in the country with more \n     than 1 million residents, the fastest-growing from 2010 to \n     2011 was Austin.\n       Though the national downturn has slowed job creation in \n     Texas's cities, they're still adding jobs, sometimes briskly, \n     unlike many other American metropolitan regions. Austin's \n     strong information-technology sector and government-related \n     work (the city is Texas's state capital) helped propel 4.3 \n     percent job growth from 2009 through 2011 (and 15.3 percent \n     growth from 2002 through 2009). The number of jobs in \n     McAllen, which benefits from increased trade with Mexico \n     under the North American Free Trade Agreement, grew 3.7 \n     percent. Job growth in economically diverse Houston has \n     matched or exceeded the state rate since 1995.\n       What accounts for the resilience of the Texas economy, \n     which has outperformed the rest of the country not only over \n     the long term but during the Great Recession as well? A pro-\n     business climate has unquestionably been a substantial \n     advantage. In its annual ranking of business environments, \n     Chief Executive has named Texas the most growth-friendly \n     state for eight years in a row. (California has been last for \n     the same eight years.) The reasons included low taxes and \n     sensible regulations; a high-quality workforce (Texas ranked \n     second only to Utah in that category in 2012); and a pleasant \n     living environment (an eighth-place finish, slightly below \n     sixth-place Florida but, perhaps surprisingly, far better \n     than 28th-place California).\n       Part of the explanation for the high living-environment \n     score is doubtless Texas's low cost of living. In 2011, the \n     U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis put Texas's ``regional price \n     parity,'' a measurement of the price level of goods in an \n     area, at 97.1, a bit lower than the national level of 100 and \n     far lower than the California level of 114.8. Adjusted for \n     cost of living, Texas's per-capita income is higher than \n     California's and nearly as high as New York's. Factor in \n     state and local taxes, and Texas pulls ahead of New York.\n       More than three-quarters of the cost-of-living difference \n     between Texas and California can be explained by housing \n     costs. Texas mostly dodged the real-estate bubble of the \n     2000s: the affordability of houses in large metro areas \n     spiked in America as a whole but rose only modestly in Texas. \n     A major reason that Texas real estate is so affordable is \n     that the state lacks the draconian land-use restrictions that \n     drive California housing prices into the stratosphere. The \n     affordable housing attracts both people and businesses. Since \n     2000, 1 million more people have moved to Texas from other \n     states than have left.\n       All these considerations suggest that Texas is poised for \n     further growth. And a final reason for Texans to be \n     optimistic is that a major expansion of the Panama Canal will \n     be completed in 2014. That could bolster the Lone Star \n     State's success by rerouting Asian commerce from West Coast \n     ports to Texas alternatives, which are closer to the nation's \n     major markets.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Madam President, the President's State of the Union \nAddress is an annual event where each President comes forward, talks \nabout the agenda, the plans, and what we hope to achieve in Washington \nduring the course of the next year.\n  There were many elements in the President's State of the Union \nAddress last night. There was one in particular I was struck by. He \ntalked about establishing a college scorecard. He talked about the \nchallenges families are facing across America paying for college \neducation. It has become an enormous expense. It is the fastest growing \ndebt in America--$1 trillion in student loan debt.\n  Sadly, many students are getting in too deeply. They are getting too \nfar in debt, and they may not be able to get a job to pay it back. Many \nstudents are defaulting on those loans because they don't have an \nincome. Sometimes their parents help them go to college and sign the \npapers. Sometimes the efforts to collect the money go beyond the \ndefaulting student to the parents--in fact, sometimes to grandparents.\n  There was a case reported of a grandmother who wanted to help her \ngranddaughter, so she signed the student loan application. The \ngranddaughter didn't get a job, perhaps didn't finish school. There \ncame a time when, in collecting the student loan, they actually \ngarnished the Social Security check of the grandmother. That is the \nmost extreme case I have heard.\n  When it comes to indebtedness and student loan default, there are \ndifferent categories of debt. Some students are lucky and don't have to \nborrow a penny. Most do, and those who borrow money, we find, borrow \nthe lowest average amount from public universities--community colleges \nand public schools. Next come private universities and then a special \ncategory--the for-profit colleges. This is an incredible industry of \nwhich most Americans are not aware.\n  When we think of for-profit schools, we should remember three things, \nthree numbers. Twelve percent of students coming out of high school go \nto for-profit schools. The biggest ones, the most well-known schools, \ninclude the University of Phoenix, DeVry University, and Kaplan \nUniversity. There are a number of names which, when we hear them, we \nsay: I have heard a lot about those. They advertise a lot.\n  Twelve percent of the students coming out of high school go to those \nfor-profit schools. However, those for-profit schools receive 25 \npercent of all of the Federal aid to education--12 percent of the \nstudents, 25 percent of the Federal aid. Why? Because they are \nexpensive. For-profit schools are very expensive, and the tuition is \nhigh. So a student, to be able to go there, may qualify for a Pell \ngrant, which is an actual grant of money for students from low-income \nfamilies. Then, for loans beyond that--and it turns out that 25 percent \nof all of the Federal aid to education goes to for-profit colleges that \nhave 12 percent of the students.\n  That is not the most important number to remember--not 12, not 25, \nbut\n\n[[Page S667]]\n\nthis final number: 47 percent of all the student loan defaults come out \nof for-profit schools, which means that students who start at those \nschools either don't finish and then can't pay back their loans or \nfinish and can't find a job to pay back their loans. For-profits \nschools, 47 percent of the student loans default.\n  The stories are heartbreaking. Imagine, 19, 20, 21 years old, papers \nare being shoved across the desk in the financial office at a for-\nprofit school, and a student is basically told: Well, you can start \nschool next week; all you have to do is sign up for these loans.\n  What is a student to think? I have been told my whole life to go to \ncollege. Mom and dad are counting on me to go to college. This is the \nway to get a good job. I will sign up. I want to start.\n  What the student doesn't know is whether that school is worth the \nmoney. How could they know? I think back to those days when I started \ncollege. I hate to go back that far in time, but I didn't know whether \nborrowing $1,000 in those days was a good idea or a bad idea. I knew a \nlot of my fellow students were borrowing. But now students are getting \nin much more deeply. It isn't just $1,000 or $5,000 or even $10,000. At \nthe end of the day, it turns out to be much, much more.\n  I have come to the floor a number of times to tell the stories about \nthese for-profit schools to warn students and their families to be \ncareful. Some of these schools are good; many of them are awful--just \nplain awful.\n  Last night the President said he wanted to create a college \nscorecard. I want to hear more. I hope there will be a scorecard and a \nWeb site, maybe, where students--high school students or others across \nAmerica--can take a look at every college opportunity, not just their \npretty catalogs or their great Web sites but to find out how many of \nthese students who graduate from this college actually get a job, and \nthose who get a job, how much do they actually get paid. Of the \nstudents who borrow money to go to this college, how much do they \nborrow? How many of them fail to make the payments on their student \nloans later in life?\n  Oh, there is one important thing I left out. Here is what you are \ngoing to learn about loans to students. They are different than other \ntypes of loans. You see, if I decide to buy a home and a car and a boat \nand then lose my job and go broke and cannot pay them back, under the \nmost extreme cases I can go to court and put all my debts on the table \nin front of a judge and say: Here is all the money I owe and here is \nall the money I have. I do not know where to turn--and go through \nsomething called bankruptcy.\n  In bankruptcy, the judge says: Well--let's say you have $10,000 in \nthe bank and you owe $50,000. You are going to lose your $10,000. You \ncannot pay back the $50,000, but you no longer have an obligation to \npay it. You are judged bankrupt. You start over, wipe the slate clean.\n  Not a lot of people do that, but when things get really bad, they \nhave to. Guess what. When it comes to student loans, they are not \ndischargeable in bankruptcy. The debt that a 19-, 20-, and 21-year-old \nstudent signs up for is a debt for life. They pay it back forever--\nuntil it is paid. So these are serious debt obligations, and it is hard \nto imagine that many young people without a great deal of life \nexperience really know what is too much debt, really know whether that \nschool is any good.\n  Let me tell you a story of one student.\n  Ramon Nieves attended the American Intercontinental University, a \nfor-profit college owned by Career Education Corporation. Like many who \nattend for-profit colleges, Ramon was the first person in his family to \ngo to college. The recruiters at these for-profit schools look for \nthese students.\n  Without guidance from his family--a family that had no experience \nwith college--he trusted the school when they advised him about student \nloans. He said the school just told him to sign his name. That is all \nhe had to do. They never explained the difference between the kinds of \nloans that students could take out; that there are government loans, \nFederal loans, and then there are loans from private financial \ninstitutions. He was never told what his balance would be--how much he \nowed--or what he could expect his monthly payments to be when it was \nall over.\n  He signed up. He wanted to get started with college. And he kept \nsigning and signing, semester after semester, year after year, until he \ngraduated. He graduated from this for-profit school with $90,000 of \ndebt--$90,000.\n  He works several jobs, almost 80 hours a week, so he can pay his \nmonthly student loan payments, which are $1,000 a month, right off the \ntop.\n  His student debt is a constant burden for him and his family. He owns \na home, and he thinks he is going to lose it because of the student \nloans. He decided to try to file for bankruptcy because he was in debt \nso deeply, but he learned the hard way that the bankruptcy court cannot \nhelp him when it comes to student loans.\n  Ramon says he wishes he had not gone to college at all; that he was \nbetter off before he got that deeply in debt. Now he is at a community \ncollege--a community college--trying to get an education because the \n$90,000 in the for-profit college turned out to be a waste of time. He \nis now where he should have started.\n  Students who are not sure, start at a community college. You are near \nhome. You can commute. They offer a lot of options. They are not \nexpensive. You will learn a lot about yourself, about your education, \nand your dreams by sitting in those classrooms and going through \ncommunity college courses. After a year or two, if it sounds right and \nfeels good for you, it is time to move on to another college or \nuniversity, and you will move on to that third year of college without \na lot of debt. Start at a community college.\n  Ramon ended up at a community college finally trying to get the \neducation the for-profit school failed to give him. He says he wishes \nhe had known that at the beginning--starting at that community college \ninstead of the American Intercontinental University. Then, he says, he \nwould have received the same education but without $90,000 of debt.\n  Why does he have so much debt? According to a recent committee report \nin the Senate, the American Intercontinental University costs 250 times \nmore than a nearby community college--250 times more.\n  Federal student aid cannot cover the tuition costs, so students are \nforced to turn from Federal student aid, government loans, which are \nlow-interest loans, to private student loans, which are high-interest \nloans. Some students do not know, as they are sitting there, the \ndifferences between a 3.2-percent annual rate of interest and an 18-\npercent annual rate of interest, and that can be the difference between \na government loan and a private loan.\n  To put it in shorthand from someone who has paid off loans, the \nhigher the interest rate, the more your monthly payment is going to the \nbank rather than reducing the amount of money you owe.\n  Federal student aid cannot cover the tuition costs. The private loans \nare signed up for, and they do not come with any consumer protections. \nGovernment loans do. Government loans allow you to consolidate. \nSometimes they take into consideration the job you end up with in life. \nSometimes there is forgiveness of government student loans. It is a \nmuch more flexible, low-cost program than private student loans.\n  Sometimes students will need private student loans, but for-profit \ncolleges are using these private student loans for another important \nreason to them. For-profit colleges encourage students to take out \nprivate loans, at least in part, because private loans allow these \nschools to continue to get more Federal funds. It is a complicated \nformula, but in order to get the maximum amount of Federal dollars, the \nfor-profit schools push kids into private loans even when they are \nstill eligible for the better government loans.\n  The rule I am talking about is the 90/10 rule which requires for-\nprofit colleges to receive at least 10 percent of their revenues from \nsources other than the Federal Government--10 percent of their revenues \nfrom sources other than the Federal Government.\n  If you took the Federal money we send to for-profit schools in \nAmerica--roughly $32 billion a year--if you took that money and \ntranslated it into a Federal budget, for-profit colleges in America \nwould be the ninth largest Federal agency--$32 billion going to this \nsector of the economy.\n\n[[Page S668]]\n\n  When they push the kids into the private loans that are not as good, \nnot as generous, much more expensive, that covers the 10 percent they \nhave to come up with in real money as opposed to government money. It \nmeans that 90 percent of the revenue of these extremely profitable \nschools comes right out of the Federal Treasury.\n\n  Even though for purposes of this rule Federal revenue includes only \nfunds from the Department of Education's Federal student aid programs--\nGI bill funds, for example, are not even considered Federal funds--many \nfor-profit schools are close to 90 percent of their revenue coming from \nthe Federal Government. If you add in GI bill funds, sometimes it is \ncloser to 100 percent.\n  Where is the accountability? If these schools are dragging kids \ndeeply into debt, if the kids are defaulting at rates twice as fast and \ntwice as serious as those going to public and private schools, where is \nour responsibility? How is a student--a high school student in Illinois \nor in North Dakota--supposed to know whether that Web site about that \ncollege is true?\n  How would they know when that school says ``we are accredited,'' that \nthe accreditation is phony? Most of these for-profit schools belong to \nan organization that accredits all the schools that are for-profit \nschools. They take care of one another. They ignore the obvious when \nthese schools are failing the students and their families.\n  The Federal aid is keeping the doors open for these for-profit \nschools. Can we afford that? Can we afford to get students across \nAmerica deeply into debt for a largely worthless education? Do we have \nthat much money sloshing around here in Washington when it comes to \nhelping students get through school?\n  That is why the President's statement last night about student debt, \nabout the rising college costs, and a scorecard for colleges and \nuniversities is right spot on. It is time we tell families across \nAmerica the truth about colleges and universities, and it is time for \nthose same colleges and universities to wake up to a reality. The \nreality is the sky is not the limit when it comes to the cost of higher \neducation.\n  I have talked to a number of them--respected institutions--that give \ngood degrees, good diplomas, and I have told them the same thing: You \njust cannot keep raising the cost of higher education. Middle-income \nfamilies, working families do not have a chance. Madam President, \n$20,000, $30,000, $40,000 a year to go to school? It is just something \nthat ordinary families cannot even consider.\n  Congress needs to act now to stop this for-profit school industry \nfrom exploiting students and their families and taxpayers. Why we are \nspending so much money--money we can no longer afford--to subsidize \nthese highly profitable schools is beyond me. I cannot explain it.\n  These schools that leave these kids high and dry break my heart. \nEvery time I fly out to O'Hare Airport, on the Kennedy Expressway in \nChicago, right before I get to the Cumberland exit, I look up at one of \nthese office buildings, and up there in big, bold letters is ``Westwood \nCollege.'' Wow, the campus of Westwood College.\n  I know a little bit about that college. I have met students who have \ngone to that college, and let me tell you, I want to put a sign right \nunder there that says, ``Please Avoid This Ripoff.''\n  A young lady who went to Westwood College testified in Chicago. She \nwatched a lot of shows on TV about forensic criminal investigation, and \nshe wanted to get into criminal investigation. She signed up at \nWestwood College. It took her 5 years to finish.\n  When she finished, she had a debt of $90,000. But she wanted a degree \nin law enforcement. She wanted to be on CSI in the real world. Guess \nwhat happened. She went to every law enforcement agency in the \nChicagoland area, and they pushed it back and said: Westwood is not a \nreal college. You have wasted your time--5 years--and your money.\n  Here she sits now living in her parents' basement at a time in life \nwhen she thought she would be starting her own career, her own life. \nWhat is she doing? She is paying back a loan for a worthless education \nfrom Westwood College.\n  I have been after these folks for a long time. They exploit these \nkids day in and day out. Sadly, we subsidize them. We send them \nmillions of dollars in Federal funds to continue this exploitation of \nstudents.\n  This has to come to an end. This is not the kind of thing we need to \nencourage if America is going to have well-educated and trained \nstudents so they have good lives and America continues to prosper.\n  One of my colleagues, Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, has been a leader \non this issue. As chairman of the HELP Committee, he has had hearings \non for-profit schools, and I commend them to anyone interested in this \nsubject. Take a look at Tom Harkin's hearings. I could go on for a long \ntime--Tom could too--about the schools across America that are \nexploiting students.\n  We owe it to the students to tell them the truth. We owe it to their \nparents. And we beg teachers and high school counselors and others, who \nreally care about young people: Look long and hard at these for-profit \nschools before you recommend them to a student.\n  I encourage all my colleagues to take a look at legislation that Tom \nHarkin and I have introduced. We are trying to drop the Federal subsidy \nto these for-profit schools just a small bit. It will be hard to do. \nThese for-profit schools are pretty powerful in Washington. But if we \nare going to do our job to protect families and students across \nAmerica--following the President's lead from his State of the Union \naddress to make sure we are sensitive to student loans, student \nindebtedness, that we hold colleges and other training institutions \naccountable for what they are doing to and for students--it is time for \nus to turn the page and join the President.\n  The President's speech last night is a challenge to all of us on both \nsides of the aisle, both sides of the Rotunda, to take this student \ndebt crisis seriously.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, last night President Obama had the \nopportunity to present to the American people a plan envisioned for how \nhe plans to strengthen the state of our Union.\n  While I am pleased he finally turned his focus back to the ongoing \njobs crisis in our country, I was left feeling disappointed and \nfrustrated that the President continued to call for higher taxes to pay \nfor more and more government spending.\n  I don't believe the President acknowledges--or at least he didn't \nlast evening--the seriousness of our debt and fiscal crisis. We are \nnearly $16.5 trillion in debt, and $6 trillion of that\n\n[[Page S669]]\n\ndebt is from the President's spending over the last 4 years--and he now \nhas 4 more years to go.\n  Yet rather than tell the American people specifically how he will \nreduce this unsustainable debt, he once again pulled out the same tired \nplaybook and made it clear his basic fiscal plan is ever higher taxes. \nIt's almost an obsession with tax hikes and telling the American \npeople: You are just not taxed enough, when we are practically taxed to \ndeath. When you add not just the Federal but the State and the local \nand the sales and the excise and gasoline and the entertainment and all \nthe other taxes that American people pay in their daily lives, it cuts \ninto their paycheck in a very significant way each week. The real \nquestion is, Is the solution to our problems more taxes on the American \npeople?\n  Mr. President, you got your taxes in the fiscal cliff debate. You had \ncampaigned for this and you won the election. These tax levels were \ngoing to expire and hit every American with a massive tax increase. We \nclawed back a significant amount of that to protect the majority of \nAmericans. But you got your taxes, Mr. President. Now is the time to \naddress the other side of the so-called balanced approach that you have \nbeen promising: spending reductions.\n  Sadly, last night gave us no indication that the President is \ncommitted to leading on this critical issue and fixing our economy and, \nmore important, getting more people back to work.\n  Instead of detailing a plan to reduce the record-high debt, he \noutlined a liberal laundry list of new government programs and \ninitiatives. I could almost hear the sound of a cash register in the \nbackground--ka-ching, ka-ching, ka-ching--with every new program he put \nforward.\n  Some of these ideas were worthy ideas, but we cannot afford them. How \nare we going to pay for them? What is the result? The President said in \na most disingenuous way that none of these initiatives would add a dime \nto the already unsustainable debt. If they do not add a dime to the \ndebt and you are proposing all kinds of programs that are going to cost \na lot of money, there is only one way you can pay for them, and that is \nto raise taxes--either that or to continue to borrow money and put us \nin an ever-deeper hole of debt, more obligated to our creditors with \neach day that goes by.\n  Hoosiers and Americans across the country are taxed enough. \nWashington cannot keep asking hard-working Americans to dig deeper and \npony up more money so that the Federal Government can spend more. The \nAmerican people no longer are falling for that. Hoosiers tell me they \nwant to do their part to restore the fiscal health of this country. \nThey want to do their part to help America become a better place and a \nmore prosperous nation for their children and their grandchildren. They \nare willing to step up and do what it takes to help. But Hoosiers and \nthe American people are not willing to be enablers to Washington's \nspending addiction. They want to see their lawmakers and this \nadministration reform the outrageous, out-of-control spending, not \ncontinually call for higher taxes to pay for greater spending coming \nout of Washington.\n  I have to say I was somewhat encouraged that the President mentioned \nhe was willing to make modest reforms to programs like Medicare. Both \nRepublicans and Democrats, including the President, agree that \nMedicare, Medicaid, and Social Security represent the biggest portion \nand ever-growing percentage of government spending. The nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office recently reported that spending on \nMedicare, Medicaid, and Social Security and the interest on the debt \nfor that spending will consume 91 percent of all Federal revenues in 10 \nyears. That, then, takes all the wind out of our sails in terms of \nthose necessary functions of the Federal Government, such as preparing \nadequately for our national security and defense and a number of other \nthings the Federal Government is involved in that are essential \nfunctions. But with mandatory spending eating up, in 10 years, 91 \npercent of all we take in, we still are not going to have the ability \nto pay for those programs.\n  With 10,000 baby boomers retiring every day, we know the status quo \nis unsustainable. We cannot afford to continue the way we are. These \nprograms are in jeopardy. We are not trying to take away the programs, \nwe are trying to save the programs. They are in jeopardy, though, if we \ndo not take steps now to structure them in a way that will control \ncosts and preserve benefits for current and future recipients.\n  Hard-working Hoosiers and millions of Americans have spent a lifetime \npaying into these programs, and they rely on the health and security \nbenefits they receive from them. But these benefits will not last if we \nignore the facts about the current fiscal status and insolvency these \nprograms are careening toward and do nothing. I was glad the President \nat least acknowledged that we need to make modest reforms. I think we \ncan do that.\n  The reason we are dealing with this across-the-board sequester and \nthe reason we are talking about potential cuts that have to be made is \nwe have not had the courage and the will to stand up and recognize and \nacknowledge that it is the mandatory spending reforms that will put us \nin a place of fiscal health so we can continue the effective and \nessential functions of the Federal Government.\n  According to the International Monetary Fund, to cover current \nobligations for Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, our younger \ngeneration--our young people--will either have to pay 35 percent more \ntaxes and receive 35 percent lower benefits. Those are the facts. Do \nthe math, do the arithmetic. This is not ideological. This is not \nRepublicans versus Democrats, liberals versus conservatives. This is \npure numbers, pure math. It is an unsustainable course, and it is going \nto result in a massive decrease in benefits for those who pay into \nthose programs over a lifetime or a massive increase in taxes on those \nwho have to have that deducted from their paychecks and put into these \nprograms in order to keep them solvent.\n  We have to deal with that problem and deal with it now. We should \nhave been dealing with it years ago. We have seen this train wreck \ncoming, and it is getting ever closer. Now it is time for the \nPresident, having recognized the need to address this issue--now is the \ntime that he needs to show the American people he is willing to lead, \nnot from behind but from the front, and offer a specific plan to reform \nand strengthen our health and retirement security programs.\n  The President said the sequester--the across-the-board cuts where \neveryone gets nicked--is a terrible idea. It is his terrible idea, and \nit is not the best way to address our spending plight. It is not the \nbest way to deal with this because it basically assumes that every \nprogram is of equal value, that what is spent to provide security for \nthe American people by having an adequate and strong military is at the \nsame level as some program that has been proven years ago to be totally \ndysfunctional and efficient. But they would both get cut.\n  I will be laying out a number of things, as others have--like Senator \nCoburn to highlight some of those programs that need to be reevaluated. \nNot that we think all of these ought to be eliminated or trimmed or \nthat they don't fall into an essential category in terms of the role of \nthe Federal Government but there are several programs that nonpartisan \nagencies, such as the General Accounting Office, or even the \nPresident's own Office of Management and Budget have recommended, are \nnot worthy of the support they receive because they are not an \nessential function or they are even dysfunctional programs altogether.\n  We do not have to delve into the across-the-board sequester, which we \nhave no choice but to do now because we failed to live up to what we \nneeded to do--and I will be talking about that later, as I said.\n  I urge us to focus on fixing the country's fiscal health. We do not \ndo that by raising taxes, we do it by enacting broad spending reforms. \nWe do it by reducing our debt. We do it by creating a budget so we can \nlive within our means. And we do it by promoting growth, growing our \neconomy. A growing economy can solve a lot of problems and get a lot of \npeople back to work. This is how we strengthen America, and this is how \nwe get Americans back to work.\n  It is time we get to work and accomplish this task that lies before \nus now,\n\n[[Page S670]]\n\nnot later--no more deferrals, no more pushing it down the road. It is \ntime to step up now, as the President said, putting the interest of our \ncountry ahead of our own personal political interest, rising above the \npolitical to do what is right for America.\n  That is the challenge, and, Mr. President, we need your leadership.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER.

Madam President, Senator Sessions and I take to the floor \nto talk about immigration, which is obviously a very important and very \nhot topic. The first point I would like to make is just a simple \nstatement and suggestion. There has been a lot of activity and a lot of \ndiscussion about immigration in the Senate and in the Congress and \nWashington, DC. If we merely listen to a lot of beltway, so-called \nmainstream reporting about this, they would give the impression that \nthere is near universal consensus around a model we have tried before, \nwhich is a so-called comprehensive approach.\n  First, I don't think there is anything near universal agreement. I \ndon't think there is consensus. I think there are real questions and \nconcerns among many of us in the Senate and in Congress but, much more \nimportantly, in America and the real world.\n  I think those fundamental concerns come down to one thing; that is, \nwe have tried this so-called comprehensive approach before. We have \ntried proposals that marry an immediate amnesty with promises of \nenforcement. That model has not worked before. In fact, it has failed \nmiserably.\n  The most notable example was major immigration legislation in 1986. \nIt was the same model. It had comprehensive and immediate amnesty with \npromises of enforcement. There were promises that we will have to do \nthis just once, never have to look back, and the problem will be \nsolved. Of course, the problem was not solved. It didn't even just \ncontinue. The problem has quadrupled.\n  The amnesty did happen immediately. As soon as the bill passed, that \nvirtually and immediately kicked in. The promises of enforcement were \njust that, promises. Those promises were not kept, and as a result what \nhappened with that model? The problem of 3 million illegal aliens \ndidn't go away and was not solved once and for all. It quadrupled and \nbecame the present problem of 11 or 12 million--or more--illegal \naliens. That is the fundamental concern I have with most of the so-\ncalled comprehensive proposals being put forward. That is the \nfundamental concern of Louisianans I talk to every day.\n  We want to solve the problem. We don't want to perpetuate it, much \nless quadruple it. I think it is important to discuss alternative, more \neffective, more workable approaches. I have several ideas about what \nthose approaches might look like, and, in fact, I am introducing a \npackage of immigration bills today. I will talk about that further, but \nI certainly want to recognize and thank my good friend and colleague, \nSenator Sessions from Alabama, for joining me on the Senate floor \ntoday.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator for his leadership and in-depth \nstudy and knowledge about how these laws are working--and really not \nworking--in America today.\n  I just left a hearing in the Judiciary Committee. The chairman of \nthat committee, Senator Leahy, basically said--referring perhaps to \nme--they want enforcement first, but it seems they don't have any \ninterest in amnesty--or words to that effect. I would say the American \npeople's view is exactly the opposite. What the American people have \nbeen asking for and what they are afraid of is that we will have a deal \nlike 1986 where the amnesty provisions become law and were immediately \napplied, but the promises of enforcement never occurs. So I believe \nthat is a danger again.\n  It feels to me so much like 2007 when I, Senator Vitter, and others \nengaged and asked tough questions about the legislation which really \nresulted in its failure because it would not have done what the authors \nof it said it would do. So for 30 or 40 years the American people have \nsaid: End the lawlessness. That is what they have asked of us first. \nThey will work a way to be compassionate if the lawlessness has ended, \nbut that has not happened.\n  In fact, in a number of ways we have gone in the opposite direction. \nImprovement has occurred at the border in real numbers because over the \nlast several years--before President Obama took office--we agreed to \nincrease the number of Border Patrol agents. With the help of Senator \nVitter, I forced through legislation to build a fence. I am sure \nSenator Vitter remembers that debate.\n  Now everybody talks about how we have a fence, and they are bragging \nabout it. It is only 36 miles of the real fence we asked for. I am sure \nthe Senator from Louisiana remembers how they opposed every foot of it \nand how they resisted it in every way possible. They didn't favor \nadding border agents. There was a vote for border agents--and I \nremember speaking about it--but they never produced the money. So we \nauthorized border agents. People said they were for border agents, but \nthey would not vote for the money to support that. We had a big \ndiscussion and debate about that, and eventually we added some border \nagents. That has helped, but the problem is not fixed.\n  Internally, this administration has systematically dismantled \nenforcement inside the United States. Chris Crane, who is head of the \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement Union, is a marine and a great guy. \nThe ICE union has unanimously voted no confidence in John Morton, the \nhead of the ICE Department. They have sued the ICE Department because \nMorton blocked them from doing their sworn duty to enforce the law.\n  Today I asked Crane if he had ever met with Secretary Napolitano. \nChris testified about the bad morale that ICE agents have. A little \nover a year ago I asked Secretary Napolitano about the bad morale that \nICE agents have. Crane said he had never met her and has never shaken \nhands with her. At this point, we don't have the kind of commitment in \nlaw enforcement that I think gives the American people confidence that \nwe are moving forward on the right path.\n  Finally, I would just share with the Senator that I do think that \nmeans this is no sure thing. People are awfully confident that as long \nas some big names are on the bill, it is just going to pass. I am not \nconfident that is so.\n  Mr. VITTER. I thank the Senator, and I certainly agree. Again, the \nfundamental issue is, Is the model that has been tried before really \ngoing to work--an immediate amnesty with promises of enforcement? \nUnfortunately, history is littered with examples of that exact model \nfailing and those promises of enforcement never being kept.\n  What do I mean by that? I mentioned 1986, which is the biggest \nhistorical example: An immediate amnesty where we are going to get \nserious about enforcement, we will never have to look back, and we will \nhave to do this once. We will solve the problem.\n  Of course, it didn't solve the problem; it quadrupled the problem. \nThere were 3 million illegal aliens back then. There are 11 to 12 \nmillion illegal aliens now. There have been promises of a U.S.-VISIT \nProgram with an entry-and-exit system to track everyone entering the \ncountry and making sure they exit in time. That was first promised back \nin 1986. Ten years later, in 1996, Congress passed another act to \nrequire a fully integrated entry-exit system with full implementation \nby 2005. Guess what. 2005 has come and gone. It has been 30 years since \nthat initial promise was made. We still don't have an operational and \neffective U.S.-VISIT system.\n  My colleague from Alabama mentioned another glaring example: the\n\n[[Page S671]]\n\nSecure Fence Act of 2006, which we actually passed in legislation. The \nSecure Fence Act of 2006 promises to achieve operational control for \nthe entire border. It defined ``operational control'' as ``the \nprevention of all unlawful entries into the United States, including \nentries by terrorists, other unlawful aliens, instruments of terrorism, \nnarcotics, and other contraband.'' We have not achieved that.\n  In fact, we are so far from that goal, DHS has had to weaken the \ndefinition so it only now talks about effective operational control. \nThey had to stick the word ``effective'' in there because we never had \noperational control. Who knows exactly what that means, but GAO tried \nto define and tried to measure it in a recent report.\n  In their recent report they found that only 44 percent of the \nsouthern border was under any sort of operational control. Only 15 \npercent of that is under full operational control. Even if we use the \nloosey-goosey word ``effective,'' we have less than one-half of the \nborder under that control. More than one-half of the border is under \nwhat they call managed control, which often means no control. It means \na lot of almost fully unfettered, illegal crosses.\n  Now we come to today with this debate, and the new promise: If you \njust give us immediate amnesty, we are going to have this enforcement. \nWe promise, we promise, we promise. Again, we are concerned that we are \nreliving history in a negative way.\n  For instance, when the Gang of 8 declares they ``will ensure . . . a \nsuccessful permanent reform to our immigration system that will not \nneed to be revisited,'' that sure sounds like 1986, with this one fix \nthat we will never have to look back. But, of course, we are looking \nback because the problem has grown. It is interesting to note that the \nvery day after the Gang of 8 announcement, there was even disagreement \nbetween some of the gang members regarding what they announced and what \nthey promised.\n  Many of the Republican members of that Gang of 8 emphasized that \nenforcement has to happen; otherwise, nothing else is triggered. Yet on \nthe other side of the political spectrum, Senator Schumer--also a \nmember of that Gang of 8--walked back any commitment to fully secure \nenforcement before citizenship happened. He said: ``We're not using \nborder security as an excuse or a block to the path to citizenship.''\n  So there we have it. After the announcement, there is apparent \ninconsistency about how serious they are about ensuring enforcement, \nand that is the fundamental question. I think that is a very legitimate \nconcern given the past history.\n  We have proposed a different path forward with a targeted, step-by-\nstep approach to prove to ourselves and the American people that we are \nserious about these enforcement and related reforms, to do those, and \nto have them working before we move on anything else.\n  Today I am introducing a series of bills that fall into that \ntargeted, step-by-step approach. I do not use the word \n``comprehensive'' because I think that word is a negative. It is \ntargeted, and it is step by step. I will outline those bills in a \nminute.\n  Again, I certainly want to thank and recognize the Senator from \nAlabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Would the Senator from Mississippi say the enforcement \nof immigration laws is an area--based on the Senator's experience in \nCongress, in the House and in the Senate--where the difference between \nthe promises of what is going to happen and what actually happens is \ngreater than almost any other issue we have dealt with, where people \nare promising this and only delivering something else?\n  Mr. VITTER. Absolutely. Unfortunately, that is the history, tried and \ntrue: lots of promises. No single major promise has been kept. Whether \nit is the fence, whether it is the US-VISIT Program, whether it is the \noverall promise of enforcement in 1986, none of those promises has been \nkept.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. According to some news reports--to follow up on the \npoint the Senator made about sending two messages, one promising the \npeople one thing and the other telling special-interest groups another \nthing--one report said Democratic Senators have assured immigration \nactivists that the so-called enforcement trigger is just a ``talking \npoint'' to give Republicans, who are supporting this scheme, this plan, \nas cover and there will not ever be an impediment to the achievement of \namnesty. Does that make the Senator from Mississippi uneasy, that \npeople who are supposed to be speaking in good faith, telling their \nRepublican colleagues and the American people they have a plan that is \ngoing to guarantee enforcement while they are telling, apparently, the \nactivists something quite different?\n  Mr. VITTER. That makes me very nervous and very uneasy. It is exactly \nwhat Senator Schumer said the very next day after the announcement: \n``We're not using border security as an excuse or a block to the path \nto citizenship.''\n  Mr. SESSIONS. In other words--well, the words Senator Schumer is \nsaying are quite plain. I have a great deal of respect for him. I know \nhe wants to accomplish something valuable here. But it does seem to me \nhe is saying, Well, if enforcement doesn't occur, we promise there will \nbe a trigger and there will be no amnesty unless enforcement occurs; \nbut if we get there and enforcement doesn't occur, you are still going \nto get your amnesty.\n  Mr. VITTER. That is what it sounds like to me. It sounds to me as \nthough the trigger is meaningless. The amnesty and even full \ncitizenship--to me, amnesty is any legal status, but they are actually \ntalking about a path to full citizenship will happen ultimately, no \nmatter what on the enforcement side.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will conclude and yield to my esteemed colleague to \nlay out some ideas he has to actually improve enforcement so that if we \nget to the point where we can achieve a legal system that operates \neffectively in America, we will know it when it happens. We can get \nthere. Without some of these provisions Senator Vitter will recommend, \nI am confident we will not get there. If people won't support these \nkinds of provisions, then it raises questions about whether they are \nserious about their promises to end the lawlessness.\n  I just left a Judiciary Committee hearing. Mr. Vargas testified, who \nwas here apparently illegally, came at the age of 12. I asked him: \nShould a good Nation have a legal system that has clear laws, clear \npolicies, and those laws are in force? And he said yes. So there is \nnothing wrong, nothing immoral, nothing unconstitutional for the \nAmerican people to say we should have a lawful system of immigration. \nEverybody is not able to come. You have to wait in line and wait your \nturn and meet the qualifications before you come. And if you try to \nenter illegally, there will be consequences. There is nothing immoral \nabout that. It is only common sense. It is only the right thing to do.\n  I thank the Senator from Mississippi for his work on this and the \nideas he will be presenting to us.\n  Mr. VITTER. I thank the Senator from Alabama for his leadership on \nthis issue and on the Judiciary Committee.\n  There is, Madam President, an alternative way forward, a positive, \nproductive way forward, a targeted, step-by-step approach that is \nappropriate, particularly given all the broken promises of the past.\n  The American people need to be convinced, and who can blame them? \nAgain, the landscape of this issue is littered with utterly broken \npromises. We need to rebuild that trust and rebuild that confidence, \nand we can only do that in a targeted, step-by-step way.\n  I don't claim to have all the answers, but I am introducing today \nseven bills--actually, six bills, and I am joining Senator Grassley as \na coauthor of a seventh bill--that would be important parts of this \ntargeted, step-by-step approach. Let me briefly mention what those \nseven bills are.\n  First of all, the STEM Jobs Act of 2013. This would make up to 55,000 \nvisas available to qualified immigrants whom we need in this economy--\nwell educated, qualified. We have jobs here ready for them, and it \nwould be an enormous economic boost. They would have a doctorate degree \nin the field of science, engineering, technology, or math from a U.S. \ndoctoral institution and would have taken all doctoral courses in the \nSTEM field while in the United States. We train, we educate\n\n[[Page S672]]\n\nthose superqualified folks all the time and then, all too often, we \nsend them back to their native countries and don't allow them to remain \nhere to get on a pathway to citizenship and to contribute, as they \nwould, to our economy.\n  A child tax credit law. This would amend the IRS Code to simply put \nin place significant identification requirements for the child tax \ncredit to require taxpayers to provide that valid ID, to cut out what \nis admitted to be rampant fraud in the system. The IRS itself and its \ninspector general office have said there is at least $1.3 billion of \nfraud a year in the child tax credit. These checks from the taxpayer, \nactual checks going out to illegal recipients who do not qualify under \nthe law, in some cases, dozens, allegedly, at a single address, a \nsingle family, are clearly fraud. We must meet some basic requirements \nto cut out that fraud. The IRS itself, under this administration, has \nasked for those tools. We should give them those tools under this child \ntax credit legislation.\n  Sanctuary cities reform would prohibit appropriated funds from being \nused in contravention of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act of 1986. I am joined by Senator Grassley and Senator \nFischer in that legislation.\n  Too many jurisdictions in the United States are self-proclaimed \nsanctuary cities. By doing that, they are in contravention of Federal \nimmigration law when they say they will not cooperate in the \nenforcement of that law in any way. That is unacceptable, and those \ncities should not get appropriated funds.\n  E-Verify I mentioned is an initiative and legislation by Senator \nGrassley. I am proud to join him as a coauthor. I am an original \ncosponsor of that bill. It would take the present E-Verify system and \nmake it mandatory and expand it so that is our workforce system of \nenforcement. E-Verify works. The problem is it is a pilot. It is not \nmandatory and it is not broad enough. We need to broaden and make \nmandatory that workable E-Verify system.\n  The Voter Integrity Protection Act would amend the INA to make voting \nin a Federal election by an alien who is unlawfully in the United \nStates an aggravated felony, which makes it a deportable offense. If \na person is illegally participating in our elections, that is a serious \noffense to any democracy. That should be a deportable offense.\n\n  The Birthright Citizenship Act would also amend the law to consider a \nperson born in the United States ``subject to the jurisdiction'' of the \nUnited States for citizenship only if the person is born through at \nleast one parent who is a U.S. citizen or national or a lawful \npermanent resident alien in the United States or an alien performing \nactive service in the U.S. Armed Forces. Right now it is, in my \nopinion, an accident of history and a mistake that any child physically \nborn here, even of two parents here illegally and improperly, \nautomatically becomes a U.S. citizen. Virtually no other country in the \nworld has this rule. This reform would simply amend U.S. law to have \nthe same basic rule as virtually every other country in the world I am \naware of. A person doesn't automatically become a citizen just because \nthey are physically born here; at least one parent has to have that \nlegal status.\n  Finally, US-VISIT reform, finally, after decades of promises, after \ndecades of broken promises, to require that the US-VISIT system--the \nbiometric border check-in/check-out system first required in 1996 that \nis well past its implementation date of 2005--be finished, be done, be \nfully in place before any of these other triggered aspects of so-called \ncomprehensive reform happen. On that reform, I am proud to be joined by \nSenator Sessions and Senator Lee as coauthors.\n  Again, I am introducing these six bills today. I am also an original \ncosponsor of Senator Grassley's E-Verify bill, a seventh bill. I think \nthis is a targeted, step-by-step approach which is the right \nalternative to so-called comprehensive reform, which historically means \nimmediate amnesty married to promises of enforcement that never happen, \nthat never fully materialize.\n  I urge my colleagues to look hard at these measures and hopefully \nsupport some or all of them. I urge them even more to go back home and \nlisten to their constituents, to listen hard at the neighborhood coffee \nshop and the townhall meetings, because I think these sorts of \nconcerns, as Senator Sessions and I have expressed today, are the core \nconcerns, the core questions of a great majority of the American \npeople.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/13/senate-section/article/S672-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S672-S675]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  NOMINATION OF WILLIAM J.

Mr. President, I am delighted to rise in strong support \nof the confirmation of William Kayatta of Maine to serve on the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the First Circuit.\n  Mr. Kayatta was originally nominated to this position more than 1 \nyear ago. He was approved by the Judiciary Committee on a bipartisan \nvote last April. Unfortunately, despite his exceptional qualifications, \nhis nomination was stalled by election-year politics. That is finally \nbehind us, and I am pleased the President renominated Mr. Kayatta in \nJanuary.\n  I wish to thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, my colleague \nfrom Vermont Senator Leahy; the ranking member Senator Grassley; and, \nindeed, all the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee for acting \npromptly and positively in favor of Mr. Kayatta's renomination.\n  Let me also express my gratitude to the two leaders, Senator Reid and \nSenator McConnell, for moving his nomination so quickly to the Senate \nfloor.\n  Mr. Kayatta is an attorney of exceptional intelligence, extensive \nexperience, and demonstrated integrity. I cannot tell you how highly \nregarded he is in Maine's legal circles. In fact, if you ask virtually \nany attorney, judge, prosecutor, law professor or anyone involved in \nthe legal profession in Maine, they will tell you the President could \nnot have made a better choice than Bill Kayatta. He graduated magna cum \nlaude from both Amherst College and Harvard University Law School, \nwhere he served as a member of the Law Review.\n  After graduating from law school, Mr. Kayatta clerked for the chief \njudge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, Frank Coffin. \nIt is a wonderful symmetry that he now, assuming the confirmation goes \nwell this afternoon, will be joining the court for which he clerked \nmany years ago.\n  In 1980, he joined the prestigious law firm of Pierce Atwood in \nPortland, ME, where over the subsequent 32 years Bill specialized in \ncomplex civil litigation at both the trial and appellate levels. Bill \nKayatta has served as chairman of both the Maine Professional Ethics \nCommission, the Maine Board of Bar Examiners, and as president of the \nMaine Bar Association.\n  In 2002, Mr. Kayatta was inducted into the American College of Trial \nLawyers, and in 2010 he was elected by his peers to the college's board \nof regents.\n  Mr. Kayatta has simultaneously maintained a very substantial pro bono \npractice. In the year 2010, he received the Maine Bar Foundation's \nHoward H. Dana Award for career-long pro bono service on behalf of low-\nincome Mainers.\n  In 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court appointed him as a special master in \nKansas v. Nebraska and Colorado, an original water rights case. That \ntoo is an indication of the Court's confidence in Mr. Kayatta's legal \nabilities.\n\n[[Page S673]]\n\n  Finally, Mr. Kayatta has earned the American Bar Association's \nhighest rating: ``unanimously well-qualified,'' reflecting the ABA's \nassessment of his credentials, experience, and temperament.\n  Mr. Kayatta's impressive background makes him eminently qualified for \na seat on the First Circuit. His 30-plus years of real-world litigation \nexperience would bring a valuable perspective to the court.\n  The First Circuit has only six authorized judgeships, the fewest of \nany circuit. It acutely feels any vacancy that arises. The First \nCircuit has not been at full strength since January 1, 2012, when Judge \nKermit Lipez took active senior status. Now the circuit's caseload must \nbe distributed among just five judges who continue to do their best to \nprovide the timely and measured justice for which the First Circuit has \nlong been known.\n  The State of Maine is very proud of its history of providing superb \njurists to the Federal bench. I am confident William Kayatta will \ncontinue in that fine tradition, and I urge my colleagues to join me in \nvoting for his confirmation, a vote that is long overdue but has \nfinally arrived.\n  Again, I wish to thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the \nranking member, and the two leaders, Senator Reid and Senator \nMcConnell, for moving this important nomination to the Senate floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Maine for \nher kind words, and I would note both for William Kayatta and for the \npeople of Maine she has fought long and hard for this nomination. She \ndid last year and she has this year. I am glad we are going to be \nfinally voting on it because every time I would meet her anywhere in \nthe halls or anywhere else it would be: What about Kayatta? She knows \nhe, of course, had my strong support, as did another New Englander, \nformer Justice and now judge, David Souter. I am sorry it has taken so \nlong.\n  I look at a nominee like this, where the senior Senator from Maine, \nMs. Collins, her former colleague, Senator Snowe, and now her current \ncolleague, Senator King, have all supported this person from Maine. In \nthe past, especially with somebody extraordinarily well qualified, as \nhe is, a nomination like that would be out of the committee and off the \nfloor within a week. We have to go back to those times.\n  If we have a contentious nominee, if we have somebody who needs to be \ndebated, let's debate them. But when we have a person strongly \nsupported by their home State Senators and who has the advantage of \nbeing highly qualified by anybody's standards--Republican, Democrat, or \nanybody else--then they ought to get a vote.\n  It makes no sense for Senate Republicans to have stalled nominations \nlike that of William Kayatta, but this is their track record and their \npattern over the last 4 years. Senate Republicans used to insist that \nthe filibustering of judicial nominations was unconstitutional. The \nConstitution has not changed, but as soon as President Obama was \nelected they reversed course and filibustered President Obama's very \nfirst judicial nomination. Judge David Hamilton of Indiana was a \nwidely-respected 15-year veteran of the Federal bench nominated to the \nSeventh Circuit and was supported by Senator Dick Lugar, the longest-\nserving Republican in the Senate. They delayed his confirmation for 7 \nmonths. Senate Republicans then proceeded to obstruct and delay just \nabout every circuit court nominee of this President, filibustering 10 \nof them. They delayed confirmation of Judge Albert Diaz of North \nCarolina to the Fourth Circuit for 11 months. They delayed confirmation \nof Judge Jane Stranch of Tennessee to the Sixth Circuit for 10 months. \nThey delayed confirmation of Judge Ray Lohier of New York to the Second \nCircuit for 7 months. They delayed confirmation of Judge Scott Matheson \nof Utah to the Tenth Circuit and Judge James Wynn, Jr. of North \nCarolina to the Fourth Circuit for 6 months. They delayed confirmation \nof Judge Andre Davis of Maryland to the Fourth Circuit, Judge Henry \nFloyd of South Carolina to the Fourth Circuit, Judge Stephanie Thacker \nof West Virginia to the Fourth Circuit, and Judge Jacqueline Nguyen of \nCalifornia to the Ninth Circuit for 5 months. They delayed confirmation \nof Judge Adalberto Jordan of Florida to the Eleventh Circuit, Judge \nBeverly Martin of Georgia to the Eleventh Circuit, Judge Mary Murguia \nof Arizona to the Ninth Circuit, Judge Bernice Donald of Tennessee to \nthe Sixth Circuit, Judge Barbara Keenan of Virginia to the Fourth \nCircuit, Judge Thomas Vanaskie of Pennsylvania to the Third Circuit, \nJudge Joseph Greenaway of New Jersey to the Third Circuit, Judge Denny \nChin of New York to the Second Circuit, and Judge Chris Droney of \nConnecticut to the Second Circuit for 4 months. They delayed \nconfirmation of Judge Paul Watford of California to the Ninth Circuit, \nJudge Andrew Hurwitz of Arizona to the Ninth Circuit, Judge Morgan \nChristen of Alaska to the Ninth Circuit, Judge Stephen Higginson of \nLouisiana to the Fifth Circuit, Judge Gerard Lynch of New York to the \nSecond Circuit, Judge Susan Carney of Connecticut to the Second \nCircuit, and Judge Kathleen O'Malley of Ohio to the Federal Circuit for \n3 months.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service has reported that the \nmedian time circuit nominees have had to wait before a Senate vote has \nskyrocketed from 18 days for President Bush's nominees to 132 days for \nPresident Obama's. This is the result of Republican obstruction.\n  This obstruction is also why a damagingly high level of judicial \nvacancies has persisted for over 4 years. While such tactics are bad \nfor the Senate, they are also bad for our Nation's overburdened courts. \nPersistent vacancies force fewer judges to take on growing caseloads, \nand make it harder for Americans to have access to justice. While they \nhave delayed and obstructed, the number of judicial vacancies has \nremained historically high and it has become more difficult for our \ncourts to provide speedy, quality justice for the American people. \nThere are today 90 judicial vacancies across the country. By way of \ncontrast, that is more than double the number of vacancies that existed \nat this point in the Bush administration. The 173 circuit and district \njudges that we have been able to confirm over the last 4 years fall \nmore than 30 short of the total for President Bush's first term.\n  Over the last 4 years, Senate Republicans have chosen to depart \ndramatically from Senate traditions in their efforts to delay and \nobstruct President Obama's judicial nominations. Until 2009, Senators \nwho filibustered circuit court nominees generally had reasons to do so, \nand were willing to explain those reasons. When Senate Democrats \nfilibustered President Bush's controversial circuit court nominees, it \nwas over substantive concerns about the nominees' records and \nRepublicans' disregard for the rights of Democratic Senators. On the \nother hand, Senate Republicans have filibustered and delayed nearly all \nof President Obama's circuit court nominees even when those nominees \nhave the support of their Republican home State Senators.\n  At the end of each calendar year, Senate Republicans now deliberately \nrefuse to vote on several judicial nominees who could and should be \nconfirmed in order to consume additional time the following year \nconfirming these nominees. At the end of 2009, they left 10 nominations \non the Executive Calendar without a vote. Two of those nominations were \nreturned to the President, and it subsequently took 9 months for the \nSenate to take action on the other eight. This resulted in the lowest \n1-year confirmation total in at least 35 years. For the next 2 years, \nSenate Republicans left 19 nominations on the Senate executive calendar \nat the end of each year. It then took nearly half the following year \nfor the Senate to confirm these nominees. Last year they insisted on \nleaving 11 judicial nominees without action and another four have had \nhearings but they refused to expedite their consideration. William \nKayatta is one of those judicial nominees who should have been \nconfirmed last year.\n  Until 2009, when a judicial nominee had been reported by the \nJudiciary Committee with bipartisan support, they were generally \nconfirmed quickly. Until 2009, we observed regular order, usually \nconfirmed nominees promptly, and we cleared the Senate Executive \nCalendar before long recesses. Until 2009, if a nominee was \nfilibustered, it was almost always because of a substantive issue with \nthe nominee's\n\n[[Page S674]]\n\nrecord. We know what has happened since 2009. The median district \nnomination is stalled 4.3 times as long as it took to confirm them \nduring the Bush administration, and the median circuit court nomination \nis stalled 7.3 times as long as it took to confirm them during the Bush \nadministration. Nor has any other President's judicial nominees had to \nwait an average of over 100 days for a Senate vote after being reported \nby the Judiciary Committee.\n\n  Senate Republicans have also forced the majority leader to file \ncloture on 30 nominees, which is already more than 50 percent more \nnominees than had cloture filed during President Bush's 8 years in \noffice. Almost all of these 30 nominations were noncontroversial and \nwere ultimately confirmed overwhelmingly. Barely 80 percent of \nPresident Obama's judicial nominees were confirmed during his first 4 \nyears compared to almost 90 percent of President George W. Bush's first \nterm nominees.\n  While this is not even close to a full account of the precedents \nbroken in the last 4 years, the record is clear: Senate Republicans \nhave engaged in an unprecedented effort to obstruct President Obama's \njudicial nominations. Pretending it has not taken place is an insult to \nthe American people. The American people know better. Chief Justice \nRoberts, in his year-end Report on the Federal Judiciary in 2010 \npointed to the ``[P]ersistent problem [that] has developed in the \nprocess of filling judicial vacancies . . . This has created acute \ndifficulties for some judicial districts. Sitting judges in those \ndistricts have been burdened with extraordinary caseloads . . . There \nremains, however, an urgent need for the political branches to find a \nlong-term solution to this recurring problem.'' Despite bipartisan \ncalls to address the judicial vacancy crisis, Senate Republicans have \ncontinued their obstruction of judicial confirmations.\n  Today, the Senate is finally being allowed to vote on one of the \nnominees held over from last year. Judicial vacancies right now stand \nat 90. And I mention that because during President Bush's entire second \nterm--the 4 years from 2004 through 2008--the vacancies never exceeded \n60. I worked very hard to keep the vacancies down, but since President \nObama's first full month in office, as far as we can see, there have \nnever been fewer than 60 vacancies, and for much of that time many, \nmany more. This is a prescription for overburdened courts and a Federal \njustice system that does not serve the interests of the American \npeople. It means people who come to our courts looking for impartial \njustice can't get it because there are no judges.\n  This is hurting the integrity of the judicial system. I hear this \nfrom judges nominated by Republican Presidents and those nominated by \nDemocratic Presidents. They say these delays politicize the courts and \ndestroy the impartiality the Federal courts have to have.\n  I commend President Obama for nominating such a diverse group of \nqualified judges. In his first 4 years, President Obama has appointed \nas many women judges as President Bush did during his entire 8 years in \noffice. In just 4 years, President Obama has also nominated more \nAfrican Americans, more Asian Americans, and more openly gay Americans \nthan his predecessor did in 8 years. Americans can be proud of \nPresident Obama's efforts to increase diversity in the Federal \njudiciary and to ensure that it better reflects all Americans.\n  I hope that this year and over the coming 4 years, Senate Republicans \nwill end their misguided and harmful obstruction and work with us in a \nbipartisan manner to do what is right for the country. President Obama \nhas nominated qualified, mainstream lawyers, and the Senate should \nconsider them in regular order, without unnecessary delays. That is \nwhat we had done for as long as I have served in the Senate, whether \nthe nominations came from a Democratic or a Republican president. We \nshould work together to restore and uphold the best traditions of the \nSenate.\n  Last Thursday, the Senate Judiciary Committee reported three judicial \nnominees, William Kayatta, Robert Bacharach, and Richard Taranto. They \nare all superbly qualified, consensus nominees. All have received the \nhighest possible rating of unanimously well qualified from the ABA's \nStanding Committee on the Federal Judiciary, and with last Thursday's \nJudiciary Committee votes, all have twice now received overwhelming, \nbipartisan support from members of the Judiciary Committee from both \nsides of the aisle. All have something else in common too: Their \nnominations were stalled before the Senate for at least 7 months last \nyear without a vote. That is why they each had to be re-nominated by \nthe President this year.\n  This is sadly typical of how Senate Republicans have treated \nPresident Obama's consensus judicial nominees. Even nominees who are \nsupported by Republican home state Senators and by all the Republican \nmembers of the Judiciary Committee are stalled for months for no good \nreason. They are delaying votes on all nominees, including nominees \nthey support. This is unprecedented.\n  For example, Senator Coburn said that ``[Judge Bacharach] has no \nopposition in the Senate. . . . There's no reason why he shouldn't be \nconfirmed.'' That was before Senator Coburn joined a filibuster against \nvoting on his nomination last year. Last year's filibuster of the \nBacharach nomination was the first time in the history of the Senate \nthat a circuit nominee reported with bipartisan support had been \nsuccessfully filibustered. When I say unprecedented, I mean \nunprecedented.\n  I am glad that William Kayatta is finally getting a vote. The nominee \nspent the entirety of his 32-year legal career in private practice in \nthe Portland, ME, law firm Pierce Atwood LLP, where he is currently a \npartner. Over his career, he has personally argued over three dozen \nappeals, including two before the United States Supreme Court. He \ngraduated magna cum laude from Harvard Law School, where he served on \nthe Harvard Law Review. Upon graduation, he clerked for Chief Judge \nFrank Coffin on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, the \ncourt to which he is nominated.\n  William Kayatta has held a prominent leadership role in numerous \nprofessional organizations, including serving as the lead investigator \nfor the American Bar Association Standing Committee of the Federal \nJudiciary during its review of Justice Kagan's nomination to the \nSupreme Court. He was also appointed by the U.S. Supreme Court to serve \nas Special Master in an interstate dispute, where he was charged with \nmanaging proceedings and submitting a report and recommendation to the \nCourt. The ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary \nunanimously rated Mr. Kayatta well qualified to serve on the First \nCircuit, its highest possible rating.\n\n  While it is good that William Kayatta will finally receive a vote \ntoday, it is also well past time for the Senate to vote on Robert \nBacharach and Richard Taranto. Perpetuating these vacancies on the \nTenth and Federal Circuits, and preventing Judge Bacharach and Mr. \nTaranto from getting to work on behalf of the American people, does not \nbenefit anyone. The Judiciary Committee has again done its work to vet, \nconsider, and vote on these nominations. It is time that the other two \ncircuit nominees who were renominated and considered again by the \nJudiciary Committee and again reported to the Senate, be given an up-\nor-down vote.\n  The Senate could confirm all three nominees this week. In June 2005, \nthe Senate confirmed four circuit court nominees of a Republican \nPresident in just 2 days, including highly controversial nominees such \nas Janice Rogers Brown to the D.C. Circuit and William Pryor to the \nEleventh Circuit. In July 2006, the Senate confirmed Bobby Shepherd to \nthe Eighth Circuit, Neil Gorsuch and Jerome Holmes of the Tenth Circuit \nwithin 1 week. There is ample recent precedent for confirming Judge \nBacharach and Richard Taranto without further delay. Neither is \ncontroversial.\n  William Kayatta is strongly supported by both of Maine's Senators, \nRepublican Senator Susan Collins and Independent Senator Angus King. \nWhen George W. Bush was President, Senate Democrats worked quickly to \nhold votes on consensus circuit nominees. According to the nonpartisan \nCongressional Research Service, half of President Bush's circuit \nnominees received a confirmation vote within just 18 days of being \nreported by the Judiciary Committee. Not a single one of\n\n[[Page S675]]\n\nPresident Obama's circuit nominees has received a vote so quickly. In \nfact, the median wait time for President Obama's circuit nominees is \nmore than seven times that for President Bush's circuit nominees.\n  This continued obstruction is one of the reasons we remain so far \nbehind the pace set during President Bush's time in office. By February \nof President Bush's fifth year, the Senate had confirmed 205 of his \ncircuit and district nominees, and judicial vacancies stood at 40. In \ncontrast, just 173 of President Obama's circuit and district nominees \nhave been confirmed, and the vacancy rate has risen again to 90, or \nmore than 10 percent of the Federal bench. Judicial vacancies are \nnearly back at historically high levels.\n  Perpetuating these vacancies on the Tenth and Federal Circuits, and \npreventing Judge Bacharach and Richard Taranto from getting to work on \nbehalf of the American people, does not benefit anyone. The Judiciary \nCommittee has again done its work to vet, consider, and vote on these \nnominations. It is time for the Senate to act to confirm them.\n  I will speak more on nominations as we go along, but I do want to \ncongratulate not only the senior Senator from Maine but also Senator \nKing and the people of Maine, and the people of the First Circuit. The \ncircuit needs to have its vacancies filled, and I am glad we have such \na good person.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield back all time on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.\n  All time having been yielded back, the question is, Will the Senate \nadvise and consent to the nomination of William J.

Mr. President, few Americans have helped this great \ncountry reach for the stars more than Gen. Chuck Yeager. Long before \nthere were astronauts there was Chuck Yeager, a fearless test pilot, a \ntrue aviation pioneer paving the way for America's exploration of the \ngalaxy. But Chuck Yeager's military career involved so much more than \njust testing cutting-edge aircraft and, as almost everyone knows, \nbecoming the first man to fly faster than the speed of sound. Few \nAmericans have been as unwavering or as relentless as Chuck Yeager in \ndefense of this great country, in war and in peace, from World War II \nto Vietnam.\n  He was part of the ``greatest generation'' of Americans, the \ngeneration that fought and won World War II and then came home and made \nAmerica the world's greatest superpower. Among the greatest in that \ngeneration was Chuck Yeager.\n  Today is Chuck's 90th birthday, and I invite the entire Senate to \njoin me in congratulating him. I am so proud of this man. Not only is \nhe a native son of West Virginia but he is also a dear friend of mine. \nChuck lives in California now, with his wife Victoria, but he still \ncomes to West Virginia to hunt with me and roam the hills where he grew \nup.\n  He also visits the State from time to time to promote the foundation \nwhich bears his name, and which supports a scholarship program at \nMarshall University.\n  When I was Governor, Chuck and Victoria would sometimes visit Gayle \nand me at the Governor's Mansion. Some of you know I am a pilot, and \nduring one of his visits to West Virginia I got him to join me on a \nflight. We were trying out a new airplane for the State. It was a real \nhonor, but it was a little bit daunting, if you will, that I am flying \nleft seat and Chuck is right behind me, evaluating the entire flight. \nLooking over my shoulder, having the greatest pilot who ever lived \nsitting there, was something I will never forget.\n  Some of the story of Chuck's life you probably know and some of it \nyou may not. Chuck grew up in the small town of Hamlin. That is in \nLincoln County, WV, so deep in an Appalachian holler that folks there \nused to say you had to pump in the sunshine. His father Albert Hal \nworked as a driller in the gasfields. His mother Susie Mae took care of \nChuck, his two brothers, and two sisters.\n\n  Chuck and his father went hunting and fishing together. Chuck also \nworked with his father in the oilfields. He was fascinated by the \ndrilling equipment. He liked cars--real fast cars. He especially liked \nhis old man's Chevy truck. He not only drove it, he studied all of its \nmechanical details. He could basically take it apart and rebuild it.\n  Looking back, it is not surprising that in the middle of World War \nII, a patriotic kid from West Virginia who was good with rifles, \nmechanical equipment, and fast cars enlisted in the U.S. Air Force as \nan airplane mechanic--his first step toward becoming the single \ngreatest pilot who has ever lived.\n  A new ``flying sergeants'' program eventually gave him his first \nchance to fly. Up until that time it was officers only. His first \ncouple training flights didn't go so well. Some people might not know \nthis, but he had to overcome airsickness. Can you believe that Chuck \nYeager got airsick? Before long he found a new home in the sky in the \ncockpit of an airplane.\n  During World War II, Chuck flew numerous combat missions over Europe \nand shot down 13 enemy aircraft--5 in 1 mission. He was shot down over \nGerman-occupied France in 1944 but escaped capture to fly another day. \nBut\n\n[[Page S676]]\n\nbefore he could do that, he had to argue his case against being sent \nhome under a no more combat rule. The rule was basically if a pilot was \nshot down, they could not let them go back, because if they were \ncaptured, they could basically tell who the people who saved them were. \nHe pushed his way all the way up the chain of command to Supreme Allied \nCommander General Dwight D. Eisenhower. Ike ultimately granted Chuck's \nrequest to stay with his men.\n  After the war, Chuck became a test pilot. On October 14, 1947, he did \nwhat no man had done before--he broke the sound barrier in the \nexperimental X-1 plane named the ``Glamorous Glennis,'' after his late \nwife. His fabled flight ushered in a new era of aviation that prepared \nAmerica for its greatest leap into space and so began the legend of \nChuck Yeager.\n  Tom Wolfe wrote in ``The Right Stuff''--a movie most of us have seen. \nIf you haven't seen it, I suggest you do. Tom Wolfe wrote:\n\n       There were . . . other pilots with enough Pilot Ego to \n     believe that they were actually better than this drawlin' hot \n     dog.\n\n  Chuck had a way with words, if you ever have a chance to speak with \nhim.\n\n       But no one could contest the fact that as of that time, the \n     1950s, Chuck Yeager was at the top of the pyramid, number one \n     among all the True Brothers.\n\n  Throughout his long military career, General Yeager flew more than \n10,000 hours in more than 330 models of aircraft. In 1966, he flew 127 \nmissions in South Vietnam. He received numerous awards, including the \nDistinguished Service Medal, the Silver Star, the Bronze Star, the \nPurple Heart, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the special \npeacetime Medal of Honor. He was the youngest military pilot to be \ninducted into the Aviation Hall of Fame in 1973.\n  Chuck officially retired from the Air Force in 1975 but maintained \nhis status as a test pilot for another three decades, occasionally \nflying for the Air Force and NASA as a consultant.\n  In 1997, on the 50th anniversary of his historic flight breaking the \nsound barrier, he again flew past Mach One in an F-15D Eagle named the \n``Glamorous Glennis III.'' It was his last official flight with the Air \nForce. Of course, nothing stops Chuck Yeager. So last October on the \n65th anniversary of breaking the sound barrier, he did it again, in \nanother aircraft, at the age of 89.\n  Whenever he is asked about all his exploits, Chuck says he was just \n``doing his job,'' and that all he is he ``owes to the Air Force.'' He \nhas never ever wavered from that.\n  In his autobiography, he wrote:\n\n       My beginnings back in West Virginia tell who I am to this \n     day. My accomplishments as a pilot tell more about luck, \n     happenstance, and a person's destiny. But the guy who broke \n     the sound barrier was the kid who swam the Mud River with a \n     swiped watermelon, or shot the head off a squirrel before \n     school.\n\n  Tom Wolfe believed Chuck Yeager to be the ``most righteous of all \npossessors of the right stuff.'' Wolfe himself struggled to explain \nwhat he meant by ``the right stuff.'' His best explanation was that \n``the right stuff'' is that rare, almost indefinable mix of bravery, \nheroism, hard work, and focus that someone brings to ``a cause that \nmeans something to a people, a nation, to humanity, to God.'' That \ndescribes Gen. Chuck Yeager as well as anything else I know.\n  He is a man of extraordinary skill and legendary courage. He has an \nunparalleled sense of duty and service to his country. He risked his \nlife over and over. He is a great West Virginian. He is a great \nAmerican. On his 90th birthday he is still, without a doubt, a man with \n``the right stuff.''\n  I wish my dear friend the happiest of birthdays, and I urge every \nSenator to join me in saluting Gen. Chuck Yeager for his long and \ncourageous service to this great country.\n  Thank you, General Yeager.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to commemorate--along with my \ndistinguished friend and colleague Senator Jerry Moran--the 150th \nanniversary of Kansas State University--home of the ever-optimistic \nWildcats.\n  Since its beginning--even before Kansas joined the union as a free \nState--all the way up to today, Kansas State University continues to \nprovide a first-rate education for thousands and thousands of students.\n  To quote the K-State alma mater lyrics: ``I know a spot that I love \nfull well.'' I--along with more than 200,000 alumni--am proud to call \nKansas State University my alma mater, as did my father and also my \nson.\n  The year was back in 1858, when Kansas was only a territory--not even \na State--that a group of local settlers founded Bluemont Central \nCollege. Then, in 1863, only 2 years into statehood, the State \nlegislature and Governor became some of the first to accept the terms \nand conditions of the Morrill Act, thus creating the land grant system \nof colleges and universities.\n  On February 16, 1863, the Kansas State Agriculture College, formally \nknown today as Kansas State University, received a land grant charter \nand became the first operational land grant institution in the United \nStates. Over the past 150 years, Kansas State University has progressed \nand expanded to accommodate the students and the people living in the \nState of Kansas--the people it has served so well.\n  Today, Kansas State University is comprised of nine academic colleges \nranging from liberal arts to veterinary medicine. The university \nexpanded its campus in Manhattan to include an aviation and technology \nschool in Salina and an innovation campus in Olathe, KS. Also, Kansas \nState University Research and Extension has a presence in every county \nin Kansas--all 105. These offices are a source of vital information to \nevery farmer and rancher in our State. We are staying true to our land \ngrant roots.\n  Back in 1863, Kansas State University's first enrollment totaled a \nmere 14 students. This school year Kansas State University reached a \nrecord enrollment of more than 24,000 students. These students hail \nfrom all 50 States and over 90 countries. Out of this diverse \npopulation, the university has produced industry leaders, heads of \nStates, humanitarians, generals, gifted scientists, and a few public \nservants.\n  Kansas State University has received national recognition for the \nexceptional education it provides students year after year. Kansas \nState continues to have college programs ranked the best in the Nation. \nThe university has been recognized as a leader among public \nuniversities in total number of Rhodes, Truman, Marshall, Udall, and \nGoldwater Scholars.\n  I cannot talk about my alma mater without mentioning Kansas State \nUniversity's athletic program, especially over the recent years. Since \nits first football game way back in 1883, dedicated fans have been \ncoming to the sports arenas to support our athletes and our team. This \nintercollegiate athletic program has complemented the education \nprovided by the university and has been a great source of purple pride \nfor both alumni and Kansas.\n  As Kansas State University looks toward the future, it sets new goals \nfor the institution and for its students. Launched by president Kirk \nSchulz in 2010, K-State 2025, the university's strategic plan, strives \nto make Kansas State University a top 50 public research institution \nwithin 15 years. Thanks to the work that has been done throughout the \npast 150 years and the research that continues, I have no doubt Kansas \nState University is on track to achieve this very important goal.\n  Throughout this week and weekend, students, staff, alumni, and \nfriends of the university will gather in Manhattan, KS--the ``little \napple''--to celebrate the history of Kansas State University.\n  On behalf of the Senate, it is my honor to congratulate Kansas State\n\n[[Page S677]]\n\nUniversity on its accomplishments over the past 150 years. As the alma \nmater song says, it is truly ``a spot that I love full well.'' Every \nman a Wildcat.\n  I yield to my distinguished friend and colleague, Senator Moran.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kansas.\n  There is no K State alumni, no individual from our home State who \nbleeds the color purple more fervently than the senior Senator from \nKansas. It is an honor to join him here today to recognize the \nsignificant accomplishments on the 150th anniversary of the first land \ngrant university college in the Nation.\n  Senator Roberts comes to the Kansas State University through his \nfamily--his father as well as his son.\n  I have become acquainted with Kansas State University as a citizen of \nour State in which we see each and every day the benefits that accrue \nto the citizens of our State because of the academic research, the \neducation, the extension of education across our State that benefits \neach and every citizen. So it is with great pleasure that we honor the \naccomplishments today of this university. It has had tremendous \nleadership.\n  In my early days in Congress, President Wefald in many ways created a \ngreat opportunity for Kansas State University to excel, to become \nsomething different than it had been, to move forward into the future. \nNow, under the leadership of president Kirk Schulz, his leadership only \naccelerates the opportunity for Kansas State University to provide new \nand beneficial services, education, and benefits to the people of our \nState, to our country, and to students around the globe.\n  Kansas State University is known for its agricultural background, for \nits support for that significant industry in our State--farmers and \nranchers look to Kansas State University for education and for \ntechnical support, and we know of their importance in that No. 1 \nindustry in our State--but, as Senator Roberts said, engineering and \naerospace; now a campus at Salina, KS, dealing with aviation and \navionics, with UAVs moving into the future; a campus in Johnson County, \nthe suburbs of Kansas City, in which additional research in bioscience \nis being accelerated. So in each and every circumstance, Kansas State \nUniversity contributes to the economy and well-being of our State and \nour country.\n  As a parent, I know Kansas State University. Both our daughters \nattended Kansas State University, and one remains a student there. I \nremember the first day I wandered with my 17-, 18-year-old daughter \nonto campus for a campus tour, and at the end of the day--I will admit \nwe had visited other universities as well, but at the end of the day \nKelsey said: Dad, there is no place more welcoming, no place more like \nhome, no place where I feel like a part of a family more than Kansas \nState University.\n  That is something I think K State exhibits so well and causes Kansas \nto be so proud of the Wildcat tradition, which is a sense of family; \nthat we are in it together and people are friends. It is a very \ncomfortable and enjoyable learning environment for students, and we \nhave seen it in our family.\n  Our youngest daughter followed her older sister to Kansas State \nUniversity and is now a beginning student at the College of Veterinary \nMedicine. Another area in which Kansas State University is highly \nregarded is the study of animal science. K State in Manhattan, KS, is \nthe western border of the animal science corridor, the eastern border \nbeing that place that all Kansans, regardless of alma mater, despise--\nthe University of Missouri. So from west to east, the animal science \ncorridor is bounded by the research scientists and educators and the \nschools that increase the likelihood that Americans are going to have \nnutrition, be well fed, and have a safe and abundant food supply.\n  It is an honor to be here to pay tribute to the many leaders at \nKansas State University, those who have come before and those who will \nfollow President Wefald and President Schulz to make sure Kansas State \nUniversity remains that place of higher education and learning in our \nState but also to make certain Kansas State University in Manhattan, \nKS, is always that place called home where students from across our \nState and around the globe feel as though they have found family and a \nplace to learn to improve their lives and to make certain they \ncontribute to the betterment of our world.\n  It is an honor to be here with one of the most distinguished alumni \nof Kansas State University, my colleague and friend Senator Roberts, to \nwish Kansas State University many more years of success in providing \neducation to our students and moving our State forward in ways that \nwill benefit not only this generation but those that follow us.\n  So congratulations, Kansas State University, and happy 150th \nbirthday.\n  Mr. President, I yield back to the Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank my dear friend and colleague more \nespecially for highlighting what K State is all about, and that is \nfamily. If one chooses to attend Kansas State, as many do--many come \nfrom small town America, and many come from big cities, but I think \nthey are all struck by the family atmosphere.\n  The thing I think is rather remarkable, even in having the privilege \nof talking to some of K State's football team and some of the athletes, \nboth basketball and football--all sports at K State--I am always able \nto tell the thousands and thousands of fans from K State who know their \nhistory, know where they are coming from, and always support them \nregardless of the outcome. So K State is a family.\n  K State's legendary coach Bill Snyder, who has achieved miracles on \nthe football field with team after team, always stresses family and \ntogetherness and the proper role of athletics in education.\n  My son David went to K State, and he fell in love with K State. He \ndidn't have much of a choice as far as I was concerned, but he did \nreally enjoy himself at K State. Basically, I am struck by the fact \nthat many of his friends who are graduates--when that day comes when \nyou graduate or when you leave K State, those generations really stick \ntogether, and they are friends for life. It is in that vein that I \nthink the Senator's remarks are certainly right on target.\n  Mr. MORAN. If the Senator would yield.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, Senator Roberts raises something that I \nwish to make clear, which is that Kansas State University has been so \nkind and so beneficial to our two daughters. While they found it to be \nhome and like family, they have excelled and learned, advanced their \nlives both personally and professionally in ways that are so important \nto us as parents. We have nothing but commendation to offer to Kansas \nState University for the kindness and opportunities they have created \nfor our own daughters as they pursue their goals in life.\n  So it is a very personal opportunity for me to express this gratitude \nto Kansas State University for making it so good for the things a mom \nand dad care so much about. For our two daughters Kelsey and Alex, K \nState is an important component of their lives, and we are so \nappreciative of the role that university has played in educating our \nchildren.\n  I yield back to the Senator from Kansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/13/senate-section/article/S677-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S677-S678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             150TH ANNIVERSARY OF EMPORIA STATE UNIVERSITY\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, we have a double privilege here today in \nthat we obviously are celebrating Kansas State University being 150, \nrepresenting 150 years of outstanding academic service to our people, \nbut also Emporia State University is 150 years old at the same time--a \nrather remarkable achievement. I know we would like to congratulate \nEmporia State on its 150th anniversary.\n  Emporia State University is in the beautiful Flint Hills of Kansas, \nand it is also very dear to my family. My mother attended Emporia State \nand studied education. She went on to become a teacher. Emporia State \nis a teacher's university, second to none. But she, in her day and \ntime, spent a lot of time educating Kansas children up in Atchison, KS, \nand was very much like the other proud and accomplished alumni from \nEmporia State.\n  If a person wants to know about education, all they would have to \ndo--as\n\n[[Page S678]]\n\nwell as teacher involvement and teacher progress and some of the very \nserious challenges we face today in education--is stop by Emporia \nState. They have many fine programs and nothing but the best in terms \nof graduates who do such a great job.\n  Throughout the past 150 years, Emporia State has grown to accommodate \nthe needs of the State and the 6,500 students it currently serves. What \nwas once the Kansas State Teaching College, Emporia State has now \nexpanded greatly, offering a wide range of academic programs.\n  In true Kansas fashion, the university has faced challenges head-on \nfrom its earliest days. Adversity is not uncommon. In fact, our State \nmotto is ``to the stars through difficulty.'' But the outstanding \nfaculty and staff have persevered on behalf of their students to \nprovide a quality education, and that continues today with teachers who \nalso provide a quality education. We can't do any better than that. It \nis with great pride as a Kansan and as a son of an Emporia State \ngraduate that I recognize and congratulate Emporia State University on \nits 150th anniversary.\n  I am more than happy to yield to my friend and colleague, Senator \nMoran.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding, and I \nappreciate being recognized.\n  It is true that our State places a high priority on education--\ncertainly K-12 but also universities, including public, private, \ncommunity colleges, technical colleges, and today we honor one of those \nuniversities in this milestone in its history, Emporia State \nUniversity, Emporia, KS, on its 150th anniversary.\n  Benjamin Franklin said, ``Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I may \nremember. Involve me and I learn.'' Through learning, students' lives \nhave been changed for the better for more than a century at Emporia \nState University. This is a historic occasion, their 150th anniversary, \nand I wish to recognize the significant impact Emporia State has had on \nour State and on our Nation.\n  In 1863 Emporia State was founded as a school for training teachers. \nBack then it was known as Kansas Normal School, and in its first year \nthe President and only teacher, Lyman Kellogg, taught 18 students on \nthe second floor of the district schoolhouse. At the university's first \ncommencement on June 28, 1867, President Kellogg presented diplomas to \nits two graduates, Mary Jane Watson and Ellen Plumb.\n\n  In the years that followed, Emporia State was faced with many \nchallenges, including tornadoes, fires, and a lack of funding, but the \nuniversity survived and continued each and every year to change the \nlives of the students.\n  Today 6,500 students from 45 States and 55 countries are enrolled at \nEmporia State University. Consistently ranked as a tier 1 regional \nuniversity by U.S. News and World Report, ESU offers students a wide \nrange of academic programs to choose from and the opportunity to \nparticipate in more than 130 student organizations.\n  Emporia State also remains fully committed to its original mission of \ntraining teachers through a nationally acclaimed teacher education \nprogram. If a person has somebody who made a difference in their life, \nnobody ever says: It was my Senator. It is not mom and dad. It is a \nteacher.\n  Educating teachers is a noble calling. In fact, the Teachers College \nholds the International Reading Association Award and Certificate of \nDistinction for the Reading Preparation of Elementary and Secondary \nTeachers--one of only five programs honored internationally in 2009. In \na national study of teacher education programs, Emporia State was named \none of only four postsecondary institutions in the Nation to be \nidentified as an exemplary model teacher education program.\n  I congratulate Emporia State for their success in equipping our \nNation's educators. As we know, the work of a teacher impacts the lives \nof every American now and in the future.\n  Given Emporia State's long history and dedication to training \nteachers, the university, as one might expect, now hosts the National \nTeachers Hall of Fame. Each year five of the Nation's most outstanding \neducators are recognized and honored for the jobs they do. By \nrecognizing the difference one teacher can make, the National Teachers \nHall of Fame works to promote education and inspire a new generation of \nteachers.\n  Whether ESU students pursue a career in education or another field, \nmany students who continue their studies will return to ESU for \ngraduate work. Among the Kansas Regents universities, ESU students earn \nthe highest percentage of graduate degrees. On average, one-third of \nthe degrees earned annually are graduate degrees. So whether students \nleave Emporia with an undergraduate or graduate degree, they are well \nprepared in the field they have chosen.\n  Students today are involved in community service, and Emporia State \nexemplifies that. Students at Emporia State spend much time giving back \nto the local communities. Students have cared for the elderly, provided \nfood to the hungry, and built homes for the homeless. They have also \nspent their free time mentoring young students through a program called \nYouthFriends. Currently, about 50 Emporia State students are involved \nin volunteer work once a weak with children.\n  One of the teachers at a local elementary school said this about that \nprogram:\n\n       It is great for children to have a young adult role model \n     to look up to. I have two kids in my class who have \n     YouthFriends, and they both have benefited greatly. Their \n     attitudes about school and life have changed for the better.\n\n  What a great way to make a difference in the development of lifelong \ncompassion for others.\n  The alumni of Emporia State University now number more than 75,000 \nfrom 50 States and 80 countries, and they are all proud to be called \nEmporia State Hornets. Alumni from Emporia State have gone on to \naccomplish great things. Among the many distinguished alumni are Minnie \nGrinstead, who was the first woman elected to the Kansas State \nLegislature in 1918, and Robert Mott, a World War II veteran who later \nhelped create National Public Radio.\n  For the past 150 years, Emporia State has been changing lives. One \nalumni said this about the impact on her life:\n\n       I was told by a high school guidance counselor that I would \n     never make it in college. ESU gave me an opportunity to \n     ``try.'' Not only did I earn a bachelor's degree, I earned a \n     masters, and Ph.D. Thank you ESU, you changed my life in a \n     positive way!\n\n  On this historic anniversary, it is with great pleasure that I join \nmy colleague from Kansas in submitting a resolution to congratulate the \nstudents, faculty, alumni, and the new president of Emporia State \nUniversity for 150 years of excellence in higher education. May the \nnext 150 years be even brighter than the last.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/13/senate-section/article/S678-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S678-S680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           FISCAL CHALLENGES\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about the \nfiscal challenges facing this country, and particularly the spending \nproblem we have and how it impacts not only the economy but also the \nlives of the American people.\n  Last week, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released the \nlatest Budget and Economic Outlook, which confirmed the threat that \nlong-term fiscal imbalances pose to the Nation's economy. The \nCongressional Budget Office found that the national debt will climb by \n$10 trillion, to $26 trillion, over the next 10 years if Federal \nspending continues on its current trajectory.\n  Spending on mandatory programs will remain on auto pilot, resulting \nin high annual deficits. To kind of put things in perspective, if you \ngo back to 2007 and you look at what the Federal Government spent, it \nwas about $2.7 trillion annually. If you look at what the Federal \nGovernment spent in fiscal year 2012, which ended September 30 of last \nyear, it was $3.5 trillion, an increase of nearly 30 percent.\n  Inflation during that same time period was 10.8 percent, meaning that \ngovernment grew at almost three times\n\n[[Page S679]]\n\nthe rate of inflation. Again, I want to emphasize what I think is an \nimportant point here, because in the discussion we are having about \nspending and debt, there is somehow this assertion that has been made \nthat this is not a spending problem, that actually this is more a \nrevenue issue.\n  Well, again, if you look at what has happened just in the past 5 \nyears, spending has increased nearly 30 percent, Federal spending, or \nat a rate of almost three times the rate of inflation. So clearly \nspending has increased dramatically just in the last 5 years. The trend \nis projected to continue over the next 10 years and beyond, with \nspending exceeding its historical average over that time period, and \nthen ballooning in the years beyond that.\n  Such levels of spending will cause the Federal debt to grow, and \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office, ``Such a large debt would \nincrease the risk of a fiscal crisis during which investors would lose \nso much confidence in the government's ability to manage its budget \nthat the government would be unable to borrow at affordable rates.''\n  Again, why is this important? Well, obviously, if the deficits \ncontinue to continue year after year, adding more and more to the \nFederal debt, eventually investors are going to lose confidence in our \ngovernment. They are going to demand a higher return, higher interest \nrate when we borrow money. That obviously has an impact all across the \neconomy. Because when interest rates go up, everything else that is \npegged to it goes up. If you look at middle-class Americans who are \ntrying to borrow money, for example, to buy a home or to get a college \neducation or for a small business to make investments in order to \ncreate and expand jobs, the interest rates go up for everyone. \nInflation also goes up if the Nation's fiscal challenges are not \naddressed, meaning that the hard-earned dollars are not going to go as \nfar. That is going to put further pressure on hard-working middle-class \nfamilies.\n  The threat of the budget challenges facing this country and our \neconomy is very real, because of this report that came out last week \nfrom the Congressional Budget Office. It confirmed we are headed toward \nGreece if we do not take the steps that are necessary to change the \ndirection we are on.\n  A lot of that reality, however, unfortunately, is lost on lots of \npeople here in Washington, DC. As I said earlier, there has been this \ndebate about whether we do, in fact, have a spending problem. Over the \nweekend, the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy \nPelosi, repeated what has become doctrine to many in the Democratic \nParty; that is, the idea that the U.S. Government does not have a \nspending problem.\n  She said, ``It is almost a false argument to say we have a spending \nproblem.'' This comes from the top Democrat in the House of \nRepresentatives. ``It is almost a false argument to say we have a \nspending problem.'' Well, obviously the White House scrambled quickly \nthe next day to come out: Yes, yes, we know we have a spending problem.\n  But there is reporting out there that suggests the President of the \nUnited States has also made this assertion, that this is not a spending \nproblem. I do not know how you can examine the Federal budget \nprojections and not come to the conclusion that we have a spending \nproblem. It is driving our national debt, a debt that is very harmful \nto our economy.\n  You have to look no farther than the Congressional Budget Office \nreport last week to see that this is a spending problem, not a revenue \nproblem, because that same CBO report said that the revenue--money that \nis raised by the Federal Government--is returning to its historical \naverage of 17.9 percent of GDP. That is the way we have measured the \namount of revenue coming into the Treasury as a percentage of our \nentire economy. You measure that over time, and getting back to the \nhistorical average, the 40-year average would be 17.9 percent.\n  If you look at the year 2015 as a case in point, the revenues get \nback to 19.1 percent of GDP, which is a 25-percent increase in 2 years, \nsignificantly exceeding the historical average. If you look at the 10-\nyear outlook the CBO came up with, they said revenues would average \n18.9 percent over the next decade, which is almost a full percentage \npoint more than the 40-year historical average.\n  The point is this: Revenues are not only at historic levels, will be \nthere by 2015 and stay there for the next decade, but they will exceed \nthe historic average for revenues over the next 10 years. So clearly, \nwhat we are talking about here is not a problem of Washington taxing \ntoo little, it is a problem of Washington spending too much.\n  I know that truth is hard and that math is hard to accept for the \npeople who want to grow government, but we absolutely have to govern in \nreality. What the math shows is that mandatory spending, which as I \nsaid is on auto pilot, continues to squeeze the Federal Government and \nthe Federal budget to a point where we are going to face a Greece-style \nfiscal crisis if Washington continues to punt on the hard decisions \nthat have to be made.\n  Mandatory spending comprised roughly 60 percent of Federal spending \nin fiscal year 2012. If you look at the big drivers of mandatory \nspending, Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security represented 40 \npercent of that total, according to the Congressional Budget Office. \nCongress and the administration have an opportunity in the coming \nmonths to reform these entitlement programs not only to get this \ncountry back on a more sustainable fiscal track but also to save and \nprotect these programs not only for current retirees but for future \ngenerations of Americans as well.\n  That is why I was disappointed last night that the President, in his \nState of the Union Address, failed to lay out a plan to address the \nfiscal challenges our country faces. I hope the President and my \ncolleagues here in the Congress will come to the table and work with us \nto solve these problems, particularly as we consider ways to address \nthe sequester, the continuing resolution which follows after that, and \nthe fiscal year 2014 budget resolution.\n  We cannot simply wait and watch these programs crumble under the \nweight of looming insolvency. We know Social Security operated at a \ncash deficit in 2010. The Medicare trustees have told us that Medicare \nwill be insolvent by the year 2024 and the HI trust fund actually as \nearly as the year 2016. If we are going to keep the promises we have \nmade to current retirees and to future generations of Americans, we \nhave to make these programs solvent. That means we have to reform them \nin a way that saves and protects them and makes sure they are fiscally \nsustainable not only for today but for the future as well.\n\n  I have to say, as I listened to the debate about the issues of \nspending and debt, there is an argument that is made by those on the \nother side that this is just because of the two wars, and the two wars \ndrove up spending; you know, they were not paid for and that is the \nreason we have this $16.4 trillion debt. Well, obviously the wars have \ncontributed to that. But if you look at through 2012, that is about \n$1.4 trillion. Obviously, I would say, to be fair, Republicans have \ncontributed to this as well as Democrats. When Republicans were in \ncharge of the Congress, we did not do a good enough job of keeping \nspending under control.\n  But the fact is even if you count in spending on Iraq and \nAfghanistan, that is about $1.4 trillion. The total debt now, as I \nsaid, is over $16 trillion, scheduled to go to $26 trillion 10 years \nfrom now. Over the course of the first 4 years of this President's \nterm, his first term in office, the debt has increased almost $6 \ntrillion. So it is hard to feature any objective analysis of these \nfacts and this data and say it was the wars that somehow caused all of \nthis.\n  Washington has been overspending for a long time. It is high time for \nthose habits to change. If you look at the war that is winding down, \nthe cost of that, the resources we are putting into these conflicts, \nthose dollars are not going to be showing up again as expenditures in \nthe next few years. We still have the Congressional Budget Office \ntelling us at the end of the next decade we will have added an \nadditional $10 trillion to the debt. So clearly that has certainly been \na factor, but it has not been the main factor.\n  There is again no objective analysis that would suggest spending on \nthe wars has been the driving reason for why we are facing the debt \ncrisis we have today. I would simply say too\n\n[[Page S680]]\n\nthat when you are in a hole, it is advisable to quit digging.\n  Obviously, we continue to look at ways to add more and more spending \nand, therefore, more and more debt. The health care bill is not \nsomething anybody on my side here in the Senate supported when it \npassed in 2009 and early 2010. But that too is going to drive up \nspending and is going to drive up debt as we head into the future.\n  You heard from the President last night a whole new series of new \nspending initiatives, ``investments,'' he called them, in a whole range \nof areas. As he was sort of laying that out, those of us who were \nlistening to that message were thinking to ourselves: Okay, if you put \na calculator on this thing, it keeps going and going and going. Yet the \nPresident said we did not need to add a single dime to the deficit. \nWell, I do not know how anybody could accept that with a straight face. \nIt flat does not pass the smell test.\n  We have a spending problem here in Washington, DC. The facts bear \nthat out. The revenues are going up. They are going to go up 25 \npercent, according to the Congressional Budget Office, in the next 2 \nyears. In 2015 they will be at 19.1 percent of GDP, an average we have \nnot seen--or a number we have not seen in a long time. Then they will \nstay roughly at that for the next decade. This is not a revenue \nproblem. This is not a problem where Washington taxes too little. This \nis a problem where Washington spends too much.\n  If you look at the other side of the equation, spending continues to \ngo up as a percentage of GDP. We see a little bit of relief here in the \nnext few years, but then when the cost of the Affordable Care Act \nstarts hitting, when you start seeing the demographics of the country, \nas they continue to change, if we do not do something to save and \nprotect Social Security and Medicare for future generations, it is \ngoing to bankrupt us.\n  We are headed for a train wreck. We have to do something about that \nand recognize what that problem is. That problem purely and simply is \nthat Washington spends too much. It is a spending problem. That is why, \nagain, when I heard the top Democrat, the minority leader in the House \nof Representatives, say over the weekend that it is a false argument to \nsay this is a spending problem, I was shocked, because I think most \nAmericans would argue, as they look at this, and they can do the math, \nWashington has a very serious spending problem which needs to be \naddressed. It needs to be addressed sooner rather than later.\n  I thought the report that came out from the Congressional Budget \nOffice last week was instructive for a number of reasons. It pointed \nout the impact that debt is going to have as we face this debt crisis \nin terms of interest rates, in terms of inflation, in terms of loss of \njobs, and a more sluggish economy. We know from history that when you \nget a certain amount of debt, it becomes such a drag on your economy \nthat it reduces economic growth. So we have seen this anemic, sluggish \neconomic growth which is going to be continued now for the foreseeable \nfuture. We have slower growth, fewer jobs, massive amounts of debt. \nEventually what that is going to mean for the middle-class American is \nhigher interest rates when it comes to buying a home, when it comes to \nbuying a car, when it comes to financing a college education. It is \ngoing to mean lower take-home pay when the economy slows down and there \nis not the demand for workers out there. There are so many adverse \nimpacts on our economy from carrying the kind of debt load we are \ncarrying today. I think we have a responsibility to lead.\n  I hope the President of the United States will lead on this issue; \nthat he in his budget will put forward the types of remedies that are \nnecessary not only to deal with our short-term crisis in the \nsequestration but also to put us long term on a sustainable fiscal path \nby proposing reforms, reforms to these programs that are driving \nFederal spending, that are going to add massive amounts to our debt \nover the course of the next decade and beyond, and at the same time \nlook at things we can be doing that would generate economic growth, \nthat would create jobs in this country. Because when the economy is \ngrowing and expanding, then all of these other problems look much \nsmaller by comparison.\n  Republicans here in the Senate are ready to work with the President, \nwork with Democrats.\n  We are anxious to go to work on entitlement reform to save Social \nSecurity and Medicare. We are anxious to go to work on reforming our \nTax Code in a way that would unleash economic growth to obtain the \nrobust growth we need in the economy to create jobs and make the debt \ncrisis we face look much smaller by comparison.\n  I hope in the days ahead the President of the United States, the \nleadership on Capitol Hill, and the Congress will do what we should \nhave done a long time ago. It is long overdue for action. It is high \ntime that we become busy and do the work of the American people, which \nis about providing a more secure, prosperous, and a safer, debt-free \nfuture for future generations. Anything less is negating or undermining \nthe responsibility we have to the American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID.

The senior Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, now that the nomination of Senator Hagel is \nbefore us, I want to begin this discussion and debate with a few \nremarks about him. The committee approved this nomination and sent it \nto the floor of the Senate yesterday by a vote of 14 to 11.\n  Senator Hagel has received broad support from a wide array of senior \nstatesmen, defense, and foreign policy\n\n[[Page S681]]\n\norganizations. At his January 31 nomination hearing before the Armed \nServices Committee, Senator Hagel was enthusiastically introduced and \nendorsed by two former chairmen of our committee, chairmen who have \nhuge bipartisan support and respect by everybody in this body and \neverybody outside of this body who knows them. Those two chairmen are \nSam Nunn and John Warner.\n  Senator Hagel's nomination has been endorsed by five former \nSecretaries of Defense who served under both Democratic and Republican \nPresidents: Bob Gates, Bill Cohen, Bill Perry, Harold Brown, and Melvin \nLaird. He has been endorsed by three former Secretaries of State--\nMadeleine Albright, Colin Powell, and George Shultz--and by six former \nNational Security Advisers who served in that position for more than 20 \nyears under six of the last seven Presidents.\n  Let me just share with our colleagues a few of the words of Senator \nNunn when he introduced Senator Hagel to our committee:\n\n       I believe our Nation is fortunate to have a nominee for \n     Secretary of Defense with the character, experience, courage \n     and the leadership that Chuck Hagel would bring to this \n     position. First, Chuck is acutely aware that even in an age \n     of rapid technological advances, our military capability and \n     effectiveness depend on the quality and the morale of the \n     people who serve our Nation in uniform, as well as the \n     families who support them.\n\n  Continuing:\n\n       Chuck received two Purple Hearts in Vietnam, and when he \n     returned home he continued to fight for veterans and for \n     Active-Duty military personnel. He knows that our people are \n     our strongest asset. Second, Chuck's experience in Vietnam \n     shaped his life and his perspective. War for Chuck Hagel is \n     not abstraction. I am confident, if confirmed, he will ask \n     the hard and smart questions before sending troops into \n     battle. Chuck Hagel knows the United States has vital \n     interests that are worth fighting for and dying for. He \n     also knows that war should be a last resort and that our \n     Nation must effectively use all of our tools, not limited \n     only to our military, to protect our important and our \n     vital interests.\n\n  Senator Nunn continued:\n\n       Certainly there is a tension in these values, but it is a \n     tension that we should welcome in the thought process and in \n     the advice that our Secretary of Defense gives to our \n     Commander in Chief and to this Congress.\n       From our service together on the Defense Policy Board in \n     recent years, I know that Chuck Hagel has a clear world view \n     and that it aligns with the mainstream of U.S. foreign and \n     defense policy, and also with President Obama. Chuck Hagel \n     believes that we must build and preserve America's strength \n     as a force for good in the world. He recognizes that \n     protecting our interests requires strong allies and friends, \n     as well as strong American leadership.\n\n  Senator Warner's extraordinarily powerful and warm comments included \nas follows:\n\n       There is an old saying in the combat army infantry and \n     Marine Corps. ``Certain men are asked to take the point.'' \n     Which means to get out and lead in the face of the enemy. \n     Chuck Hagel did that as a sergeant in Vietnam. If confirmed, \n     Chuck Hagel will do it again. This time not before a platoon \n     but before every man and woman and their families in the \n     Armed Services. He will lead them and they will know in their \n     hearts that we have one of our own.\n\n  Senator Hagel has received a letter of endorsement from 11 retired \nsenior military officers who say Chuck Hagel is uniquely qualified to \nmeet the challenges facing the Department of Defense and our men and \nwomen in uniform.\n  He has received a letter of endorsement from nine former Ambassadors \nwho worked with him on Middle East issues. That letter says, in part:\n\n       Each of us has known the Senator over the past 20 years and \n     has found him invariably one of the best informed leaders in \n     the U.S. Congress on the issues of U.S. national security. . \n     . . Senator Hagel's political courage has impressed us all. . \n     . . Time and again he chose to take the path of standing up \n     for our nation over political expediency. . . . He has \n     invariably demonstrated strong support for Israel and for a \n     two-state solution and has been opposed to those who would \n     undermine or threaten Israel's security. We can think of few \n     more qualified, more nonpartisan, more courageous, or better \n     equipped to head the Department of Defense.\n\n  That is from nine former Ambassadors who worked with Senator Hagel on \nMiddle East issues. Let me read who those Ambassadors are: Nicholas \nBurns, former Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, \nAmbassador to NATO and Greece; Ryan Crocker, former Ambassador to Iraq \nand Afghanistan; Edward Djerejian, former Ambassador to Israel and \nSyria; William Harrop, former Ambassador to Israel; Daniel Kurtzer, \nformer Ambassador to Israel and to Egypt; Samuel Lewis, former \nAmbassador to Israel; William Luers, former Ambassador to Venezuela and \nCzechoslovakia; Tom Pickering, former Under Secretary of State for \nPolitical Affairs, Ambassador to Israel and Russia; and Frank Wisner, \nformer Under Secretary of Defense for Policy and Ambassador to Egypt \nand to India.\n  Senator Hagel's nomination has been supported by the major groups of \nAmerican veterans, including the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Iraq and \nAfghanistan Veterans of America, AMVETS, Vietnam Veterans of America, \nand the American Legion. He has received support from the Military \nOfficers Association of America, Foreign Area Officer Association, and \nthe Non Commissioned Officers Association.\n  Senator Hagel has been endorsed by numerous newspapers, including USA \nToday, which stated:\n\n       Many of the supposed weaknesses that Republican Senators \n     hammered him on are actually proof that Hagel takes \n     thoughtful positions and doesn't bend easily to pressure.\n\n  I would like to read just a few quotes from those organizations of \nveterans who have endorsed him. The Veterans of Foreign Wars says the \nfollowing:\n\n       It is not the place for America's oldest and largest combat \n     veterans organization to advise or recommend to the President \n     who he should nominate for cabinet positions. However, the \n     Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States considers Chuck \n     Hagel, twice wounded Vietnam War veteran, war infantryman, \n     and former two-term United States Senator from Nebraska, to \n     be uniquely qualified to lead the Department of Defense.\n\n  That is signed by Robert Wallace, who is executive director of the \nVFW.\n  The Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America wrote the following:\n\n       Without Senator Hagel's leadership in Washington, there \n     would not be a post 9/11 GI bill. Senator Hagel has always \n     been a strong advocate for veterans at the Department of \n     Defense. There is no doubt he will continue that legacy. Time \n     and time again, from Vietnam to the VA to the USO, Senator \n     Hagel has answered his country's call to serve, demonstrating \n     courage, character and resolve at every turn. We encourage \n     the Senate to approve his nomination swiftly.\n       Paul Rieckhoff, Founder and Chief Executive Officer.\n\n  The AMVETS National Commander Cleve Geer endorsed President Obama's \nnomination of Chuck Hagel with the following comments:\n\n       AMVETS fully supports President Obama's nomination of Chuck \n     Hagel for the future Secretary of Defense. As a veterans \n     service organization, AMVETS' main mission is to serve as an \n     advocate for veterans, their families and the communities in \n     which they live. I am confident that former Senator Hagel \n     will utilize his experience and understanding of America's \n     military to lead this Nation's troops and the Department of \n     Defense.\n\n  The organization votevets.org wrote the following in a petition \nsigned by over 8,000 veterans and military families:\n\n       Senator Hagel is a tremendous pick for Secretary of Defense \n     who I know very well, and I have little doubt that he will \n     serve President Obama with distinction both as a voice of \n     reason within the administration and as a faithful advocate \n     for carrying out the policies of the Commander in Chief.\n\n  That was signed by John Soltz.\n  The Military Officers Association of America wrote the following:\n\n       While the Military Officers Association of America does not \n     endorse or oppose specific candidates for elected or \n     appointed office, we believe Senator Hagel is certainly a \n     candidate who is fully qualified for appointment to this \n     extremely important position. Our past work with Senator \n     Hagel has been very positive, and we believe that he brings \n     an important sensitivity to the human side of budget and \n     operational considerations. His experience as a combat \n     wounded Vietnam veteran, as deputy administrator of the VA, \n     and his two terms in the Senate provide a range of \n     perspectives that would serve any Secretary of Defense well. \n     We previously recognized Senator Hagel's efforts to protect \n     the interests of military beneficiaries with our Arthur T. \n     Marix Congressional Leadership Award. We do not believe that \n     cabinet nominees should be held hostage to political litmus \n     tests.\n\n  That was signed by ADM Norbert Ryan, USN, retired, President of the \nMilitary Officers Association of America.\n  The Non Commissioned Officers Association of the United States wrote \nthe following:\n\n       We strongly support the appointment of Chuck Hagel to be \n     Secretary of Defense. His\n\n[[Page S682]]\n\n     military service, including being twice wounded in action, \n     has instilled the values of service and personal sacrifice \n     for which he knows well the human cost of war. He has been an \n     advocate for soldiers, Marines, sailors, airmen and coasties \n     to ensure the training and equipage of America's 21st \n     military force coincide with a solid revised defense posture \n     to meet conventional and unconventional world challenges. \n     Senator Hagel has also championed personnel issues relating \n     to combat dwell time, force protection, transition issues, \n     including electronic medical issues, preparation for future \n     employment and training, and veterans benefits, including \n     enhancements to post 9/11 educational benefits. He also \n     recognizes the value and the sacrifice of families of the men \n     and women who serve in this Nation's uniformed services.\n\n  That was signed by Richard Schneider, executive director for \ngovernment affairs.\n  The Vietnam Veterans of America wrote:\n\n       We like Hagel. We think he is a great guy, and having a \n     combat veteran in there would be a good thing.\n\n  The American Legion wrote:\n\n       Hagel is a long-time member of the Legion. He served right \n     after he returned from Vietnam. He is a long-time advocate \n     for veterans in the VA, and especially for veterans exposed \n     to Agent Orange. Our organization has consulted with him, \n     among others, on various national security matters. Having \n     said that, the American Legion is prohibited by our \n     congressional charter from endorsing any candidate for \n     elected or appointed office.\n\n  The Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund, Jan Scruggs, founder and \npresident, wrote the following:\n\n       I first met Mr. Hagel in 1981 when he was the No. 2 man at \n     the Veterans Administration. He had just thrown out of his \n     office some people who were demanding that he stop his \n     support for Maya Lin's design for the Vietnam veterans \n     memorial. His integrity and toughness were impressive then. \n     Both qualities have grown since. Long before he became a \n     Senator, Mr. Hagel was an infantryman in Vietnam. He fought \n     the enemy up close, and he had to put Americans in body bags. \n     I am sure as defense secretary he would not hesitate to use \n     military force aggressively if our Nation or its allies are \n     in danger, yet he knows well that war is terribly \n     unpredictable and needs to be avoided. He has shown some fury \n     at those who have never seen war, but encouraged it during \n     the past decade. This is called courage. He has earned his \n     stripes.\n\n  Senator Hagel's credentials are underscored by the service in war and \nin peace that has been described so eloquently in all those letters \nfrom those veterans organizations. As a young man, Senator Hagel \nenlisted in the Army and served in Vietnam, where he received two \nPurple Hearts, the Army Commendation Medal, and the Combat Infantryman \nBadge for his service.\n  He volunteered to go to Vietnam. He answered the question, where are \nyou, by answering, here I am. Senator Hagel served as Deputy \nAdministrator of the Veterans' Administration during the Reagan \nadministration. He was twice elected to the Senate, where he served on \nthe Foreign Relations and Intelligence Committees.\n  Since he left the Senate 4 years ago, Senator Hagel has served as \nchairman of the board of directors of the Atlantic Council. The \nAtlantic Council counts among its other directors and honorary \ndirectors seven former Secretaries of State and four former Secretaries \nof Defense, along with numerous other senior officials from the \nadministrations of both parties. The Atlantic Council is very much a \npart of the mainstream of the American foreign policy establishment.\n  Much of the time and attention at our committee hearing was devoted \nto a handful of statements Senator Hagel made over the course of his \ncareer that raised questions about his views on Israel, Iran, and other \nissues.\n  Senator Hagel explained and clarified these things and placed them in \ncontext. He apologized for one remark, and told the committee he would \nsay other things differently if he had the chance or was making them \nover. Senator Hagel was clear in the positions he takes today and that \nhe will take if confirmed as Secretary of Defense. In particular, \nSenator Hagel stated unequivocally, first:\n\n       Iran poses a significant threat to the United States, our \n     allies and partners, and our interests in the region and \n     globally. Iran continues to pursue an illicit nuclear program \n     that threatens to provoke a regional arms race and undermine \n     the global non-proliferation regime. Iran is also one of the \n     main state-sponsors of terrorism and could spark conflict, \n     including against U.S. personnel and interests.\n\n  Second, he is ``. . . fully committed to the President's goal of \npreventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon . . . all options must \nbe on the table to achieve that goal . . .'' and his policy, if \nconfirmed, will be ``one of prevention, not of containment.''\n  Third, while he believes ``engagement is clearly in our interests,'' \n``engagement is not negotiation.'' He stated:\n\n       I've never thought engagement is weakness. I never thought \n     it was surrender. I never thought it was appeasement. I think \n     it's clearly in our interest. . . . [G]et the international \n     sanctions behind you, keep military options on the table. If \n     the military option is the only option, it's the only option.\n\n  Finally, he said that he is ``a strong supporter of Israel,'' and \nbelieves that ``we have a special relationship with Israel.'' If \nconfirmed, he ``will ensure our friend and ally Israel maintains its \nqualitative military edge in the region, and will continue to support \nsystems like Iron Dome, which is today saving Israeli lives from \nterrorist rocket attacks.''\n  Senator Hagel has also recognized the very real risks posed to our \nnational security as a result of the unique budgetary pressure arising \nout of cuts previously agreed upon by Congress, the budgeting by \ncontinuing resolution, and the impending threat of a sequester. Senator \nHagel told the committee:\n\n       [Sequestration] if allowed to occur, would damage our \n     readiness, our people, and our military families. It would \n     result in the grounding of aircraft and returning ships to \n     port, reducing the Department's global presence and ability \n     to rapidly respond to contingencies. Vital training would be \n     reduced by half of current plans and the Department would be \n     unable to reset equipment from Afghanistan in a timely \n     manner. The Department would reduce training and maintenance \n     for non-deploying units and would be forced to reduce \n     procurement of vital weapons systems and suffer the \n     subsequent schedule delays and price increases. Civilian \n     employees would be furloughed for up to 22 days. All of these \n     effects also negatively impact long-term readiness. It would \n     send a terrible signal to our military and civilian \n     workforce, to those we hope to recruit, and to both our \n     allies and adversaries around the world.\n\n  One of our colleagues has alleged that Senator Hagel has failed to \nprovide complete financial disclosure and suggested, despite the \nadmitted lack of evidence of any kind, that Senator Hagel may have \nreceived money that ``came directly from Saudi Arabia, came directly \nfrom North Korea.'' There is no evidence for that, but that is the kind \nof innuendo which was made and I believe should not have been made.\n  As a matter of fact, Senator Hagel has provided the exact same \nfinancial disclosure the committee requires of all nominees, including \nat least the last eight Secretaries of Defense. As required by the \nArmed Services Committee and by the Ethics in Government Act, he has \ndisclosed all compensation over $5,000 that he has received in the last \n2 years. As required by the Armed Services Committee, he has received \nletters from the Director of the Office of Government Ethics and the \nActing Department of Defense General Counsel certifying that he has met \nall applicable financial disclosure and conflict-of-interest \nrequirements. As required by the Armed Services Committee, he has \nanswered a series of questions about possible foreign affiliations. \nAmong other questions, the committee asked whether, during the last 10 \nyears, the nominee or his spouse have ``received any compensation from, \nor been involved in any financial or business transaction with, a \nforeign government or an entity controlled by a foreign government.'' \nSenator Hagel's answer was, ``No.''\n  Senator Hagel, like all of our nominees, has undergone a thorough FBI \nbackground investigation. Senator Inhofe and I have reviewed the FBI \nfile. The innuendo that Senator Hagel could somehow be hiding the fact \nhe is on the payroll of a foreign power is offensive to those of us who \nhave served with him and beneath the dignity of the U.S. Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a series of \nletters in which certain Senators requested certain financial \ndisclosure and the letter with which I responded.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S683]]\n\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 8, 2013.\n     Hon. Jim Inhofe,\n     Ranking Minority Member,\n     Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Jim: I read with some concern a February 6, 2013, \n     letter that you signed with 25 other Republican Senators, \n     demanding that former Senator Chuck Hagel provide additional \n     financial disclosure information in connection with his \n     nomination to serve as Secretary of Defense. This letter \n     appears to insist upon financial disclosure requirements that \n     far exceed the standard practices of the Armed Services \n     Committee and go far beyond the financial disclosure required \n     of previous Secretaries of Defense.\n       Our committee has a well-defined set of financial \n     disclosure and ethics requirements which apply to all \n     nominees for civilian positions in the Department of Defense. \n     We require each nominee to provide us with the following: a \n     copy of the Nominee Public Financial Disclosure Report \n     required by the Ethics in Government Act--OGE Form 278; a \n     response to a standard committee questionnaire, which \n     includes questions on future employment relationships, \n     potential conflicts of interest, personal financial data, and \n     foreign affiliations; and a formal ethics agreement, which \n     outlines the steps the nominee will take to avoid any \n     potential conflict of interest, including a commitment by the \n     nominee to divest DOD contractor stocks within 90 days of \n     appointment to office, avoid buying DOD contractor stocks \n     while in office, and resign from non-Federal boards and \n     activities.\n       Before these materials are provided to the committee, they \n     are reviewed by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics (OGE) \n     and the DOD General Counsel's office--both of which are \n     familiar with the unique conflict of interest requirements \n     imposed by our committee--to ensure that the required \n     disclosures of information meet our standards. The leader of \n     each of these offices sends us a letter certifying that the \n     office has reviewed the financial disclosure and determined \n     that the nominee will be in compliance with applicable laws \n     and regulations governing conflicts of interest. Our majority \n     and minority counsels review these materials and work \n     together, through the DOD General Counsel's office, to \n     address any questions that may arise about the completeness \n     of the materials provided or the nominee's compliance with \n     our requirements.\n       We have applied these disclosure requirements and followed \n     this process for all nominees of both parties throughout the \n     16 years that I have served as Chairman or Ranking Minority \n     Member of the committee. I understand that the same financial \n     disclosure requirements and processes were followed for at \n     least the previous 10 years, during which Senator Sam Nunn \n     served as Chairman or Ranking Minority Member. During this \n     period, the committee has confirmed eight Secretaries of \n     Defense (Secretaries Carlucci, Cheney, Aspin, Perry, Cohen, \n     Rumsfeld, Gates, and Panetta), as well as hundreds of \n     nominees for other senior civilian positions in the \n     Department.\n       There are two unprecedented elements to the financial \n     disclosure demanded by the February 6, letter: (1) the \n     disclosure of ``all compensation over $5,000 that [Senator \n     Hagel has] received over the past five years''; and (2) the \n     disclosure of any foreign funding of eight private entities \n     from which Senator Hagel has received compensation since \n     leaving the Senate (including the date, source, and specific \n     amount of each foreign contribution). Each of these demands \n     goes well beyond what the committee has required of any \n     previous nominee.\n       With regard to the demand that Senator Hagel disclose all \n     compensation over $5,000 that he has received over the past \n     five years, the standard financial disclosure form which the \n     committee requires all nominees to provide calls for the \n     disclosure of all entities from which the nominee has \n     received compensation in excess of $5,000 (including clients \n     for whom the nominee personally provided more than $5,000 in \n     services, even if the payments were made to the nominee's \n     employer, firm, or affiliated business) during the previous \n     two years. The two-year disclosure requirement that has been \n     consistently applied by the committee is established in \n     section 102(b)(1)(A) of the Ethics in Government Act and \n     applies not only to all nominees for Senate-confirmed \n     positions, but also to all candidates for federal elective \n     office.\n       With regard to the demand that Senator Hagel disclose \n     foreign funding for private entities from which he has \n     received compensation, the February 6 letter asserts that \n     this information is needed because ``If it is the case that \n     [Senator Hagel] personally [has] received substantial \n     financial remuneration--either directly or indirectly--from \n     foreign governments, sovereign wealth funds, lobbyists, \n     corporations, or individuals, that information is at the very \n     minimum relevant to this Committee's assessment of your \n     nomination.''\n       In fact, the committee questionnaire addresses the issue of \n     foreign affiliations in a manner that is equally applicable \n     to all civilian nominees coming before the committee. Among \n     other questions, the committee questionnaire asks whether, \n     during the last ten years, the nominee or his spouse has \n     ``received any compensation from, or been involved in any \n     financial or business transactions with, a foreign government \n     or an entity controlled by a foreign government.'' Senator \n     Hagel's answer to this question was ``No.''\n       The demands of the February 6 letter go beyond this \n     standard disclosure regime and would subject Senator Hagel to \n     a different requirement from all previous nominees, under \n     which he alone would be required to somehow ascertain whether \n     certain entities with whom he has been employed may have \n     received foreign contributions. In particular:\n       Senator Hagel serves without compensation as the Chairman \n     of the Board of Directors of the Atlantic Council--a ``think \n     tank'' that includes among its other Directors and Honorary \n     Directors seven former Secretaries of States and four former \n     Secretaries of Defense. The Atlantic Council's public website \n     provides a diverse list of corporate contributors, including \n     both domestic companies (such as Chevron, General Dynamics, \n     Lockheed, Raytheon, Boeing, Citigroup, Duke Energy, and Exxon \n     Mobil) and foreign entities (such as Polish Telecom, Saab, \n     All Nippon Airways, and the Istanbul Stock Exchange). Over \n     the 16 years that I have served as either Chairman or Ranking \n     Minority Member of the committee, we have considered numerous \n     nominations of individuals who were associated with similar \n     think tanks, universities, and other non-profit entities. \n     Even in the many cases where a nominee received compensation \n     from such a nonprofit entity, we did not require the nominee \n     to disclose the sources of funding provided to the non-profit \n     entity.\n       Senator Hagel has also served as an Advisory Board Member, \n     Senior Advisor, Director, Special Advisor, or Board Member to \n     seven domestic for-profit entities identified in the February \n     6 letter since he left the Senate in January 2009. His \n     financial disclosure report and committee questionnaire \n     indicate that he left four of these entities (Wolfensohn & \n     Company, National Interest Security Company, Elite Training & \n     Security, and Kaseman, LLC) in 2010 and has received no \n     compensation from them during the two-year reporting period \n     covered by the Ethics in Government Act. Nonetheless, the \n     February 6 letter demands that Senator Hagel provide ten \n     years of corporate financial data on foreign investments or \n     funding received by these entities. The forms and committee \n     questionnaire indicate that Senator Hagel continues to serve \n     as an Advisory Board Member for Corsair Capital, a Senior \n     Advisor to McCarthy Capital, and a Special Advisor to the \n     Chairman of M.I.C. Industries and that he has received \n     compensation for his service to these three entities. I am \n     doubtful that, as mere advisor to these companies, Senator \n     Hagel has either access to the corporate financial \n     information that is sought in the February 6 letter or the \n     authority to release such information if he were able to get \n     access to it. In any case, over the 16 years that I have \n     served as either Chairman or Ranking Minority Member of the \n     committee, we have considered numerous nominations of \n     individuals who were employed by for-profit entities of every \n     variety. We have considered board members, officers, \n     directors, and employees of companies doing business across \n     the full range of our economy. In this time, we have never \n     required the nominee to attempt to ascertain and disclose the \n     names of investors in such an entity.\n       The committee cannot have two different sets of financial \n     disclosure standards for nominees, one for Senator Hagel and \n     one for other nominees.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Carl Levin,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 6, 2013.\n     Hon. Chuck Hagel,\n     Distinguished Professor in the Practice of National \n         Government, Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service, \n         Georgetown University, 37th and O Streets, NW, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hagel: On January 29, two days before your \n     confirmation hearing, you received a request, via email, from \n     several Senators on the Senate Armed Services Committee for \n     additional information necessary to fairly assess your \n     nomination to be Secretary of Defense. The written copy of \n     the letter (delivered the next day) was signed by six \n     Senators, including the Ranking Member of the Committee. The \n     letter requested that you respond to the request before the \n     hearing, so that you could then answer questions concerning \n     your responses.\n       You declined to respond to the request for additional \n     financial disclosure.\n       At the hearing, you were told by Members of the Committee \n     that a response to our request for information would be \n     necessary before the Committee could vote on your nomination. \n     The Chairman of the Committee expressly asked you to submit \n     your response by Monday, February 4.\n       Monday came and went, and you still did not respond.\n       At the end of the day on Tuesday, February 5, you submitted \n     a short ``response'' to our request. In that response, you \n     explicitly declined to answer many of the questions asked of \n     you.\n       You were asked to disclose all compensation over $5,000 \n     that you have received over the past five years. You declined \n     to do so.\n       You were asked to disclose if--and to what specific \n     extent--the Atlantic Council has received foreign funding in \n     the past five years. You declined to do so.\n       You were asked to disclose if--and to what specific \n     extent--McCarthy Capital has received foreign funding in the \n     past ten years. You declined to do so,\n\n[[Page S684]]\n\n       You were asked to disclose if--and to what specific \n     extent--Corsair Capital has received foreign funding in the \n     past ten years.

You declined to do so.\n       You were asked to disclose if--and to what specific \n     extent--Kaseman, LLC has received foreign funding in the past \n     ten years. You declined to do so.\n       Your own financial records are entirely within your own \n     control, and you have flatly refused to comply with the \n     Committee Members' request for supplemental information.\n       The records from the other firms--more than one of which, \n     you have disclosed, paid you $100,000 or more--are highly \n     relevant to the proper consideration of your nomination. Your \n     letter discloses no affirmative efforts on your part to \n     obtain the needed disclosure, and your lack of effort to \n     provide a substantive response on this issue is deeply \n     troubling.\n       If it is the case that you personally have received \n     substantial financial remuneration--either directly or \n     indirectly--from foreign governments, sovereign wealth funds, \n     lobbyists, corporations, or individuals, that information is \n     at the very minimum relevant to this Committee's assessment \n     of your nomination. Such remuneration may be entirely \n     appropriate, but that determination cannot be made without \n     disclosure.\n       If you have not received remuneration--directly or \n     indirectly--from foreign sources, then proper disclosure will \n     easily demonstrate that fact.\n       Your refusal to respond to this reasonable request suggests \n     either a lack of respect for the Senate's responsibility to \n     advise and consent or that you are for some reason unwilling \n     to allow this financial disclosure to come to light.\n       This Committee, and the American people, have a right to \n     know if a nominee for Secretary of Defense has received \n     compensation, directly or indirectly, from foreign sources. \n     Until the Committee receives full and complete answers, it \n     cannot in good faith determine whether you should be \n     confirmed as Secretary of Defense.\n       Therefore, in the judgment of the undersigned, a Committee \n     vote on your nomination should not occur unless and until you \n     provide the requested information.\n           Sincerely,\n     (Signed by 26 Senators).\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 February 8, 2013.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. James Inhofe,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Levin and Ranking Member Inhofe: I appreciate \n     the opportunity to respond to the February 6, 2013, letter \n     from 25 Senators, including several members of the Senate \n     Armed Services Committee. I remain committed to providing the \n     Committee with complete personal financial disclosure, in \n     accordance with the applicable requirements of law and \n     regulation. In the spirit of cooperation, I have gone beyond \n     those requirements in several areas. For example, although \n     the committee questionnaire requires that nominees provide \n     copies of ``any formal speeches,'' I have sought transcripts \n     of informal speeches of which I did not have copies, and \n     provided those transcripts to the committee.\n       In that same spirit of cooperation, I have reviewed each of \n     the specific requests for information described in your \n     letter. While some of these requests appear to go beyond what \n     is either in my control or is mine to release under the law, \n     I am committed to providing what I can--and when I cannot, to \n     explain why not.\n       As you know, I previously submitted all of the information \n     required by the Committee's standard financial disclosure \n     processes. This includes information regarding compensation \n     that I received over the past two years, as reported on the \n     Nominee Public Financial Disclosure Report in Schedule D. To \n     assist you in reviewing this information, I have prepared a \n     chart that reflects all compensation over $5,000 I received \n     for that time period.\n       Further, you asked questions about whether, and the extent \n     to which, eight identified entities (with which I have been \n     affiliated) have received foreign funding in the past. As I \n     explained in my response to the Committee, dated February 5, \n     2013, my legal and fiduciary obligations prevent me from \n     releasing this kind of corporate financial information for \n     those entities that are privately owned/held. One of the \n     entities that you inquired about, Atlantic Council, is a \n     501(c)(3) organization which permits greater public \n     disclosure of its funding Streams. While Atlantic Council \n     does not make public a comprehensive list of all its donors, \n     it does publicly acknowledge its foreign corporate and \n     foreign government donors of $5,000 or more. I have attached \n     a copy of Atlantic Council's publicly available list of these \n     foreign donors over the past five years. Because I serve \n     without compensation, I have not been a direct or indirect \n     beneficiary of these contributions. Of the remaining seven \n     companies, McCarthy Capital, Wolfensohn, M.I.C. Industries, \n     National Interest Security Company, Kaseman, and Elite \n     Training & Security have authorized me to inform you that \n     they have not compensated me with any foreign-derived funds. \n     Corsair Capital has been advised by its outside counsel that \n     it cannot provide further information regarding its finances.\n       I wish to reiterate that I have not received any \n     compensation from or been involved in any financial or \n     business transactions with a foreign government or an entity \n     controlled by a foreign government. This is reflected in my \n     response to the SASC Questionnaire, Question 3, Part E--\n     Foreign Affiliations.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to respond to your questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Chuck Hagel.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Department of Defense right now needs \nits new leader. Its current leader, who has done a great job, has \nannounced he is leaving and has set a time for that departure.\n  We face a budgetary challenge of immense proportions--not just in the \nDepartment of Defense but in all of our agencies. Our military is \nengaged in combat operations overseas. North Korea has exploded a \nnuclear device--highly provocative, highly objectionable--and must be \ncountered. The absence of senior leaders in the Department of Defense \nwill harm our national defense, will harm our men and women in uniform, \nand sends exactly the wrong message to both our friends and our \nadversaries around the world.\n  If confirmed, Senator Hagel would be the first former enlisted man \nand the first veteran of the Vietnam war to serve as Secretary of \nDefense. This background gives Senator Hagel an invaluable perspective \nnot only with respect to the difficult decisions and recommendations a \nSecretary of Defense must make regarding the use of force and the \ncommitment of U.S. troops overseas but also with respect to the day-to-\nday decisions a Secretary must make to ensure our men and women in \nuniform and their families receive the support and the assistance they \nneed and deserve. It would be a positive message for our soldiers, our \nsailors, our airmen, and our marines in harm's way around the world to \nknow that one of their own holds the highest office in the Department \nof Defense and that he has their backs.\n  The President needs to have a Secretary of Defense in whom he has \ntrust, who will give him unvarnished advice, a person of integrity, and \none who has a personal understanding of the consequences of decisions \nrelative to the use of military force. Senator Hagel certainly has \nthose critically important qualifications and he is well qualified to \nlead the Department of Defense.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown.) The senior Senator from Rhode \nIsland is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when Senator \nLee concludes his remarks, I be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Lee are printed in today's Record under ``Morning \nBusiness.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nnomination of Senator Chuck Hagel to be the next Secretary of Defense. \nHe comes to this job at an extraordinarily challenging time for the \nDepartment and for our Nation. Among the many issues he will confront, \nSenator Hagel will oversee the drawdown of our forces out of \nAfghanistan, the enhancement of our cyber defenses, and the management \nof various fiscal constraints on the defense budget. In fact, I cannot \nthink of a more critical juncture of national security issues, budget \nissues, and technology issues, all coming together, facing the next \nSecretary of Defense.\n  I have known Chuck for many years, and I know he is particularly \nwell-suited to tackle these challenges. Chuck was born and raised in \nNebraska, the oldest of four sons of a World War II veteran. Public \nservice, military service is in that family's core. When his father \ndied suddenly at the age of 39,\n\n[[Page S685]]\n\nChuck quickly shouldered the responsibility of helping his mother raise \nhis brothers. And when our Nation was in the midst of a bitter and \ndivisive fight in Vietnam, he volunteered to fight, serving alongside \nhis brother Tom. This was an era when there were many people who were \nlooking for ways through deferments to avoid service, to avoid wearing \nthe uniform of the United States. He was unusual in that he not only \nsought service, but he sought service in Vietnam alongside his brother.\n  He rose to be an infantry sergeant, and both he and his brother were \nwounded twice, with each saving the other's life. In that experience as \na combat infantryman, he knows, perhaps better than anyone who has been \nnominated for this office, the ultimate cost of our policies that are \nmade here in Washington.\n  When he returned home, Chuck used the GI bill to attend the \nUniversity of Nebraska in Omaha, and after graduating from there, he \nwent to Washington to work for a freshman Congressman from his home \nState.\n  In 1980 President Reagan, recognizing his skill, his talent, his \npatriotism, and his devotion to the country, nominated him to be Deputy \nAdministrator of the Veterans Administration. He ultimately left that \npost on a matter of principle. He thought there was inadequate support \nfrom that department for veterans suffering from exposure to Agent \nOrange. At that time, the effects of Agent Orange were being dismissed \nby some as nonconsequential, as something that was just a made-up \nmalady by these veterans.\n  Chuck knew differently, and later the science would prove him right. \nHe continued to fight as he left the Veterans Administration, helping \nto ensure that these veterans who were physically affected by their \nservice in Vietnam received compensation as the victims of Agent \nOrange.\n  In that tenure as the Deputy Administrator of the Veterans \nAdministration, he had the responsibility of running a large Federal \ndepartment. So he is now bringing not only his service as a common \ninfantryman but his service running a large department devoted to the \nveterans of these United States. That will serve him well as Secretary \nof Defense. Again, it makes him singularly if not uniquely qualified.\n  But it doesn't stop there because he has extraordinary experience in \nthe private sector. In the mid-1980s he cofounded Vanguard Cellular \nSystems, which became one of the largest independent cellular systems \nin the country. Again, someone from modest means with great \nimagination, after serving his country both as a soldier and as an \nadministrator under the Reagan administration, went back and started a \nbusiness and made it successful--so successful that he was able to \ndevote himself to other public activities.\n  He served as deputy commissioner general of the United States for the \n1982 World's Fair. He was president and chief executive officer of the \nUSO, the agency devoted to helping servicemembers and their families. \nAgain, his commitment to the American soldier, sailor, airman, and \nmarine has been consistent, constant, and unrelenting.\n  Then he became chief operating officer of the 1990 Economic Summit of \nIndustrialized Nations--the G7 summit--in Houston, the president of an \ninvestment bank, and he was on the board of some of the world's largest \ncompanies.\n  So you already have at this juncture a soldier, a successful \nentrepreneur, and a successful Federal administrator.\n  Then in 1996 he came to the Senate to represent the people of \nNebraska. He was the first Republican Senator from Nebraska in a \ngeneration. We came here together. He came with all of these skills, \nand he added more skills, understanding the political process from the \ninside and from the outside that helped shaped national security \npolicy, the budgets and the policies of the Department of Defense and \nevery other Federal agency.\n  During his time in the Senate as a member of the Senate Foreign \nRelations and Intelligence Committees, he championed national security \npolicies with the goal of ensuring that our military remains the \nstrongest in the world. Senator Hagel believes in working closely with \nour allies and partners and that, in his words, ``a nation must \nstrategically employ all instruments of its power--diplomatic, \nmilitary, economic--to defend its interests.'' So he brings a broad, \ncomprehensive approach to national security, which is essential for our \nnext Secretary of Defense because so many of the national security \nchallenges we face are not simply military; they are diplomatic, they \nare economic, and they are environmental. They require the kind of \nbroad-ranging approach that he takes to national security policy.\n  As he stated during his nomination hearing 2 weeks ago, he has one \nfundamental question he has asked himself on every vote he took while \nserving in the Senate: Is the policy worthy of the men and women we \nwere sending into battle and surely to their deaths? Is this going to \nbe worth the sacrifice, because there will be sacrifices.\n  It is one thing to study the art of war in lecture halls and to speak \nprofoundly as a pundit. It is something else to be in the mud, under \nfire, seeing others fall. I have not had that experience. I served 12 \nyears in the U.S. Army, but very few people, very few people in this \nChamber, very few people who would be considered for Secretary of \nDefense, have been under fire, have seen comrades fall, know that \nultimately what we do here is borne by what those brave young Americans \ndo across the globe. He knows it intellectually and viscerally. I know \nhe will bring that perspective, that concern for our men and women in \nuniform, to every decision before him as Secretary of Defense.\n  In this role, he will continue to focus our efforts on fighting \nterrorism in Afghanistan and throughout that region. We are facing a \ncrucial turning point. In his State of the Union Address last night, \nthe President announced his plan to further reduce our force levels in \nAfghanistan next year as the Afghan National Security Forces will take \nfull responsibility for securing their nation. I think Senator Hagel is \nvery well positioned to carry out this policy, to ensure it is \ndone effectively, to ensure that our forces are protected and that we \nare able to help enable the Afghan forces to carry the burden to defend \ntheir country and provide stability.\n\n  Senator Hagel will also lead the Department in preparing for emerging \nthreats to our national security, such as attacks on our cyber \ninfrastructure. We are at a critical point in our history, perhaps akin \nto the 1920s when air power first began to emerge as a credible \nmilitary dimension, then later as space became a possible military \ndimension. Cyber is now a new dimension in warfare.\n  We are at a similar juncture to the one when some of our colleagues \nin the 1920s were wondering how we use these contraptions that fly \naround the sky. But in a short period of time, air power made a \nprofound difference on the world. The attack on Pearl Harbor was \nlaunched by aircraft from aircraft carriers, not by the bombardment of \nbattleships and not by the landing of military forces. You can see the \neffect it had not only through World War II but in every conflict to \ntoday.\n  We are at another critical juncture, and that is with respect to \ncyber security. How will we defend ourselves? What policies will we \nadopt to use this new technology to protect the United States and our \nallies? It will require integration across our government. It will \nrequire thoughtful, conscious deliberation. I believe he is prepared to \ndo that and will do that very well.\n  I am pleased that President Obama has just issued an Executive order \nthat will improve coordination and information sharing with our \nindustry partners so we can better protect our Nation's critical \ninfrastructure, but there is more to be done, and I believe that in the \ncontext of a Secretary of Defense, Chuck Hagel can do it.\n  Perhaps most challenging of all, Senator Hagel will lead the \nDepartment in a time of great fiscal constraints and uncertainty. As \nour Nation continues to find a path forward to rebound from the \neconomic challenges of the last few years, there is an ever-growing \npressure to reduce the size of the defense budget, which has nearly \ndoubled over the past 10 years. But we must be very careful to do so in \na way that eliminates unsustainable and unproductive costs without \nlosing vital capabilities. That is a great challenge. As a result of \nthe high operations tempo of our services, the multiple operations and \ndeployments, all of our services are facing serious reset and \nrecapitalization\n\n[[Page S686]]\n\nneeds in terms of equipment and also significant efforts to help our \nmilitary members and their families readjust, retrain, reequip, and \nprepare for a challenging future.\n  Serious decisions will have to be made about the threats we face and \nas we anticipate new and emerging threats. Again, he is well prepared \nthrough his entire life of public service, military service, private \nservice, administrative and business activity to confront this \nextraordinary range of challenges.\n  A lot has been made about some comments Senator Hagel has made in the \nlast years, going back 5, 7, 8, or more years. But I know, indeed, \nwhich was reflected in his testimony, that he did not seek out this \nposition. President Obama chose to nominate Chuck Hagel because he knew \nof his record, of his service to our country. He knew of his incredible \ncommitment to the men and women who wear the uniform of the United \nStates. He knew about his experience in the private sector. He knew \nabout his experience as a governmental leader. He knew there was an \nability to rely upon his judgments, Senator Hagel's judgments, with \nconfidence in times of crisis. I expect that the President of the \nUnited States is not going to turn to Chuck Hagel, particularly among \ncrises, and ask him if can he quote verbatim what he said 10 years ago. \nHe is going to say: What are my options? What is your advice? You know \nabout war better than anyone. You know about military policy. You know \nabout international security. You know about the interaction of \ndiplomacy, economics, and environmental policy. Give me your judgment. \nI have to make a decision.\n  I believe, reflecting what the Senator, my chairman, Carl Levin, has \nsaid, that in this difficult moment, the President of the United States \nneeds a Secretary of Defense to provide that kind of perspective, and \nthe men and women of the Department of Defense have to have the ability \nto have their voice heard decisively and definitively in those serious \ndiscussions, particularly about the deployment of military force.\n  As I said, I am extremely confident he can do this. Let me also say I \nam impressed with those who have served our country in diplomatic and \nmilitary roles who have endorsed Chuck Hagel strongly and \nenthusiastically. These endorsements are from men and women who have \nserved in both Democratic and Republican administrations. Among them \nare Bob Gates, William Cohen, Madeleine Albright, William Perry, Brent \nScowcroft, Ryan Crocker, and Thomas Pickering. These men and women have \ndevoted themselves to protecting the United States, and they have done \nit with extraordinary energy and effectiveness. This list of \nSecretaries of Defense will rank as some of the best we have ever had, \nand they are absolutely confident Chuck Hagel can and should do this \njob.\n  There are Ambassadors on this list who have handled delicate and \ndifficult issues involving international law. There are several \nAmbassadors who have been Ambassadors to the State of Israel and \nstrongly support Senator Hagel. All of these individuals know him. They \nalso know as well--if not better than I and many of my colleagues--of \nthe threats, dangers, and opportunities which face this country, and \nthey are strongly supporting Chuck Hagel. In fact, they have concluded \nin a letter that he is ``uniquely qualified to meet the challenges \nfacing the Department of Defense and our men and women in uniform.''\n  There has been a lot of discussion about Chuck Hagel's appreciation \nof the strong, important, and critical relationship between the United \nStates and State of Israel. All I can say is I was so impressed by the \ncomments of the Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon, who was \nalso the Ambassador to Washington, and who has met and dealt with \nSenator Hagel on a number of issues involving the relationship with the \nUnited States. The Deputy Foreign Minister said: ``I have met him many \ntimes, and he certainly regards Israel as a true and natural U.S. \nally.''\n  In another quote he said:\n\n       I know Hagel personally. . . . I think he believes in the \n     relationship, in the natural partnership between Israel and \n     the United States.\n\n  Here is an Israeli patriot who understands and has spent a great deal \nof time devoted to the relationship of the United States and Israel. In \nhis own words, he concludes that Chuck Hagel regards Israel as a true \nand natural U.S. ally and will act accordingly. He is a dedicated \npatriot. He is an individual who has served this country in so many \ndifferent ways. I support his nomination, and I urge my colleagues to \ndo the same.\n  Also, I think it is important to state that this nomination--as we \nhave done with every Secretary of Defense for decades--deserves an up-\nor-down vote on the floor of the Senate. People may choose to cast a \nvote against him for many reasons, and that is the prerogative of that \nSenator. I strongly believe, if we want to stay true to the traditions \nof this body and to the presumption that the President should be \nallowed to at least have his nominee voted up or down, then we have to \nbring this vote to the floor of the Senate for an up-or-down vote as \nquickly as possible.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a \ncolloquy with my colleague, the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Sequestration\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, Senator Collins and I are here because \nwe agree we must take action in this body and in this Congress to avoid \nsequestration. Sequestration is a term we have all been throwing \naround, and it refers to the automatic cuts that are scheduled to take \neffect on March 1. Those cuts were designed to force Congress to make a \ntough decision and to take comprehensive action on our debt and \ndeficits.\n  I think we all agree there is no question we need a comprehensive and \nbalanced plan to put us on a more sustainable fiscal path. I think that \nplan should look at all areas of spending. It should look at domestic, \nmandatory, and defense as well as comprehensive tax reform. I think \nthere are many areas of bipartisan agreement on deficit reduction, \nincluding controlling the long-term cost of health care.\n  Unfortunately, Congress has missed several opportunities to enact a \nlong-term plan to get our debt and deficits under control. That is why \nwe are again facing a deadline at the end of this month to address \nthose automatic cuts. As a result of that, we are starting to see the \nvery real and negative consequences of our inaction. We are seeing it \non our national security, and we are seeing it on our economy as \nbusinesses and agencies alike begin to prepare for the automatic cuts \nunder sequestration.\n  Last week, Senator Collins and I wrote to the leadership in the \nSenate urging bipartisan action on sequestration and the need to find a \nbetter approach. In our letter, we talked about the impacts we are \nstarting to see in New Hampshire and Maine, including the threat to \njobs, our national security, and to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, \nwhich is critical not only to New Hampshire and Maine but also to this \ncountry's national security. We called attention to the drastic effects \nwe face for our economy, for our jobs, and for our national security.\n  Today we are here to reiterate the importance of addressing \nsequestration and doing it now.\n  I wish to thank the senior Senator from Maine, my colleague, for \njoining me to talk about this important issue, and I am looking forward \nto hearing her remarks. I know it is something she cares about as much \nas I do and as much as I think most of the Members of this Chamber do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, first, let me say, I am very pleased to \njoin with my friend and colleague from New Hampshire to speak out \nagainst the indiscriminate meat-ax cuts known in Washington as \nsequestration that are scheduled to take effect in just 2 weeks' time. \nWe simply must take action to avoid this self-inflicted harm to our \neconomy and to our national security. But what I find inexplicable is a \ngrowing acceptance that sequestration is going to go into effect \ndespite the fact that virtually everyone should concede that across-\nthe-board cuts\n\n[[Page S687]]\n\nwhere we don't set priorities do not make sense.\n  There are good programs that deserve to be preserved, there are \nprograms that have outlived their usefulness and should be eliminated, \nand then there are programs that could be cut and reduced. That is not \nthe approach we are taking. We are not going through the budget in a \ncareful way by identifying programs that could be eliminated or \nreduced, setting priorities, and making investments. No, we are \nallowing to go into effect across-the-board cuts that fall \ndisproportionately on the Department of Defense.\n\n  Indeed, we are already seeing the effects of these cuts on our \nmilitary because each of the military services has begun planning for \nthe likelihood of deep budget cuts. The Navy is preparing for a \ncivilian hiring freeze and cutting workers at shipyards and base-\noperated support facilities.\n  I wish to be clear exactly who these employees are. These are the \nnuclear engineers, the welders, the metal trades workers repairing \nsubmarines and ships at the Navy's four public shipyards, including the \nPortsmouth Naval Shipyard in my home State of Maine, which employs half \nof its workforce from my colleague's State of New Hampshire. I know the \nsenior Senator from New Hampshire shares the concern about this \nparticular installation on the border we share. But, of course, the \ndamage of sequestration extends far beyond just one installation or two \nStates.\n  Just this morning I was over at the Pentagon, and I took advantage of \nthe opportunity to sit down with the Navy's top shipbuilding official \nto discuss what the impact of sequestration would be for our naval \nfleet. Well, one example we have already seen. The Navy will keep the \nUSS Abraham Lincoln, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, in port rather \nthan repairing and deploying it. Across the fleet, the Navy is being \nforced to reduce deployments, maintenance, and overhauls for critical \nrepairs. When we look at the shipbuilding budget, it is evident that \nsequestration and the continuation of a partial-year funding \nresolution, known as the continuing resolution, would be absolutely \ndevastating for our Navy, for shipbuilding, and for our skilled \nindustrial base. That includes Bath Iron Works in Maine, which I am so \nproud of, which builds the best destroyers in the world. This has \nconsequences not only for our workforce, but also for our national \nsecurity.\n  It is important to note Secretary Panetta has made clear that \nallowing these sweeping cuts to go into effect would be \n``devastating,'' in his words, and would badly damage the readiness of \nthe U.S. military.\n  The fact is defense has already taken a huge reduction in future \nspending. The defense budget has been slated to be cut by $460 billion \nover 10 years, and that is before sequestration. When this number is \nadded to the defense cuts scheduled to begin on March 1, we are looking \nat an enormous impact on our national security.\n  Now, it is important to recognize we are not saying the national debt \nis not a problem. Certainly, when we have a $16.4 trillion debt, that \nis not sustainable, and the national debt is a security concern in its \nown right. Just last year, in 2012, the Federal Government spent $223 \nbillion in interest payments alone. That means we are spending more on \ninterest on the national debt each month than we spent in an entire \nyear on naval shipbuilding and the Coast Guard budget.\n  Just think about that. The interest payment in one month exceeds the \nentire Coast Guard budget and the entire budget for shipbuilding in the \nNavy. The estimates are that by the middle of this decade--not some \ndistant year--our interest payments to China, our largest foreign \ncreditor at $1.2 trillion, will be covering the entire cost of that \nCommunist country's military. Think of the horrific irony of that. At \nthe same time America is bound by treaties to defend our allies in Asia \nagainst Chinese aggression, the American taxpayers are bankrolling the \nthreat through the interest payments we are paying to the Chinese.\n  Neither the Senator from New Hampshire nor I am saying the Pentagon \nshould be exempt from budget scrutiny or even future cuts, but the \ndisproportionate impact that sequestration would have on our troops and \non our national security is dangerous and it must be averted. The \nDepartment cannot continue to operate on a continuing resolution that \nincreases costs, prevents long-term planning, and makes it impossible \nfor the Department to function effectively.\n  I yield to my colleague from New Hampshire to expand on some of these \npoints. Then we will talk further about the impact.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine for \nlaying out what we are seeing in terms of the potential impact of those \nautomatic cuts. The comments and the statistics the Senator from Maine \nhad about China and what they are going to be able to do with the money \nwe are paying is really eye-opening and scary.\n  The Senator from Maine spoke about some of the impacts we are \nbeginning to see at the ports of naval shipyards. As the Senator \npointed out, it is something very important to both Maine and New \nHampshire. It employs about 4,000 workers, almost evenly split between \nour two States. As a result of the sequester, starting March 1, one of \ntheir major projects, the repair of the USS Miami, which was damaged in \na fire, is going to be halted immediately. Just stopped--16 days from \nnow. The Navy is going to cut over 1,100 temporary civilian workers, \nmostly from shipyards such as Portsmouth. The needed maintenance and \nmilitary construction will be postponed indefinitely. It is not just \nabout those jobs at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard or at the shipyards \nacross the country, but that has a ripple effect across our economy, \nand it affects the grocery stores and the restaurants and all of the \nsmall contractors and small businesses doing work at those shipyards.\n  There will be ramifications for our national defense across the \nservices. Yesterday, we had some harrowing testimony in front of the \nArmed Services Committee from all of the chiefs of the military \noutlining what they see coming as a result of the consequences of the \nsequester and the continuing resolution the Senator from Maine spoke \nabout.\n  DOD-wide--so across the Department--they expect to lay off a \nsignificant portion of the 46,000 temporary and term employees. All \nservices and agencies will likely have to furlough most DOD civilian \nemployees for up to 22 working days. Imagine that. That is a whole \nmonth of paychecks that those workers are not going to have to support \ntheir families, to be able to spend into the economy, and that is going \nto have a huge impact.\n  It is possible that DOD might not have enough funds to pay for \nTRICARE, health care coverage for our veterans through the end of the \nfiscal year. As we saw on the front pages of the paper this week, the \nDepartment delayed the deployment of the USS Harry Truman, the carrier \nstrike group that was headed to the Persian Gulf. If sequestration goes \ninto full effect, the Navy will shrink by about 50 ships and at least \ntwo carrier groups.\n\n  By the end of the year, the Navy, if we do nothing, will lose about \n350 workers a week or 1,400 a month from our civilian industrial base. \nThat will have a huge impact in New Hampshire, as I know it will in \nMaine as well.\n  So there are real, significant impacts, as the Senator from Maine \npointed out, on the defense industry, on this country's national \nsecurity, and on the domestic side of the budget. It is already \nstarting to have ramifications on our economy and job growth. We saw in \nthe last quarter of 2012 that our economy contracted for the first time \nsince 2009, and much of that decline was due to sharp reductions in \ngovernment spending in anticipation of the sequester coming into \neffect.\n  We saw it in New Hampshire, in some of our businesses that are \ndependent on government contracts, particularly in the defense \nindustry. So our failure to act is not only irresponsible, but it is \nbeginning to have a real impact in slowing down this economy.\n  It is simply unacceptable that we are not addressing this issue. We \nneed to act. If we let the sequester go into effect, we stand to lose, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office, up to 1.4 million jobs. A \nrecent forecast from Macroeconomic Advisers suggests that sequestration \nwould reduce our gross domestic product by .7 percentage points this \nyear.\n\n[[Page S688]]\n\n  We can't risk putting our economic recovery in jeopardy with these \nindiscriminate cuts. They are going to have an impact on research and \neducation vital to our ability to grow this economy and remain \ncompetitive.\n  The National Institutes of Health would face a $2.5 billion cut. They \nwould have to halt or curtail scientific research, including needed \nresearch in cancer and childhood diseases. The Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention would see a $464 million cut. States and local \ncommunities would lose billions of Federal education funding for title \nI, for special education grants, and for other programs.\n  As many as 100,000 children will lose their places in Head Start, \n25,000 teachers could lose their jobs, and we will see those impacts \nimmediately in Maine and in New Hampshire.\n  I wish to turn back to the Senator from Maine to share what she is \nseeing in Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, first I wish to commend the Senator from \nNew Hampshire for broadening the debate and reminding all of us of the \nmacroeconomic impact, as well as the impact on our two States.\n  The estimate is that Maine's defense industry--which includes not \njust the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Bath Iron Works, and our Pratt & \nWhitney plant, but a lot of smaller contractors and suppliers--could \nlose as many as 4,000 jobs as a result of sequestration. Think about \nthat. That means, as the Senator from New Hampshire pointed out, these \nare people who are supporting their families and who are supporting \nother businesses in the community. The impact, the ripple effect, is \njust devastating.\n  That is why it does not surprise me that the Congressional Budget \nOffice has pointed to sequestration as the primary cause for the slow \ngrowth we have seen already, and CBO projects as well; that our economy \nwould grow at a faster rate--at 2 percent--if we averted sequestration. \nThese aren't meaningless numbers. They affect real people. The \nestimates are that we would lose between 1.4 million and 2 million jobs \nif this is allowed to go into effect nationwide.\n  It is also a failure on the part of Washington to make decisions. If \nwe are going to allow these mindless, indiscriminate cuts to go into \neffect, why are we here? We might as well have computers or robots \nmaking decisions for us. Our job is to do the hard, painful work of \nsetting priorities and making decisions. That is why I am so frustrated \nby the approach we appear to be on the verge of taking.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire makes a very important point. While \nthe Department of Defense would take a disproportionate impact from \nsequestration, and I am extremely concerned about that, there are other \nimportant programs that would be affected as well. The superintendents \ngroups have met with me and talked about what it would mean for \nschoolchildren in Maine if halfway through the school year--more than \nhalfway through the school year--all of a sudden they get a reduction \nin title I money that goes to low-income schools, to special education \ngrants, to other important programs such as Head Start, and the TRIO \nProgram, which helps low-income and first-generation students attend \nand excel in college.\n  Think about the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, biomedical \nresearch that is so critical, cuts in the FAA workforce that could \nreduce air traffic control, disrupting air traffic during the busy \nsummer months.\n  The list goes on and on: essential education, health care, research, \ntransportation programs that deserve support that do not deserve to all \nbe treated the same.\n  Again, I want to emphasize that we recognize spending must be cut and \nthe debt, at $16.4 trillion, is way out of control. That amounts to \nsomething like $52,000 for each man, woman, and child in this country.\n  We are committed to seeking pragmatic solutions through compromise \nand to avoiding this devastation of our economy and our national \nsecurity. We recognize we have to look at all areas of spending and \nthat we need to overhaul our Tax Code and make it more pro-growth, \nsimpler, and fairer. If ever there were a moment when Members of \nCongress and the President should put aside their politics for the \ngreater good of the Nation, now is the time.\n  So I, for one, want to thank the Senator from New Hampshire for \ncaring so much about this issue. We have agreed to work together--and \ncontinue to work together--to address this. These automatic cuts were \nnever supposed to take effect. I remember being told: Do not worry. It \nis never going to happen. It is too unpalatable. It will just never \noccur.\n  Well, they were supposed to force us to make the difficult decisions \nnecessary to put our economy on a sound footing and to deal with our \nunsustainable debt. Our Nation's leaders--the President, Democrats and \nRepublicans alike--have denounced sequestration for the most part, and \nyet here we are.\n  So I hope we can work together to avoid this fiscal cliff which will \nhave such damaging effects for the people of this Nation.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Collins very much for \nher kind words. I know we both care a great deal about this situation \nwe are in, as I think most of the Members of the body do. What is so \nfrustrating is that it is avoidable. This is not something that has to \nhappen because we are facing a crisis. This is happening because of \nwhat we have done in our actions. So we can undo these actions, as the \nSenator points out.\n  I share the Senator's belief that we need a comprehensive solution. \nWe have to look at all aspects of the budget. We need to look at \ndomestic, defense spending, mandatory programs, and we need to look at \nrevenues. Comprehensive tax reform--that is a way we can address that.\n  There are areas of bipartisan agreement that we ought to be able to \ntake action on right away. We have had a number of GAO reports that \nmake recommendations on duplicative programs within government. We are \nalready working to control the long-term costs of health care, to close \ntax loopholes, and on defense spending, we all know there are still \nreforms that can be done, as the Senator pointed out. We can get better \nphysical controls. We can end some of the fraud and abuse in \ncontracting. That is just the beginning of a list that, I am sure, if \nwe all dedicated ourselves to coming up with a compromise on how we \navoid the sequester, we could do.\n  We should not delay because our failure to resolve this issue is \nhaving damaging effects on our economy, and it is only going to get \nworse if we do not find the solution.\n  So, again, I thank Senator Collins for her commitment to address this \nchallenge we face, for her willingness to come down and engage with me, \nand for us to work together, along with our colleagues, to try to get a \nresolution so we do not have these devastating cuts going into effect.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator would yield for one \nmoment, without losing his right to the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Before the Senators from New Hampshire and Maine leave the \nfloor, I just want to commend them for their statements, for their \nconversation. It is so critically important we avoid sequester. The \nmore Senators and the more Members of the House who look for ways on a \nbipartisan basis to avoid it, the better. We only have 2 weeks left to \ngo. With the kind of energy and creativity that these two Senators \nbring to this body, it makes me a little bit more hopeful that we are \ngoing to be able to avoid this unbelievably bad outcome.\n  So I just want to thank both Senators and thank my friend from \nOklahoma for yielding for a moment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me, first of all, respond to the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee. I agree. We have talked about \nthe anguish.\n  We had a hearing yesterday where the service chiefs discussed the \ndisaster facing our armed forces if we go through sequestration. I do \nnot think most Members of this body fully understand what it means, not \njust to the defense of our country as a whole, but to each of the \nindividual States.\n  In my State of Oklahoma, I am very concerned about Tinker Air Force \nBase\n\n[[Page S689]]\n\nand its 16,000 civilian employees. What is going to happen there?\n  Anyway, let me just wind up this part by saying I have been ranked as \nthe most conservative Member for many years. But I have always said: I \nam a big supporter of using our resources in two areas: One is national \ndefense and the other is transportation and infrastructure.\n\n  A short while ago, the majority leader was kind enough to call my \noffice and tell me I would be objecting to the consideration of the \nnomination of former Senator Hagel to be Secretary of Defense.\n  However, this is not a filibuster. I keep getting stopped by people \nout in the hall: Oh, we are going to filibuster. Who is going to \nfilibuster?\n  What we are doing is not a filibuster. We are seeking a 60 vote \nthreshold for a controversial nomination. If the majority really wanted \nto move forward quickly, all they have to do is agree to a 60-vote \nmargin, like they did with the Sebelius and Bryson nominations.\n  In addition, as ranking member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, I am obligated to assist the members of the committee.\n  First of all, the vote in the committee was a 100-percent partisan \nvote. Every Republican there voted against moving the Hagel nomination \nout of committee. Well, there has to be a reason for that.\n  One of the reasons--the major reason, I would say--and if you do not \nbelieve this, go back and look at the tape of the meeting yesterday \nwhere many of our members said: Why is it we are rushing to confirm \nChuck Hagel to be Secretary of Defense when he has not given us the \ninformation we have requested? One such Member is the junior Senator \nfrom Texas, who is in the Chamber with me right now.\n  But let me first clarify there is nothing unusual about requesting a \n60-vote threshold. This happens all the time. I can remember when the \nmajority leader agreed to a 60-vote threshold in the 2009 nomination of \nKathleen Sebelius. She was confirmed.\n  There is nothing unusual about a 60-vote threshold.\n  John Bryson was nominated to be the Secretary of Commerce. Several of \nus had concerns about this nomination. Ultimately, he was confirmed. \nBut once again the entire Senate agreed to a confirmation vote by a 60-\nvote margin.\n  I can remember when the majority leader--let me say this about the \nmajority leader. He has been exceptionally good to me on things I have \nbeen involved in. I have two major bills that were my bills. One was in \nconcert with Barbara Boxer--the highway bill. Frankly, I could not have \ngotten it passed without them. Another was my pilots' bill of rights. I \ncould not get a hearing on it in committee. I tried for a year. He \nstepped in and helped me. I have said in national publications I could \nnot have gotten it passed without Leader Harry Reid. So we have a very \ngood relationship, and one which will continue.\n  However, Senator Reid, on numerous occasions, was concerned about \nRepublican nominations. During the Bush Presidency, Stephen Johnson--\nwho, incidentally, was a Democrat--was nominated to be EPA \nAdministrator. I thought he would be good Administrator. There were \nseveral Democrats who thought he would not be good Administrator. So \nHarry Reid did what he is supposed to do, and he interceded on behalf \nof the Democrats who opposed him. As result, cloture was filed and, \ntherefore, the nomination needed 60 votes to proceed. Well, the \nAdministrator got 61 votes.\n  Another example was Dirk Kempthorne. He was nominated to be Secretary \nof the Interior. My colleagues will remember he is a former Senator \nfrom Idaho. Some objected to his confirmation. Of course, this was \nduring the Bush administration. Senator Kempthorne was nominated, and \nhe went ahead and was confirmed. It was a 60-vote margin. There is \nnothing unusual about this.\n  Getting back to Stephen Johnson, this is even more analogous to what \nwe have right now because he was a Democrat who was nominated by a \nRepublican President. Unfortunately, once again we were forced by the \nDemocrats to have a cloture vote which requires 60 votes.\n  Stephen Johnson was a Democrat. So here we had the Republicans \nwanting Stephen Johnson and the Democrats not wanting Stephen Johnson. \nIt is very analogous to what we have today. Today, we have former \nSenator Chuck Hagel, who is a Republican.\n  But in this case, we have a situation where cloture has been filed by \nthe majority leader. I have no objection to voting. I do not want to \nwait. I do not want to string this out. I have other places to go other \nthan hanging around here. I would vote tonight if we could just get the \ninformation that has been requested by the Republican members of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee.\n  Keep in mind, the Hagel nomination was reported out of committee by a \n100-percent partisan vote. All Republicans voted against sending him \nout. Why did they do it? They did it because we have not gotten the \ninformation we want.\n  I have a letter. This is a letter that is signed by 25 Republicans \nstating that we have not received the information necessary for a \nproper vetting of the Hagel nomination.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 6, 2013.\n     The Hon. Chuck Hagel,\n     Distinguished Professor in the Practice of National \n         Government, Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service, \n         Gerorgetown University, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hagel, On January 29, two days before your \n     confirmation hearing, you received a request, via email, from \n     several Senators on the Senate Armed Services Committee for \n     additional information necessary to fairly assess your \n     nomination to be Secretary of Defense. The written copy of \n     the letter (delivered the next day) was signed by six \n     Senators, including the Ranking Member of the Committee. The \n     letter requested that you respond to the request before the \n     hearing, so that you could then answer questions concerning \n     your responses.\n       You declined to respond to the request for additional \n     financial disclosure.\n       At the hearing, you were told by Members of the Committee \n     that a response to our request for information would be \n     necessary before the Committee could vote on your nomination. \n     The Chairman of the Committee expressly asked you to submit \n     your response by Monday, February 4.\n       Monday came and went, and you still did not respond.\n       At the end of the day on Tuesday, February 5, you submitted \n     a short ``response'' to our request. In that response, you \n     explicitly declined to answer many of the questions asked of \n     you.\n       You were asked to disclose all compensation over $5,000 \n     that you have received over the past five years. You declined \n     to do so.\n       You were asked to disclose if--and to what specific \n     extent--the Atlantic Council has received foreign funding in \n     the past five years. You declined to do so.\n       You were asked to disclose if--and to what specific \n     extent--McCarthy Capital has received foreign funding in the \n     past ten years. You declined to do so.\n       You were asked to disclose if--and to what specific \n     extent--Corsair Capital has received foreign funding in the \n     past ten years. You declined to do so.\n       You were asked to disclose if--and to what specific \n     extent--Wolfensohn and Company has received foreign funding \n     in the past ten years. You declined to do so.\n       You were asked to disclose if--and to what specific \n     extent--M.I.C. Industries has received foreign funding in the \n     past ten years. You declined to do so.\n       You were asked to disclose if--and to what specific \n     extent--the National Interest Security Company has received \n     foreign funding in the ten years. You declined to do so.\n       You were asked to disclose if--and to what specific \n     extent--Elite Training and Security, LLC has received foreign \n     funding in the past ten years. You declined to do so.\n       You were asked to disclose if--and to what specific \n     extent--Kaseman, LLC has received foreign funding in the past \n     ten years. You declined to do so.\n       Your own financial records are entirely within your own \n     control, and you have flatly refused to comply with the \n     Committee Members' request for supplemental information.\n       The records from the other firms--more than one of which, \n     you have disclosed, paid you $100,000 or more--are highly \n     relevant to the proper consideration of your nomination. Your \n     letter discloses no affirmative efforts on your part to \n     obtain the needed disclosure, and your lack of effort to \n     provide a substantive response on this issue is deeply \n     troubling.\n       If it is the case that you personally have received \n     substantial financial remuneration--either directly or \n     indirectly--from foreign governments, sovereign wealth funds,\n\n[[Page S690]]\n\n     lobbyists, corporations, or individuals, that information is \n     at the very minimum relevant to this Committee's assessment \n     of your nomination. Such remuneration may be entirely \n     appropriate, but that determination cannot be made without \n     disclosure.\n       If you have not received remuneration--directly or \n     indirectly--from foreign sources, then proper disclosure will \n     easily demonstrate that fact.\n       Your refusal to respond to this reasonable request suggests \n     either a lack of respect for the Senate's responsibility to \n     advise and consent or that you are for some reason unwilling \n     to allow this financial disclosure to come to light.\n       This Committee, and the American people, have a right to \n     know if a nominee for Secretary of Defense has received \n     compensation, directly or indirectly, from foreign sources. \n     Until the Committee receives full and complete answers, it \n     cannot in good faith determine whether you should be \n     confirmed as Secretary of Defense.\n       Therefore, in the judgment of the undersigned, a Committee \n     vote on your nomination should not occur unless and until you \n     provide the requested information.\n           Sincerely,\n       (Signed by 26 Senators).\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. This letter is signed by several Senators, but it was \npromoted, more than by anyone else, by the Senator from Texas. The \nSenator has repeatedly requested this information. I have personally \nheard Senator Cruz request this information, just yesterday, and on \nseveral previous occasions.\n  In a previous letter, he said: We express our concern--several \nSenators also signed this letter--on the unnecessary rush to force \nthrough a vote on Chuck Hagel's nomination before he has been able to \nrespond adequately to multiple requests from members of the Armed \nServices Committee for additional information.\n  I'm reading now from the letter: Those requests have included a \nrequest to Chuck Hagel for the disclosure of his personal compensation \nhe has received over the past 5 years.\n  We are talking about Chuck Hagel.\n  This is information which he controls. He can provide this \ninformation. It is there.\n  The letter also requests the disclosure of foreign funds he may have \nreceived indirectly. This is important because some have raised \nquestions of a potential conflict of interest.\n  Why does he not want to disclose this? Somehow he would like to be \nconfirmed without disclosing this information.\n  As Senators we have a responsibility here. I do not care if you are a \nDemocrat or Republican. If a member of the Armed Services Committee \nrequests this information and the information is available and he is \nable to obtain it and does not provide it, we have a process problem.\n  Mr. President, my primary objection to Chuck Hagel's confirmation is \nfor policy reasons. That is why I think he is not qualified for that \njob. Others do not agree with that. That is fine. But they have to \nagree on the process.\n  In fact, I cannot remember--and I have been on the Armed Services \nCommittee in both the House and Senate for 25 years. I do not remember \none time when information that was requested, which was perfectly \nwithin the purview of the committee was not provided. This has not \nhappened. This is unprecedented.\n  I heard some people say: you are filibustering a Cabinet appointee. \nThat is not what we are doing. What we are trying to prevent is an \nunprecedented event where committee members do not receive information \nwhich is important for Members to have in order to consider a \nnomination.\n  So I will continue to read the letter.\n  The letter includes a request for a complete list of his prior public \nspeeches, notably, multiple additional speeches on controversial topics \nthat have been made public by the press.\n  For example, I understand FOX News is going to run a story tomorrow \nregarding some speeches made by former Senator Hagel. If so, these \nspeeches would certainly give rise to a lot of interest because, I have \nbeen informed, we are talking about speeches which were made and paid \nfor by foreign governments. I have also been told, some of these \nforeign governments may not be friendly to us.\n  Therefore, I believe Senators are entitled to review this \ninformation. Are we entitled to that? Yes; we are entitled to that.\n  So this letter includes a request for a complete list of his prior \npublic speeches, notably, additional speeches on controversial topics \nthat have been made public in the press, despite those speeches having \nbeen omitted from his own disclosure.\n  I remember in the early stages of the confirmation process, requests \nwere made of Senator Hagel about information we knew existed because \nthe press had written about it in the past. Some may argue that \nSenators are not entitled to review these speeches. I disagree. A \nmember of the Armed Services Committee has a responsibility to review \nthat information.\n  The letter also makes the critical request from the administration \nfor additional information on their precise actions during and \nimmediately following the tragic murder of four Americans in Benghazi, \nLibya on September 11, 2012.\n  Regardless, if the administration has answered these questions, the \nSenate is entitled to review speeches that have been made by the person \nwho is up for confirmation to be Secretary of Defense.\n  I would say to the majority leader, the request for a 60 vote \nthreshold is based on precedent. It is what the majority leader agreed \nto on the John Bryson and Kathleen Sebelius nominations. It is what he \ninsisted upon when the Democrats forced cloture to be filed on the Dirk \nKempthorne and Stephen Johnson nominations. There are several others. \nMichael Leavitt was one. John Bolton went through this twice. We all \nremember Miguel Estrada. We remember Robert Portman, now one of our \nfellow Senators.\n  So there is nothing unusual about this. But there is a problem with \nthe process we are entering now. That process is, we have made \nrequests--I am talking about Members such as Senator Cruz from Texas \nand other members of the Senate Armed Services Committee who have made \nperfectly reasonable requests for information. In this case, it is on \nspeeches reportedly made to foreign audiences. However, these concerns \ncan be clarified in a matter of minutes.\n  That is why we should not rush. If this information is provided we \ncould resolve this matter tonight. The information is out there. I have \npersonally talked to Senator Cruz. He said: Look, if they will just \ngive us that information we have been requesting now for weeks, we can \nhave the vote tonight.\n  That is our reasonable request. We are not talking about merits. We \nare not talking about substance. We are talking about a process. Never \nbefore in my memory has a Senate Armed Services member's reasonable \nrequest been denied before someone has come up for a confirmation. It \nis a simple request. It has been done on a regular basis. A 60-vote \nmargin is not a filibuster. We are merely saying the Senate is entitled \nto this information. Hopefully, this will jar some of the information \nloose. Maybe we can get it now. I hope we do.\n  I want to move this on and move it as rapidly as possible.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here again to talk about the \neffects of climate change on the health of our families and our \ncommunities. Just as we know that secondhand smoke and too much sun \nexposure are bad for human health, we know pollution and variations in \nclimate conditions are as well.\n  I wish to thank our chairman on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, Mrs. Boxer, for the briefing she held today with a number of \nscientists, including one who spoke specifically about the human health \neffects we can see from climate change. Climate change is threatening \nto erode the improvements in air quality we have achieved through the \nClean Air Act.\n  EPA-enforced emissions reductions have led to a decline in the number \nand\n\n[[Page S691]]\n\nseverity of bad air days in the United States. These are the days I \nknow the Presiding Officer is familiar with because I am sure they \nhappen in Connecticut as well as in Rhode Island, where the air quality \nis so poor that it is unhealthy for sensitive individuals: the elderly, \ninfants, people with breathing difficulties to be outdoors. Even \nhealthy people are urged to limit their activities when out-of-doors.\n  In Rhode Island, about 12 percent of children and 11 percent of \nadults suffer from asthma. Both are higher than the national average. \nOur Rhode Island Public Transit Authority runs free buses on bad ozone \ndays to try to keep car traffic down because these days are so \ndangerous to the public. Of course, the major air pollutant behind bad \nair days is ozone, commonly known as smog. Ground-level ozone or smog \nmakes it difficult to breathe, causes coughing, inflames airways, \naggravates asthma, emphysema and bronchitis and makes lungs more \nsusceptible to infection.\n  That all means asthma attacks, emergency room visits, \nhospitalizations, which, in turn, result in missed school and work and \na burden not only of worry but also a burden on the economy. Smog, of \ncourse, forms more quickly during hot and sunny days. So as climate \nchange drives more heat, it increases the number of warm days and the \nconditions for smog and for bad air days become more common.\n  Climate change is also prolonging the allergy season. I am sure there \nare a number of people listening who suffer from hay fever in the late \nsummer and early fall. Some people suffer from it most acutely. It is \nmost often caused by ragweed pollen. Since 1995, ragweed season has \nincreased across the country. It has increased by 13 days in Madison, \nWI. It has increased by 20 days in Minneapolis, MN. It has increased by \nalmost 25 days in Fargo, ND. The further north you go, the greater the \nincrease in the ragweed season. So for folks in Fargo, for instance, it \nis 25 more days of sniffling and sneezing and 25 more days that ragweed \npollen might trigger a child's asthma attack.\n  Not only does more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere mean warmer \nweather and therefore longer pollen seasons, it also means a higher \npollen count. At 280 parts per million, which was the concentration of \natmospheric carbon back in the year 1900, each ragweed plant would \nproduce about 5 grams of pollen.\n  At 370 parts per million, which is where we are now--year 2000 levels \nto be precise--pollen production more than doubles. It doubles again at \n72 parts per million, which is the concentration that is now projected \nfor the year 2075. So as we work to improve air quality and to reduce \nrespiratory illnesses and the allergic conditions that trigger \nrespiratory distress, we need to fight the growing trigger, climate \nchange.\n  Warming oceans and lakes can also harm our health. Higher water \nsurface temperature is associated with harmful blooms of various \nspecies of algae. These blooms are often referred to as ``red tide.'' \nThey deplete oxygen, block sunlight, and they produce toxins. The \ntoxins are very often captured by clams and oysters and other \nshellfish.\n  When they are consumed, it can result in neurotoxic shellfish \npoisoning, which causes debilitating respiratory and gastrointestinal \nsymptoms. A warming climate also is predicted to change the range of \ndisease-spreading parasites, such as ticks and mosquitoes. With longer \nsummers and shorter winters, we will face more exposure to these pests \nand to the diseases they can carry.\n  We in New England and Connecticut and Rhode Island and Massachusetts, \nof course, are very familiar with lyme disease, which is a tick-borne \nillness that can have very grave and serious effects.\n  Slow and steady warming is also causing sea levels to rise, which \nthreatens coastal infrastructure and human safety as well. In South \nKingstown, RI, Matunuck Beach Road is the only means of access to \napproximately 500 homes. That road also covers the public water main. \nFor years, the sand erosion has eaten away at the beach. Now the road \nis immediately vulnerable to storms. Indeed it has been overwashed in \nrecent storms. A breach in Matunuck Beach Road cuts off those 500 homes \nfrom emergency services. If it were damaging enough, it could cut off \ntheir water.\n  Our water quality is also threatened. Many of Rhode Island's \nwastewater treatment plants are in low-lying areas and flood zones near \nthe coast. It is the story in many other States. In California, for \nexample, the rising sea level has put 29 wastewater treatment plants, \nresponsible for 530 million gallons of sewage processing every day, at \nincreased risk for flooding.\n  As we know, climate change loads the dice for more extreme weather: \nheat waves, droughts, storms, all serious threats to human health and \nsafety. Climate change has led to an increase in the likelihood of \nsevere heat waves. Extreme heat causes heat exhaustion. It can cause \nheat stroke. The need for air-conditioning in heat waves also strains \nthe power infrastructure, which can cause electrical brownouts and \nblackouts. This hinders emergency services and exacerbates wildfires \nand drought. These are the kinds of conditions--from extreme heat--that \nled to literally tens of thousands of deaths in the record-setting \nRussian heat wave of 2010.\n\n  Heavy rainfall can cause physical damage, flooding erosion, and \nsewage overflow. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that \n118,000 sanitary sewer overflows occur annually from storms overwashing \nthrough combined sewer systems, overloading those systems, and being \nreleased directly into the open, releasing up to actually 860 billion \ngallons of untreated sewage and wastewater. In 2010, heavy rainfall and \nflooding caused millions of dollars in damage in spilled raw sewage in \nWarwick, RI, my home State. The flood led to the temporary shutdown of \nthe local wastewater treatment facility. These overflows, like the one \nin Warwick, can result in beach closures, shellfish bed closures, \ncontamination of drinking water supplies, and other environmental and \npublic health problems.\n  Extreme rainfall, meaning both way too little and way too much \nrainfall, promotes waterborne outbreaks of disease. In the northeast \nUnited States, heavy rainfall has increased by 74 percent since my \nchildhood in the 1950s.\n  As we have seen with Superstorm Sandy, Hurricane Irene, and Hurricane \nKatrina, storms can very quickly affect millions of people and require \ntens of billions of dollars to clean up. The threat gets worse as sea-\nlevel rise allows storm surges to reach farther inland and create more \ndamage than just a few decades ago. Much of the east coast was fearful \nof flooding during Superstorm Sandy last year, including, of course, \nsouthern Rhode Island. Because of erosion and sea-level rise, the storm \nsurges on our shores can reach homes that were originally built \nhundreds of feet from the coastline.\n  I had the experience of standing with a man who had a childhood home \nthat had been through at least three generations of his family. He was \nnow actually older than me, and that childhood home--which had stood \nwell back from the beach--was canting toward the sea and tumbling into \nthe ocean. The ocean had claimed his home of multiple generations as \nits victim.\n  This map shows by ZIP code where the 800,000 people displaced by \nHurricane Katrina sought refuge after that terrible storm. Hundreds of \nthousands of people were strewn across every corner of the country. \nHundreds of thousands of lives were disrupted as a result.\n  Thankfully, not everybody is sleepwalking through these alarming \nrealities. In 2010, Rhode Island created our Climate Change Commission, \nwhich has identified risks to key infrastructure and is analyzing data \nfrom events such as Hurricane Sandy and the 2010 flood. Other States \nhave formed similar commissions.\n  I brought last night to our President's State of the Union Address \nGrover Fugate, who is executive director of our Coastal Resources \nManagement Council, which has to look at and address every day and plan \nfor the effects of our rising sea level, increased storm activity, and \nthe risk that that portends to the shores of our ocean State.\n  For the past 3 years, Rhode Island has also been part of a regional \ngreenhouse gas initiative nicknamed ReGGie, along with our neighbors in \nConnecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire,\n\n[[Page S692]]\n\nNew York, and Vermont. Our region caps carbon emissions and sells \npermits to emit greenhouses gases to powerplants. This has created \neconomic incentives for both the States and our utilities to invest in \nenergy efficiency and in renewable energy development. And consumers \nhave reaped the benefit of lower prices. In 2012, regional emissions \nwere 45 percent below the annual cap, so just last week the State \nannounced an agreement to cap future emissions at the 2012 rate.\n  I am proud of the work done in my State, and I know the Presiding \nOfficer's home State of Connecticut is working equally hard on this \nissue. We are working to both slow climate change and to prepare for \nwhat are now its inevitable effects. But sadly, when it comes to this \nparticular threat to our national security and our prosperity, Congress \nis asleep. It is time for us to wake up. The health and safety of \nAmericans and of people all over the world is at risk. We must awaken \nto what is happening in the world around us and to the fact that the \ncarbon pollution we are emitting is causing it. This is our \nresponsibility. This is our generation's responsibility. It is, indeed, \nour duty. It is time for us to wake up.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a special \nclass of people who are critical to the success of any U.S. Senator.\n  During the recent Super Bowl game, one advertisement stood out among \nall the others. It was an advertisement based on a tribute taken from \nthe great American Paul Harvey. It was entitled ``So God Made a \nFarmer.'' While I respect and admire farmers greatly, especially those \nI know from Utah, I am also certain that my colleagues in this Chamber \nwill agree that when it comes to this institution, we can rightly \nchange that statement ever so slightly to say, ``So God Made a Chief of \nStaff.''\n  My first chief of staff Spencer Stokes is returning to Utah. He is \nalso returning to his family and to private life after 2 extraordinary \nyears serving me in my office. I offer this in tribute to him and to \nall great chiefs of staff who labor here on Capitol Hill.\n  When God looked down on the Senate, He realized that Senators alone \ncould never keep things running and He said, I need a caretaker. So God \nmade a chief of staff. He needed someone whose first thought in the \nmorning and last thought at night would be about helping and serving a \nSenator; who would rise before dawn and organize the day, set the \nstrategy, deal with the thick and thin of things, and steer the Senator \naway from bad meetings, bad policy, and bad people; someone who would \nwork all day in and out of the office, would skip holidays, birthdays, \nand parties in pursuit of their service, who would stay past midnight \nwaiting for a vote, and then be willing to get up at the crack of dawn \nthe next morning to do it all again. So God made a chief of staff.\n  He needed someone with thick skin, strong will, and at the same time \na soft touch; strong enough to herd cats, yet gentle enough to comfort \na grieving constituent or staff member; someone to call BS, tame the \ncantankerous bureaucracy of government, creatively solve problems big \nand small, and patiently listen to a hostile constituent with an axe to \ngrind, and then tell that same constituent to come back again real \nsoon--and mean it. So God made a chief of staff.\n  God said, I need someone who can shape a staff, shine shoes, horse \ntrade for furniture and office space, navigate a litany of ethics and \nrules requirements, and play the role of cruise director for countless \nconstituent tours of Washington, DC; someone who will put in a full 40 \nhours by Tuesday at noon, and then put in another 72 hours on top of \nthat by the end of the week. So God made a chief of staff.\n  He had to have someone willing to sprint at double speed to stay \nahead of a news story, and yet stop on a dime and pivot to help the \nreal people of this country, no matter the consequences, no matter the \ncircumstances, and regardless of what the press might be doing at the \nmoment. He needed someone who, when the Senator becomes surrounded by \n``yes'' men is willing to say humbly yet firmly and resolutely, ``No, \nsir.'' So God made a chief of staff.\n  He said, I need somebody strong enough to catch arrows, take heat, \nendure withering criticism, and patiently listen to angry voices; \nsomebody who is just fine with little prominence, praise, prestige, or \nperks, and who above all is fiercely loyal and forever has the \nSenator's back. So God made a chief of staff.\n  I am fairly certain that when God looked down on a newly elected \nSenator from Utah during the final months of 2010, He knew that any old \nchief of staff wouldn't do. So, in my case, he actually chose a \nfarmer--a turkey farmer, to be specific--from Bothwell, UT, named \nSpencer Stokes.\n  Spencer has been a truly outstanding chief of staff. Doing the heavy \nlifting and providing the Herculean effort required to set up an office \nand build a staff from scratch proved to be Spencer's forte. It proved \nto be easy for him--or at least he made it look easy. He has an eye for \ndetail like no other, though we occasionally need to remind him to \n``zoom out.'' Straight chairs in the conference room, straight desks, \nand even straight ties all set the stage for straight talk about issues \nand policy and serving constituents.\n  Spencer's love of Utah and its people is unequaled. As a first order \nof business, he set out to make my office something of an embassy for \nmy State. So when you walk into our office, you are actually walking \nquite literally into Utah. From the art on the walls to the naming of \nthe conference rooms, from our legendary JELL-O Wednesday to the staff \nreading of the smalltown Utah newspapers each week--everything leads to \nan experience in our office, and everything in our office is an \nexperience of Utah.\n  Spencer will long be remembered and appreciated for his handwritten \nnotes, the best night tour in DC--a true story--bringing people \ntogether, confetti cannons, Utah fry sauce, lots of laughter, and a \ntireless commitment to make bad things good and good things even \nbetter.\n  From Spencer's perspective, there are no small players in this great \ninstitution that is the Senate. He did not just preach that philosophy, \nhe lived it every single day he was here. As a testament to that, we \nnoted that when we asked him to provide a list of all the people he \nwanted invited to his farewell party, at the top of Spencer's list \nthere were people who were not necessarily of high status. No, the top \nof the list was reserved for the people who really make this place go: \ncashiers and cooks, security personnel, guides and junior staff from \nnearly every corner of this building.\n  I salute Spencer Stokes for his service to this Nation, to this \ninstitution, and to the people of Utah. I salute Spencer for his \nservice to me and my family. I will forever be thankful that God made a \nchief of staff and especially thankful for a particularly extraordinary \nchief of staff, Spencer Stokes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/13/senate-section/article/S693-4", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S693-S694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO U.S. MARSHAL DAVID DEMAG\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, one of the great privileges in serving in \nthe U.S. Senate is the ability to make recommendations to the President \nwith respect to important nominations for posts in our States. I was \npleased 4\n\n[[Page S694]]\n\nyears ago to recommend to President Obama the nomination of David Demag \nto be Vermont's U.S. Marshal, and to help move his nomination through \nthe Judiciary Committee and Senate confirmation. In fact, he was the \nfirst U.S. Marshal to be confirmed during the Obama administration.\n  Since his confirmation, Marshal Demag's tireless devotion to reducing \ncrime rates in Vermont has helped make my home State a safe and \ncomfortable home for its residents.\n  Marshal Demag began his career in 1971 as a patrol officer for the \nBurlington Police Department, where he rose through the ranks as \ncorporal, detective, sergeant, lieutenant, and later, commander. I have \nknown Marshal Demag throughout his career. He served as chief of police \nfor both the Essex and St. Albans Police Departments. He also was a \nmember of the Burlington Police Department. He has been a leader in \nVermont in the fight against rural crime, and has spent his life and \ncareer devoted to public service.\n  As a U.S. Marshal for Vermont, Dave Demag has remained dedicated to \narresting the State's most wanted fugitives and sex offenders and his \nwork in establishing the Vermont Violent Offender Task Force has \nexpanded the ability of the U.S. Marshal's office to catch violent and \nhabitual sex offenders. The task force has not only served as a tool \nfor bringing law enforcement officials throughout the State together, \nbut has also improved Vermont's track record for fugitive arrests to 70 \npercent while reinvesting assets seized from criminals to address the \nneeds of State and local law enforcement. These results are making a \nreal difference in the lives of Vermonters across the State and should \nserve as a model for how Federal and State law enforcement can work \ntogether around the country.\n  One of Vermont's local news stations, WCAX, recently ran a story \nhighlighting these accomplishments, and I ask unanimous consent that a \ncopy of that story be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks. I look forward to Marshal Demag's continued partnership with \nstate and local law enforcement in Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. I look forward to Marshal Demag's continued partnership \nwith State and local law enforcement in Vermont.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                   [WCAX--Vermont, January 28, 2013]\n\n               U.S. Marshals making an impact in Vermont\n\n                         (By Jennifer Reading)\n\n       Burlington, VT.--Five faces represent Vermont's most \n     wanted. Two have been caught, but the remaining three \n     fugitives are prime targets for the U.S. Marshals Service.\n       ``It's a real good area to attack to make our communities \n     safer here in Vermont,'' said David Demag, who was appointed \n     by President Obama to head the U.S. Marshals Service's \n     Vermont Division.\n       Three months ago he created the Vermont Violent Offender \n     Task Force. The operation expanded the Marshals' mission to \n     include tracking down violent and habitual sex offenders. \n     Statistically--these criminals pose a greater risk to the \n     public. ``The ones who are out of compliance top that list \n     and are more likely to re-offend,'' Demag said.\n       Demag said dedicating a full time team to taking down non-\n     compliant sex offenders--on top of its regular fugitive \n     finding mission--meant adding a state trooper and a UVM \n     police officer to the task force. But he said the plan is \n     working. Since October they've arrested 39 federal and 40 \n     state fugitives. In 2012 fugitive arrests for state offenses \n     jumped by 70 percent. ``This is not a place where fugitives \n     or sex offenders can come and hide,'' said Chief Deputy U.S. \n     Marshal Bill Gerke.\n       That's the message the task force sent to three high \n     profile out-of-state fugitives on the run in Vermont. The \n     Marshals found Philip Barr hiding out in Hardwick. He was \n     wanted for a Florida murder. Robert Mulkern was arrested in \n     Windsor for a Maryland sex assault and 149 counts of child \n     pornography. And Clifford Moore was nabbed on his way to the \n     airport, fleeing murder, sex assault and terrorism charges. \n     Although the task force gives priority to federal fugitives \n     identified as the ``worst-of-the-worst,'' they'll also adopt \n     state and local cases if there's a violent component to the \n     crime. The Marshals have the tools, expertise and time that \n     their state counterparts lack. ``We are here as a resource \n     for them,'' Demag said.\n       Two weeks ago they helped local authorities locate Shane \n     Phillips, a Johnson man wanted for more than a decade for \n     various violent crimes. He was hiding behind a false wall in \n     his family's home. ``The spirit and the actual cooperation \n     has never been better than it is presently,'' Gerke said. The \n     life-long Deputy Marshal said interagency cooperation is the \n     key to slowing down the state's ongoing violent crime and \n     preventing out-of-state organized crime from getting a \n     foothold in Vermont. ``Vermont will not harbor that type of \n     activity,'' he added.\n       The task force is funded by the federal government. Assets \n     seized from the criminals are then reinvested in state and \n     local law enforcement--paying overtime if they help with \n     compliance checks--as well as outfitting them with critical \n     safety equipment and vehicles.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/13/senate-section/article/S694-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S694-S695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO PATTY STONESIFER\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is easy from our perch on Capitol Hill \nto sometimes forget about the city that surrounds us. Like so many \ncommunities across the country, urban and rural, Washington, D.C. \nwrestles with a population in poverty. Soon, those people will have a \nnew advocate at the head of one of the Nation's capital's leading \norganizations focused on ending the cycle of poverty among local youth \nand adults. Starting in April, Patty Stonesifer will become the new \nC.E.O. and President of Martha's Table.\n  Patty devoted 9 years of her life to the work of the Gates \nFoundation. As its chief executive officer, she helped the foundation \nbecome the largest philanthropic institution in the world while taking \nno salary for herself. After her time at the Gates Foundation, Patty's \npassion for change led her to become part of the U.S. delegation to the \nUnited Nations General Assembly Special Sessions on AIDS, and was later \nappointed by President Obama in 2010 to chair the White House Council \nfor Community Solutions. We have become friends through our shared \nservice on the Smithsonian Board of Regents, and she is active on the \nboard of the Center for Global Development, and is a member of the \nCircle of Allies and Champions for the National Council of Youth \nLeaders.\n  Patty's dedication to philanthropy aligns perfectly with the mission \nof Martha's Table. This nonprofit is more than a food pantry. Not only \ndoes Martha's Table supply more than 1,000 meals each day to hungry \nWashingtonians, it also works to develop long-term solutions to hunger \nand nutrition issues, seeking an end to poverty. Martha's Table helps \nto break the cycle of poverty by providing education, nutrition, and \nfamily support services to hundreds of children and families. Martha's \nTable is lucky to have someone like Patty at the helm. I have no doubt \nshe will successfully prepare the next generation of young people for a \nbright future. Patty's self sacrifice and dedication to ending poverty \nand hunger in our Nation's Capital is to be commended, and I wish her \nthe best of luck in her new role.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from The Washington Post \nentitled, ``Patty Stonesifer, former CEO of Gates Foundation, to lead \nD.C. food pantry,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [The Washington Post, January 29, 2013]\n\n  Patty Stonesifer, Former CEO of Gates Foundation, To Lead D.C. Food \n                                 Pantry\n\n                           (By Steve Hendrix)\n\n       It took about six months after moving to Washington for \n     Patty Stonesifer to find her new job. As the former chief \n     executive of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, she had a \n     lot of corner-office options to sift through, including a \n     university presidency and the top jobs at a national charity \n     and an international development agency.\n       Her choice? She's going to run Martha's Table on 14th \n     Street NW. Starting April 1, she will take over the well-\n     regarded but decidedly local food pantry and family-services \n     nonprofit organization.\n       Stonesifer, 56, who oversaw the Gates Foundation endowment \n     of $39 billion and a staff of more than 500 for nine years, \n     will manage the D.C. charity's $6 million budget, 81 paid \n     employees, three vans and thrift shop.\n       Martha's Table plans an official announcement Wednesday. \n     But as word of Stonesifer's unexpected career move began to \n     circulate in recent days, it inspired twin reactions: \n     ``Wow!'' and ``Why?''\n       Overachievers usually work their way from small to big. \n     Having Stonesifer come run a small local charity is like \n     General Electric business titan Jack Welch showing up to \n     manage the corner appliance store, or one of the Super Bowl-\n     bound Harbaugh brothers deciding to coach high school \n     football.\n       ``If you just look at my resume, I find that I have to \n     explain this,'' Stonesifer said last\n\n[[Page S695]]\n\n     week at the temporary office she'd established at a Busboys \n     and Poets table across the street from her new home base. In \n     between a series of briefings from Martha's Table managers, \n     she tried to explain how a top-of-the-charts philanthropy pro \n     came to match fates with an ambitious local charity.\n       ``But if you know me, I don't have to explain it at all,'' \n     she said. ``I absolutely think I can help Martha's Table, but \n     this is going to be wonderful for me.''\n       A shift in scale\n       Cathy Sulzberger, the head of the Martha's Table board of \n     directors, was in a taxicab last fall when she got a call \n     from the headhunter leading the board's search for a new \n     leader: A surprising--and exciting--candidate had applied.\n       ``Honestly, my first response was, `Is Patty Stonesifer \n     sure she wants this kind of job?' '' recalled Sulzberger.\n       Running the 33-year-old nonprofit group will certainly be a \n     shift in scale. Under Stonesifer, the Gates Foundation became \n     the largest philanthropic institution in the world. It has \n     set colossal, planet-shifting goals for itself: eradicating \n     polio and malaria, transforming American high schools, and \n     more.\n       Before that, Stonesifer was a senior vice president at \n     Microsoft responsible for developing MSNBC, Encarta and Slate \n     magazine (now owned by The Washington Post Co.).\n       More recently, President Obama asked her to chair his White \n     House Council for Community Solutions, and she has just \n     wrapped up a stint as chairman of the Smithsonian \n     Institution's Board of Regents. Stonesifer has appeared on \n     Time magazine's annual list of the 25 Most Influential \n     People. She is married to journalist and founding Slate \n     editor Michael Kinsley. She is a boldface name.\n       ``There is no phone call that Patty would make that \n     wouldn't be returned, none at all,'' said Diana Aviv, \n     president of Independent Sector, a Washington-based coalition \n     of nonprofit groups and foundations.\n       Soon after leaving the Gates Foundation in 2008, Stonesifer \n     and Kinsley began splitting their time between Seattle and \n     the District, where he used to live and where she has a \n     daughter from a previous marriage working at USAID. Last \n     year, Kinsley accepted an editor's job at the New Republic \n     magazine, and they decided to make the District their full-\n     time home.\n       Stonesifer has been wealthy since piling up tens of \n     millions in Microsoft stock in the company's early years. \n     (She also became a director at Amazon.com before it went \n     public and remains on that company's board.) But she retains \n     the modest bent of the Indiana Catholic who grew up with \n     eight siblings in a house where volunteerism was as regular \n     as making the bed. She took no salary while running the Gates \n     Foundation.\n       After the couple bought a restored brownstone near Dupont \n     Circle, Stonesifer began exploring Washington by foot and \n     Metro.\n       ``I was amazed at how there is a city within a city here,'' \n     she said, reeling off the stats: 110,000 households live in \n     poverty, one in three households with children can't afford \n     enough food. ``This idea that the District has so much child \n     hunger, it's mind-boggling.''\n       Stonesifer decided she needed some time in the trenches. \n     Nothing would teach her, and her peers in the foundation \n     world, more about these intractable problems than confronting \n     them, year after year, in the faces of the people who suffer \n     them.\n       And then she saw the CEO-wanted ad for Martha's Table.\n       ``I decided to raise my hand,'' she said.\n       Her husband said he was surprised, at first.\n       ``I said, `Are you going to be adding the salt to the \n     soup?' '' Kinsley recalled, sitting with Stonesifer in their \n     living room after her coffee-shop meetings were over. The \n     walls were covered with paintings by Seattle artists, misty \n     mountain ranges and tulip fields. ``But I shouldn't have been \n     surprised. You said you wanted to do something hands-on.''\n       ``You didn't really believe me,'' she said. ``You thought I \n     should be a university head.''\n       ``Yes, run a college,'' he said, ``maybe the World Bank.''\n       ``It's nice to have a husband who thinks you can do \n     anything.'' She leaned over to pat his leg.\n       ``You'll get your turn at running Hewlett-Packard, I \n     assume,'' Kinsley said.\n       She shot him a look.\n       ``Joke! Joke!'' he said.\n       The right person\n       First she had to get this job.\n       ``Even if she comes from a major philanthropy and is so \n     well-known, we had to make sure we were hiring the right \n     person for Martha's Table,'' Sulzberger said of the long \n     vetting Stonesifer went through. ``This may be a smaller \n     stage, but it's not a small job for anybody.''\n       Martha's Table started in 1980 as a place for hungry \n     students to get an after-school sandwich. Its ``McKenna's \n     Wagon'' food vans have been mealtime fixtures at McPherson \n     Square and other gathering spots for the homeless for \n     decades. Now, it serves more than 1,100 people a day with \n     meals and early-childhood and after-school programs.\n       The group's legion of volunteers is legendary: A roll of \n     more than 10,000 school kids, poor people and the occasional \n     president who chop vegetables and build sandwiches.\n       Now, the organization wants to make a leap.\n       ``I think Martha's Table is ready for the next stage,'' \n     said Linda Moore, founder of the E.W. Stokes Charter School \n     in Northeast Washington and longtime board member. ``Even \n     though I'm not sure what that is, we were looking for a \n     leader to take us there.''\n       Stonesifer got the job. The head of the Gates Foundation \n     U.S. programs, Allan Golston, sent congratulations. So did \n     Sylvia Burwell, president of the Walmart Foundation. Even \n     Stonesifer's old boss thought it was a good move.\n       ``I think it blends all the elements she loves in \n     philanthropy,'' Melinda Gates said by e-mail. ``Even when \n     living in Seattle, she did hands-on work at a local charity--\n     anonymously. That type of work keeps you grounded in the real \n     issues in people's lives.''\n       Again, she will work for free, but she will also work for \n     real. She expects long hours. This is not, she insisted (with \n     some heat) a ``retirement'' job.\n       She's heard that one before, after she left Microsoft and \n     agreed to run Bill Gates's library initiative.\n       `` `Oh, she's going to convert libraries to the Internet, \n     how sweet.' Well, it wasn't sweet at all,'' Stonesifer said. \n     ``We added 11,000 libraries to the Web, and that group went \n     on to become the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.''\n       No stepping back.\n       On a taxi ride from her house to a meeting of philanthropy \n     leaders at the Hotel Monaco, she described her biggest \n     concern: that people will assume she can connect a funding \n     hose from Martha's Table to the Gates Foundation and the \n     coffers will be full forever.\n       Not gonna happen.\n       ``That's not what they do, and that's not what Martha's \n     Table needs,'' she said. ``The strength of Martha's Table is \n     in the thousands of small donors and volunteers that ensure \n     we deliver services every day. I don't want my coming here to \n     make people step back in any way.''\n       The cabdriver leaned back. ``You work for Martha's Table?'' \n     he asked in a strong Ethiopian accent.\n       Stonesifer hesitated. ``I'm going to.''\n       ``It's a good charity,'' the man said. He picks up \n     volunteers there all the time, he explained, young people who \n     need a ride home. Thinking of his own two children in \n     Virginia colleges, he doesn't take their money.\n       ``You'd have to be mentally handicapped to charge somebody \n     doing what they do,'' he said. ``You work for Martha's Table, \n     I won't charge you, either.''\n       Stonesifer put a hand on his shoulder, even as she insisted \n     he take the money from her hand. ``You dear, sweet man,'' she \n     said. ``God bless you.''\n       On the curb, she exulted.\n       ``That's the power of Martha's Table,'' she said. ``A man \n     driving a cab and putting two kids through school. That's \n     what we have to work with. I'm so excited.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/13/senate-section/article/S695-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S695-S696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR. LARRY D. TYLER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a \ndistinguished Kentuckian, a pillar of the Louisville community and a \nfixture at the University of Louisville, and a very good friend of \nmine. Dr. Larry D. Tyler is a professor of engineering fundamentals, \nand this year he celebrates 50 years of service with UofL's J.B. Speed \nSchool of Engineering.\n  Dr. Tyler earned his original appointment at UofL as an engineering \ninstructor in 1963. He received tenure in 1970. He has taught more than \n30 different courses in the fields of engineering mathematics and \nmechanical, industrial, chemical, and civil engineering. He has created \ninnovative instructional methodologies for core engineering mathematics \ncourses, including early detection of prerequisite weaknesses.\n  Dr. Tyler has earned all of his degrees at the University of \nLouisville: his undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering, a \nmaster's in mathematics, a master's of mechanical engineering, and a \nPh.D. in engineering and physics. Along the way he has been published \nin peer-review journals and presented at international conferences on \nengineering design and automation. He won the Speed School's \nOutstanding Teacher Award in 1975, 1980, and 1983, the University \nFaculty Favorite Award in 2007, the Speed School Alumni Outstanding \nTeaching Award in 2007, the University of Louisville's Distinguished \nTeaching Award in 2008, and the Departmental Professor of the Year \nAward in 2012.\n  Larry has served as a faculty advisor to many fraternity student \nchapters, and here I should mention that Larry and I are old friends. \nNot only did we attend UofL together as undergraduates, we were both \nmembers of Phi Tau fraternity together; in fact, we were in the same \npledge class. So I've had the pleasure of seeing Larry grow into the \nincredibly accomplished and respected professor that we knew he was \nalways meant to be.\n  Larry, it has been a privilege to walk alongside you for these many \nyears. I know that we both care deeply about our wonderful hometown of \nLouisville, and we have both dedicated our careers\n\n[[Page S696]]\n\nto serving the people of Louisville and giving back to this city by our \nown contribution. On this occasion to celebrate your success, I say, \nwell done.\n  Larry's teaching philosophy is to be both student- and content-\ncentered, in order to instill the qualities of desire, determination, \nand dedication in his students because, as he says, ``success in any \nendeavor requires all three.'' The life and career of Dr. Tyler is \ncertainly proof that if you have those three qualities, you can go very \nfar.\n  Mr. President, I would ask my U.S. Senate colleagues to join me in \nrecognizing the accomplishments of Dr. Larry D. Tyler, and \ncongratulating him upon his 50 years of successful service with UofL's \nJ.B. Speed School of Engineering. I hope he continues to lead our \nuniversity and our city onward and upward for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/13/senate-section/article/S696-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S696-S697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          COMMITTEE ON HEALTH, EDUCATION, LABOR, AND PENSIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Unless the \n     chairman and ranking minority member agree on a shorter \n     period of time, the minority shall have no fewer than three \n     business days to prepare supplemental, minority or additional \n     views for inclusion in a committee report from the time the \n     majority makes the proposed text of the committee report \n     available to the minority.\n       Rule 17.--(a) The committee, or any subcommittee, may issue \n     subpoenas, or hold hearings to take sworn testimony or hear \n     subpoenaed witnesses, only if such investigative activity has \n     been authorized by majority vote of the committee.\n       (b) For the purpose of holding a hearing to take sworn \n     testimony or hear subpoenaed\n\n[[Page S697]]\n\n     witnesses, three members of the committee or subcommittee \n     shall constitute a quorum: provided, with the concurrence of \n     the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee or \n     subcommittee, a single member may hear subpoenaed witnesses \n     or take sworn testimony.\n       (c) The committee may, by a majority vote, delegate the \n     authority to issue subpoenas to the chairman of the committee \n     or a subcommittee, or to any member designated by such \n     chairman. Prior to the issuance of each subpoena, the ranking \n     minority member of the committee or subcommittee, and any \n     other member so requesting, shall be notified regarding the \n     identity of the person to whom it will be issued and the \n     nature of the information sought and its relationship to the \n     authorized investigative activity, except where the chairman \n     of the committee or subcommittee, in consultation with the \n     ranking minority member, determines that such notice would \n     unduly impede the investigation. All information obtained \n     pursuant to such investigative activity shall be made \n     available as promptly as possible to each member of the \n     committee requesting same, or to any assistant to a member of \n     the committee designated by such member in writing, but the \n     use of any such information is subject to restrictions \n     imposed by the rules of the Senate.

Mr. President, on January 31, one of the most unique and \ninteresting individuals I have ever known passed away while receiving \nhospice care at the Southern Arizona VA Health Care System. He was my \nbrother-in-law, Joe McQuaid, a 92-year-old veteran of the Second World \nWar.\n  I will have more to say about this unique individual at a later date. \nBut, today, I want to express my deep gratitude to all of the wonderful \nprofessionals at the Southern Arizona VA Health Care System for the \nextraordinary care they gave to him in the last 2 months of his life.\n  Joe McQuaid was a strapping 6 feet 4 inches. He was healthy all of \nhis life until last November 15. On that day, after his daily exercise, \nhe fell in a freak accident and broke his hip. He was operated on at \nthe Tucson VA hospital, and his hip seemed to be healing just fine. But \nafter being transferred to a local rehabilitation facility, Joe fell \nagain and re-broke his hip. He was readmitted to the VA hospital, but \nhis condition deteriorated rapidly and he passed away on January 31.\n  The personnel at the VA medical center in Tucson could not have been \nmore professional, skilled, and compassionate in the care they gave to \nJoe McQuaid in those final two months. They did everything possible to \ntreat his injury and help him to recover. But once it became clear that \nrecovery was not possible, they took wonderful care of him, admitting \nhim to hospice care, attending to his needs, and ensuring that he had a \ngentle passing.\n  As a veteran myself, during all my years in Congress I have always \nbeen very supportive of our VA system and\n\n[[Page S698]]\n\nour veterans. I have long believed that our nation has a sacred \nobligation to those who have borne the burdens of battle and national \ndefense, and we must ensure that they have access to first-rate health \ncare.\n  So it was with great pride that I had this opportunity to witness \nfirsthand the extraordinary care and attention that staff members at \nthe Tucson VA center were giving to this 92-year-old veteran.\n  At the risk of leaving out the names of others who cared for my \nbrother-in-law, I specifically want to thank and salute Jonathan \nGardner, the director of the Southern Arizona VA Health Care System, \nfor his leadership of that institution and for his many years of \ndistinguished service to the VA system. Also Julianne French, a \nregistered nurse and administrative assistant to the chief medical \nofficer, who was so responsive to my inquiries and calls. Also Dr. \nDavid Emelity, the acting chief of staff, Dr. Richard Hoffman, and Dr. \nJoao Ferreira, all of who took a deep personal interest in Joe's \nmedical condition.\n  And a special thank you to Glenda Riggs, clinical nurse leader in the \nintensive care unit, who cared for Joe and went out of her way to keep \nme and members of Joe's family informed at every step of his treatment \nand care. I can't speak too highly of Nurse Riggs' skill and \ncompassion, and her tireless attention to all of her patients and their \nfamilies.\n  The Southern Arizona VA Health Care System has a wonderful team, with \ngreat leadership from Jonathan Gardner. It is clear to me that any \nveteran who comes through the doors of that center is going to get \nsuperb treatment.\n  I am proud of all the people who work in America's VA system, and I \nam grateful for the care they give to our veterans. My recent \nexperience, seeing firsthand the quality of care and the quality of \nstaff at the center in Tucson, reaffirms my faith in the VA system and \nmy respect for the great work they do.\n  Again, I just want to thank the entire team at the Southern Arizona \nVA Health Care System. Thank you for all you did for this 92-year-old \nWorld War II veteran, Joe McQuaid. And thank you for the same high-\nquality care you give to all of the veterans at the Tucson center.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/13/senate-section/article/S698-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S698-S701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN RELATIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ.

However, proxies shall not be voted on a \n     measure or matter except when the absent member has been \n     informed of the matter on which he is being recorded and has \n     affirmatively requested that he or she be so recorded.\n\n\n                           RULE 6--WITNESSES\n\n       (a) General.--The Committee on Foreign Relations will \n     consider requests to testify on any matter or measure pending \n     before the committee.\n       (b) Presentation.--If the chairman so determines, the oral \n     presentation of witnesses shall be limited to 10 minutes. \n     However, written statements of reasonable length may be \n     submitted by witnesses and other interested persons who are \n     unable to testify in person.\n       (c) Filing of Statements.--A witness appearing before the \n     committee, or any subcommittee thereof, shall submit an \n     electronic copy of the written statement of his proposed \n     testimony at least 24 hours prior to his appearance, unless \n     this requirement is waived by the chairman and the ranking \n     member following their determination that there is good cause \n     for failure to file such a statement.\n       (d) Expenses.--Only the chairman may authorize expenditures \n     of funds for the expenses of witnesses appearing before the \n     committee or its subcommittees.\n       (e) Requests.--Any witness called for a hearing may submit \n     a written request to the chairman no later than 24 hours in \n     advance for his testimony to be in closed or open session, or \n     for any other unusual procedure. The chairman shall determine \n     whether to grant any such request and shall notify the \n     committee members of the request and of his decision.\n\n\n                           RULE 7--SUBPOENAS\n\n       (a) Authorization.--The chairman or any other member of the \n     committee, when authorized by a majority vote of the \n     committee at a meeting or by proxies, shall have authority to \n     subpoena the attendance of witnesses or the production of \n     memoranda, documents, records, or any other materials. At the \n     request of any member of the committee, the committee shall \n     authorize the issuance of a subpoena only at a meeting of the \n     committee. When the committee authorizes a subpoena, it may \n     be issued upon the signature of the chairman or any other \n     member designated by the committee.\n       (b) Return.--A subpoena, or a request to an agency, for \n     documents may be issued whose return shall occur at a time \n     and place other than that of a scheduled committee meeting. A \n     return on such a subpoena or request which is incomplete or \n     accompanied by an objection constitutes good cause for a \n     hearing on shortened notice. Upon such a return, the chairman \n     or any other member designated by him may convene a hearing \n     by giving 2 hours notice by telephone to all other members. \n     One member shall constitute a quorum for such a hearing. The \n     sole purpose of such a hearing shall be to elucidate further \n     information about the return and to rule on the objection.\n       (c) Depositions.--At the direction of the committee, staff \n     is authorized to take depositions from witnesses.\n\n\n                            RULE 8--REPORTS\n\n       (a) Filing.--When the committee has ordered a measure or \n     recommendation reported, the report thereon shall be filed in \n     the Senate at the earliest practicable time.\n       (b) Supplemental, Minority and Additional Views.--A member \n     of the committee who gives notice of his intentions to file \n     supplemental, minority, or additional views at the time of \n     final committee approval of a measure or matter, shall be \n     entitled to not less than 3 calendar days in which to file \n     such views, in writing, with the chief clerk of the \n     committee, with the 3 days to begin at 11:00 p.m. on the same \n     day that the committee has ordered a measure or matter \n     reported. Such views shall then be included in the \n     committee report and printed in the same volume, as a part \n     thereof, and their inclusion shall be noted on the cover \n     of the report. In the absence of timely notice, the \n     committee report may be filed and printed immediately \n     without such views.\n\n[[Page S700]]\n\n       (c) Rollcall Votes.--The results of all rollcall votes \n     taken in any meeting of the committee on any measure, or \n     amendment thereto, shall be announced in the committee \n     report. The announcement shall include a tabulation of the \n     votes cast in favor and votes cast in opposition to each such \n     measure and amendment by each member of the committee.\n\n\n                            RULE 9--TREATIES\n\n       (a) The committee is the only committee of the Senate with \n     jurisdiction to review and report to the Senate on treaties \n     submitted by the President for Senate advice and consent to \n     ratification. Because the House of Representatives has no \n     role in the approval of treaties, the committee is therefore \n     the only congressional committee with responsibility for \n     treaties.\n       (b) Once submitted by the President for advice and consent, \n     each treaty is referred to the committee and remains on its \n     calendar from Congress to Congress until the committee takes \n     action to report it to the Senate or recommend its return to \n     the President, or until the committee is discharged of the \n     treaty by the Senate.\n       (c) In accordance with Senate Rule XXX.2, treaties which \n     have been reported to the Senate but not acted on before the \n     end of a Congress ``shall be resumed at the commencement of \n     the next Congress as if no proceedings had previously been \n     had thereon.''\n       (d) Insofar as possible, the committee should conduct a \n     public hearing on each treaty as soon as possible after its \n     submission by the President. Except in extraordinary \n     circumstances, treaties reported to the Senate shall be \n     accompanied by a written report.\n\n\n                          RULE 10--NOMINATIONS\n\n       (a) Waiting Requirement.--Unless otherwise directed by the \n     chairman and the ranking member, the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations shall not consider any nomination until 3 business \n     days after it has been formally submitted to the Senate.\n       (b) Public Consideration.--Nominees for any post who are \n     invited to appear before the committee shall be heard in \n     public session, unless a majority of the committee decrees \n     otherwise, consistent with Rule 3(f).\n       (c) Required Data.--No nomination shall be reported to the \n     Senate unless (1) the nominee has been accorded a security \n     clearance on the basis of a thorough investigation by \n     executive branch agencies; (2) the nominee has filed a \n     financial disclosure report and a related ethics undertaking \n     with the committee; (3) the committee has been assured that \n     the nominee does not have any interests which could conflict \n     with the interests of the government in the exercise of the \n     nominee's proposed responsibilities; (4) for persons \n     nominated to be chief of mission, ambassador-at-large, or \n     minister, the committee has received a complete list of any \n     contributions made by the nominee or members of his immediate \n     family to any Federal election campaign during the year of \n     his or her nomination and for the 4 preceding years; and (5) \n     for persons nominated to be chiefs of mission, the report \n     required by Section 304(a)(4) of the Foreign Service Act of \n     1980 on the demonstrated competence of that nominee to \n     perform the duties of the position to which he or she has \n     been nominated.\n\n\n                            RULE 11--TRAVEL\n\n       (a) Foreign Travel.--No member of the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations or its staff shall travel abroad on committee \n     business unless specifically authorized by the chairman, who \n     is required by law to approve vouchers and report \n     expenditures of foreign currencies, and the ranking member. \n     Requests for authorization of such travel shall state the \n     purpose and, when completed, a full substantive and financial \n     report shall be filed with the committee within 30 days. This \n     report shall be furnished to all members of the committee and \n     shall not be otherwise disseminated without authorization of \n     the chairman or the ranking member. Except in extraordinary \n     circumstances, staff travel shall not be approved unless the \n     reporting requirements have been fulfilled for all prior \n     trips. Except for travel that is strictly personal, travel \n     funded by non-U.S. Government sources is subject to the same \n     approval and substantive reporting requirements as U.S. \n     Government-funded travel. In addition, members and staff are \n     reminded to consult the Senate Code of Conduct, and, as \n     appropriate, the Senate Select Committee on Ethics, in the \n     case of travel sponsored by non-U.S. Government sources.\n       Any proposed travel by committee staff for a subcommittee \n     purpose must be approved by the subcommittee chairman and \n     ranking member prior to submission of the request to the \n     chairman and ranking member of the full committee.\n       (b) Domestic Travel.--All official travel in the United \n     States by the committee staff shall be approved in advance by \n     the staff director, or in the case of minority staff, by the \n     minority staff director.\n       (c) Personal Staff.--As a general rule, no more than one \n     member of the personal staff of a member of the committee may \n     travel with that member with the approval of the chairman and \n     the ranking member of the committee. During such travel, the \n     personal staff member shall be considered to be an employee \n     of the committee.\n       (d) Personal Representatives of the Member (PRM).--For the \n     purposes of this rule regarding staff foreign travel, the \n     officially-designated personal representative of the member \n     (PRM) shall be deemed to have the same rights, duties, and \n     responsibilities as members of the staff of the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations. Furthermore, for the purposes of this \n     section, each member of the committee may designate one \n     personal staff member as the ``Personal Representative of the \n     Member.''\n\n\n                          RULE 12--TRANSCRIPTS\n\n       (a) General.--The Committee on Foreign Relations shall keep \n     verbatim transcripts of all committee and subcommittee \n     meetings and such transcripts shall remain in the custody of \n     the committee, unless a majority of the committee decides \n     otherwise. Transcripts of public hearings by the committee \n     shall be published unless the chairman, with the concurrence \n     of the ranking member, determines otherwise.\n       (b) Classified or Restricted Transcripts.--\n       (1) The chief clerk of the committee shall have \n     responsibility for the maintenance and security of classified \n     or restricted transcripts, and shall ensure that such \n     transcripts are handled in a manner consistent with the \n     requirements of the United States Senate Security Manual.\n       (2) A record shall be maintained of each use of classified \n     or restricted transcripts as required by the Senate Security \n     Manual.\n       (3) Classified transcripts may not leave the committee \n     offices, or SVC-217 of the Capitol Visitors Center, except \n     for the purpose of declassification or archiving, consistent \n     with these rules.\n       (4) Extreme care shall be exercised to avoid taking notes \n     or quotes from classified transcripts. Their contents may not \n     be divulged to any unauthorized person.\n       (5) Subject to any additional restrictions imposed by the \n     chairman with the concurrence of the ranking member, only the \n     following persons are authorized to have access to classified \n     or restricted transcripts.\n       (A) Members and staff of the committee in the committee \n     offices or in SVC-217 of the Capitol Visitors Center;\n       (B) Designated personal representatives of members of the \n     committee, and of the majority and minority leaders, with \n     appropriate security clearances, in the committee offices or \n     in SVC-217 of the Capitol Visitors Center;\n       (C) Senators not members of the committee, by permission of \n     the chairman, in the committee offices or in SVC-217 of the \n     Capitol Visitors Center; and\n       (D) Officials of the executive departments involved in the \n     meeting, in the committee offices or SVC-217 of the Capitol \n     Visitors Center.\n       (6) Any restrictions imposed upon access to a meeting of \n     the committee shall also apply to the transcript of such \n     meeting, except by special permission of the chairman and \n     ranking member.\n       (7) In addition to restrictions resulting from the \n     inclusion of any classified information in the transcript of \n     a committee meeting, members and staff shall not discuss with \n     anyone the proceedings of the committee in closed session or \n     reveal information conveyed or discussed in such a session \n     unless that person would have been permitted to attend the \n     session itself, or unless such communication is specifically \n     authorized by the chairman, the ranking member, or in the \n     case of staff, by the staff director or minority staff \n     director. A record shall be kept of all such authorizations.\n       (c) Declassification.--\n       (1) All noncurrent records of the committee are governed by \n     Rule XI of the Standing Rules of the Senate and by S. Res. \n     474 (96th Congress). Any classified transcripts transferred \n     to the National Archives and Records Administration under \n     Rule XI may not be made available for public use unless they \n     have been subject to declassification review in accordance \n     with applicable laws or Executive orders.\n       (2) Any transcript or classified committee report, or any \n     portion thereof, may be declassified, in accordance with \n     applicable laws or Executive orders, sooner than the time \n     period provided for under S. Res. 474 if:\n       (A) the chairman originates such action, with the \n     concurrence of the ranking member;\n       (B) the other current members of the committee who \n     participated in such meeting or report have been notified of \n     the proposed declassification, and have not objected thereto, \n     except that the committee by majority vote may overrule any \n     objections thereby raised to early declassification; and\n       (C) the executive departments that participated in the \n     meeting or originated the classified information have been \n     consulted and consented to the declassification.\n\n\n                    RULE 13--CLASSIFIED INFORMATION\n\n       (a) The handling of classified information in the Senate is \n     governed by S. Res. 243 (100th Congress), which established \n     the Office of Senate Security. All handling of classified \n     information by the committee shall be consistent with the \n     procedures set forth in the United States Senate Security \n     Manual issued by the Office of Senate Security.\n       (b) The chief clerk is the security manager for the \n     committee. The chief clerk shall be responsible for \n     implementing the provisions of the Senate Security Manual and \n     for serving as the committee liaison to the Office of Senate \n     Security. The staff director, in consultation with the \n     minority staff director, may appoint an alternate security \n     manager as circumstances warrant.\n       (c) Classified material may only be transported between \n     Senate offices by appropriately cleared staff members who \n     have been specifically authorized to do so by the security \n     manager.\n\n[[Page S701]]\n\n       (d) In general, Senators and staff undertake to confine \n     their access to classified information on the basis of a \n     ``need to know'' such information related to their committee \n     responsibilities.\n       (e) The staff director is authorized to make such \n     administrative regulations as may be necessary to carry out \n     the provisions of this rule.\n\n\n                             RULE 14--STAFF\n\n       (a) Responsibilities.--\n       (1) The staff works for the committee as a whole, under the \n     general supervision of the chairman of the committee, and the \n     immediate direction of the staff director, except that such \n     part of the staff as is designated minority staff shall be \n     under the general supervision of the ranking member and under \n     the immediate direction of the minority staff director.\n       (2) Any member of the committee should feel free to call \n     upon the staff at any time for assistance in connection with \n     committee business. Members of the Senate not members of the \n     committee who call upon the staff for assistance from time to \n     time should be given assistance subject to the overriding \n     responsibility of the staff to the committee.\n       (3) The staff's primary responsibility is with respect to \n     bills, resolutions, treaties, and nominations and other \n     matters within the jurisdiction of the committee. In addition \n     to carrying out assignments from the committee and its \n     individual members, the staff has a responsibility to \n     originate suggestions for committee or subcommittee \n     consideration. The staff also has a responsibility to make \n     suggestions to individual members regarding matters of \n     special interest to such members.\n       (4) It is part of the staff's duty to keep itself as well \n     informed as possible in regard to developments affecting \n     foreign relations and national security and in regard to the \n     administration of foreign programs of the United States. \n     Significant trends or developments which might otherwise \n     escape notice should be called to the attention of the \n     committee, or of individual Senators with particular \n     interests.\n       (5) The staff shall pay due regard to the constitutional \n     separation of powers between the Senate and the executive \n     branch. It therefore has a responsibility to help the \n     committee bring to bear an independent, objective judgment of \n     proposals by the executive branch and when appropriate to \n     originate sound proposals of its own. At the same time, the \n     staff shall avoid impinging upon the day-to-day conduct of \n     foreign affairs.\n       (6) In those instances when committee action requires the \n     expression of minority views, the staff shall assist the \n     minority as fully as the majority to the end that all points \n     of view may be fully considered by members of the committee \n     and of the Senate. The staff shall bear in mind that under \n     our constitutional system it is the responsibility of the \n     elected members of the Senate to determine legislative issues \n     in the light of as full and fair a presentation of the facts \n     as the staff may be able to obtain.\n       (b) Restrictions.--\n       (1) The staff shall regard its relationship to the \n     committee as a privileged one, in the nature of the \n     relationship of a lawyer to a client. In order to protect \n     this relationship and the mutual confidence which must \n     prevail if the committee-staff relationship is to be a \n     satisfactory and fruitful one, the following criteria shall \n     apply:\n       (A) members of the staff shall not be identified with any \n     special interest group in the field of foreign relations or \n     allow their names to be used by any such group;\n       (B) members of the staff shall not accept public speaking \n     engagements or write for publication in the field of foreign \n     relations without specific advance permission from the staff \n     director, or, in the case of minority staff, from the \n     minority staff director. In the case of the staff director \n     and the minority staff director, such advance permission \n     shall be obtained from the chairman or the ranking member, as \n     appropriate; and\n       (C) staff shall not discuss their private conversations \n     with members of the committee without specific advance \n     permission from the Senator or Senators concerned.\n       (2) The staff shall not discuss with anyone the proceedings \n     of the committee in closed session or reveal information \n     conveyed or discussed in such a session unless that person \n     would have been permitted to attend the session itself, or \n     unless such communication is specifically authorized by the \n     staff director or minority staff director. Unauthorized \n     disclosure of information from a closed session or of \n     classified information shall be cause for immediate dismissal \n     and may, in the case of some kinds of information, be grounds \n     for criminal prosecution.\n\n\n                 RULE 15--STATUS AND AMENDMENT OF RULES\n\n       (a) Status.--In addition to the foregoing, the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations is governed by the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate, which shall take precedence in the event of a clear \n     inconsistency. In addition, the jurisdiction and \n     responsibilities of the committee with respect to certain \n     matters, as well as the timing and procedure for their \n     consideration in committee, may be governed by statute.\n       (b) Amendment.--These rules may be modified, amended, or \n     repealed by a majority of the committee, provided that a \n     notice in writing of the proposed change has been given to \n     each member at least 48 hours prior to the meeting at which \n     action thereon is to be taken. However, rules of the \n     committee which are based upon Senate rules may not be \n     superseded by committee vote alone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/13/senate-section/article/S701-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin.

Mr. President, I would like to recognize and \nhonor the incredible life of John Quimby, an inspirational leader that \nguided and touched the lives of so many.\n  John Quimby was born on February 12, 1935, in Prescott, AZ, to \nparents Henrietta and Merle Quimby. The family later moved to \nCalifornia and resided in Banning and Riverside. Mr. Quimby was hired \nas a radio announcer for a brief period of time before being elected to \nthe San Bernardino City Council in 1957. He was the youngest person to \never serve on that body.\n  In 1962, John Quimby was elected to the California State Assembly, \nrepresenting parts of Riverside and San Bernardino counties. Mr. Quimby \nbecame the first paraplegic to serve in the California Legislature. He \ncontracted polio at a young age and as a result spent the majority of \nhis life in a wheelchair. Mr. Quimby did not allow his limited mobility \nto prevent him from pursuing his dreams and fighting fervently for the \nresidents of California.\n  Over the course of his 12 years in the Assembly, John Quimby helped \npass numerous laws. Most famously, he drafted the Quimby Act in 1965, \nwhich allowed cities to require developers to donate land for \nrecreational use. As a result of this piece of legislation, hundreds of \nparks now exist in California that might otherwise have not.\n  Apart from being a dedicated assemblyman, John Quimby was also a \nbeloved figure in California politics who thrived on personal and \ncommunity interaction. He had the ability to make everyone feel special \nand cared for.\n  Please join me in expressing the sympathies of this body to John \nQuimby's brother Merle, daughter Kimberly, son John Jr., stepdaughters \nMary and Virginia George, stepson Kenny, his seven grandchildren, and \nhis seven great-grandchildren. On this day, we celebrate him, his life, \nand his exemplary contributions to California and the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/13/senate-section/article/S701-3", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S701-S702]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING MONSIGNOR LEO McFADDEN\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of \nMonsignor Leo McFadden, a priest, an Air National Guardsman, and a \nspiritual leader for thousands of Nevadans whose recent passing is a \nsaddening loss to the Silver State. Monsignor McFadden was a beloved \nmember of our community, and I am grateful for his work as a priest and \nchaplain for the less fortunate and spiritually needy in northern \nNevada.\n  Not only was Monsignor McFadden a man of God, but he was also a \nPulitzer Prize-nominated columnist who spent 20 years writing and \nediting for the Nevada Register. He also served in the Nevada Air \nNational Guard for decades, and he was the first Guardsman chaplain to \nbe a general line officer.\n  Monsignor McFadden was a priest at Saint Teresa of Avila Catholic \nChurch in Carson City and at Reno's Our Lady of the Snows Catholic \nChurch. In 1977, Leo McFadden was given the distinct designation as a \nmonsignor.

Mr. President, one-half century ago this month the \nresidents of Portage Township made a significant and lasting decision. \nThey voted in February 1963 to incorporate, becoming the city of \nPortage. This decision provided many opportunities for this nascent, \nvibrant community to grow, enabling city leaders and residents alike to \nchart a course for future prosperity. This milestone will be \ncommemorated in a number of ways throughout the year, including at \nPortage's city council meeting last night.\n  The city of Portage is a part of Michigan's rapidly evolving story. \nHistorically, residents and community leaders relied on fertile \nfarmland for agriculture production. In fact, in the late 1880s and \nearly 1900s, this area was known as ``Celery City.'' Today, it is home \nto thriving businesses, welcoming neighborhoods and abundant natural \nbeauty. The population of Portage has more than doubled in the past \nhalf century, and a number of new businesses, large and small, have \nhelped to transform the city's economic base.\n  As part of the celebration, Portage recently unveiled its new motto, \n``A Natural Place to Move.'' It speaks to the city's continued \ncommitment to preserving its many parks, lakes, and trails in a way \nthat encourages residents to stay active and healthy.\n  It is fitting that the celebrations planned this year include a mix \nof activities. A commemorative newsletter in February will highlight \nthe city's rich history; a half-marathon and 5K road race later this \nmonth will showcase the city's extensive and impressive park system; \nvolunteer opportunities spread throughout the year offer residents a \nnumber of ways to give back to their community; and a 50th anniversary \nconcert this summer as part of the 2013 summer concert series will \nbring families and friends together to celebrate this important \nanniversary.\n  The city of Portage and its residents have much to be proud of. \nTogether, they have steadily moved forward. This year is a moment to \npause and reflect on the past, and to ensure that the next 50 years \ncontinues to be marked by growth and progress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/13/senate-section/article/S702-2", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S702-S704]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VERMONT ESSAY FINALISTS\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the \nRecord finalist essays written by Vermont High School students as part \nof the Third Annual ``What is the State of the Union?'' Essay contest \nconducted by my office. These 21 finalists were selected from over 300 \nentries.\n  The essays follow.\n\n       Sydney Alderman, Mt. Abraham Union High School (Finalist)\n\n       Today we often face the problem of excessive violence \n     between people, starvation, and economic problems. People \n     aren't all getting what they need and something needs to be \n     done. What would fix everything, broaden our universal \n     communications skills and get things done quicker would be to \n     unite globally. By working as an entire unit we can all \n     communicate and work toward the same goal we all crave: \n     peace. Uniting globally can solve conflicts causing violence, \n     starvation, and economic problems.\n       Uniting globally will benefit the people of the world \n     immensely. By uniting globally it would be much easier to \n     distribute the necessary resources to sustain everyone, such \n     as food, water, and energy. When everyone is on the same page \n     and communicating thoroughly between territories, you can \n     maintain fair trade and further discuss what laws and human \n     rights need to be established as well. When we're all united \n     for a common goal, let's assume peace amongst all people, \n     discussion is more productive and conclusive and proper \n     action can be taken at a faster pace. Actions such as \n     bringing food and water to those who have none, and also \n     getting the area with these conditions re-established for \n     suitable living conditions. Everyone benefits from a united \n     world.\n       The U.S. economy will be heavily benefitted by uniting \n     globally. When we unite globally, trade is faster and we can \n     simply work faster because communication is quicker and more \n     conclusive than when we're all thinking separately. Trade \n     will therefore be quicker and we can be more productive about \n     it with such open communication. It would be easier to \n     discuss the distribution of currency amongst countries and \n     people and how we can fix the current economic problems. \n     Uniting globally will solve the biggest problems of the \n     world. It will broaden the communication between territories \n     and will help us resolve conflicts causing famine, violence, \n     and economic problems universally. When we all band together \n     we can accomplish anything and finally bring a new era of \n     peace.\n\n         Tyler Bradley, South Burlington High School (Finalist)\n\n       Our country needs to invest in clean sustainable energy and \n     decrease our dependence for oil from other nations. Our \n     nation should be investing in wind and solar power. Wind is a \n     renewable source of energy, which will last forever. It does \n     not pollute our environment and is all natural. Solar energy \n     also provides us with clean energy, with no combustion. It \n     too is renewable and causes no greenhouse gases. Although \n     wind and solar, as energy sources, may prove to be expensive, \n     it is a small price to pay for the health and safety of our \n     environment. In contrast, we are eventually going to run out \n     of oil and the high cost of transporting oil and our \n     dependency on other nations needs to be eliminated.\n       We need to stop relying on foreign nations for our energy \n     supply. If foreign governments continue to control oil \n     profits they can use that money to fund terrorism mischief. \n     In addition, these energy rich countries can restrict the oil \n     supply and therefore make the United States a hostage to \n     their demands. We need to end this cycle and invest in more \n     sustainable energy sources.\n       We need Congress to work harder to obtain sustainable \n     energy tax incentives like the Investment Tax Credit and \n     Production Tax Credits. These credits will help reduce the \n     cost of wind and solar projects and in the long run help \n     reduce global warming. All across our earth we currently see \n     record heat waves, melting glaciers, rising sea levels and \n     extreme droughts and floods. The United States must lead the \n     world in reversing global warming, to preserve a safe planet \n     for our children and grandchildren.\n\n          Annie Arthur, Woodstock Union High School (Finalist)\n\n       To be a democracy, our country must be able to hear the \n     voices of every citizen individually and the population as a \n     whole. People all over the world are sacrificing their lives \n     for the hope of the right to vote. In the United States, \n     eligibility is simple. To vote, one must be a citizen of the \n     United States and be 18 or older. However, a country as great \n     as ours does not seem able to succeed in a very seemingly \n     simple task: vote freely. The State of our Union is teetering \n     on the edge.\n       In the 2012 Presidential Election, only 57.5% of the entire \n     eligible population cast their ballots. About 93 million \n     citizens did not participate in this most basic foundation of \n     democracy. How is the United States supposed to run as an \n     effective democracy if so many citizens remain silent in such \n     a crucial time to make their voices heard? Granted, part of \n     this lack of voting is caused by laziness, indifference or \n     belief that one vote will not change the outcome. However, \n     there are many citizens who want to vote but restrictions \n     imposed at the state level have either attempted or succeeded \n     to suppress participation in this election. In this recent \n     election there were laws passed to hinder voter participation \n     by making it difficult to register to vote, requiring voter \n     photo identifications, miscommunication of date and times, \n     and threatening voters with imprisonment for voter fraud. \n     Officials also succeeded in cutting early voting periods, \n     voting by mail, polling hours and number of locations. Even \n     though courts temporarily struck down many of these efforts, \n     there is no reason to believe that state officials will be \n     deterred from imposing more voting restrictions in the \n     future.\n       This national issue should not be determined at state \n     level. Restriction on voting is a federal problem and should \n     be addressed by federal powers. This is too important an \n     issue to leave to individual state governments as clearly \n     demonstrated by the blatant attempts to deny citizens their \n     right to vote. The solution is to simply create basic \n     standards on voting. The federal government could pass a bill \n     with minimum guidelines for states to follow on voting laws. \n     This legislation does not need to be a complex list of \n     restrictions; this bill would be freeing up voting laws by \n     listing only what needs to happen to achieve successful \n     voting. Each state would then have the freedom to expand on \n     these basic requirements. This bill could facilitate \n     registration, polling hours and ability to mail in votes. It \n     is an American's right to be able to vote. As the world's \n     greatest democracy, no political party should be able to \n     obstruct voting. The United States, a nation for the people, \n     of the people, by the people needs to set a better example as \n     the standard bearer of democracy.\n\n   Jeannine Bissonette, Champlain Valley Union High School (Finalist)\n\n       Ever since Woodrow Wilson was elected in 1913, it has been \n     a tradition for Presidents to address the nation with their \n     State of the Union report. As President Obama prepares to \n     present his State of the Union address, many politically \n     concerned citizens begin to ponder the thoughts of what will \n     be produced in the next four years.\n       With a current national unemployment rate of 7.9%, the \n     numbers appear to be much lower than the 10% that the United \n     States endured during October of 2009. Although these rates \n     suggest a recuperating recession, they have not yet reached a \n     level in which the nation can sit back comfortably. These \n     high unemployment rates understandably result in a greater \n     necessity for more families to reach out to social welfare \n     services such\n\n[[Page S703]]\n\n     as food stamps and local food shelves. According to a local \n     press interview with food shelf coordinator Mary Ann \n     Castimore, the Vergennes Congregational Church found \n     themselves serving a total of approximately fifty to sixty \n     new families. People are struggling to find and hold steady \n     jobs; feeding their families continues to be growing concern.\n       Corresponding with the current economy, the United States \n     could certainly do more to address the concerns of the young \n     people. With the lack of vacant positions in the working \n     world, young adults are learning quickly that it does not \n     matter so much what they've majored in, but what is \n     available. As a high school student of Vermont, I have become \n     increasingly aware of my school advisor's push for me to look \n     into which fields are in need of laborers, rather than those \n     that suit me best when determining an occupation. As the \n     pursuit for jobs lengthens, it is important that the \n     government restricts outsourcing jobs to other countries and \n     create said jobs within the nation. Instead of outsourcing \n     jobs, the United States should provide incentives to retain \n     these positions in America.\n       As the United States adapts to the most severe recession \n     since the Great Depression, the American citizens' fear of a \n     failing economy is justified. Major issues such as the \n     nearing fiscal cliff or changes in Social Security are \n     becoming more common parts of American conversation. As \n     January approaches, politicians in D.C. are running out to \n     time to make the decision of who will be taxed in the coming \n     years. By taxing Americans making over two hundred and fifty-\n     thousand dollars, more taxes can be gleaned by the federal \n     government. Additionally, more citizens being taxed results \n     in more equitable terms. As a federal insurance program, \n     Social Security is praised highly for the benefits it \n     provides the retired population. Since American citizens are \n     now living into their eighties, a shortage in Social Security \n     money has materialized. The inadequacy of funds has led to an \n     extended retirement age which is predicted to continue \n     increasing into the future. The United States must continue \n     to raise the retirement age in order for Social Security to \n     continue operating. It takes time and multiple strategies to \n     solve any major issue: there is no one perfect solution.\n\n               Jonah Blatt, Milton High School (Finalist)\n\n       Good Evening America,\n       There are several issues that need to be addressed here \n     tonight that will benefit our nation in one way or another. \n     First off, I'd like to touch on the topic of unemployment. \n     The unemployment rate has dropped significantly. The rate was \n     10% in November of 2009, which was the highest from January \n     1st 2009 to January 1st 2013. In the middle of that, the rate \n     bounced up and down between 9% and 9.5% from 2010 to 2011. \n     Now here we sit today on a continuous, steady decline all the \n     way down to 7.7%, and I assure you it is not over. Jobs were \n     being created at a rate of 151,000 per month in 2012 and we \n     look to raise that number this coming year. My new plan \n     allows workers who have lost their job to be placed on \n     temporary jobs as trainees for short periods to retain their \n     skills or gain new ones while still receiving benefits. This \n     was released on April 19th where the unemployment rate was \n     8.2% and now it is 7.7%. It's working, America.\n       Cannabis, or better known as marijuana has become a major \n     topic of discussion these days in America. Is it a medical \n     miracle or an addiction amongst many? The Office of National \n     Drug Control Policy and I have stated that we oppose the \n     legalization of marijuana and other drugs since legalization \n     would increase the availability and use of other illegal \n     drugs. Their legalization would bring more health and safety \n     risks closer to your homes. The legalization and selling of \n     marijuana could bring some positive to our attention. A \n     potential boost for the economy if it was sold and taxed \n     heavily. However in the end I strongly oppose the \n     legalization process and it should only remain available for \n     medical use only. The risks strongly outweigh the positives.\n       Over 50 years ago we created a strong, close relationship \n     with Israel. We have done joint military planning along with \n     military research and weapons development. We have \n     continuously assisted Israel with $3.1 billion in security \n     assistance and I will not be the president to stop that \n     trend. The only way for Israel to achieve peace with their \n     neighbors is to begin with a clear and strong commitment to \n     the security of Israel. They are also a big export consumer \n     to our economy. We must stand by our ally through these tough \n     times between them and the Palestinians. We will look to both \n     sides to find a common ground to install peace back into the \n     world between these rival nations. I am in support of \n     resumption of the aid to the Palestinian government with a \n     condition that the government renounce terrorism. Israel has \n     a right to defend themselves from these Palestinian rocket \n     attacks, but we will look to peace first in order to draw \n     this to an end. Israel is an important ally in all \n     perspectives. We must help them.\n       Thank you and good night America.\n\n       Allie Bull, Champlain Valley Union High School (Finalist)\n\n       The United States of America is known as the land of \n     profuse opportunity for all who come here. Throughout the \n     history of this country, there have been events to be proud \n     of and events that were not too glorious. As the world \n     prepares for the new year of 2013, it is a good idea to \n     reflect as we explore the state of this union, and gain \n     insight into how this country is running.\n       Congress is seemingly dysfunctional right now. The current \n     Congress has passed the least number of bills in history. \n     This statistic is shocking and embarrassing. The system of \n     checks and balances within our democracy is designed to \n     prevent an abuse of power. It is also a known fact that our \n     system takes longer to pass bills and get things done; \n     however, the current state of gridlock is not okay. The \n     nation is frustrated with the leaders and the lack of \n     compromise in Washington. Congress needs to become a leader \n     of the whole nation, and not individual leaders of each \n     political party. The wall between each party needs to be let \n     down and national issues need to be addressed. It is hard for \n     congressmen to make decisions that could affect reelection; \n     yet, the lack of progress being made is not making the \n     constituents any happier. It is better for these leaders to \n     leave the nation stronger and prosperous than when they \n     arrived, as opposed to an unchanged, struggling country.\n       In the shadow of the Sandy Hook Massacre, gun control \n     debates have resurfaced. This is a topic that needs to be \n     addressed, swiftly and promptly. Semi-automatic weapons are \n     completely and utterly unnecessary in the United States of \n     America. There is no reason that a person should need or \n     desire to own one. These weapons are killing machines and \n     should be banned. Americans have the right to bear arms, but \n     there is no need for weapons other than hunting weapons. Any \n     weapons that do remain legal in this country need to be \n     regulated and controlled with very thorough background \n     checks. However, the fact that semi-automatic weapons are \n     available isn't the only cause of these tragedies. Hollywood \n     portrays gun violence as exciting and desirable. That, in \n     combination with violent video games, leaves imprints in the \n     brains of impressionable young people (including the mentally \n     ill). Semi-automatic weapons should be banned, and violence \n     movies and games should be regulated. In this country there \n     is freedom of speech and expression, but the production of \n     these movies and games results in harm to other citizens. All \n     of these factors need to be addressed. Politicians who agree \n     with this stance need to step up and speak out despite the \n     possible damage to their reelection. The safety of the people \n     should be more important than reelection.\n       America is a bright and prosperous place. There are a few \n     issues dragging it down, but with the known strength of this \n     nation, these problems can be solved. The only way to fix big \n     problems is to lay down political barriers and work together, \n     hand-in-hand.\n\n       Emma Davitt, Champlain Valley Union High School (Finalist)\n\n       The current state of our Union is multifaceted, filled with \n     diverse opinions and numerous obstacles. Our Union faces an \n     interesting future ahead, either a prosperous and promising \n     future, or a destructive and deleterious future. It is up to \n     us, the people of the United States, to do everything we can \n     to ensure a brilliant future, to promise fortuitous and \n     successful lives for our succeeding generations.\n       We are currently coping with the most intense, severe \n     recession in our country since the Great Depression. 7.9% of \n     the people in the United States are out of work, struggling \n     to find jobs and earn a living. Detrimental taxes are \n     traumatizing families, college graduates' degrees are rarely \n     helping them secure jobs and, throughout these unfortunate \n     situations, many Americans are still focusing on abortions \n     and gay marriage rights. It is time for our nation to accept \n     individuality, embrace the freedom our country was founded \n     upon, and fix the major problems facing the people of the \n     United States of America.\n       The unemployment rate is uncomfortably high. In 2008, many \n     businesses closed, numerous workers were laid off and the \n     unemployment rate began to rise. As a result, jobs have \n     become more valuable, and at a time where few were \n     comfortable with their living situations and current bank \n     accounts, taxes rose. To address this situation, taxes must \n     be lowered for the lower and middle-class families while \n     returning the economy to a peaceful state, encouraging \n     businesses to grow and expand in the United States.\n       The economy is not only affecting the working class of our \n     nation, but also the children--the future. If children watch \n     their parents and older siblings with college degrees \n     struggle to find a job, what will make them want to go to \n     college? What will convince them that attending college is a \n     wonderful and beneficial experience? The young members of our \n     national community will one day be responsible for our \n     country and our only option to ensure a bright and promising \n     future is to nurture, teach and help this younger generation. \n     With this in mind, it should be of great importance to the \n     United States to make college education more affordable for \n     the young population. Through grants, aid and scholarships, \n     many more students will have the opportunities to attend \n     universities, and with an economy on the mend, we can look to \n     the future with great hope in the highly educated body that \n     will one day run the country.\n       Contemplating these issues, our Union has a lot to focus \n     on. We have run ourselves into a deep economic and \n     educational rut and it is our job to work together to climb \n     out of\n\n[[Page S704]]\n\n     it. The future of our country rests solely in the hands of \n     the upcoming generation, however, how can we have faith in \n     the subsequent decades if our current society struggles to \n     find jobs and attend college? The answer is rather simple, \n     the young people of our country have the chance to make \n     groundbreaking decisions and be amazing leaders, if given the \n     opportunities.\n\n       Taryn Druge, Champlain Valley Union High School (Finalist)\n\n       In an idealistic world we would work for a common good. \n     Countries wouldn't consider money, land, or rivalry. They \n     would only see how they could create peace and maintain it. \n     As Franklin D. Roosevelt said, ``A point has been reached \n     where the peoples of the Americas must take cognizance of \n     growing ill-will, of marked trends toward aggression, of \n     increasing armaments, of shortening tempers--a situation \n     which has in it many of the elements that lead to the tragedy \n     of general war . . . Peace is threatened by those who seek \n     selfish power.'' It is my opinion that, in this world, we are \n     not driven by the ambition for peace but instead by the \n     ambition for wealth and power. We, the U.S., are no \n     different, as much as we would love to believe otherwise and \n     see ourselves as the peace bearers of the world. We must open \n     our eyes to the truth. Wealth and power must be relevant in \n     our dealings with foreign nations because these are some of \n     the only factors that will drive negotiation.\n       An example of the struggle for wealth and power is the \n     United States relationship with China. Currently, the U.S. is \n     deeply uneasy about China, to whom we are deeply indebted, \n     for they are our greatest supplier of goods. It is \n     frightening to think that China's withdrawal could destroy \n     our entire economy, yet our withdrawal from China would \n     cripple them as well. Instead of the dependence creating \n     unity among our nations, it has created discomfort and \n     hostility. The power complex each country has creates the \n     belief that dependence upon one another weakens us. When \n     Thomas Jefferson said, ``Dependence begets subservience and \n     venality, suffocates the germ of virtue, and prepares fit \n     tools for the designs of ambition,'' Jefferson could never \n     foresee that U.S. dependence would extend overseas due to our \n     economies' desire to manufacture cheaper and thus more \n     profitable products.\n       China and the U.S are two great superpowers, and each is \n     just as self-destructive as the other. Without a strong and \n     desirable alliance with China, the U.S. becomes weakened to \n     possible foreign attacks and a collapse of the economy. The \n     U.S. is feeling out of balance right now: so many goods are \n     being manufactured overseas at the expense of U.S. jobs being \n     taken away. This balance could be found when the U.S comes to \n     the realization that we cannot completely isolate China, and, \n     at the same time, we must create a political environment that \n     nurtures U.S. businesses that manufacture products \n     domestically.\n       In an ideal world the bonds and alliances of countries \n     would surpass the separation of race, religion, class and \n     culture.

Technical Sergeant Grutter was awarded the Bronze Medal Star \nwith Valor and the Purple Heart, and I honor him for the courageous \nactions he took to earn these awards.\n  In 2008, Technical Sergeant Grutter was assigned as a security \nofficer for the Defense Intelligence Support Office-Afghanistan. On \nMarch 20, 2008, while driving a convoy vehicle for the Guard, Technical \nSergeant Grutter twice risked his own life to thwart enemy ambushes and \nsave the lives of others.\n  In the first instance, Technical Sergeant Grutter used his own \nvehicle as a shield to protect Afghan National Police officers driving \nan unarmored vehicle. Then, noticing the Afghan National Police's \nmachine gun crew in distress, he dismounted from his own vehicle, ran \nthrough intense fire, and helped the police repair their weapons.\n  While Technical Sergeant Grutter was working with the machine gun \ncrew, enemy insurgents moved in to flank the convoy and began to \nprepare an attack. With great bravery, Sergeant Grutter ran \napproximately 200 meters over exposed terrain to engage the insurgents, \nwhich forced them to retreat. Shortly thereafter, the enemy disengaged \nand left the area.\n  Unfortunately, a second ambush was already in the making. A large \nnumber of civilians became trapped by small arms fire from enemy \nforces. Without regard for his personal safety, Technical Sergeant \nGrutter provided suppressing fire from an exposed position, which \nallowed the Afghan National Police to evacuate the civilians to safety.\n  As a result of the courageous actions taken by Technical Sergeant \nGrutter, lives were saved and the convoy continued its mission.\n  I thank Technical Sergeant Grutter for his brave actions and honor \nhis distinguished service and meritorious achievement in earning the \nBronze Medal Star with Valor and the Purple Heart. The courage he \ndemonstrated during his combat mission brings great honor to our \ncountry, the Air National Guard and the state of Rhode Island.\n  Along with his fellow Guardsmen, I thank Technical Sergeant Grutter \nfor his outstanding commitment to serving and protecting our country. \nWe in Rhode Island are lucky to call him one of our own, and we are \nproud of him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/13/senate-section/article/S704-2", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S704]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/13/senate-section/article/S704-3", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S704]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the presiding officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/13/senate-section/article/S704-4", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S704-S705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SIX-MONTH PERIODIC REPORT ON THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO \nLIBYA THAT WAS ORIGINALLY DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13566 OF FEBRUARY \n                             25, 2011--PM 3\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nwithin 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the \nPresident publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have \nsent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice \nstating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13566 \nof February 25, 2011, is to continue in effect beyond February 25, \n2013.\n  Colonel Muammar Qadhafi, his government, and close associates took \nextreme measures against the people of Libya, including by using \nweapons of war, mercenaries, and wanton violence against unarmed \ncivilians. In addition, there was a serious risk that Libyan state \nassets would be misappropriated by Qadhafi, members of his government, \nmembers of his family, or his close associates if those assets were not \nprotected. The foregoing circumstances, the prolonged attacks, and the \nincreased numbers of Libyans seeking refuge in other countries caused a \ndeterioration in the security of Libya, posed a serious risk to its \nstability, and led me to declare a national emergency to deal with this \nthreat to the national security and foreign policy of the United \nStates.\n  We are in the process of winding down the sanctions in response to \ndevelopments in Libya, including the fall of Qadhafi and his government \nand the establishment of a democratically elected government. We are \nworking closely with the new Libyan government and with the \ninternational community to effectively and appropriately ease \nrestrictions on sanctioned entities, including by taking actions \nconsistent with the U.N. Security Council's decision to lift sanctions \nagainst the Central Bank of Libya and two other entities on December \n16, 2011. The situation in Libya, however, continues to pose an unusual \nand extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of \nthe United States and we need to protect against this threat and the \ndiversion of assets or other abuse by certain members of Qadhafi's \nfamily and other former regime officials. Therefore, I have determined \nthat it is necessary to continue\n\n[[Page S705]]\n\nthe national emergency with respect to Libya.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, February 13, 2013.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/13/senate-section/article/S705-1", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:57 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 235.

A bill to reduce housing-related health hazards, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am introducing two bipartisan bills \npertaining to healthy housing, the Healthy Housing Council Act and the \nTitle X Amendments Act. These bills seek to improve federal \ncoordination of healthy housing efforts and better integrate healthy \nhousing activities into the ongoing lead poisoning prevention work at \nthe Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n  The presence of housing-related health hazards is often overlooked or \nis unable to be addressed, and yet these hazards are sometimes the \ncause of a variety of preventable diseases and conditions like cancer, \nlead poisoning, and asthma. While I have been working to address these \nhazards throughout my tenure in Congress, I was pleased that the \nAdministration last week released its Strategy for Action to Advance \nHealthy Housing, a multi-department and agency effort to develop \nconsensus-based criteria to address housing hazards that impact the \nhealth and habitation of children and families.\n  This new Strategy for Action calls on Federal agencies to address \nbarriers and disincentives to the delivery of services to improve \nhousing conditions, particularly among low-income families with young \nchildren; replicate successful local healthy housing programs on a \nlarger scale; and conduct more research into cost-effective advances in \nhealthy housing programming.\n  The Title X Amendments Act, S. 290, which I am introducing with \nSenators Johanns, Franken, and Boxer, and has been in the drafting \nstages for many months, responds to these calls for action. It would \nprovide HUD with the necessary authority to continue to carry out \nhealthy housing activities while protecting important ongoing lead \nremediation efforts, allow grantees to improve the conditions in zero-\nbedroom units, and streamline eligibility for assistance. These are \nsimple, yet necessary reforms designed to improve and expand cost-\neffective services, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nsee them enacted.\n  It is also vital that we continue the type of collaboration and \ncoordination among Federal departments and agencies, like HUD, HHS, \nEPA, and CDC, that resulted in the Strategy for Action to Advance \nHealthy Homes. Indeed, there are many programs fragmented across \nmultiple agencies that are responsible for addressing housing-related \nhealth hazards like lead and radon, and we should strive to improve the \nefficiency and efficacy of these efforts by ensuring that these \nagencies continue to work together.\n  The Healthy Housing Council Act, S. 291, which Senator Johanns, \nFranken, and Boxer have also cosponsored, would establish an \nindependent interagency Council on Healthy Housing in the executive \nbranch in order to improve coordination, bring existing efforts out of \ntheir respective silos, and reduce duplication.\n  The bill calls for the council to convene periodic meetings with \nexperts in the public and private sectors to discuss ways to educate \nindividuals and families on how to recognize housing-related health \nhazards and access the necessary services and preventive measures to \ncombat these hazards. The council would also be required to hold \nbiannual stakeholder meetings, maintain an updated website, and work to \nunify healthy housing data collection and maintenance.\n  Our goal for these bills is to help reduce the more than 5.7 million \nhouseholds living in conditions with moderate or severe health hazards, \n23 million additional homes with lead-based paint hazards, 14,000 \nunintentional injury and fire deaths every year that result from \nhousing-related hazards, and 21,000 radon-associated lung cancer deaths \nevery year. Indeed, these numbers contribute to increasing health care \ncosts for individuals and families, as well as for federal, state, and \nlocal governments.\n  Promoting low-cost measures to eliminate subpar housing can make a \ndramatic and meaningful difference in the lives of children and \nfamilies and help reduce health care costs. I urge our colleagues to \njoin in supporting these bipartisan bills.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Schumer, Ms. \n        Klobuchar, Mr. Blumenthal, and Ms. Baldwin):\n  S. 296. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \neliminate discrimination in the immigration laws by permitting \npermanent partners of United States citizens and lawful permanent \nresidents to obtain lawful permanent resident status in the same manner \nas spouses of citizens and lawful permanent residents and to penalize \nimmigration fraud in connection with permanent partnerships; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Uniting \nAmerican Families Act, UAFA, which grants same-sex bi-national couples \nthe same immigration benefits heterosexual couples have long enjoyed. \nThis is the sixth Congress in which I have introduced this legislation, \nand I am proud to be joined this year by Senator Collins, a strong \nchampion for American families. She cosponsored this bill last \nCongress, and I thank her for her leadership as she joins me as an \noriginal cosponsor today.\n  Preserving family unity is central to our immigration policy. \nPresident Obama understands that, which is why I was so pleased to see \nthat he included UAFA as a core tenet of the immigration principles he \noutlined last month.\n  Even as American attitudes are changing about the civil rights of gay \nand lesbian Americans, the so-called Defense of Marriage Act forces \nmany Americans to choose between the country they love and being with \nthe people they love. This destructive policy tears families apart and \nforces hardworking Americans to make the heart-wrenching choice no \nAmerican should have to make. Families from Maine to California \nexperience this hardship. In Vermont, I have seen firsthand the \nunfairness that couples have endured as a result of our current laws \nand have spoken at length on their struggles in this Chamber. I have \nheard from a number of Vermonters who have had to make the difficult \ndecision to leave their work and homes in Vermont in order to be able \nto live with their spouses in more welcoming countries; some whole \nspouses are legally in the U.S. temporarily but worry daily when they \nwill be required to leave the U.S.; and some who suffer the heartbreak \nof a long-distance marriage when their spouses are denied even a \nvisitor visa to spend some time with their spouses in the U.S. The \nSenate Judiciary Committee heard directly from families like these as \nwell.\n  Over the past decade, Americans have begun to reject the notion that \nU.S. citizens who are gay or lesbian should not have their committed \nrelationships recognized by the law and the protections that provides. \nAs of last month, the District of Columbia and nine states, including \nConnecticut, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New \nYork, Washington, and my home state of Vermont, have legalized same-sex \nmarriage. At the end of the 111th Congress, bipartisan votes in both \nthe Senate and the House reversed the Military's ``Don't Ask, Don't \nTell'' policy, a 17-year-old stricture that barred gay and lesbian \nservice men and women from openly serving in the military. Consistent \nwith the repeal of the ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' policy, just last week \nthe Pentagon signaled that it will begin providing benefits to the \nsame-sex spouses of military personnel. As they have many times in our \npast and will continue in the future, prevailing American attitudes are \nprogressing toward fairness and justice. The Supreme Court is poised to \ndecide the fate of the Defense of Marriage Act and whether that law, \nwhich deprives same-sex couples of over 1,000 Federal benefits and \nresponsibilities, is consistent with our constitutional values.\n\n[[Page S710]]\n\n  Many of our friends around the world have embraced immigration \nequality for same-sex families. Today at least 25 nations, including \nsome of our closest allies, offer immigration benefits to same-sex \ncouples. America should join Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, \nCanada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, \nGreenland, Hungary, Iceland, Israel, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, New \nZealand, Norway, Portugal, Romania, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, \nSwitzerland, and the United Kingdom in leading on this issue of civil \nrights and respect for the dignity of all families. I hope that \nSenators who supported this important advancement in our military \npolicy will join me in calling for similar fairness and equality in our \nimmigration laws.\n  Some opponents of the United American Families Act have argued that \nit would increase the potential for visa fraud. Of course I share the \nbelief that all immigration applications should be screened for fraud, \nbut I am confident that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services will \nhave no more difficulty identifying fraud in same-sex relationships \nthan they do in heterosexual marriages. The penalties for fraud under \nthis bill would be the same as the penalties for marriage fraud. These \nare very strict penalties: a sentence of up to 5 years in prison, \n$250,000 in fines for the U.S. citizen partner, and deportation for the \nforeign partner. In addition, in order to qualify as a bi-national \ncouple under UAFA, petitioners must prove that they are at least 18 \nyears of age and in a committed, lifelong relationship with another \nadult. The advancement of American ideals that respect human \nrelationships and family bonds need not and should not be impeded by \nsuch fears.\n  Among developed countries with cultures of respect for human rights \nand fairness, the United States policy in this regard is not living up \nto our great traditions of equal treatment under the law. We can and \nshould do better. I hope all Senators will agree that the United States \nshould not have a policy that forces Americans to choose between their \ncountry and the ones they love, and I urge members of this body to join \nSenator Collins and me in this effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 296\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nentitled the Lower Mississippi River National Historic Site Study Act. \nThis bill will direct the Secretary of the Interior to study the \nsuitability and feasibility of designating sites in Plaquemines Parish \nalong the Lower Mississippi River Area as units of the National Park \nSystem. I know there are several of my colleagues across the aisle that \ndo not want to authorize such studies because they only target one \narea, or because it potentially will cost the Federal Government a \nmodest amount to conduct such a study. I can appreciate those \nsentiments, but the good news with this particular study, is that the \nlocal government feels this is so important to get done, they are \nwilling to pay for all or some of the study if necessary, because they \nknow these sites deserve Federal recognition as a unit of the National \nPark Service.\n  This area in Southeastern Louisiana has contributed much to our \nNation's history, and there are many stories that have yet to be \npreserved for future generations. Unless Congress acts to preserve \nthese historical assets, they will be lost forever. That is why I am \nagain for the fourth time, introducing this legislation. It is \nimportant that this legislation become law and I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to enact it.\n  In order to be designated as a unit in the National Park System, the \nDepartment of the Interior must first conduct a special resources study \nto determine whether an area possesses nationally significant natural, \ncultural or recreational resources to be eligible for favorable \nconsideration.\n  This is exactly what my bill does--it asks the Department of the \nInterior to take the first step in determining what I already know--\nthat the Lower Mississippi River Area would be a suitable and feasible \nasset to the National Park Service.\n  As many from Louisiana are already aware, this area has vast \nhistorical significance with cultural history. In the 1500s, Spanish \nexplorers traveled along the banks of the river. In 1682, Robert de \nLaSalle claimed all the land drained by the area. In 1699, the site of \nthe first fortification on the Lower Mississippi river, known as Fort \nMississippi. Since then, it has been home to ten different \nfortifications, including Fort St. Phillip and Fort Jackson.\n  Fort St. Philip, which was originally built in 1749, played a key \nrole during the Battle of New Orleans when American soldiers blocked \nthe British Navy from going upriver. Fort Jackson was built at the \nrequest of General Andrew Jackson and partially constructed by famous \nlocal Civil War General, P.G.T. Beauregard. This fort was the site of \nthe famous Civil War battle known as the ``Battle of Forts'' which is \nalso referred to as the ``night the war was lost.'' As you can see, \nfrom a historical perspective, this area has many treasures that \nprovide a glimpse into our past. These are treasures that have national \nsignificance and they should be maintained and preserved.\n  In addition, there are many other important and unique attributes to \nthis area. This area is home to the longest continuous river road and \nlevee system in the U.S. It is also home to the ancient Head of Passes \nsite, to the Plaquemines Bend, and to two National Wildlife Refuges.\n  Finally, this area has a rich cultural heritage. Over the years, many \ndifferent cultures have made this area home, including Creoles, \nEuropeans, Indians, Yugoslavs, African-Americans and Vietnamese. These \ncultures have worked together to create the infrastructure for the \ntransport of our Nation's energy, which is being produced by these same \npeople off our shores in the Gulf of Mexico. They have also created a \nvibrant fishing industry that contributes to Louisiana's economy.\n\n[[Page S713]]\n\n  I think it is easy to see why this area would make an excellent \naddition to the National Park Service. However, the longer Congress \ntakes to act, the greater the opportunity for these treasures and their \nrich history to erode away. Unfortunately, this area has weathered the \npassing of several hurricanes, including Katrina and most recently \nIsaac, and is now suffering from the impacts of the BP oil spill. All \nof these events threaten to destroy these historical assets, but this \nneed not be the case. These assets need protection and this is the \nfirst step in securing it. That is why I am re-introducing this bill--\nto conduct a study to determine the suitability and feasibility of \nincluding this area in the system and ultimately to begin the process \nof adding this area as a unit of the National Park Service. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to quickly enact this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JOHANNS (for himself and Mrs. Fischer):\n  S. 317. A bill to require the Inspector General of the Environmental \nProtection Agency to include certain assessments in reports; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss changes needed at \nthe Environmental Protection Agency to rebuild public trust and \ntransparency.\n  The reviews of this agency are almost unanimous from my constituents \nin Nebraska. Quite frankly, my constituents are frustrated, and \nsometimes just plain angry. While the details and specific issues will \nvary from one industry to another, the theme seems to always be the \nsame: Nebraskans think EPA doesn't understand domestic businesses, nor \ndo they understand job creation--from specific industries, to their \nemployees, to their customers. They think the agency is not \ntransparent, is arrogant, and oftentimes unresponsive. I hear this from \nag producers, I hear it from the construction industry, I hear it from \nelectricity providers, I hear it from city managers and mayors.\n  Do you know what else. These folks don't speak with an R or a D \nbeside their name but, rather, an A for American. Their message is \nloud, it is very clear, and it is unmistakable: EPA is overreaching, \noverbearing, and overstepping boundaries that have long existed. The \nrequest is always the same. They ask: Senator, what can you do? What \ncan you do to change how they act?\n  Nebraskans' frustration is driven by both what EPA is trying to do--\nmeaning the content of their rules and standards--as well as how the \nagency is making its decisions. So today I will be introducing several \nproposals to address these two areas.\n  My first proposal addresses how EPA conducts business by increasing \ntransparency in policy decisions. I am introducing a bill that brings \nagency guidance documents under the coverage of the Congressional \nReview Act. As currently written, the CRA covers only substantial \nagency rules. Meanwhile, EPA has made use of what they call guidance \ndocuments to simply circumvent the accountability that comes with the \nrulemaking process, while still making major policy changes. Using \nguidance documents also shields the policy change from being reversed \nby Congress under the Congressional Review Act.\n  Perhaps, though, the most obvious example was the use of a guidance \ndocument to expand the regulatory reach of EPA and the Corps of \nEngineers over bodies of water not currently covered. They did this by \nexpanding the definition of ``waters of the United States'' under the \nClean Water Act. The changes are extremely controversial, so the \nagencies chose a path that intentionally minimized oversight and legal \nresponsibility. In other words, they did an end-run around us--they did \nan end-run around the American people and Congress.\n  My bill closes this loophole by ensuring that guidance documents are \ncovered by the Congressional Review Act just as similar regulations \nwould be.\n  Senators Barrasso, Grassley, Paul, Coats, and Fischer have agreed to \ncosponsor this commonsense change, and I want to say thank you to them \nfor this critical support.\n  The idea behind this is simple and straightforward: Major policy \nchanges pursued through the use of guidance documents need to come \nhere. They need to have our scrutiny, the scrutiny of the public, and \nthe congressional oversight rules need to apply. It is that \nstraightforward.\n  My second proposal likewise promotes transparency by addressing how \nthe agency responds to our States. It says simply this: If a State is \ndeveloping its plan to implement a rule or a standard established by \nthe EPA under the Clean Air Act, any reasonable request that a State \nmakes to the agency for technical support, data, or modeling must be \nhonored.\n  Here is why this is important: State governments are equal partners \nin much of the work the EPA does. That is the law. In fact, the law \nspecifically recognizes the prominent role States have. Section 101 of \nthe Clean Air Act, for example, notes that:\n\n       . . . air pollution control at its source is the primary \n     responsibility of States and local governments.\n\n  The law further declares that its purpose is, in part:\n\n       . . . to provide technical and financial assistance to \n     State and local governments in connection with the \n     development and execution of their air pollution prevention \n     and control programs.\n\n  Also, section 101 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act \ndeclares:\n\n       It is the policy of the Congress to recognize, preserve, \n     and protect the primary responsibilities and rights of States \n     to prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution . . .\n\n  Unfortunately, the EPA is not honoring that language--although it is \nabundantly clear--and is instead treating State agencies as second-\nclass citizens. For evidence of this, we need look no farther than the \ntext of a recent court opinion.\n  In a case last year involving the Clean Air Act, the DC Circuit Court \nof Appeals ultimately struck down an EPA rule known as the Cross-State \nAir Pollution Rule or the transport rule. Here is what the court said:\n\n       (t)he Federal Government sets air quality standards for \n     pollutants. The States have the primary responsibility for \n     determining how to meet those standards and regulating \n     sources within their borders.\n\n  Well, the trouble, according to the opinion, is that the EPA ignored \nthe law. That is truly what the court ruled: EPA snubbed their nose at \nus, Congress, and therefore the law. It did not give the States the \ntime needed to develop a plan to meet the standards. Instead, EPA tried \nto force-feed States the implementation plan EPA developed.\n  I can say with some certainty that my home State of Nebraska is much \nbetter off when allowed to develop a plan tailored to our State, rather \nthan to accept a ``one size fits all,'' ``my way or the highway,'' \noverreaching Federal plan.\n  The court explained it this way:\n\n       . . . (t)he Clean Air Act affords States the initial \n     opportunity to implement reductions required by EPA under the \n     good neighbor provision. But here, where EPA quantified \n     States' good neighbor obligations, it did not allow the \n     States the initial opportunity to implement the required \n     reductions with respect to sources within their borders.\n\n  The court's conclusion in turn was absolutely and abundantly clear:\n\n       . . . EPA's Transport Rule violates federal law. Therefore, \n     the rule must be vacated.\n\n  That is the holding of the court.\n  My bill targets the relationship between EPA and the States, and \ntakes steps to restore the equal footing that has been eroded over the \npast several years by the EPA. My bill says, very simply, if a State \nhas a question about the data or the modeling driving a standard, the \nEPA cannot shut them out or slow-walk their request. They have to be \nresponsive. So no more hiding the ball, as the saying goes, just simple \ntransparency and a true partner working relationship.\n  The third good government bill I am introducing addresses broad \nfrustration with what I would call the EPA bombshells. By that I mean \nthe agency's failure to obey current law directing them to publish \nregulatory agendas. This is remarkable. It is remarkable that EPA \ncontinues to struggle with telling the public what rules are coming. \nBut they do.\n  As a child, I always enjoyed birthday parties and all the surprises. \nBut EPA regulations are no party for people, and they shouldn't come as \na surprise.\n  Well, it turns out that several executive orders and existing \nstatutes instruct EPA to tell the public what exactly is on its \nregulatory agenda. Section 602 of the Regulatory Flexibility\n\n[[Page S714]]\n\nAct, for example, requires the agencies to publish:\n\n       During the months of October and April of each year . . . a \n     regulatory flexibility agenda which shall contain a brief \n     description of the subject area of any rule which the agency \n     expects to propose . . .\n\n  Also, Executive Order 12866 requires the EPA to update its regulatory \nagenda twice a year.\n  These updates are supposed to be published in a document known as the \nUnified Agenda. It seems clear to me; unfortunately, not clear to EPA. \nEPA has ignored these requirements. It failed to publish an agenda in \nthe spring of 2012, it published nothing in October, and then waited \nuntil December 2012 to publish anything at all. That is not acceptable. \nThe administration simply played hide-the-ball until after the \nelection.\n  My bill instructs the EPA Office of Inspector General--known as EPA's \nOIG--to assess whether EPA obeys the law and publishes its regulatory \nagenda according to deadlines. The OIG is tasked with reviewing what \nEPA does and reporting on problems, abuses, and efficiencies. My \nlegislation simply directs the OIG to include in its reports a tally of \nwhether EPA has met its legal requirements to publish planned \nregulations.\n  My point here is that EPA simply needs to meet its legal \nrequirements. It needs to be transparent, which means simply to be \nhonest with the American people about new regulations it is planning.\n  My fourth and final EPA bill puts some teeth behind my request that \nthe agency deal with the American people in an honest way. It shouldn't \nbe needed, but it is. It simply says we will reduce EPA's budget if the \nagency fails to meet its legal deadlines for regulatory agenda setting. \nIf a deadline passes and the agency has not published its agenda, then \nthe Office of the Administrator loses $20,000 per week until the \ndeadline is met. If this approach sounds familiar, that is because this \nbill is modeled after a provision in the highway bill that passed with \nsubstantial bipartisan margins in both the Senate and the House last \nyear. Section 1306 of the highway bill authorizes the rescission of \n$20,000 per week from agencies that fail to complete documents required \nby transportation projects. The rationale is straightforward and \naccepted by Congress: If an agency does not complete its work according \nto reasonable schedules, then the budget gets decreased.\n  I have outlined four commonsense solutions designed to respond to \nreasonable concerns of real people and to respond to their heartfelt \nfrustration with this agency. But, above all, they promote transparency \nand they promote responsible government.\n  I urge my colleagues to assist and cosponsor these proposals that \nbring transparency and a dose of reality to an out-of-control Federal \nagency.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Cochran):\n  S. 323. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for extended months of Medicare coverage of immunosuppressive \ndrugs for kidney transplant patients and other renal dialysis \nprovisions; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Comprehensive \nImmunosuppressive Drug Coverage for Kidney Transplant Patients Act with \nmy colleague Senator Thad Cochran.\n  More than 26 million American adults are living with chronic kidney \ndisease. Fortunately, many of these individuals are able to improve \ntheir condition through medication and lifestyle change.\n  But more than half of a million Americans live with irreversible \nkidney failure or end-stage renal disease. They have only two choices \nto survive--both of them hard. They can receive regular and frequent \ndialysis or they can receive a kidney transplant.\n  In 1972, Congress made a commitment to individuals with end-stage \nrenal disease, or ERSD, to cover the treatment they needed, including \npossible transplants, under Medicare, regardless of their age.\n  Organ transplantation is a medical success story. Thousands of kidney \ntransplants are done every year, and for the patients fortunate enough \nto receive a donated organ, the quality and length of their lives can \nbe dramatically improved.\n  But not everyone who needs a donated kidney receives one. There are \ncurrently more than 100,000 Americans on the waiting list for a kidney \ntransplant.\n  Last year, 15,000 transplants were performed while more than 30,000 \npeople were added to that waitlist.\n  Derek Haney is one of the lucky ones who beat those odds and received \na kidney transplant.\n  Derek is a brave young man raised in Effingham, IL, a small city in \ncentral Illinois.\n  In 2008 the unexpected happened. Derek became chronically ill. After \nregular trips to the hospital, Derek's doctors discovered that his \nkidneys were only functioning at 10 percent. At the age of 23, Derek \nwas diagnosed with end stage renal disease.\n  For the next two and a half years of his life, Derek underwent \ndialysis. Three times a week he would go in a 4-hour dialysis \ntreatment, while he waited for a kidney. The dialysis treatments meant \nthat Derek had to put his college plans on hold, but he continued to \nwork full-time and never gave up hope.\n  On July 15, 2010, Derek got his new kidney.\n  Two and a half years later, Derek is still healthy. He is pursuing a \ndegree in business administration at a local community college. He \nhopes to transfer soon to a university where he can work toward a CPA \nlicense.\n  Fortunate1y for Derek and his family, Medicare covered the expense of \ndialysis--more than $75,000 a year for 2\\1/2\\ years. Medicare also paid \nfor Derek's kidney transplant at a cost of about $110,000.\n  For the last two and a half years, Medicare has covered the expensive \nimmunosuppressive medication Derek must take for the rest of his life \nto ensure that his body doesn't reject his new kidney.\n  Here's the problem: Derek's Medicare coverage runs out in July.\n  Without Medicare coverage, Derek will be burdened with prescription \ndrug costs of roughly $1500 per month--more than he and almost any \nfamily could afford.\n  There is an unfair and unrealistic gap in coverage for people with \nend stage renal disease who, like Derek, are neither elderly nor \ndisabled.\n  For those transplant recipients, Medicare coverage, including \ncoverage of immunosuppressive drugs, ends 36 months after \ntransplantation.\n  If only the need to continue the immunosuppressive drugs also ended \n36 months after transplantation. But it doesn't.\n  Without immunosuppressive drugs to prevent rejection, many patients \nfind themselves back in a risky and frightening place--in need of a new \nkidney.\n  A recent New England Journal of Medicine report estimates that \nextending immunosuppressive drug coverage to people who now lose it \nafter 36 months will save Medicare approximately $200 million a year by \nhelping to prevent kidney rejections.\n  Extending immunosuppressive drug coverage saves lives and it saves \nmoney.\n  Sadly, Derek isn't alone. It is estimated that over 45,000 successful \ntransplant recipients are at risk of losing their immunosuppressive \ndrug coverage.\n  This makes no sense morally, medically or economically.\n  I am pleased to join my Republican colleague, Senator Cochran, in \nintroducing the Comprehensive Immunosuppressive Drug Coverage for \nKidney Transplant Patients Act.\n  This bipartisan legislation would allow kidney transplant recipients \nto continue Medicare coverage for the purpose of immunosuppressive \ndrugs only. All other Medicare coverage would end 36 months after the \ntransplant.\n  Our legislation will reduce the need for dialysis and repeated kidney \ntransplants. It will provide reliable, sustained access to critically \nimportant, life-saving medications for thousands of Americans.\n  In both moral and economic terms, this is the right decision and I \nurge our colleagues to join us in passing this reasonable, targeted, \nlifesaving bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S715]]\n\n                                 S. 323\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 31\n\n       Whereas, in 1776, the United States of America was \n     imagined, as stated in the Declaration of Independence, as a \n     new nation dedicated to the proposition that ``all men are \n     created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with \n     certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, \n     liberty, and the pursuit of happiness'';\n       Whereas, on November 19, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln, \n     in reference to the Declaration of Independence, stated, \n     ``Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth, \n     upon this continent, a new nation, conceived in liberty, and \n     dedicated to the proposition that all men are created \n     equal.'';\n       Whereas the history of the United States includes \n     injustices and the denial of basic, fundamental rights at \n     odds with the words of the founders of the United States and \n     the sacrifices commemorated at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania;\n       Whereas the injustices committed in the United States \n     include approximately 250 years of slavery, 100 years of \n     lynchings, denial of both fundamental human and civil rights, \n     and withholding of the basic rights of citizenship;\n       Whereas inequalities and injustices in our society still \n     exist today;\n       Whereas Sojourner Truth, Frederick Douglass, Harriet \n     Tubman, W.E.B. Dubois, Booker T. Washington, Charles Hamilton \n     Houston, the Tuskegee Airmen, Lena Horne, Ralph Bunche, \n     Jackie Robinson, Constance Baker Motley, James Baldwin, \n     Dorothy Height, Thurgood Marshall, and Shirley Chisholm each \n     lived a life of incandescent greatness while many African \n     Americans lived, toiled, and died in obscurity, never \n     achieving the recognition they deserved, but paved the way \n     for future generations to succeed;\n       Whereas many African-American men and women worked against \n     racism to achieve success, such as James Beckwourth, Bill \n     Pickett, Colonel Allen Allensworth, Clara Brown, and many \n     others who were pivotal in the exploration and westward \n     expansion of the United States;\n       Whereas pioneers such as David Dinkins, Mae Jemison, Arthur \n     Ashe, Oprah Winfrey, James Earl Jones, Clarence Thomas, \n     Ursula Burns, Alice Walker, Ronald Brown, Alexis Herman, \n     Kenneth Chenault, and Magic Johnson have all served as \n     positive beneficiaries of our forefathers and as great role \n     models and leaders for future generations;\n       Whereas, on November 4, 2008, and again on November 6, \n     2012, the people of the United States elected an African-\n     American man, Barack Obama, as President of the United \n     States, and African Americans continue to serve the United \n     States at the highest levels of the government and Armed \n     Forces;\n       Whereas Carter G. Woodson, the ``Father of Black History'', \n     stated, ``We have a wonderful history behind us. . . .  If \n     you are unable to demonstrate to the world that you have this \n     record, the world will say to you, `You are not worthy to \n     enjoy the blessings of democracy or anything else.' '';\n       Whereas Black History Month, celebrated during the month of \n     February, dates back to 1926 when Carter G. Woodson set aside \n     a special period of time in February to recognize the \n     heritage and achievement of black Americans;\n       Whereas, on February 22, 2012, President Barack Obama and \n     First Lady Michelle Obama, along with former First Lady Laura \n     Bush, celebrated the groundbreaking of the National Museum of \n     African American History and Culture on the National Mall in \n     Washington, D.C.;\n       Whereas Hiram Rhodes Revels, Blanche Kelso Bruce, Edward \n     William Brooke, Carol Moseley Braun, Barack Obama, and Roland \n     Burris have all served as African-American firsts in the \n     exclusive body known as the United States Senate; and\n       Whereas, on January 2, 2013, Tim Scott became the first \n     African American to serve as Senator of South Carolina, and \n     on February 7, 2013, William ``Mo'' Cowan became the first \n     African American to represent Massachusetts in the Senate \n     since 1978: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) acknowledges that all of the people of the United \n     States are the recipients of the wealth of history given to \n     us by black culture;\n       (2) recognizes the importance of Black History Month as an \n     opportunity to reflect on the complex history of the United \n     States, while remaining hopeful and confident about the path \n     that lies ahead;\n       (3) acknowledges the significance of Black History Month as \n     an important opportunity to recognize the tremendous \n     contributions of African Americans to the history of the \n     United States;\n       (4) encourages the celebration of Black History Month to \n     provide a continuing opportunity for all people in the United \n     States to learn from the past and to understand the \n     experiences that have shaped the United States;\n       (5) remembers the injustices that African Americans have \n     endured and commends the African-American community for \n     overcoming those injustices and changing the course and \n     nature of history by forging the fight for equality; and\n       (6) agrees that while the United States began in division, \n     the United States must now move forward with purpose, united \n     tirelessly as one Nation, indivisible, with liberty and \n     justice for all, and honor the contribution of all pioneers \n     who help ensure the legacy of these great United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/02/13/senate-section/article/S716-2", "month": "02", "year": "2013", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S716-S717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 32--CONGRATULATING THE NORTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY \n    FOOTBALL TEAM FOR WINNING THE 2012 NATIONAL COLLEGIATE ATHLETIC \n     ASSOCIATION DIVISION I FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP SUBDIVISION TITLE\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN (for himself and Ms. Heitkamp) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.
