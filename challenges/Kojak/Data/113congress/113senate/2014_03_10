It has been reported that a number of our colleagues in \nthe Democratic majority in the Senate intend to speak on the Senate \nfloor tonight on the question of climate change. Sometimes they will \nsay ``global warming,'' and I guess that is ceasing to be the No. 1 \nphrase now.\n  An article in the USA Today said this ``effort is cause for some \nconfusion because these Senators are calling for action in a chamber \nthey control but without any specific legislation to offer up for a \nvote.''\n  No legislation--this is, indeed, confusing. Why wouldn't the majority \nleader bring a bill to the floor of the Senate to expressly approve \nPresident Obama's climate agenda or to approve his rigorous regulations \nthat constrict Americans with it.\n  Why not? The answer is it wouldn't pass. The American people do not \nsupport this and neither does Congress. A lot of his Democratic \ncolleagues, I would suggest, don't want to vote on it. It raises a lot \nof questions about what the deal is and what we need to do as a Nation \nto handle pollution, carbon dioxide, climate change, and how we need to \ndeal with it and how we should think about it. There was an article in \ntoday's Washington Times by Mr. William C. Triplett II that points out \nthe following:\n\n\n[[Page S1372]]\n\n\n       In mid-February, billionaire and major Democratic National \n     Committee donor Tom Steyer held a dinner at his palatial San \n     Francisco home for 70 of his closest friends. Former Vice \n     President Al Gore was the headliner, and in attendance were \n     Democratic Senators Harry Reid. . .\n\n  The Democratic Senate leader and four other Senators were present.\n  He has pledged to give $50 million to a campaign to defeat, mainly, \nRepublicans because they don't agree with his global warming agenda.\n  Mr. Triplett says:\n\n       What has everyone's attention is this number: $100 million. \n     Mr. Steyer has announced that he intends to put $50 million \n     of his own money into Democrats' races in 2014 and has \n     challenged his fellow deep-pocket liberals to match it with \n     an additional $50 million of their own. His issue is \n     ``climate change.''\n\n  We have to talk after this conference. We will have a lot of talk \ntonight about this question.\n  With regard to Congress, I will try to be as brief as I can. In 1970 \nCongress passed the Clean Air Act before global warming had ever been \ndiscussed. In fact, there was some discussion of global cooling in \n1970. It passed.\n  Carbon dioxide is an odorless, tasteless gas that plants take in and \nbreathe out oxygen; and people breathe in oxygen again and let out \ncarbon dioxide. It is a naturally forming, odorless, tasteless, \nnonharmful gas.\n  It was contended that this gas was causing global warming. It made \nsome sense to me. CO2 apparently is some sort of a global \nwarming gas and creates a blanket effect and could increase the \ntemperatures. Who knows--that was the argument and it seemed to make \nsome sense.\n  However, John Dingell, a Democrat from Michigan who was there at the \ntime of the Clean Air Act and was one of its authors said: ``I think \nthe Supreme Court came up with a very\nmuch erroneous decision on whether\nthe Clean Air Act covers greenhouse \ngases . . . ''\n  So what happened was the Supreme Court, in a 5 to 4 vote--after it \nwas contended through the International Panel on Climate Change that \nCO2 could be causing climate change--ruled this was a \npollutant, as are particulates like NOX and SOX--\nsulfur dioxide, and, therefore, under the 1970 law, which never \nmentioned CO2, the Environmental Protection Agency was \nrequired to regulate it. That gave these unelected bureaucrats--people \nin that agency--the power to regulate an individual American's barbecue \ngrill, their lawnmower, and every major business in America the amount \nof CO2 they emit from their businesses and their plants. It \nis a remarkable development from a pure constitutional question. If the \nissue were brought up today it would not pass. There are not sufficient \nvotes, apparently, to overturn it, but there would never have been \nenough votes to pass legislation to do what the Supreme Court said.\n  We are not looking at cost and benefits when we deal with this issue. \nWe are talking about billions of dollars in cost and what kinds of \nbenefits we get for that. Even if we were to reduce our CO2 \nemissions in the United States by 80 percent by the year 2050, in line \nwith what the President says our goal should be, there would be \nvirtually no reductions in predicted global temperatures if you take \nthe models the experts utilize, even 90 years from today around the \nyear 2100.\n  So it is not improper for us to raise questions about this, and as to \nhow much power we should be giving to the Environmental Protection \nAgency, and how much cost can be pushed down onto the American people \nto pay for this agenda when there are some interesting facts that keep \ncoming out.\n  In January of 2014, in the Scientific American magazine, which has \nbeen a staunch supporter of global warming legislation, it contained an \narticle entitled ``The Long Slow Rise of Solar and Wind,'' which \nexplains some of the reasons for the ``slow pace of energy \ntransition.'' The article explains, ``each widespread transition from \none dominant fuel to another has taken 50 to 60 years,'' and ``there is \nno technical or financial reason to believe [renewables] will rise any \nquicker.''\n  It just takes time to transition. Even if we can make this happen, we \ncan't make it as fast as a lot of people would like it to see it. The \narticle says:\n\n       From 1990 to 2012 the world's energy from fossil fuels \n     barely changed, down from 88 percent to 87 percent.\n\n  So we remained on the same path, even though we have been working on \nthis for many years. The article concludes that ``energy transitions \ntake a long time.'' They just do.\n  Then we have the problem of exaggeration to the point where \nexaggeration is really not a fair word to describe it, in my opinion. \nIt becomes more than an exaggeration but a deliberate \nmisrepresentation.\n  On November 14, 2012, President Obama said, ``The temperature around \nthe globe is increasing faster than was predicted even 10 years ago.'' \nIncreasing faster than even 10 years ago it was predicted to increase. \nSo I wrote former EPA director, Administrator Lisa Jackson, in December \nof 2012 asking her to provide the best available data that EPA had and \nthat they would rely upon to support the President's statement. I asked \nher to send us the data to support that claim.\n  A few months later, in February of 2013, Gina McCarthy, then \nAssistant Administrator of the EPA, wrote me a response but she did not \nprovide any of the requested data relating to the average global \ntemperature and the so-called increases.\n  Then in April, 3 months later, after she was nominated to be head of \nEPA, I asked Ms. McCarthy again and she said she would provide \nadditional followup information to support the President's statement \nthat global temperatures are increasing faster than what was predicted. \nOn April 30 she responded in writing to me--I am on the EPW Committee--\nbut not with any requested analysis or the chart I asked for that would \nshow official predictions versus actual global temperatures. She simply \nstated:\n\n       EPA has not produced its own analysis, but we expect a \n     definitive comparison in the forthcoming [IPCC] Fifth \n     Assessment Report.\n\n  Then on May 29, 2013, President Obama did it again. He claimed:\n\n       [We] also know that the climate is warming faster than \n     anybody anticipated 5 or 10 years ago . . .\n\n  This is the President. I challenged the statement at the committee \nbefore his top environmental official, Administrator McCarthy. She \ncould not produce any information to back this up. And he repeats it \nagain. This is very disturbing to me.\n  So on June 24, 2013, I was joined by all EPW Republicans in a letter \nto Ms. McCarthy to ask that she provide data supporting the President's \nclaims, but she didn't provide any data.\n  Why? There is no such data. The climate is not warming faster than \nwas predicted by the experts several or even 5 to 10 years ago. Nothing \nclose. Let us look at this chart. On this chart the red line is a \nprojection compiled of 102 predictive computer models. These models are \nused by experts at various universities and think tanks around the \nglobe in trying predict what is going to happen. They believe with \nCO2 and other global warming gases the temperatures will \nincrease and we have to take extraordinary steps, they say, to avoid \nthis because it can be damaging to us.\n\n  This is what the average of those models predicted, going up \nsubstantially from almost a degree by 2020. That is 1 degree, in 20-\nsome-odd years. That is noticeable. That is an impact, if it were to \nhappen.\n  However, these two lines are actual temperature measurements starting \nin 1980 and through the current date, right here. And the temperatures \nhaven't gone up. It has been an extraordinary thing. The computer \nmodels have been wrong virtually every year and experts are admitting, \neven the IPCC admits this is a problem for them. They do not know why \nthe temperature hasn't been increasing. CO2 has been going \nup. Why isn't the temperature increasing, such as they predicted?\n  Yet the President continues to say the temperature around the globe \nis increasing faster than was predicted even 10 years ago. It is hardly \nincreasing at all in the last 17 years.\n  So we have to have some truth, and I hope, if our colleagues talk \nabout this issue, they will ask EPA Administrator McCarthy what \ninformation she has that would justify such a statement. And I hope \nthey do not make that same statement. Actually, I said to her it would \nbe nice if she would tell the President to quit saying it. I will say \nhe hasn't said it since last year.\n\n[[Page S1373]]\n\n  Again, the facts, as I show them here, show a flat temperature. And \nthose facts are pretty much undisputed.\n  Now we have all these allegations that say: Well, extreme weather. \nThe problems from CO2 and greenhouse gases are causing \nextreme weather. We all heard that when Hurricane Sandy hit the \nnortheast. We don't normally have one in the northeast, but it hit the \nnortheast, and it was fairly strong. It was not an exceedingly powerful \nhurricane, but it did a lot of damage for people who have been living \non the water and weren't prepared for it. It did a lot of damage.\n  Al Gore, former Vice President, recently asserted ``all weather \nevents are now affected by global warming pollution.'' Senator Barbara \nBoxer, chairman of our committee--the EPW Committee--said Superstorm \nSandy is ``evidence of climate change mounting around us.''\n  In January of this year, before the Senate EPW Committee, the \nadministration's top wildlife official Dan Ashe declared there were \n``more frequent and severe storms, flooding, droughts and wildfires.'' \nThis is the top person in the wildlife department. He said we have \n``more frequent and severe storms, flooding, droughts and wildfires.'' \nAnd he, therefore, supported President Obama's climate action plan. So \nI wrote him and asked him to provide any data he had personally \nevaluated that would support his claim. He testified before a U.S. \nSenate committee. I asked him if he had any data to back it up. And, of \ncourse, he didn't.\n  Dr. Holdren, the top science adviser in the country, also declared \nthe President will talk about ``the connection between the increasing \nfrequency and intensity of droughts and climate change when he speaks \ntomorrow. He has actually repeatedly talked about the connection \nbetween climate change and extreme weather.''\n  Well, what do we know about that? We have had experts before our \ncommittee to discuss that very subject. Dr. Roger Pielke, who is a \nclimate impacts expert, agrees with the view that global warming is \npartly caused by human emissions. He testified in the EPW Committee \nlast year. He talked to us. He talked about this very issue--extreme \nweather--and here is what he said:\n\n       It is misleading, and just plain incorrect, to claim that \n     disasters associated with hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, or \n     droughts have increased on climate timescales either in the \n     United States or globally.\n\n  He said it is not true. It is misleading. It is false. Dr. Roy \nSpencer of the University of Alabama at Huntsville also testified \nbefore our committee last year saying:\n\n       There is little or no observational evidence that severe \n     weather of any type has worsened over the last 30, 50 or 100 \n     years.\n\n  The American Enterprise Institute looked at the data on this question \nand this is what they found:\n\n       In brief, tornado, hurricane and cyclone activity are at \n     historically low levels, wildfires are in a long-term decline \n     except in government forests, there is no trend in sea-levels \n     related to increases in greenhouse gas concentrations, the \n     record of the Arctic ice cover is ambiguous, there is no \n     drought trend since 1895, and the same is true for flooding \n     over the past 85 to 127 years.\n\n  When I asked Dr. Holdren--the President's science adviser--about \nthis, he responded: ``The first few people you quoted are not \nrepresentative of the mainstream scientific opinion on this point.''\n  That was a baseless accusation, as he had no data to dispute their \ninformation. Hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, and floods are measured \nevery year. We have objective data.\n  Dr. Pielke went back and examined the hurricanes--with category 5 \nbeing the strongest, down to 1 being the least--and categorized them \n50-plus years, and we are not having more or bigger hurricanes, we are \nnot having more floods, we are not having more tornadoes. We had an \noutbreak of very severe tornadoes a few years ago in Alabama, but the \ndata would indicate clearly that nationwide we are not having more. We \nhave always had tornadoes, and this one did a lot of damage and got a \nlot of coverage, but it was not a trend. I was sort of surprised to see \nthis idea.\n  There are a lot of things I think we can do which would move us in \nthe right direction where we could have compromise, and maybe nuclear \nenergy would be one which we have support on both sides of the aisle \nfor and would be good for the environment and good for energy and keep \ncosts at a reasonable level without any pollution. So there are a lot \nof things we can do.\n  As we discuss the hundreds of billions of dollars in costs which are \nbeing imposed on our economy as a result of some of the ideas to deal \nwith climate change and extreme weather, I asked my colleagues: Would \nyou please check the data; is it truly so that we are having more \nhurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, or floods? Dr. Pielke says no. Let's \nsee somebody dispute those numbers. They haven't been disputed.\n  Is it true the temperature is increasing faster than was predicted \neven 5 years or 10 years ago? The IPCC data doesn't show it and neither \ndoes any other objective data. So I asked the EPA Administrator to \nsubmit some data to show me if that is true: Do you have any? If so, \nwon't you ask the President to quit saying that? Shouldn't the \nPresident lead us and tell the truth about the situation?\n  I don't suppose we know enough now to answer this question \nconclusively either way, but I would say there has been a lot of \nexaggeration and a lot of hype. The American people are feeling the \ncrunch already in their electric and gasoline bills, and manufacturing \ncosts are going up as a result of these efforts to stop storms, which \nseem to be down, to stop a rise in temperature which doesn't seem to be \nrising right now. We will have to evaluate overall what the right thing \nto do is as a nation, but I think it is time for us to be a bit more \ncautious, to be less alarmist, and to focus more on the science of the \nsituation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/10/senate-section/article/S1373-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1373-S1374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SEXUAL ASSAULT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the Senate takes another step forward in \ncombating sexual assault in the military. Thanks to the leadership of \nSenators McCaskill, Ayotte, Fischer, and others, we can improve \nlegislation which adds important new protections for victims of sexual \nassault and strengthens our ability to investigate and prosecute these \ncrimes.\n  This legislation we will be voting on bolsters and improves upon the \nprovisions to combat sexual assault which were included in the National \nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014. Among the reforms \nincluded in that bill and are now law were provisions which make it a \ncrime to retaliate against a servicemember for reporting a sexual \nassault; that require every servicemember who reports a sexual assault \nto get a special victims' advocate who works for them, not for the \ncommand or for the court; and also this recently enacted law requires a \nhigher level review of decisions not to prosecute an allegation of \nsexual assault.\n  The reforms in the bill we will be voting on shortly are significant \nadditions to that recently enacted law. First, this bill will be making \nan important change in how we prosecute sexual assault crimes by \namending the Military Rules of Evidence to eliminate what is known as \nthe good soldier defense, which has allowed servicemembers to argue \nthat their good military performance is evidence of their innocence \nwhen charged with a crime. The military culture has been too slow to \ngrasp the painful truth that even a successful professional can also be \na sexual predator. This important reform in the bill we are considering \nwill help to alter that culture.\n\n  The bill also strengthens oversight of commanders' decisions on \nprosecution. Under reforms we passed last year, any decision by a \ncommander not to prosecute a sexual assault case is reviewed by the \nnext highest authority in the chain of command. When that decision \ncontradicts a recommendation to prosecute from the commander's senior \nlegal adviser, that review is done by the service Secretary, the \nhighest civilian authority in each military service. The bill we are \nnow going to consider would require the same review if a commander's \ndecision not to prosecute conflicts with the recommendation of the \nsenior prosecutor who would try the case.\n  The bill also strengthens victims' input into prosecution decisions. \nThe reforms we passed last year require that every victim of a military \nsexual assault be provided with a special victims' counsel--an attorney \nwho works\n\n[[Page S1374]]\n\nnot for the commander or the court but for the victim. The bill before \nus requires that these victims' counsels advise victims on the \nadvantages and disadvantages of seeing their case prosecuted in a \nmilitary court or in a civilian court. The bill also requires that when \nvictims express a preference for one or the other, that preference be \ngiven great weight.\n  The bill before us includes other important new protections for \nsexual assault victims. For example, it allows victims of a sexual \nassault who leave the military to challenge the terms or the \ncharacterization of their discharge. The bill requires a confidential \nprocess enabling victims to seek a review of discharge decisions in \norder to look for possible instances of retaliation for their having \nreported a crime.\n  The bill we will soon vote on also includes an important new \nprovision to boost accountability for commanders. It requires their \nperformance appraisals analyze whether they have established a command \nclimate in which sexual assault allegations are properly and fairly \nhandled and in which a victim can report a sexual assault without fear \nof reprisal or ostracism.\n  These and other provisions in the McCaskill-Ayotte-Fischer bill add \nfurther weight to the important reforms included in the National \nDefense Authorization Act we adopted and was enacted very recently. The \nbill we will be voting on contains real important reforms which deserve \nnot just our support and our votes but our thanks to Senators \nMcCaskill, Ayotte, Fischer, and others for crafting these additional \nreforms because they will surely make a major contribution in \nprotecting the troops who protect us.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise in support of S. 1917, the \nVictims Protection Act of 2014, and S. 1752, the Military Justice \nImprovement Act of 2013.\n  I have worked on this issue for years, and I am tired of lip service \nand empty promises of zero tolerance policies. Sexual assault in the \nmilitary and service academies continues to rise. The data speaks for \nitself. Roughly 26,000 sexual assaults took place in the military last \nyear.\n  I am so proud of the seven women on the Armed Services Committee who \nled this effort. And I appreciate the fine men who supported them, \nespecially Chairman Carl Levin.\n  We are now 20 women total in the Senate. We disagree on some issues, \neven the bills before us. But we agree on the goal of providing more \nprosecutorial tools to punish criminals, ensuring fairness in the \nprocess, and getting help to victims.\n  The 2013 National Defense Authorization Act, NDAA, included more than \n30 reforms addressing sexual assault in the military. They include: 13 \nprosecutorial reforms, 5 reforms to improve reporting of crimes, 10 \nreforms to improve victims services, and 2 reforms to expand the \ntraining of first responders.\n  This is a historic piece of legislation that takes a serious and \nsignificant step towards addressing this issue.\n  However, our work is not done. That is why I support Senator \nMcCaskill's and Senator Gillibrand's bills to further reform our \nmilitary justice system.\n  Senator McCaskill's bill builds on the provisions included in the \n2013 NDAA by providing additional support to victims. It prevents \ndefendants from using a good military character defense unless it is \nrelevant to the crime. And it ensures these improvements also apply to \nthe service academies which are also dealing with the epidemic of \nsexual assault.\n  I also support Senator Gillibrand's bill which would take the job of \ndeciding which crimes to prosecute out of the hands of commanders and, \ninstead, give it to independent military prosecutors with expertise in \nthese crimes.\n  This approach has value for victims, commanding officers, and the \naccused. Victims are assured of a fair process. Commanders are given an \nindependent source on an issue that they might not have expertise or \nexperience. And those accused of sexual violence get legal protections \nthrough the process.\n  These two bills take another step towards cracking the code on \naddressing sexual assault in the military. Our men and women in uniform \nface enough stresses on the battlefield. We can't allow sexual violence \nto be another one.\n  I urge my colleagues to support these bills.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Collins pertaining to the introduction of S. 2100 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Madam President, it was just one year ago last week that \nvictims of violence, members of law enforcement and those committed to \nworking against domestic and sexual violence celebrated the signing of \nthe Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women Act reauthorization and the \nTrafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act. The signing of this \nimportant legislation on March 7 last year was an enormous \naccomplishment for a divided Congress, which came together to pass \nmeaningful and historic legislation that protects all victims. One year \nlater, we honor those victims and survivors by renewing our commitment \nto our shared goal of ending domestic and sexual violence.\n  Our bipartisan effort last year is making lives better today. The new \nnondiscrimination provisions we fought so hard to protect are ensuring \nthat all victims, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender \nidentity, have access to lifesaving programs and cannot be turned away. \nAs I have said many times, ``a victim is a victim is a victim.'' While \nsome called for us to cast the most vulnerable groups among us aside \nand pass a watered down bill, I am proud that we held firm in our \nbeliefs. This could not have been done without the leadership and \ncommitment of Senator Crapo and Senator Murkowski, who fought within \ntheir caucus to preserve a fully inclusive reauthorization and stood \nwith me in the Senate to protect all survivors. In the House, \nCongressman Tom Cole was a critical voice in calling for the \nparticularly urgent need to address abuse on tribal lands. I thank them \ntoday, as I did 1 year ago, for their dedication and their partnership.\n  Every week, we are learning more about the impact of this important \nlaw. Last month, the Department of Justice launched a pilot project in \nwhich three tribes--the Umatilla, the Pascua Yaqui, and the Tulalip--\nwill begin to exercise their authority to prosecute non-Indian \noffenders who commit acts of domestic violence against an Indian on \ntribal land. Until now, non-Indian abusers were essentially immune from \nprosecution, a fact they would use to terrorize their victims. This new \nauthority marks the beginning of the end of those days and is a \nwatershed moment in our commitment to end the epidemic of violence \nagainst Indian women that has for too long been ignored. We fought hard \nto ensure this provision remained in the bill and it will save lives. \nAttorney General Holder, associate attorney general West and deputy \nassociate attorney general Hirsch deserve praise for making careful \nimplementation of the Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women Act a top \npriority.\n  Less than 2 weeks ago, the Department of Homeland Security announced \nit was taking additional steps under our VAWA reauthorization to \nprevent the sexual assault and abuse of immigrants in our detention \nfacilities. This was in response to a provision in the VAWA law \nrequiring that all DHS facilities comply with the Prison Rape \nElimination Act to prevent sexual abuse and assault. There is still \nmuch work to be done to protect immigrant women, and I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with DHS to ensure that they are doing all they can \nto protect those in their custody. I also remain committed to passing \nlegislation to increase the number of U visas available for immigrant \nvictims of violence. That powerful law enforcement\n\n[[Page S1375]]\n\ntool helps keep all of us safe by encouraging victims to report \ncriminals who pose a danger to our communities.\n  And last week, we heard about the impact services under VAWA have on \nvictims--and how much more we must do. The National Network to End \nDomestic Violence, in their annual National Domestic Violence Counts \nCensus, found that every day 9,000 service requests go unmet because of \na lack of resources. This is not acceptable. Every day tens of \nthousands of victims turn to domestic and sexual violence services \nproviders for support through emergency safe shelters, legal \nassistance, and child support groups, and we must do all we can to \nensure these needs are met.\n  In my nearly 40 years in the Senate, few issues have meant more to me \nthan passing an inclusive Violence Against Women Act. The law is an \nexample of how the Federal Government, in cooperation with state and \nlocal communities, can help solve problems. By providing new tools and \nresources to communities all around the country, we have helped bring \nthe crimes of rape and domestic violence out of the shadows. I am proud \nof the work we did last year and I hope that a bipartisan Senate can \ncome together this year to pass other, meaningful bills to support law \nenforcement and victims, like the Justice For All Act and the Runaway \nand Homelessness Youth Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/10/senate-section/article/S1375-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is currently considering the McHugh \nnomination. We are not in morning business.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I am going to proceed on my leader \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n\n\n                         appalachia depression\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, there is a depression in Appalachia--\nan absolute depression. Families are losing work because of government \nattacks on the coal industry and communities are hurting.\n  Tonight we are going to hear 30 hours of excuses from a group of \npeople who think that it is just OK that we have a depression in \nAppalachia. Well, it is not OK. It is cruel. It is cruel to tell \nstruggling coal families that they can't have a job because some \nbillionaire in San Francisco disagrees with their line of work.\n  Let me relay a message from a Kentucky miner named Howard. What you \nare going to hear over the next 30 seconds is more important than \nanything these anticoal liberals will say over the next 30 hours.\n  Here is what Howard had to say:\n\n       I say to you, Mister President of the United States . . . \n     We're hurting. You say you're the president of the people? \n     Well, we're people too. No one loves the mountains more than \n     we do. We live here. We crawl between them. We get up every \n     morning and we go to the top of a mountain in a strip job in \n     the cold rain and snow to put bread on the table. Come and \n     look at our little children, look at our people, Mr. \n     President. You're not hurting for a job; you've got one. I \n     don't.\n\n  That is Howard from eastern Kentucky.\n  I am not sure how anyone can hear something like that and think that \nattacking coal families is OK. It is not just coal families who are \nsuffering.\n  I have two electric bills from a farmer named John in Shelbyville. \nShelbyville is not in coal country. It is in another part of our State. \nBut 90 percent of our electricity is from coal-fired generation. We \nhave some of the lowest utility rates in America. At least we used to.\n  In July of 2008, the year before the President took office, John's \nelectric bill was $64.70. That was John's electric bill before the \nPresident took office. In July of 2013, he paid $107.30. This same \nfarm, a new President, and a 66-percent increase in utility bills in my \nState outside of coal country. That is a cost increase the people of \nKentucky and the Nation simply cannot afford.\n\n  My colleagues say they will spend the entire night talking about how \nwe need to wake up and take action. They are going to spend all night \nsaying how we need to wake up and take action. I wish to challenge them \nto think about acting in a way that puts the Americans I represent \nfirst and not spend 30 hours pretending as though they don't exist.\n  As I said, we have a depression in the coalfields of Kentucky created \nby this administration. Utility bills are soaring all over my State \nbecause of the actions of this administration. Tonight our colleagues \nare going to spend all night talking about just how great that really \nis. There is another side to the story. We need to care about and think \nabout the people who are being hurt by the policies of this \nadministration.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If neither side yields time, the time will be \nequally divided.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I am pleased to have the nomination of \nJudge Carolyn McHugh before the Senate today. Throughout her life Judge \nMcHugh has demonstrated a commitment to the highest standards of \nacademic excellence, professional distinction, and public service.\n  Judge McHugh graduated magna cum laude from the University of Utah, \nwhere she later earned her jurist doctorate, graduating Order of the \nCoif and serving as the editor on the Utah Law Review.\n  After excelling in law school, Judge McHugh clerked for the Honorable \nBruce Jenkins of the District of Utah. She then spent more than 20 \nyears in private practice, where she excelled, focusing on complex \ncommercial litigation.\n  Throughout her career in private practice, Judge McHugh has \ndemonstrated a strong commitment to pro bono work. She has been awarded \nseveral honors for her work to advance women in the legal profession. \nIn 1996 the Utah State Bar recognized her with a Distinguished \nCommittee Award from the Needs of Children Committee.\n  It was nearly 10 years ago when I first met Judge McHugh when I was \nworking for then-Governor Jon Huntsman. During his first year as \nGovernor, it was time for him to appoint someone to the Utah Court of \nAppeals. At that point the nominating commissions began their work, and \nshortly after their work concluded, the Governor's staff started \ninterviewing various applicants, various people who had been considered \nby the nominating commission. It soon became apparent that there was a \nreal standout in this very impressive group of candidates for this \ncourt of appeals position, and Judge McHugh's name rose to the top of \nthe list.\n  During discussions I had with her and with my colleagues, as well as \nwith Governor Huntsman, I found her to possess a keenly insightful \nlegal mind, and I found her to be someone who really understands the \nrole of judges--the necessarily limited role--and the\n\n[[Page S1376]]\n\ncrucial function of the judge in our system. She has served with great \ndistinction on the Utah Court of Appeals during those intervening \nyears.\n  For that reason I am confident, based on the knowledge she has \nacquired, the skills she has developed and honed over the years, and \nthe commitment to public service she has displayed up to this point in \nher career, Judge McHugh will, in fact, excel as a judge on the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. I strongly urge my colleagues \nto support her confirmation.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, in the last few weeks, we have wasted \nprecious floor time and energy to overcome filibusters on several \njudicial nominations. The majority leader was forced to file cloture on \njudicial nominees in Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Puerto Rico, \nand Tennessee. This was the case, even though every single one of those \nnominations had the support of home State Senators--whether Democrat or \nRepublican. In fact, seven of the eight judges confirmed in the last 2 \nweeks after filibusters were defeated were confirmed overwhelmingly \nwith 90 or more votes. So why were we forced to overcome unnecessary \nprocedural obstacles even though these judges were non-controversial \nand were filling longstanding vacancies in their districts? It is \nbecause Senate Republicans continue to try to slow down all \nconfirmations in the Senate.\n  Today, we must again vote to end a filibuster on a judicial \nnomination. Carolyn McHugh, nominated to fill a vacancy on the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, is a distinguished jurist who \nhas served on the Utah Court of Appeals for nearly a decade. She has \nthe support of both her home State Republican senators--Senator Hatch \nand Senator Lee. Her nomination could and should have been confirmed \nlast year. She was unanimously reported out of the Judiciary Committee \non November 14, 2013, but because Republicans refused to consent to a \nconfirmation vote by the full Senate and Senate Republicans would not \nconsent to holding her nomination in the Senate, Judge McHugh's \nnomination was returned to the President at the end of last year. She \nthen had to be re-nominated and re-processed through committee this \nyear and was again reported out of the Judiciary Committee without \nopposition on January 16, 2014.\n  After tonight's vote to end this unnecessary Republican filibuster, \nthe Senate will waste up to 30 hours waiting for post-cloture time to \nburn, even though Judge McHugh will then be confirmed overwhelmingly. \nIt is unlikely that much, if any, of the 30 hours will be used to \nexplain why Republicans found it necessary to block the Senate from \npromptly considering Judge McHugh's nomination last year and again this \nyear.\n  Republicans continue to obstruct on every nomination, even though \nthere are currently 89 Federal judicial vacancies, 34 of which have \nbeen deemed emergency vacancies by the Administrative Office of the \nU.S. Courts. In stark contrast, there were only 56 judicial vacancies \nat the same point in President Bush's tenure. The comparison is even \nmore troubling when you consider the 33 judicial nominees currently \npending on the Executive Calendar. We could lower the number of \njudicial vacancies today to less than 70 if Senate Republicans would \nsimply consent to voting on the pending nominees. We have not had fewer \nthan 70 vacancies since May 2009, more than 4 years ago. And for most \nof President Obama's tenure in office, judicial vacancies have hovered \naround 80 and 90 because of Senate Republican obstruction. \nNevertheless, Senate Republicans continue to object to votes on \njudicial nominations even when they cannot muster anything upon which \nto justify their delay.\n  There are no excuses for the delays except sheer partisanship. \nTwenty-one of the 33 judicial nominees currently pending on the \nExecutive Calendar had hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee \nlast year. And 31 of the 33 judicial nominees currently pending on the \nfloor were voted out of Committee with bipartisan support. It is clear \nthat Senate Republicans have decided to use the rules change as another \nexcuse to further accomplish their partial government shut down. Before \nthe rules change, Senate Republicans used anonymous holds to delay \nconfirming qualified judicial nominees, and dragged their feet every \nstep of the way to slow down the confirmation process. Senate Democrats \nchanged the rules precisely because of these delay tactics, which were \ncausing great harm to the judicial system and negatively impacting \nthose Americans who were seeking justice in our Federal courts. The \nAmerican people who have sought to obtain justice in our Federal courts \ndeserve speedy and prompt justice. These petty partisan tactics on \ndisplay are not worthy of the Senate.\n  Shortly, I hope we can overcome the filibuster of the nomination of \nJudge Carolyn McHugh to fill a vacancy in the Tenth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. She has served since 2005 as a judge on the Utah Court of \nAppeals and as the presiding judge of that court since 2012. She \npreviously worked in private practice at Parr Brown Gee & Loveless as \nan associate (1983-1987) and subsequently as a shareholder (1987-2005). \nShe has served as an adjunct professor at the University of Utah Law \nSchool and at the University of Utah College of Social and Behavioral \nScience. Judge McHugh earned her J.D., Order of the Coif, from the \nUniversity of Utah Law School in 1982. After law school, she clerked \nfor Judge Bruce S. Jenkins of the U.S. District Court for the District \nof Utah. The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary \nunanimously rated Judge McHugh ``Well Qualified'' to serve on the U.S. \nCircuit Court of Appeals for the tenth Circuit, its highest rating. She \nhas the support of her home State senators, Senator Hatch and Senator \nLee. The Judiciary Committee reported her unanimously by roll call vote \nto the full Senate on November 14, 2013, and by voice vote on January \n16, 2014.\n  I thank the majority leader for filing a cloture petition to end the \nfilibuster of Judge McHugh's nomination. I hope my fellow senators will \njoin me today to end this filibuster so that she can begin working on \nbehalf of the American people.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank my colleague Senator McCaskill, as \nwell as Senator Fischer. The Senate voted 97-0--unanimously--to support \nthe Victims Protection Act. This act builds on important work that was \ndone in the Defense authorization bill to ensure that victims of sexual \nassault in the military will be treated with dignity and respect; that \nthere will be full accountability for commanders to ensure the climate \nwithin their unit is one of zero tolerance toward sexual assaults; and \nthat when a victim comes forward, that victim--male or female--is \nsupported within this system.\n  The Victims Protection Act, passed today by a vote of 97-0--and few \nthings in the Senate pass with a 97-0 vote--will ensure there is \nanother level of review when a commander disagrees with the \nrecommendation of a prosecutor to prosecute a sexual assault case. It \nwill then go up to the civilian secretary for another level of review.\n  The bill also ensures commanders are judged in their evaluations on \nthe climate within their unit for addressing sexual assault and how \nthey handle these types of cases.\n  It also eliminates the so-called good soldier defense. Because even \nif you have been a good soldier, if you have committed sexual assault, \nyou need to be held accountable for your actions. So this bill will \nensure people who are perpetrators are held accountable for their \nactions.\n  The bill also allows important input from the victims so they can \nhave a say as to whether they believe a case should be brought in a \nmilitary or a civilian system for prosecution.\n  This act adds on the important work we have done together in the \nDefense authorization bill but it is not the end. We will continue in \nthe Armed Services Committee to make sure the reforms that have been \npassed are implemented, that commanders are held accountable for a \nclimate of zero tolerance within their units, and that victims of \nsexual assault are treated with dignity and respect and know they will \nbe supported if they come forward to report.\n  So I thank the Chair, and I again thank Senator McCaskill for her \nleadership on this bill. So few things pass in this body unanimously, \nbut this shows the bipartisan commitment we have to stopping this \nscourge of sexual assault in the military.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/10/senate-section/article/S1377-6", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1377-S1415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                             CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, just last week one of the world's most well-\nknown spiritual leaders, His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet, \nvisited the Capitol. He talked about the moral\n\n[[Page S1378]]\n\nimperative to protect the planet we call home. The Dalai Lama spoke \nwith passion and longing of his native Tibet, where mountain snows melt \nin spring to feed the rivers to provide Bangladesh, China, India, \nNepal, and Pakistan with water.\n  The Himalayas are sometimes called the ``third pole'' because they \ncontain nearly a third of the world's nonpolar ice. But in recent \nyears, manmade climate change has caused milder winters, less snow, and \nless water for 1.3 billion people living downstream from Tibet.\n  In the Western United States we face a similar problem. For more than \na decade drought has plagued the Colorado River, both upstream and \ndownstream--the lifeblood of a number of Western States, including \nNevada, California, Arizona, and other States.\n  During this period of time, we have had some so-called average snows \nin the Upper Colorado but none of it reaches the river. The climate has \nchanged. Milder winters have meant less Rocky Mountain snowpack and \nless spring runoff to feed the river. Combined with more extreme summer \nheat and other issues connected with climate change, the shrinking \nwestern snowpack threatens the water source for more than 30 million \npeople. Far more than 30 million people, because 38 million people in \nCalifornia are affected very adversely because of what is going on with \nthe Colorado River.\n  The seriousness of this climate problem is not lost on the average \nAmerican. The vast majority of Americans believe climate change is \nreal. They believe it is here.\n  A quarter century ago the first President Bush promised to use ``the \nWhite House effect'' to combat the ``greenhouse effect.'' That is what \nPresident Bush said, but not much has happened, I am sorry to say.\n  Despite overwhelming scientific evidence and overwhelming public \nopinion, climate change deniers still exist. There are lots of \nthem. They exist in this country. They exist, I am sorry to say, in \nthis Congress--in the House and in the Senate.\n\n  So I am very grateful to Senator Schatz, Senator Whitehouse, and the \nchairman of the very important environmental committee, Senator Boxer, \nand many other Senators who will join this climate change debate and \npresentation tonight for standing up against the deniers.\n  Climate change is real. It is here. It is time to stop acting as \nthough those who ignore this crisis--for example, the oil baron Koch \nbrothers and their allies in Congress--have a valid point. They don't. \nClimate change is here. Climate change has brought harsh and drastic \nsituations all over our country.\n  In the last few years alone, the Midwest has experienced the most \npunishing drought since the Great Depression. Wildfires have ravaged \nthe West, with places burning which have never burned before. The \nmighty Mississippi nearly ran dry, and barge traffic had to be brought \nto a stop because the river wasn't deep enough for them to travel.\n  While record droughts affected some parts of the United States, \ntorrential rains and extreme thunderstorms struck others. Temperatures \ntopped 60 degrees in Alaska in January. February brought a blanket of \nsnow and ice to Atlanta, GA--the South.\n  In other parts of the world, glaciers and ice sheets which have been \nfrozen for tens of thousands of years are melting and melting quickly. \nFires have consumed vast forests and monsoons and superfloods left \nmillions homeless all over the world. Since this new year, the United \nKingdom has had its wettest winter perhaps ever but far more than in \nthe last 100 years. Tokyo, Japan, in a period of a little over 2 weeks, \ngot 4 years' worth of snow. Australia experienced its hottest summer in \nthe history of Australia.\n  The vast majority of scientists say this is just the beginning of the \nravages of our world changing. Dozens of reports from scientists around \nthe globe link extreme weather to climate change, and the more extreme \nclimate change gets, the more extreme the weather is going to get. \nEveryone has to understand that. It is easy to see the urgency to \nconfront climate change, but this challenge is also an opportunity--and \nit truly is.\n  We have the ability now to reduce our reliance on oil and other \nfossil fuels, increase our production of clean energy, and create good-\npaying jobs which can never be outsourced. We have the ability to \nchoose the kind of world in which we live. We have that choice.\n  In Nevada we have done some good things. We have chosen clean \nrenewable energy as we retire older polluting powerplants. We only have \none left. We imported millions of tons of coal.\n  I remember I was in the House of Representatives and one powerplant \nwas on its way out. Al Matteucci, attorney for Nevada Power, was \ntelling me that little powerplant was importing 2 million tons of coal \na year. I said: What are you talking about? I thought, 2 million tons \nof coal? But that is the way it was, just one relatively small \npowerplant. We are no longer doing that in Nevada. We have only one \ncoal-fired plant left, and we have done this by going of course to some \nnatural gas, but we have done so many good things with renewable \nenergy. With geothermal we finally passed California. We are the most \nproductive State in the Union with geothermal energy.\n  We have done other things with renewable energy. This old plant I \njust talked about, where millions of tons of coal came in every year, \nwhy are we getting rid of that? For lots of reasons. But one reason is \nthis polluting powerplant, built on Paiute Indian land in Moapa, NV, \nabout 35 miles outside of Las Vegas, during the Johnson administration \nwas closed.\n  Next week, a week from this coming Friday, we are going to have a \ngroundbreaking on the Moapa land, where they are going to have hundreds \nand hundreds of jobs because they are going to produce huge amounts of \nenergy through solar, and that energy is going to go to California. We \nhave huge amounts of solar energy all over the State of Nevada and we \nare shipping it to California because California did the right thing. \nThey passed a law saying by a certain period of time one-third of all \ntheir power must come from renewable sources. This is a progressive \nState. It is important, and we are helping them meet those demands, but \nwe are also doing a lot to produce our own energy.\n  I talked about this powerplant. The powerplant, Moapa, at this Indian \nreservation, is the first solar project to be built on tribal lands--\ncertainly in Nevada and likely in the whole country.\n  The largest solar plant in the world opened last month on the Nevada-\nCalifornia border, the largest one in the world. Dozens of geothermal \nwells on public lands power the cities of Reno and Sparks in northern \nNevada. Because some of Nevada's best renewable energy resources are \nlocated in the rural areas, we recently completed a power line \nconnecting renewable energy sources. It was part of the Obama program \nto help stimulate the economy, which certainly has done that all over \nthe country, but it certainly has done it in Nevada. We have this power \nline connecting the northern part of the State and the southern State \nfor the first time ever.\n  What is being put into that power line? Renewable energy. Solar, \nwind, geothermal. This power line connecting renewable energy resources \nwith the people and businesses that need them and making the electric \ngrid more efficient is a part of what we used to talk about all the \ntime, a smart grid. It is actually here. Nevada is the first place \nwhere we actually have Federal programs which got us the smart grid. We \nhave permission to take this power line from northern Nevada to \nsouthern Nevada, now into the great Northwest.\n  So we are doing some good work. This is what the smart grid is all \nabout. Nevada has proven it is very easy to reduce our reliance on \nfossil fuels, which is good for the economy and good for the \nenvironment.\n  But as the Dalai Lama said:\n\n       We have the capability and the responsibility to act. But \n     we must do so before it is too late.\n\n  He went on further to say:\n\n       This . . . is not just a question of morality or ethics, \n     but a question of our own survival.\n\n  I believe him.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following my opening remarks the \nfollowing Senators be recognized for up to 90 seconds in the order \nlisted: Durbin, Schumer, Murray, Boxer, Whitehouse, Schatz, Feinstein, \nWyden, Nelson, Cantwell, Cardin, Klobuchar, Udall of Colorado, Udall of \nNew Mexico, Shaheen, Merkley, Bennet, Franken, Coons, Blumenthal,\n\n[[Page S1379]]\n\nHeinrich, King, Kaine, Warren, Markey, Booker, and Gillibrand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in this Chamber we spend a lot of time \ndebating how our actions will affect future generations and the \nobligations we have to leave future generations a better nation and a \nbetter world.\n  Nowhere is this responsibility more apparent than when it comes to \nthe issue of climate change. It is critical we leave our children and \ngrandchildren a sustainable planet with a promising, bright future.\n  We can no longer shy away from the fact that over 98 percent of all \nworking climate scientists believe that human activities have led to \nclimate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has found \nit to be unequivocal that the world is warming due to human activities. \nThe existence of manmade climate change is not a debatable issue, nor \nis it a vague or distant threat. It is a situation which requires \nserious attention immediately.\n  I have heard it said there is only one major political party in the \nworld which denies what I just said: the scientific evidence which \npoints to climate change and the fact the world we are living in is \nchanging with extreme weather patterns the life we lead and the future \nfor many generations.\n  I hope, during the course of this debate, if the Republican Party \ncomes to the floor, they will dispute what I just said. I am calling on \nthem to name any other major political party in the world which agrees \nwith the proposition that they stand for, questioning whether there is \nscientific evidence supporting climate change. I believe there is, and \nI believe we should act now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues. They did an \namazing job on the Climate Action Task Force, particularly Senators \nBoxer and Whitehouse, who led the task force, and the indefatigable new \nMember Senator Schatz for organizing and coordinating this effort.\n  The overwhelming majority of the world's scientists believe humans \nare changing the Earth's climate. Climate deniers like to claim there \nare competing stories about whether this is true, usually pushing \npolluter talking points that there is not a scientific consensus on \nclimate change. We know this is utterly false, and I would pose the \nfollowing question to my colleagues who think ``the jury is still out'' \non climate change: If you went to 100 doctors and 98 of them said you \nwere sick and should take medicine, but two told you that you were fine \nand should do nothing, what would you do?\n  Climate change deniers need to wake up and realize the scientific \ndiagnosis about warming the planet is real. We need to take action, \nmuch of which will be outlined tonight. I hope my colleagues and the \nAmerican people are listening.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Climate Action \nTask Force, I am very proud to join with all of our colleagues to talk \nabout an action which is needed.\n  Climate change is real. We have seen it in the overwhelming \nscientific evidence which is occurring today. It is not just about \nscience. It is impacting all of us. We see the rise in asthma attacks. \nWe see the impacts in my home State of Washington. I hear this concern \nfrom my constituents, and we know rising sea levels are threatening all \nof us. We see it in our rural communities where we are seeing drought. \nWe are seeing it in our forests where the dry weather is turning our \nwoods into kindling. We see it in our local fishing communities where \nocean acidification is hindering our shellfish development. These \nimpacts have enormous costs. They are devastating to our families and \ncommunities who are suffering from droughts, superstorms, and \nwildfires.\n  But it is not just an environmental issue; it is not just a health \nissue. It is a budget issue. It is not just about rising temperatures; \nit is about rising costs. As chair of the Budget Committee, I can tell \nyou this issue is a burden to our taxpayers. Federal disaster recovery \nspending alone has increased year after year as the number and size of \nweather-related disasters rise. These costs will continue if we don't \nact.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. We know the jobs we can create with new economic \nopportunities of climate change will help bring us out of the budget \ndeficits we face.\n  I congratulate all of our colleagues who are here tonight to talk, \nand I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we know all Senators care deeply about \ntheir constituents and their families. If any one of us saw danger \nlooming, we would do everything in our power to save them. Yet in the \nface of irrefutable scientific agreement, the Senate does nothing to \nmake sure polluters pay for the carbon they emit, which would move us \ntoward a clean energy economy and away from catastrophic climate \nchange.\n  Yes, there is money, big money, behind the polluters. Yes, those \npolluters are raging against us with layers of lies. Yet and still the \nenvironment which used to be a bipartisan issue has turned truly \nbitterly partisan, but we cannot and we must not and we will not give \nin because it is our job. We must preserve our environment for our \npeople, which is pretty basic.\n  The deniers have given in to the power of wishful thinking, just as \nthose defending cigarette addiction did.\n  To those who would say let China lead, I say this is shameful. In \nChina 1.2 million people died in 2010 from air pollution. That is a \nfact, not a fantasy. America doesn't sit around and wait for someone \nelse to protect the health and safety and the quality of life of our \npeople. It is wrong. So I am so proud tonight to stand with my resolute \ncolleagues as we fight back against those polluters who would put their \nself-interests ahead of the salmon we have sworn to protect.\n\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Thank you, Mr. Presiding Officer.\n  The problem of carbon pollution could not be more real for my home \nState of Rhode Island. It is real for our country's future. I will be \nhere in the wee hours and I will yield my time so we can compress this. \nWe have a lot of Senators who want to speak in a short period of time.\n  I want to yield my time and express my gratitude to Senator Schatz of \nHawaii who has coordinated tonight's event.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. I rise with 29 of my colleagues with a simple message for \nCongress and for our Nation: Climate change is real; climate change is \ncaused by humans; and climate change is solvable. We will not rest \nuntil Congress wakes up and acts on the most pressing issue of our \ntime.\n  Why are we doing this? Why are we taking this particular action to \ntake the floor tonight and into the morning right now? The answer is \nsimple: This is the floor of the U.S. Senate, the greatest deliberative \nbody in the world. This is where historically America has addressed \nsome of its toughest challenges. Tonight has to be the historic \nbeginning of us facing the challenge of our generation. The real \nquestion ought to be: Why haven't we done this sooner and, perhaps more \npointedly, why isn't every single Member of this body down here with \nus?\n  Tonight is just the beginning. We are going to continue to push \nthroughout the year, and the public is with us--Independents, \nDemocrats, and Republicans. Americans are calling for action. The only \nplace where climate change is still an open debate is within the four \ncorners of this Capitol.\n  I have seen what can happen when there is a real commitment to clean \nenergy and clear goals laid out. In my home State of Hawaii we set \naggressive goals and doubled our use of clean energy in just 3 years. \nTackling climate change is going to require the entire country working \ntogether.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Hawaii has \nexpired.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S1380]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank Senator Schatz for all the work he did to put together this \neffort tonight.\n  I simply want to say that when you look at the data from the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Academy of \nSciences, I believe you reach a blunt judgment: Climate change is the \nscientific equivalent of a speeding Mack truck. So tonight it is \nappropriate that Senators start getting into these issues with \npractical approaches. We have done our part in a bipartisan effort to \npromote hydropower. I am very pleased the President has a new approach \nin terms of dealing with wildfire, which is also bipartisan, because \nfires we are seeing are getting bigger and hotter, and there are steps \nwe can take to deal with those urgent problems. This evening is all \nabout sensible action.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, one of the places that is threatened most \nis a low-lying area such as Bangladesh, but do you know what area is \nthreatened most in the Continental United States? The Miami area. I am \ngoing to be taking the commerce committee during the April recess to \nhave a hearing on climate change and sea level rise particularly right \nin the heart of a city that has been experiencing flooding over and \nover because of this climate change.\n  Florida is ground zero for sea level rise. We have a compelling story \nto tell. Our leaders are making key decisions and investments today so \nthat our coastal economy will thrive. We are going to pull all this \ntogether in the hearing. There are several members of the commerce \ncommittee here tonight. I invite Senators during the April recess to \ncome to this hearing. Thank you all for organizing this all-night \nevent, and I look forward to the material that will be coming out this \nevening.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, climate change is not a problem of the \nfuture. Climate change is drastically impacting our oceans today. \nAcidification is increasing at astonishing rates, and our oceans take \nup 25 percent of our carbon emissions. Carbon and ocean acidification \nkill our oysters, crabs, and other shellfish, and impact the shellfish \nthat other sea life depends on, such as our salmon, so the impact to an \nindustry in our State that is worth $30 billion and supports 148,000 \njobs is serious.\n  Just last week there was a huge die-off of scallops in British \nColumbia, resulting in 30 percent of employees in that region being \nlaid off. So climate change is not only killing oysters and scallops, \nbut it is killing our fishing jobs. That is why we are here tonight, \nbecause we know we need to act to save jobs and help our economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, as a member of the Climate Action Task \nForce, I couldn't be more proud of my colleagues on the floor tonight. \nI thank Senator Boxer, Senator Schatz, and Senator Whitehouse for \norganizing this evening.\n  The information we want to present is clear. The facts are clear. \nScience indicates what we do here on Earth is affecting the livability \nof our planet, and we can do something about it. This is an urgent \nissue, from climate refugees around the world, the visible signs we see \nin China, to each of our individual States.\n  I am honored to represent the people of Maryland, where 70 percent of \ncitizens live in coastal zones. The Chesapeake Bay is iconic to the \nsurvival of Maryland as we know it today and yet it is at risk.\n  But here is the good news: We can do something about it. We can \nreduce our carbon footprint. We can reduce our carbon pollution, and in \ndoing so we not only help our environment, we also help our economy and \njob growth, help make America more energy secure, which helps our \nnational security. So let's take the reasonable steps necessary to help \nour future generations, help our economy, and help our environment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I am also very pleased to talk about one of \nthe most pressing challenges confronting our Nation and my State of \nColorado, and that is climate change. We have seen in my State this is \nnot an obscure threat or distant problem. We have had catastrophic \nfloods and mega wildfires that have been the result of drought, of a \nwhole series of changes in a way we see climate systems operating in \nColorado. It is threatening our way of life.\n  I have a powerful photograph here. We have had in the past 2 years \nthree successive mega fires. Last year's Black Forest fire brought \ndestruction to Colorado Springs. Over 500 homes burned and we lost 2 \nlives. This fire quickly surpassed the Waldo Canyon fire which was the \nmost destructive fire in Colorado history.\n  Now is the time to act. Now is the time to grab the opportunity to \ncreate new emergency technologies, to enhance our national security \nand, by the way, to keep faith with our children. We do not inherit \nthis Earth from our parents. We are borrowing it from our children. If \nwe do not act on climate change, we will leave them a less bright \nfuture. If we do act, we can create jobs and protect the environment.\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee, along with the Presiding \nOfficer, we can enhance our Nation's security with these new \ntechnologies. Let's act now. I am here in this Congress and this Senate \nto protect our way of life. If we act now, we can protect that special \nway of life.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, thank you very much, and let \nme first of all congratulate my chairman, Chairman Boxer, Senator \nWhitehouse, and Senator Schatz for organizing this effort and what we \nare calling an up-all-night conversation.\n  New Mexico is in the bull's-eye when it comes to climate change. \nEveryplace else, if it goes up 1 degree, New Mexico and the Southwest \ngo up 2 degrees, so we know we are hit really hard. I am going to talk \nlater in this conversation about all of the impacts.\n  It is clear, forest fires, as my cousin talked about, droughts, huge \ndie-off in terms of trees, extreme rain events after fires, and \nflooding are devastating. But New Mexico has been at the forefront of \nthe solution. When it comes to renewable energy, we are out there--\nsolar energy, wind, bio, advanced biofuels such as algae. We are \nworking in the direction we need all of us to be working in together in \nthis country, to make sure we orient toward renewables and tackle this \nproblem. I will be able to expand on this later.\n  I would yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I am pleased to join my colleagues tonight in talking about the \neconomic and environmental imperative of addressing climate change. I \nthank all of the members of the climate task force, all my colleagues \nwho are here, and particularly Senator Schatz from Hawaii, for \norganizing tonight.\n  The fact is, as we have heard, climate change is real and it is \nhappening. According to the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange, a group of 3,000 scientists from over 130 countries who have \nstudied climate change for over 20 years, global emissions must be \nstabilized by midcentury in order to avoid the most catastrophic and \nirreversible consequences of climate change.\n  Studies from the National Research Council and the U.S. Global \nClimate Research Program reinforce that global temperatures are \nsteadily rising and contributing to more extreme weather events and \nrising sea levels. Scientists from the University of New Hampshire have \nfound that humans are responsible for releasing large amounts of carbon \ndioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere that are causing \nrapid climate change. I only need to look at New Hampshire to see the \nreal economic and health implications.\n  In New Hampshire, climate change is contributing to sea level rise, \nwhich\n\n[[Page S1381]]\n\nimperils businesses, homes, and coastal communities such as Portsmouth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from New Hampshire has \nexpired.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. The outdoor recreation community has less snow, \nresulting in fewer tourism dollars. Wildlife health is becoming \nincreasingly vulnerable to disease. What is happening in New Hampshire \nis happening around the world. We must take action now.\n  I look forward to coming back later this evening to talk more about \nwhat we are seeing in New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, Theodore Roosevelt said:\n\n       Of all the questions which can come before this Nation, \n     short of the actual preservation of its existence in a great \n     war, there is none which compares in importance with the \n     great central task of leaving this land even a better land \n     for our descendants than it is for us.\n\n  We should reconsider those words now in the context of carbon \npollution--carbon pollution which is a direct assault to our rural \nresources, on our farming, fishing, and forestry. In Oregon we had \nthree worst-ever droughts we have faced over a 13-year period, \ndevastating to the farmers, their families, and the farm economy.\n  In fishing, everyone who goes to their favorite trout stream knows \nthat if there is no snowpack, the stream is warmer and smaller in \nsummer and a poor place to fish, and certainly worse for iconic salmon \nand steelhead.\n  The forests are burning, from pine beetles, which spread throughout \nthe land in the context of not having those cold snaps in the winter, \nand in the context of tinderbox conditions on the forest floor. Those \nforest fires have been some of the worst we have seen in a century, and \nmore is yet to come. We cannot wait for 20 or 30 or 40 years to act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. We cannot wait for 2 or 3 or 4 years to act. The carbon \npollution is real and the damage is real. It is time for this Chamber \nto act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Why are we here tonight. We are here because if we \nfail to act, our planet will be destroyed. As exaggerated as that claim \nsounds, it is strikingly, irrefutably true. We are here because our \nfuture is at stake, and not only ours but our children's. We are here \nbecause of climate change, which is really climate disruption and \nplanet destruction. It is real and it is urgent.\n  Anyone who lives in Connecticut knows about the snowstorms and \nhurricanes, Superstorm Sandy, the rising tide that will eventually \ndestroy our coastline, the rising temperatures that will emaciate our \nvegetation and our produce. There are real human effects but also \neconomic effects. There are immense economic perils but also tremendous \neconomic promise. There are immense economic perils but also tremendous \neconomic promise if we invest in the steps that have to be taken to \nstop climate disruption.\n\n  We can take advantage of the immense opportunity and obligation we \nface by acknowledging the reality that our planet is at stake and \ndefeating and discrediting the climate change deniers, who are as much \na part of the problem as any of the natural forces or elements at \nstake.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. That is why we are here tonight, and that is why we \nwill stay the course.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, as a member of the climate change task \nforce, I am pleased to join my colleagues in calling for action on \ntackling one of our Nation's greatest challenges. I wish to start by \nthanking Senator Whitehouse, Senator Schatz, and Senator Boxer for \ntheir leadership on this issue.\n  Tonight we will illustrate that climate change is not theoretical and \ncannot be ignored. We will discuss how sound science can be used to \nbetter understand and manage climate impacts. We will highlight the \nmoral imperative that we have in Congress to implement real solutions.\n  In my home State of New Mexico we are seeing bigger fires, dryer \nsummers, more severe floods when it finally does rain, and less \nsnowpack in the winter. Our Nation's second most extreme year for \nweather on record was in 2012, but in New Mexico we experienced the \nhottest year on record. Over the last 4 years alone, we have seen the \ntwo largest fires in New Mexico's history.\n  The reality is that things are only going to get worse if we don't \nact. If we have any hope of reversing the effects of climate change--\nand we truly must--it is critical that we embrace this challenge now \nand lead the world in innovation, efficiency, and clean energy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, Joe Sewall, David Huber, Harry Richardson, \nHoddy Hildreth, and Sherry Huber--those names mean nothing in this \nChamber, but they meant everything in Maine in the 1970s. They were the \nparents of the environmental movement in our State. What do they all \nhave in common? They are all Republicans.\n  I rise tonight in puzzlement as to how this issue became a partisan \none. It is a scientific issue. Light travels at 186,000 miles per \nsecond. That is science. That is not a partisan or debatable issue. The \nscience on this question is definitive.\n  I would not call myself a denier, but I was a skeptic until several \nyears when I encountered a chart, which I will show in a large version \nlater this evening, that talks about CO2 in the atmosphere \nfor the last million years. Yes, it varied over time between 150 and \n250 parts per million, but in the 1860s, at the dawn of the fossil fuel \nage, it started to go up, and now it is at 400 parts per million. That \nnumber has not been seen in this world for 3 million years. The last \ntime we were at that figure, the sea level was 80 feet higher.\n  We are playing with the future of this planet. We have to do \nsomething, and that is why we are here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, as a member of the climate change task \nforce, I am proud to join my colleagues today. I particularly wish to \nthank Senators Schatz, Whitehouse, and Boxer for getting us organized \nand bringing attention to the urgent need to address climate change. We \nare on the cusp of a climate crisis. We are at a point of no return \nthat will threaten our health, our economy, and our planet.\n  For the next several hours and all through the night and into \ntomorrow, dozens of Senators will add their voices to the millions of \nvoices around the country of people who are committed in the fight \nagainst climate change.\n  I got ready for this event by asking people for help. I sent out an \nemail asking a simple question: What do people think the world will \nlook like 25 years from now if we don't do anything at all to stop \nclimate change? Nearly 5,000 emails have already poured in from \nworkers, teachers, grandparents, and students. These Americans see what \nis happening to our environment. They see the paralysis of our \npolitics. They see that we are headed down a dangerous path. They see \nthat we--our country and our Congress--must change.\n  This is where we start--a moment of great peril for Massachusetts, \nfor America, and for the world, but also a moment of great opportunity. \nThis is a time for us to come together.\n  During my time on the floor, I plan to read letters from some of the \npeople who have emailed me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. WARREN. I yield the floor.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, the science proves there is a danger, the \neconomics prove there is a solution, and the politics tonight begin the \nprocess of saying there is a way to deal with this issue.\n  The planet is running a fever, but there are no emergency rooms for \nplanets. We have to engage in the preventive care so that we deploy the \nstrategies which make it possible for our planet to avoid the worst, \nmost catastrophic effects of climate change. We can do it and do it in \na way that helps our economy.\n  There are now 80,000 people working in the wind industry in the \nUnited States. There are 142,000 people in the\n\n[[Page S1382]]\n\nsolar industry. That is 220,000 people. There are 80,000 people in the \ncoal industry. Most of the wind and solar jobs have been created in the \nlast 5 years. This is a job-creating revolution which is taking off.\n  Tonight we are going to stay up all night to talk about this climate \nchange issue in the hopes that tomorrow will be the dawn of a new era \nwhere the Congress begins to do something about this issue and where it \nresponds to its historic duty to the next generation to end this \ncrisis.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, climate change is real and it is \nhere. Rising sea levels, disappearing coastlines, longer droughts, \ncolder winters, hotter summers, and massive so-called storms of the \ncentury are occurring routinely, such as Hurricanes Irene and Lee and, \nof course, Superstorm Sandy that devastated the Northeast. But powerful \nspecial interests and too many politicians who should simply know \nbetter would have us believe that it is a hoax or that any reasonable \naction would kill jobs.\n  I, for one, refuse to believe that somehow harmful pollution is the \nonly way to grow and sustain our economy. I, for one, know for a fact \nthat what is good for our environment can be good for business when we \nact responsibly.\n  It is time to invest in clean energy with wind, solar, biofuel, and \nother sources of energy that do not pollute our environment and \ncontribute to climate change. We have everything it takes from \nsustainable resources, American innovation, and manufacturing know-how \nto produce new sources of clean energy that are made here in America. \nThat is how we can cut our dependence on costly foreign oil and make us \nmore secure; that is how we can spark new businesses, new jobs, and a \nstronger middle class, all while protecting the air we breathe and the \nwater we drink and preserving all the beauty of our most cherished \nplaces for the next generation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, how much time remains under the \ncontrol of our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 3 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. INHOFE. If the Senator needs more time, I will not object.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. That is kind of the distinguished Senator, but I \nthink we have managed to come within our time.\n  As we close, I wish to thank so many colleagues who have participated \nin this early lightning round of statements by Senators. We expect to \nhave 30 Democratic Senators speaking on this issue during the course of \nthe night, through the night, and into tomorrow morning.\n  It is a matter we are overdue in addressing. It is a matter that is \nreally beyond legitimate scientific dispute--at least as to the \nfundamental truth of the planet warming and why. Indeed, Abraham \nLincoln was the President when a scientist named Tyndall--over in \nEngland--first presented to the Royal Academy of Sciences his work \nshowing that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere warms the Earth as it \nincreases its density. We are now more carbon dense.\n  As Senator King said, we spent about 800,000 to 3 million years in a \nzone of 150 to 300 parts per million. We had never been at 400 parts \nper million in the history of human habitation on the face of this \nplanet until just a few months ago when the first 400-parts-per-million \nreading was recorded. We have to pay attention to this.\n  I will close by saying that not only is this a vital point for our \nhome States, it is vital for California, which is riven by drought. It \nis vital for New Mexico and Colorado, which have also seen drought and \nwildfires. It is also vital for New York, which was clobbered by \nSuperstorm Sandy. It is vital for Hawaii, which is seeing sea level \nrise and acidification. It is vital for Massachusetts, where the sea \nlevel is up 10 inches, and we are beginning to see fisheries move north \nand away from our waters to avoid the warming seas. It is vital for \nConnecticut, which has virtually lost its lobster fishery because of \nits warming season. And, of course, it is vital for Rhode Island. My \nNarragansett Bay is 3 to 4 degrees warmer in the winter, and that means \nthat fisheries, such as the winter flounder fishery, are simply gone--\n90-plus percent crashed.\n  We have to face this as States, we have to face this as a nation, and \nif we fail, we will have failed the fundamental test of every American \ngeneration. The fundamental test of every American generation is, will \nyou bring the reputation of this country and the integrity of this \ndemocracy forward through your time so the next American generation can \ncarry it forward with honor?\n  We received our democracy from the ``greatest generation.'' They \nfought world wars to make it safe for us. If we fail now, we will not \nbe the greatest generation; we will be a disgraced generation. I intend \nto do everything I can to make sure we do not get there.\n  I yield back the rest of the Democrats' time\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, all night long? Well, that is going to be \nfun.\n  By the way, the Oklahoma City Thunders are not playing tonight, so we \nmay get a few more viewers.\n  It is nice to look over and see probably the most articulate and \nknowledgeable of all of the alarmists historically as our newest \nSenator from Massachusetts, Ed Markey.\n  You can be good friends and still disagree. The Senator from Rhode \nIsland certainly knows that because we had a little disagreement last \nweek. The Senator from California certainly knows this as well.\n  We have been working on this for a long time. This started with the \nKyoto Treaty. I think most people have forgotten about that. During the \nClinton-Gore administration, Gore came back from Rio de Janeiro and \nsaid we are all going to die from global warming. I will say that he \nknows what he is doing. The New York Times speculated that Al Gore is \nvery likely the first environmental billionaire in existence, so I \nguess he knows what he is doing there.\n  In spite of the fact of what has happened recently, I think it is \nprobably necessary to have something all night, something to get the \nattention of the American people, because they keep saying--and I hear \nit over and over--climate change is real, global warming is real; it is \nreal; it is real; it is real. If you say it enough times, then people \nare going to think it is real.\n  Tonight, all night long, you can say ``it is real, it is real, it is \nreal,'' but I think people have heard that before and times have \nchanged. A couple of things have happened, and I know a lot of you \nregret this.\n  I remember so well when Lisa Jackson was the Administrator of the \nEPA.\n  I have often said some very good things about her, even though she is \nvery liberal and I am ranked most of the time as the most conservative \nMember of the Senate. Yet when she is asked a direct question, she \nalways comes out with an honest answer.\n  I asked my good friend Senator Markey just a few minutes ago, who was \nthere--first of all, let me say the United Nations started all this \nstuff. They have one big annual party, and it is usually in very nice \nplaces. I think at last count 190 countries were there. I remember \ntalking to one of my good friends from one of the sub-Saharan African \ncountries who was there with his administration. I said: You don't \nbelieve this stuff, do you?\n  He said: No, but this is one of the biggest parties of the year.\n  One of the big parties in 2009 was Copenhagen. They set a record of \nhow cold it was in Copenhagen. I remember that very well. I remember at \nthat time--and I hope I get this right because we had several people \nfrom the administration. We had at that time Senator John Kerry, of \ncourse, Congressman Ed Markey, Nancy Pelosi, and President Obama, who \nwas Senator Obama at that time--no, he was already President at that \ntime. Their job was to convince the 191 other countries that were in \nCopenhagen that we in the United States were going to pass some type of \nreal cap and trade legislation.\n  So we had a hearing. At that time I think the Republicans were in \ncontrol. But I said to Lisa Jackson: I am going to go to Copenhagen \ntomorrow to be a one-man truth squad. Everybody has been there talking \nabout what we are going to do here in the United States and somebody \nhas to tell them the\n\n[[Page S1383]]\n\ntruth. So I said: I have a feeling when I leave tomorrow, you are going \nto have a declaration and when you do, it has to be based on some type \nof science. I could tell by looking at her that they were going to have \nthe endangerment finding.\n  I ask my friend if he remembers that, the endangerment finding.\n  Anyway, I left the next morning for Copenhagen, and that afternoon \nthey had the endangerment finding. Before I left I said: When you have \nthe endangerment finding, it has to be based on some type of science. \nWhat science are you going to use?\n  She said: Well, mostly the IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change.\n  So that is the kind of science they have been using for a long period \nof time.\n  But, ironically, the timing couldn't be better. It wasn't a matter of \nweeks after that; it was a matter of hours after that, that climategate \nwas exposed. Climategate was the--it all started with East Anglia \nUniversity's Climate Research Unit--the CRU--one of the main \nuniversities that helps put together the information about global \nwarming for the IPCC. There it was disclosed that the IPCC was \nsystematically distorting the facts, cooking the science of global \nwarming to either cover up data that didn't tell the story they wanted \neveryone to hear and exaggerating the impacts of changing climate to \nhelp drive people out of fear into action.\n  There are three things one needs to know about the IPCC. First of \nall, the Obama administration has referred to the IPCC as the gold \nstandard of climate change science and global warming. Some say its \nreports on climate change and global warming represent the so-called \nconsensus of the science opinion about global warming. IPCC and Al Gore \nwere awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for their efforts to build \nand disseminate greater knowledge and doing so through the IPCC. Simply \nput, what this means is that in the elite circles, the IPCC is a big \ndeal.\n  So as a result of climategate--when they found they had been lying \nall this time--when ABC News, when The Economist, when Time Magazine, \nwhen The Times of London, among many others, report that the IPCC's \nresearch contains embarrassing flaws and that the IPCC chairman and \nscientists knew of the flaws but published them anyway, we have the \nmakings of a major scientific scandal. There are two examples of how \nthe IPCC was cooking the science.\n  The IPCC claimed that the Himalayan glaciers would melt by 2035. Of \ncourse, this is not true. It is simply false. Yet it was put into the \nIPCC's fourth assessment report. According to The Sunday Times, the \nclaim about the Himalayas was based on a 1999 story in a news magazine \nwhich, in turn, was based on a short telephone interview with someone \nnamed Seyed Hasnain, who is a very little-known Indian scientist.\n  Next, in 2005, the activist group World Wildlife Fund cited the story \nin one of its climate change reports. Yet despite the fact that the \nWorld Wildlife Fund report was not scientifically peer reviewed, it was \nstill referenced by the IPCC. Next, according to The Times, the \nHimalayan glaciers are so thick at such high altitude that most \nglaciologists believe it would take several hundred years to melt at \nthe present rate.\n  Anyway, all of that was taking place. It has to be really disturbing \nto a lot of those individuals who are alarmists, that all of a sudden \nthis backbone of the science they have been referring to of the IPCC \nwas exposed.\n\n  I remember one of the emails in 1999. These were the emails that were \nexposed. These are the ones that are behind--giving the information to \nthe IPCC:\n\n       I've just completed Mike's Nature trick of adding in the \n     real temps to each series for the last 20 years, i.e., from \n     1981 onwards, and from 1961 for Keith's to hide the decline.\n\n  So they were actually adding higher temperatures to give the trends \nthey wanted.\n  In 2009:\n\n       The fact is that we can't account for the lack of warming \n     at the moment, and it is a travesty that we can't.\n\n  These are the people who were supplying the information to the IPCC.\n  I could go on and on; there is not time to get to all of them.\n  Christopher Booker of the U.K. said: ``This is the worst scientific \nscandal of our generation.'' He was talking about the IPCC. That is the \nbasis of all of this.\n\n       Clive Crook, Financial Times: The closed mindedness of \n     these supposed men of science . . . is surprising, even to \n     me. The stink of intellectual corruption is overpowering.\n       IPCC Prominent Physicist Resigns: Climategate was a fraud \n     on a scale I've never seen.\n       U.N. Scientist Dr. Phillip Lloyd calls out IPCC ``fraud''--\n     ``The result is NOT scientific.''\n       Newsweek: Once celebrated climate researchers feeling the \n     used car salesman.\n       Some of the IPCC's most quoted data and recommendations \n     were taken straight out of unchecked activist brochures . . .\n\n  Now, I am quoting right now. This was in Newsweek.\n  George Monbiot--I probably mispronounced that. He is a columnist who \nis on the other side of this issue from me. He said:\n\n       It's no use pretending that this isn't a major blow. The \n     emails extracted by a hacker from the climatic unit at the \n     University of East Anglia could scarcely be more damaging . . \n     . I'm dismayed and deeply shaken by them . . . I was too \n     trusting of some of those who provided the evidence I \n     championed. I would have been a better journalist if I had \n     investigated the claims more closely.\n\n  We have the other problem, and that is that instead of increasing, we \nare going through now some cold spells that are just shocking and \nsetting new records. In January of 2014, 4,406 cold temperature records \nwere set around the country. In January of 2014, in my city of Tulsa, \nit got down to minus 2 degrees, breaking a record that was held since \n1912--over 100 years; in Enid, OK, minus 3 degrees. In Bartlesville, it \nwent down to minus 14 degrees--colder than the South Pole, where it was \nonly minus 11 on that same day.\n  February 2014: 5,836 cold temperature records set around the country. \nMarch 2014: Snow cover at third highest level on record; 1969, 1978 \nwere higher. The Great Lakes, second highest ice cover on record--91 \npercent; 1979 is highest at 94 percent.\n  This is not surprising given the 15-year pause in global warming. \nNature magazine stated that over the last 15 years ``the observed \n[temperature] trend is . . . not significantly different from zero \n[and] suggests a temporary `hiatus' in global warming.''\n  The Economist magazine said the same thing.\n  The President hasn't acknowledged this. On multiple occasions he has \nsaid--this is a quote from the President: ``The temperature around the \nglobe is increasing faster than was predicted even 10 years ago.''\n  Unfortunately for his talking point, the data that has been reported \nin Nature, The Economist, and even in the United Nations IPCC report \nshows that this simply is not true. Increases in global temperature \nhave stalled over the last 15 years.\n  This has to be really shocking to an awful lot of advocates who put \ntheir reputation and their lives on the idea that this world is coming \nto an end and global warming is a reality.\n\n  Several weeks ago, in a hearing held in the EPW Committee, Gina \nMcCarthy--she is the one who is the current EPA Administrator--was \npressed on this point. Asked whether or not President Obama's statement \nwas true, she responded: ``I can't answer that.''\n  With all this in mind--climategate, recent cold temperatures, and a \n15-year hiatus--how could Congress, in good conscience, move forward \nwith legislation that gives EPA the authority to regulate greenhouse \ngases? How could EPA, more importantly, move forward with regulations \nbased off of this cooked science?\n  There have been several votes on global warming-related legislation \nover the past decade since we first started debating it here in the \nlate 1990s, but they have all failed to show that there have even been \nthe 60 votes required to pass cap and trade.\n  In 1997 the Byrd-Hagel legislation, 95 to 0, the United States should \nnot be a signator to the Kyoto Treaty. The Kyoto Treaty was a treaty \nthat was negotiated with Al Gore down in South America.\n  In 2003 we had the McCain-Lieberman bill. It failed 43 to 55. Then we \nhad the McCain-Lieberman bill again in 2005, and it failed 38 to 60. \nThe trend is going in the wrong direction for them.\n  In 2008 the Lieberman-Warner bill failed 48 to 36.\n\n[[Page S1384]]\n\n  In 2010, a resolution of disapproval on EPA's greenhouse gas rule was \n47 to 53.\n  In 2011, the Inhofe-Upton prohibition on greenhouse gas regulation \nwas 50-50. In 2013, the Inhofe-Upton prohibition on greenhouse gas \nregulations as a budget amendment was 47 to 52.\n  What I am saying here is the sentiment of the House and the Senate is \ngoing in the reverse direction. So it has been virtually impossible to \ntry to pass a cap-and-trade bill.\n  I know there are a lot of people who at one time were looking at this \nand feeling as though this was something that was going to be a \nreality. But I have to say this. One of the reasons--this is kind of \ninteresting. I am sorry my good friend from Massachusetts is not on the \nfloor right now. But I can remember back when Republicans were in the \nmajority in the Senate, and I was the chairman of a subcommittee of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee that was addressing this item. \nAt that time everyone was talking as though global warming was here and \nit must be true, and I believed it probably was true, until they came \nout with the financial analysis. What would it cost if we passed cap \nand trade as a law?\n  At that time the scientists and the economists from the Wharton \nSchool of Economics and from MIT who participated--all of the estimates \nwere between $300 billion and $400 billion a year. That is something we \nwant to be very careful about. I know every time we hear ``billion \ndollars'' it doesn't really register how much that is. In my State of \nOklahoma, what I do at the end of each year is I get the total number \nof people who filed a Federal tax return, and then I do my math as to \nwhat it is going to cost. For $300 billion to $400 billion a year, it \nwould cost each taxpayer in the State of Oklahoma some $3,000 a year. \nThat could be really significant, but not if there is a problem they \nare addressing out there. Getting back to Lisa Jackson, who is the \nObama appointee to be Administrator of the EPA, I asked the question--\nand this was at a hearing, and I am sure the Senator from California \nremembers this as well because it was in one of the hearings of that \ncommittee, live on TV.\n  I said: Right now we are looking at different bills. We are looking \nat the Waxman bill and several others. The cap and trades are pretty \nmuch cap and trades. If we were to pass this, any of this legislation, \nwould this have the effect of lowering the release of CO2?\n  Her answer was: No. The reason is this is not where the problem is. \nThe problem is in China, in India, in Mexico, and in places where they \ndo not have any regulations.\n  In fact, you can carry it one step further. If we were to pass that \neither by regulation or by legislation, and go ahead and incur this \nhuge tax increase--the largest tax increase in the history of America--\nif we were to do this, as she said, it would not lower greenhouse \ngases. It could increase them because we would have to be chasing our \nmanufacturing base where they could find the generation of electricity; \nand that would be in countries I just mentioned where they have no \nrestrictions at all. So it could increase, not decrease, the greenhouse \ngases.\n  This is very significant, but it is in the weeds to the point where \nit is rather difficult to understand. Under the Clean Air Act, the \nEPA--well, I want to talk about the timing just for a minute because we \nare going through this. Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA must finalize \nnew rules within 1 year of its publication in the Federal Register.\n  What I am saying now is, what they could not get done through \nlegislation they are trying to do through regulation. One of the things \nthey are trying to do is have the greenhouse gas legislation come under \nthe EPA.\n  Anytime you have a new EPA rule, it has to be finalized within 1 year \nof its publication in the Federal Register. So the rule was released on \nSeptember 20, 2013, but it was not published until January 8, 2014. Why \ndo you suppose that was? Had the new rule been published on September \n30, the rule would have gone into effect 6 weeks prior to the midterm \nelections and people would have known how much it was going to cost \nthem.\n  If there is any doubt in anyone's mind, I have an article that was \npublished on December 14 in the Washington Post that goes through the \ndetails as to why they did this so people would not know when they were \nvoting how much all these regulations were going to cost. I ask \nunanimous consent this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Dec. 14, 2013]\n\n  ICYMI: White House Delayed Enacting Rules Ahead of 2012 Election to \n                           Avoid Controversy\n\n                          (By Juliet Eilperin)\n\n       The White House systematically delayed enacting a series of \n     rules on the environment, worker safety and health care to \n     prevent them from becoming points of contention before the \n     2012 election, according to documents and interviews with \n     current and former administration officials.\n       Some agency officials were instructed to hold off \n     submitting proposals to the White House for up to a year to \n     ensure that they would not be issued before voters went to \n     the polls, the current and former officials said.\n       The delays meant that rules were postponed or never issued. \n     The stalled regulations included crucial elements of the \n     Affordable Care Act, what bodies of water deserved federal \n     protection, pollution controls for industrial boilers and \n     limits on dangerous silica exposure in the workplace.\n       The Obama administration has repeatedly said that any \n     delays until after the election were coincidental and that \n     such decisions were made without regard to politics. But \n     seven current and former administration officials told The \n     Washington Post that the motives behind many of the delays \n     were clearly political, as Obama's top aides focused on \n     avoiding controversy before his reelection.\n       The number and scope of delays under Obama went well beyond \n     those of his predecessors, who helped shape rules but did not \n     have the same formalized controls, said current and former \n     officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of \n     the sensitivity of the topic.\n       Those findings are bolstered by a new report from the \n     Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS), an \n     independent agency that advises the federal government on \n     regulatory issues. The report is based on anonymous \n     interviews with more than a dozen senior agency officials who \n     worked with the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs \n     (OIRA), which oversees the implementation of federal rules.\n       The report said internal reviews of proposed regulatory \n     changes ``took longer in 2011 and 2012 because of concerns \n     about the agencies issuing costly or controversial rules \n     prior to the November 2012 election.''\n       Emily Cain, spokeswoman for the Office of Management and \n     Budget, said in a statement that the administration's \n     ``approach to regulatory review is consistent with long-\n     standing precedent across previous administrations and fully \n     adheres'' to federal rules.\n       Administration officials noted that they issued a number of \n     controversial rules during Obama's first term, including \n     limits on mercury emissions for power plants and Medicaid \n     eligibility criteria under the Affordable Care Act.\n       ``OMB works as expeditiously as possible to review rules, \n     but when it comes to complex rules with significant potential \n     impact, we take the time needed to get them right,'' Cain \n     said.\n       But Ronald White, who directs regulatory policy at the \n     advocacy group Center for Effective Government, said the \n     ``overt manipulation of the regulatory review process by a \n     small White House office'' raises questions about how the \n     government writes regulations. He said the amount of time it \n     took the White House to review proposed rules was \n     ``particularly egregious over the past two years.''\n       Previous White House operations have weighed in on major \n     rules before they were officially submitted for review. But \n     Jeffrey Holmstead, who headed the EPA's Office of Air and \n     Radiation in the George W. Bush administration, said the \n     effort was not as extensive as the Obama administration's \n     approach.\n       ``There was no formalized process by which you had to get \n     permission to send them over,'' Holmstead said, referring to \n     rules being submitted to the White House.\n       The recent decision to bring on Democratic strategist John \n     Podesta as a senior White House adviser is likely to \n     accelerate the number of new rules and executive orders, \n     given Podesta's long-standing support for using executive \n     action to achieve the president's goals despite congressional \n     opposition.\n       Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who chairs the Judiciary \n     Subcommittee on Oversight, Federal Rights and Agency Action, \n     said he's concerned about the real-world impact of the \n     postponements in the first term.\n       ``Legal protection delayed is protection denied,'' \n     Blumenthal said. ``I've spoken to officials at the top rungs \n     of the White House power structure and at OIRA and we're \n     going to hold their feet to the fire, and we're going to make \n     sure they're held accountable in a series of hearings.''\n       The officials interviewed for the ACUS report, whose names \n     were withheld from publication by the study authors, said \n     that starting in 2012 they had to meet with an OIRA desk \n     officer before submitting each significant rule for formal \n     review. They called the sessions ``Mother-may-I'' meetings, \n     according to the study.\n\n[[Page S1385]]\n\n       The accounts were echoed by four Obama administration \n     political appointees and three career officials interviewed \n     by The Post.\n       At the Environmental Protection Agency, for example, a \n     former official said that only two managers had the authority \n     to request a major rule in 2012: then-administrator Lisa P. \n     Jackson and deputy administrator Bob Perciasepe. Perciasepe \n     and OIRA's director at the time, Cass Sunstein, would have \n     ``weekly and sometimes semi-weekly discussions'' to discuss \n     rules that affected the economy, one said, because they had \n     political consequences, the person said.\n       ``As we entered the run-up to the election, the word went \n     out the White House was not anxious to review new rules,'' \n     the former official said.\n       Sunstein, who has returned to his post as a Harvard Law \n     School professor, declined to comment.\n       Several significant EPA proposals were withheld as a result \n     of those meetings, officials said, including a proposal \n     requiring cleaner gasoline and lower-pollution vehicles that \n     had won the support of automakers but angered the oil \n     industry.\n       That regulation, which would reduce the amount of sulfur in \n     U.S. gasoline by two-thirds and impose fleetwide pollution \n     limits on new vehicles by 2017, was ready in December 2011, \n     said three officials familiar with the proposal. But agency \n     officials were told to wait a year to submit it for review \n     because critics could use it to suggest that the \n     administration was raising gas prices, they said. The EPA \n     issued the proposed rule in March.\n       Other EPA regulations that were delayed beyond the 2012 \n     election included rules on coal ash disposal, water pollution \n     rules for streams and wetlands, air emissions from industrial \n     boilers and cement kilns, and carbon dioxide limits for \n     existing power plants.\n       Ross Eisenberg, who serves as vice president of energy and \n     resources policy at the National Association for \n     Manufacturers and has criticized several EPA regulations, \n     noted that in the past year the administration moved ahead \n     with proposals such as the rules on greenhouse gas emissions \n     and boilers.\n       ``The agenda certainly did slow down, but it doesn't \n     change,'' he said.\n       The administration also was slow to handle rules pertaining \n     to its health-care law. Several key regulations did not come \n     out until after the 2012 election, including one defining \n     what constitutes ``essential health benefits'' under a health \n     plan and which Americans could qualify for federal subsidies \n     if they opted to enroll in a state or a federal marketplace \n     plan.\n       The latter focused on what constitutes ``affordable.'' \n     Treasury proposed a regulation in August 2011 saying an \n     employer plan was affordable as long as the premium for an \n     individual was no more than 9.5 percent of the taxpayer's \n     household income. Several groups--including labor unions--\n     argued that the proposal did not take into account that the \n     premium for a family plan might be much higher than that \n     standard.\n       Unions represent a vital part of the Democratic coalition, \n     in part because they help mobilize voters during elections.\n       The Treasury Department held the proposal back while \n     finalizing all the other tax-credit rules on May 23, 2012. \n     Treasury officials later told those working on the regulation \n     that it could not be published before the election, according \n     to a government official familiar with the decision who spoke \n     on the condition of anonymity because of its sensitive \n     nature. The department made the rule on Feb. 1.\n       OMB has reduced the length of time that rules are pending \n     this year. The agency has cut the number of rules that were \n     under review for more than 200 days by more than half.\n       But while the administration is pressing ahead, activists \n     say the delays took a toll. Peg Seminario, director of safety \n     and health for the AFL-CIO, points to an update of the \n     nation's silica standards proposed Sept. 12 after a long \n     delay. The rule, which would prevent an estimated 688 deaths \n     and 1,585 silica-related illnesses each year, won't be \n     finalized until 2016.\n       Jon Devine, a senior lawyer in the Natural Resources \n     Defense Council's water program, said small streams and \n     wetlands remain vulnerable because of the administration's \n     foot-dragging. The EPA recently withdrew a proposal to \n     outline what kind of water bodies deserve federal protection \n     that had been pending since February 2012 and announced it \n     would issue a legally binding rule instead.\n       ``What's disappointing is it leaves waters subject to the \n     existing, weak state of affairs until they get the rule over \n     the final hurdle,'' Devine said.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. There are more impacts that are taking place. The \ngreenhouse gas regulations for existing powerplants are expected to be \nreleased in June of 2014.\n  The other regulations that are out there--and I am not going to spend \nany time on this because there are too many. But on the greenhouse gas \nlegislation--even though when it started, it was Charles Rivers and the \nWharton School and MIT--they came out with the approximation of $300 to \n$400 billion a year; and that is every year. The greenhouse gas \nregulatory costs under the Clean Air Act are totally different. No one \nhas even calculated this yet.\n  I would like to make sure we understand that under the bill my good \nfriend Ed Markey and Waxman put forth, it would regulate the emissions \nof those organizations that emit 25,000 tons or more. However, if you \ndo it through the Clean Air Act, it would be 250 tons. So you are \ntalking about instead of 25,000 tons--which might be only the very \nlarge organizations; refineries and that type of thing--under the Clean \nAir Act, which is what they are attempting to do today as we speak, it \nwould be just 250 tons, which would be every school, every hospital, \nevery shop, and many residences.\n  So the greenhouse gas regulatory costs--if it costs $300 to $400 \nbillion to regulate organizations that emit 25,000 tons, how much would \nit be if they emitted 250 tons? It is something that has not even been \ncalculated yet.\n  So we have all of these impacts of the regulations that take place. \nBut the greatest of all would be, if you think about the cumulative \nimpact study back--I have introduced legislation, along with several \nothers. I know John Barrasso and several others have cosponsored \nlegislation that would tell the public the cumulative effect of all \nthese regulations.\n  For example, as to the ozone regulations: 77 Oklahoma counties would \nbe out of attainment; 7 million jobs would be lost.\n  As to Utility MACT--that is something that did pass--a $100 billion \ncost--1.65 million jobs lost. It has already been implemented.\n  Boiler MACT--and every manufacturing company has a boiler; and \n``MACT'' means ``maximum achievable control technology''--Boiler MACT \nis costing $63 billion, and 800,000 jobs have already been lost.\n  The BLM fracking regulations would be $100,000 per well--duplicative \nof effective State regulations, which have been doing very well now \nsince 1948.\n  And there are greenhouse gas costs of $300 to $400 billion.\n  So I guess what I am saying here--and I know I am using up quite a \nbit of time, but it is important to look and see what has happened \nsince the time they were all talking about global warming. Everybody \nwas talking about it, and how they are going to have an all-night thing \nto try to revive it because the public has gone in the other direction.\n  George Mason University had a study where they actually interviewed \nseveral hundred of the TV meteorological people. Mr. President, 63 \npercent of them said that if global warming is taking place, it is from \nnatural causes, not from global warming.\n  Polar bears. Everyone is concerned about polar bears. I know my good \nfriend from California gave me a polar bear. It is my favorite coffee \ncup and I use it all the time. But between the 1950s and 1960s, the \nnumber of polar bears that were wandering around out there was between \n5,000 and 10,000. Today, it is between 15,000 and 25,000.\n  The threats. A lot of times when people cannot win an argument, then \nthey threaten. NASA's James Hansen said this is ``high crimes against \nhumanity.'' Robert Kennedy, Jr., called me a ``call girl,'' a \n``prostitute.'' Robert Kennedy, Jr., also said: ``This is treason. And \nwe need to start treating them as traitors.'' In other words, we need \nto start killing people.\n  In 2006, the eco-magazine Grist called for Nuremberg-style trials for \nskeptics. September 29, 2007: Virginia State climatologist skeptical of \nglobal warming loses his job after a clash with the Governor. ``I was \ntold that I could not speak in public.''\n  Barone: Warmists have a ``desire to kill heretics.''\n  The Weather Channel--Heidi Cullen, by the way, is a meteorologist on \nthe Weather Channel. She is off with an environmental group right now, \nso she is not around anymore.\n  Polling--where the American people are going; I think it is important \nto understand--this is a Gallup poll that is a current one right now. \nAccording to a Gallup poll, climate change is the least important \nenvironmental issue among the voters.\n  In March of 2010, the same Gallup poll: Americans rank global warming \ndead last, 8 out of 8 environmental issues.\n  In March 2010, Rasmussen: 72 percent of American voters do not \nbelieve global warming is a ``very serious problem.''\n  The global warmist Robert Socolow laments:\n\n\n[[Page S1386]]\n\n\n       We are losing the argument with the public, big time. . . . \n     I think the climate change activists, myself included, have \n     lost the American Middle.\n\n  So there are definitely some things going on here that are not in \ntheir favor.\n  I would like to mention this, though. I think a lot of people have \ntalked about the various scientists. On my Web site you can look up \nseveral thousand--this is a long time ago--I think we passed through \n1,000 qualified scientists way back in 2006, and it has gone up since \nthat time to many, many, so it is something where there are a lot of \nscientists. One of my favorite scientists is one because he is a Nobel \nprize-winning Stanford University physicist. He said:\n\n       Please remain calm. The earth will heal itself--climate is \n     beyond our power to control. The earth doesn't care about \n     governments and legislation. Climate change is a matter of \n     geologic time . . . something the earth does on its own \n     without asking anyone's permission or explaining itself.\n\n  Richard Lindzen of MIT was a former U.N. IPCC receiver. He said: If \nthe government wants carbon control, that is the answer the NAS will \nprovide. He is the one who also said: The ultimate controlling factor \nis once you control CO2, you control people.\n  The Harvard Smithsonian Study. The study examined the results of more \nthan 240 peer-reviewed papers published by thousands of researchers \nover the past four decades. The study covers a multitude of geophysical \nand biological climate indicators. They came to the conclusion that \nclimate change is not real and that the science is not accurate.\n  Dr. Fred Seitz--he is the former president of the National Academy of \nSciences--said: ``There is no convincing evidence that human release of \ncarbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gases is causing or will, \nin the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth's \natmosphere and disruption of the Earth's climate.''\n  So we have a lot of scientists on both sides of this issue. I think \nthe American people have woken up. I use something quite often because \nit is a little bit comical--and this is just kind of from memory, but \nthis is something that actually did happen. Mr. President, 1895 was the \nfirst time we had, in recent history--we have had cold spells before, \nand we had the medieval warm period and all of that stuff; that was a \nlong time ago--but in 1895--starting with current, more modern \nhistory--they had a cold spell that came in. That is where, I say to my \nfriend from New Hampshire, they first came up with a new ice age that \nwas coming. That was in 1895. That lasted from 1895 to 1918. Then, in \n1918, they came along with a warming period. That was the first time we \nheard the term ``global warming.'' That was in 1918, and that lasted \nuntil 1948.\n  And get this. These are about 30-year cycles. That lasted until about \n1945. In 1945, all of a sudden it changed from this warming period to a \ncooling period. That lasted until 1975. Then it changed to a warming \nperiod. Now, since 2000, it has leveled off, and we are going into \nanother cycle. You can almost set your watch by these cycles.\n  Here is an interesting thing about that. In 1948, when it changed \nfrom a warming period to a cooling period, that coincided with the \ngreatest single release of CO2 in history. That was right \nafter World War II.\n  So these are the things that are happening. I know they are going to \nenjoy staying up all night. They will have an audience of themselves, \nand I hope they enjoy it.\n  But I have to say this in all sincerity. When you see something, and \ninstead of going right along with the public and saying, it must be \ntrue because everybody is saying it--and everybody goes over and over \nagain and talks about the climate is real and the science is real, and \nall that--well, that happens when it is not real, and that is what we \nhave been going through.\n  Right now I know President Obama is going through all kinds of \nefforts to try to do through regulations what the elected people would \nnot do in the House, as well as in the Senate. When people realize--and \nthey will be reminded again, even though it has been a while--now, I \nthink it might be clever that after several years now where people have \nbeen talking about global warming that now they are trying to revive \nit, and that is what you are going to hear all night long here tonight.\n  It is kind of interesting that this is happening at a time that we \nare going through this cold spell. It certainly has not been much fun \nin Oklahoma.\n  So I think the American people are not ready to pass the largest tax \nincrease in the history of America, and we will have to wait and see.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it was with great interest that I listened \nto my friend. I suppose we are making progress. He used to call climate \nchange a hoax, and he did not say that. So maybe he is moving in our \ndirection.\n  But I also want to point out, he says we are going to be talking to \nourselves. I am happy to report that I just learned of two petitions, \none that has 65,000 signatures calling on us to act and another that \nhas 30,000 signatures calling on us to act, and the night is young.\n  Now, my friend from Oklahoma----\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield for an observation, since the \nSenator mentioned my name?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if the time is taken off their time, I am \nhappy to yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The reason I did not use the word ``hoax'' is because \nthen I might be guilty of advertising my book, and I certainly did not \nwant to do that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is wonderful. I am so happy you did not use hoaxes, \nand maybe there is a way for us to come closer together on this issue. \nBut let my say this: People are listening. People care. Because when 97 \nto 98 percent of the scientists say something is real, they do not have \nanything pressing them to say that other than the truth. They do not \nhave any other agenda. They do not work for the oil companies.\n  I will tell you, as chairman of the environment committee, every time \nthe Republicans choose a so-called expert on climate, we have tracked \nthem to special interest funding, those 3 percent. They know where \ntheir bread is buttered. I am sorry my friend left. I guess he could \nnot stand to hear the truth. So I will put that truth into the Record.\n  I do not know how my Republican colleagues can continue to deny that \nclimate change is happening. One would think they could see it out \ntheir window, because as my colleague says: Oh, there was such cold \nweather. That has been predicted by the scientists, extreme weather. \nHere is the U.S. Global Change Research Program, their National Climate \nAssessment draft: Some extreme weather and climate events have \nincreased in recent decades. We have seen heavy downpours, more severe \ndroughts, and some extremes.\n  At the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works climate \nchange briefing, Dr. Marshall Shepherd, president of the American \nMeteorological Society, and a director of the Atmospheric Sciences \nProgram at the University of Georgia, said:\n\n       Climate change is increasing the probability of extreme \n     events, and in some cases maybe strengthening their intensity \n     or increasing their frequency. We are loading the dice \n     towards more Sandy or blizzard-type storms.\n\n  So when my friend says: The planet is not warming; it is cold, we all \nknow it is not about the weather. It is about the climate. It is about \nthe long term--and, yes, we are going to see these extreme weather \nconditions.\n  I would say that when my friends call us alarmists, that is \nridiculous. We are trying to do our job. We are not scientists. We are \nnot doctors either, for the most part, but we want to make sure people \nhave health care coverage. We are not scientists, but we want to \nprotect our people from the ravages of climate.\n  I would ask my colleague Senator Schatz would he like me to go \nanother 5 minutes, 10 minutes or 2 minutes? It is up to him. I can \nwithhold. I am going to be here for quite a few hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. If the Senator from California wanted to go for another 2 \nor 3 minutes, I could give remarks for about 10, and then the senior \nSenator from Oregon has remarks to give as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n[[Page S1387]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely. Will the Presiding Officer tell me when I \nhave used 3 minutes and then I will yield the floor at that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so notified.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We just heard 45 minutes from my friend Jim Inhofe, whom \nI have a very friendly relationship with but who I think is a dangerous \ndenier, a dangerous denier in the face of 97 percent agreement among \nscientists.\n  He talks about international groups. I wish to talk about the \nNational Academy of Sciences. Here is what they said: ``Levels of \ncarbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses in earth's atmosphere are \nexceeding levels recorded in the past millions of years.''\n  That is our own National Academy of Sciences. I guess if we went out \nand asked the public do they support the National Academy of Sciences, \nI think it would come in at 90 percent, and the other 10 percent would \nsay, I will get back to you.\n  Then we have more from the National Academy:\n\n       Climate change is occurring. It is very likely caused \n     primarily by the emission of greenhouse gasses from human \n     activity.\n\n  They go on:\n\n       Human activities have increased greenhouse gas \n     concentrations in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide, the main \n     greenhouse gas, is emitted by human activities and it has \n     risen almost 40 percent over the past 150 years.\n\n  So when you hear my colleagues on the other side of the aisle stand \nand deny this, how about the U.S. National Climate Assessment? This is \nthe United States of America, our experts:\n\n       Global sea level has risen by about 8 inches since reliable \n     recordkeeping began. It is projected to rise another 1 to 4 \n     feet by 2100.\n\n  That is dangerous. We have already seen it happening. I could go on, \nand I will come back, but I will conclude with this. I am, in my \nconcluding remarks, going to tell you about every incredibly \nprestigious scientific group that has warned us about climate change: \nThe joint world science academies' statement, the American Association \nfor the Advancement of Science, the American Chemical Society, the \nAmerican Geophysical Union, the American Institute of Biological \nScientists, the American Society of Plant Biologists, the Association \nof Ecosystem Research Centers, the Botanical Society of America, the \nCrop Science Society of America, the Natural Science Collections \nAlliance, the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, the Soil \nScience Society of America, the American Medical Association, the \nAmerican Meteorological Society, the American Geophysical Union----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 3 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent for 30 additional seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Geological Society of America. All I can say is, to \ncome down here and accuse the Democrats of being alarmist, when all we \nare trying to do is protect the health and safety of the American \npeople, of their families and future generations, is extreme while we \nare in the mainstream.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I would like to address some of the tropes \nthat our climate deniers tend to use. I will go through a couple of \nthose before our great senior Senator from the great State of Oregon \ngives his remarks.\n  The first trope is: It is not warming. The ``it is not warming'' \ncrowd will not even admit that the Earth is warming. Their favorite \ntactic is to point out the window during winter and say: Look at the \nsnow on the ground. Climate change is bunk.\n  That is not an adult argument. Under that theory, winter weather \nanywhere disproves climate change. Snowstorms are weather. Weather is \nnot climate. Weather is a local phenomenon over extremely short \ntimespans. Weather is what it is going to be like tomorrow. Weather is \nnot climate. Climate is long-term weather trends over vast regions. \nThis is not difficult to distinguish among adults. It is easy to make a \njoke about how cold it is and therefore climate change is bunk.\n  But the vast majority of science disproves that assertion. Pointing \nout the window on a cold day and laughing about climate change is one \nof the most profoundly unserious things that otherwise good and \nresponsible leaders in this Chamber do. Part of this country's \ngreatness is our pragmatism. We see the world as it is and fix the \nthings we can. For that, we need reliable information. When it comes to \nclimate change, we have reliable information. We ignore it at our \nperil.\n  For those who say the Earth is not warming, I would like to talk \nabout thermometers. They measure temperature. We have them all over the \nworld, very sophisticated ones run by very smart people. They provide a \nlot of data that has proven beyond a doubt that the atmosphere and that \nthe oceans are warming. Even prominent climate skeptics such as \nAmerican scientist Richard Muller can no longer argue.\n  After exhaustive research, Dr. Muller said in 2012:\n\n       Our results show that the average temperature of the \n     earth's land has risen by two and a half degrees Fahrenheit \n     over the last 250 years, including an increase of one and a \n     half degrees over the most recent 50 years. Moreover, it \n     appears likely that essentially all of this increase results \n     from the human emission of greenhouse gases.\n\n  This was a prominent climate denier previously.\n  Two, relying on anecdotes to disprove what is actually happening. A \nresearch vessel got stuck in summer ice in Antarctica. More and more \ndeniers are being forced to rely on out-of-context anecdotes to support \ntheir false claims. In December, they got very excited about a research \nvessel that was stuck in the summer sea ice in Antarctica, claiming it \nas proof that the Earth is not warming. Here is the thing. It is an \nAntarctica. It is at the bottom of the Earth. It is one of the coldest \nplaces in the world. One summer's ice in Antarctica does not suddenly \ninvalidate millions of worldwide temperature measurements from all over \nthe planet.\n  They do this whether glaciers are growing or melting. Even though 90 \npercent of the world's glaciers are melting, they pick off one and use \nit as proof that climate change is somehow not an established \nscientific fact, even though it is.\n  The fourth trope we hear, and this is a pivot, we are starting to \nhear it more and more: It may be warming, but maybe we did not cause \nit. They begrudgingly admit that the Earth is warming but say: Hey, \nthis is part of a natural cycle. Natural cycles have happened before \nand they will happen again.\n  Recently, Dr. James Powell, a geochemist, former college president \nand National Science Board member, studied all peer-reviewed articles \non climate change--all peer-reviewed articles on climate change from \n1991 to 2013. He found just over 25,000 articles written since 1991. Of \n25,000 articles, only 26--only 26 rejected the premise of human-caused \nclimate change. This is no longer a real debate. It is only a debate in \nthe four corners of this Capitol. People across the Nation, insurance \ncompanies, the Department of Defense, most governments across the \nplanet, our biggest corporations, regular people of all political \nstripes and in every State understand that this is what is happening to \nus.\n  Some deniers also like to use responsible scientists' methods against \nthem. The truth about scientists is that they are scientists, which is \nto say they entertain doubt; they ask questions; they are not afraid to \nexpress their doubts; they observe and refine their theories. So \ndeniers cannot in good conscience use the scientific process as \nevidence that doubt still exists. Sure, there is uncertainty among \nscientists, but it is pretty much just about whether future impacts of \nclimate change will be really bad or extremely bad.\n  The sixth trope is: It is not a big deal. Maybe it is even good. As \ndeniers paint themselves even further into a corner, they become \ndesperate. We now come to the category of those who admit the Earth is \nwarming, admit it is caused by humans but claim the effects are \nnegligible or, even more preposterously, they might be good for us.\n  My colleagues and I have presented evidence from study after study \nafter study showing that while the changes so far are manageable in \nsome places, if we do not change our ways, the bad news will start \ncoming faster and faster. Absent major reforms, the rate of\n\n[[Page S1388]]\n\nchange will increase. We may not notice half a degree of average \ntemperature increase here and there, but on a geological timescale, \nthese changes are occurring at recordbreaking speed.\n  In many cases, they may be happening too quickly for nature or \nhumanity to adapt. A 2012 study commissioned by 20 governments, which \nwas written by more than 50 scientists, economists, and other experts, \nfound that by 2030 the cost of climate change and air pollution \ncombined will rise to 3.2 percent of global GDP, with the world's \nleast-developed countries most impacted, possibly suffering losses of \nup to 11 percent of their GDP.\n  Developed countries will not be exempt from these impacts. The study \nfinds that climate change could wipe out 2 percent of our GDP by the \nyear 2030. That is a big deal.\n  Finally, the trope that China is doing nothing so our actions do not \nmatter. This category of deniers accepts the reality, causes, and \nseriousness of climate change, but then they say it is hopeless because \ncountries such as China and others are doing nothing to reduce their \nimage.\n  That is flat wrong. Here is the evidence. In September, the Chinese \nState Council released its atmospheric pollution action plan, which \ncalled for a reduction in the construction of new coal-fired \npowerplants and a goal of generating 13 percent of its electricity from \nclean energy from renewable sources by 2017.\n  Chinese officials have announced they plan to institute a tax on \ncarbon pollution in 2015 or 2016. Certain regions have also begun to \nimplement pilot cap-and-trade programs, and they have plans to create a \nnational carbon market by 2020.\n  How about current investments? In 2012, the United States spent about \n$35 billion on renewables, while China spent $64 billion.\n  Finally, there is the nothing-we-can-do denial trope. Let's throw in \nthe towel. This crowd accepts the science, accepts the impacts but \nseems to have just given up.\n  When did we start thinking we couldn't solve America's big problems? \nWhen did we start thinking we were too small or not important enough to \nmake a difference?\n  I don't believe that. I believe that when America leads, the world \nfollows. For this country to lead, this Congress needs to act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Warren). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, earlier this evening I touched on the \nnumbers that underlie this debate--the numbers from the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the numbers from the National \nAcademy of Sciences--and said they really drive me to the judgment that \nclimate change is the scientific equivalent of a speeding Mack truck. \nBut I believe numbers don't really capture this discussion fully \nbecause what people want to know is the impact of climate change in \ntheir community, what it truly means for them in their part of the \ncountry.\n  To get into those impacts, I will start with one that is shellacking \nmy home State; that is, the wildfires that are burning longer, getting \nhotter, and starting earlier. Drought and high temperatures from \nclimate change are driving all of this. During the early part of this \npast year's fire season, intense wildfires once again burned across the \nWestern United States, threatening population centers and destroying \nhundreds of homes. This winter, fires have already burned in western \nOregon--something that used to be very rare. The number of houses that \nhave burned in our country from wildfires has increased a staggering \n400 percent in only the past couple of years and is projected to get \nfar worse. In 2012, 2 percent of my home State of Oregon burned in just \none summer and nearly 1.5 million acres burned across the Pacific \nNorthwest. Wildfires, of course, have always been part of life in my \nhome State, but the fires of recent years are getting hotter and are \nsignificantly more threatening to homes.\n  Our country's top scientists say the conditions that caused these \nrecent fire seasons to become more severe, including drought \naccompanied by above-average temperatures, are more common now due to \nhuman-induced climate change. Over the past 30 years the fire season \nhas become 2\\1/2\\ months longer and both the number and severity of \nforest fires in the American West have increased several-fold. \nScientists who have examined this issue say climate change is a \nsignificant factor behind it.\n  To their credit, the Obama administration has indicated that they \nwant to work with Senators of both political parties to tackle this \nissue. In particular, what they have suggested--and Senator Crapo, the \nRepublican Senator from Idaho, and I have pushed this strongly--is that \ninstead of shorting the prevention fund, which is the heart of the \nproblem--we have to go in and thin out these overstocked stands--\ninstead of shorting the prevention fund, which is what happens every \nyear now, because these fires are so big and so hot, what happens is \nthe bureaucracy comes in and takes money from the prevention fund in \norder to suppress the fires, and the problem, of course, gets worse \nbecause we don't have the funds for prevention.\n  The administration wants to work with Democrats and Republicans in \nthe Senate and in the other body so that the most serious fires--only \nthe most serious ones--get handled from the disaster fund. We believe \nthis is going to free up additional support for efforts to prevent \nthese fires, and that will be beneficial to our communities.\n  Second, I would like to focus on power sector vulnerability. The \ndrought and high temperatures that can lead to the wildfires and make \nour power grid more vulnerable also raise the question of the \nimplications for our grid and for taxpayers.\n  Much of that vulnerability comes from changes in water supply and \nwater temperature. Water plays two critical roles in generating \nelectricity. Water is needed for generating hydropower--something we do \na lot of in the Pacific Northwest. It is also needed for cooling in \nmany other types of generation, such as nuclear, biomass, and coal. For \nthose generators, water must not only be available in sufficient \nquantities, but it has to be cool enough to allow the plants to run \nsafely and efficiently. That means climate change poses a double threat \nto some of these facilities.\n  This is not a hypothetical situation; recent history has already \nshown the power sector's vulnerability to both drought and high \ntemperatures. In 2001, for example, severe drought in the Pacific \nNorthwest and California significantly reduced hydroelectric \ngeneration, causing tight electricity supplies and high prices \nthroughout the West. That drought was estimated to have an economic \nimpact of between $2.5 billion and $6 billion.\n  High temperatures have also made water too hot to actually be able to \ncool some powerplants. In 2007 the Tennessee Valley Authority had to \ntemporarily shut down its Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant because the intake \nwater temperatures were too high. In 2012 the Millstone nuclear plant \nthat powers half of Connecticut had to take 40 percent of its capacity \noffline for almost 2 weeks because the cooling water it was getting \nfrom Long Island Sound was too warm. In that same year the Braidwood \nnuclear facility in Illinois had to get an exemption to use intake \nwater that was 102 degrees instead of shutting down during a heat wave. \nWhen somebody has their air-conditioning on high because it is over 100 \ndegrees, that is not a time that we can afford to be taking a base load \npowerplant offline.\n  So far it has been possible to get through the heat- and drought-\nrelated shutdowns of these powerplants without major outages, but let's \nmake no mistake about it--the ratepayers have definitely felt them in \ntheir power bills. In Texas during the summer of 2011, for example, \nelectricity was selling on the spot market for $3,000 per megawatt \nhour--well over 100 times the normal rate.\n\n  Next I would like to talk about the effects of climate on energy \ninfrastructure. The power sector isn't the only bit of energy \ninfrastructure that is vulnerable to climate change. Recently, I--along \nwith the majority leader, Senator Reid, Senator Franken, Senator \nHarkin, and Senator Mark Udall--asked the Government Accountability \nOffice to look into the effects of climate change on energy \ninfrastructure.\n  That report was just released. What the Government Accountability \nOffice\n\n[[Page S1389]]\n\nfound is that climate changes are projected to affect infrastructure \nthroughout all major stages of the energy supply chain--of course, once \nagain increasing the risk of energy disruption.\n  In addition to power sector vulnerabilities, the GAO also found \nvulnerabilities among the infrastructure for producing and extracting \nnatural resources, including oil and gas platforms, refineries, and \nprocessing plants. This infrastructure is often located near the coast, \nmaking it vulnerable to severe weather and sea level rise.\n  Fuel transportation and storage infrastructure, including pipelines, \nbarges, railways, and storage tanks, are also susceptible to damage \nfrom severe weather, melting permafrost, and increased precipitation.\n  I close by outlining some of the steps that can actually be taken to \ndeal with these issues. I am sure people who are following this \ndiscussion tonight are saying: All right, they are making a good case \nabout the nature of the problem. So what else. What comes next in terms \nof our ability to take action to deal with this.\n  I have said before that there are a host of areas where we are going \nto have to work in a global kind of manner to build support with other \ncountries for tackling climate change, but there is no question that \nthis Senate can put points on the board this year in the fight against \nclimate change.\n  I am very pleased to have been able to work with our colleague \nSenator Murkowski, the ranking Republican on the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, over this past year. Until recently I served as \nchairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and we were \nable to pass a major law to spur development of hydropower, which is \none of America's forgotten renewables. Hydropower already makes up two-\nthirds of our country's renewable power, so this is obviously a vital \nrenewable source of energy. Our legislation makes it easier to put \nhydro on existing dams, irrigation canals, and conduits, and we believe \nit is going to spark big investments in clean renewable power. The \nNational Hydropower Association estimates that there are 60,000 \nmegawatts of potential new hydropower in our country yet to be \nharnessed.\n  In addition, our committee passed an important bill to cut redtape \nassociated with developing geothermal power on public lands.\n  My colleagues and I urge the administration to take steps to have \ntools at their disposal to invest in energy efficiency and use the \nsavings to pay for those upgrades.\n  I look forward, here on the floor of the Senate, to being able to \npass what I would call the platonic ideal of consensus energy \nlegislation; that is, the bill that has been sponsored by our \ncolleagues, Senator Shaheen and Senator Portman. I am very pleased that \nwe had a promising development over the past few weeks where we brought \ntogether those who care about trying to promote clean and renewable \nenergy in Federal buildings. We have been able to get common ground \nbetween Senators of differing views. I look forward to seeing that \nbill, the Shaheen-Portman bill, on the floor of the Senate.\n  The fact is a number of our renewable energy sources have been on a \nroll over the past several years, demonstrating their potential.\n  For example, onshore wind has installed tens of thousands of \nmegawatts of capacity in recent years when the policy support has been \nin place. As expected, the costs have come down with technology \nimprovements, experience, economies of scale, and as a deep domestic \nsupply chain has built up to manufacture all of the components of the \nwind turbines and towers. The policy support has been working, and wind \nis now knocking at the door of competitiveness with fossil \ntechnologies.\n  Offshore wind is also picking up steam, even off the coast of my home \nState, where the waters have always been too deep for offshore wind to \nbe possible. A company called Principle Power is trying to solve that \nproblem by demonstrating floating offshore wind turbines just off the \ncoast of Coos Bay in my home State. Putting a turbine on a floating \nplatform instead of mounting it on a tower on the ocean floor has the \npotential to dramatically change the potential for offshore wind. It \nwould let developers tap into the huge windy resource above the deep \nwaters off the coast of Oregon and elsewhere but without the footprints \non the ocean floor and without affecting views from the coast. It is a \npromising technology, but, like all first-of-a-kind technology, it is \ngoing to cost a bit more. That is why we ought to get policy support--\nso we can realize the potential of commercial-scale energy.\n  Finally, the costs of solar power have also been dropping like a \nrock. The potential for sustainable biomass to provide a quadruple win \nof low-carbon energy, increased forest health, reduced danger of forest \nfires, and economic growth is still there waiting to be fully \ndeveloped.\n  I wish to touch on two remaining issues, and one is before the Senate \nFinance Committee. It is my strong view that the tax treatment of all \nenergy production in the United States ought to be modified so that all \nenergy sources compete on a technology-neutral level playing field. \nThat ought to be one of the major goals of comprehensive tax reform, \nwhich, in my view, is really the grand bipartisan prize for Senate \nFinance Committee members.\n  In the short-term, we have another challenge. We shouldn't let the \nrenewable energy industries that are so important simply fall off the \ncliff just when the supply chains have been developed and just when \nthey are reaching a level of competitiveness where they can really take \noff.\n  It is my hope that it is possible to work in a bipartisan way. I \nintend to talk to Senator Hatch, the ranking Republican on the Finance \nCommittee, and colleagues on both sides of the aisle to work on a tax \nextenders package that includes a variety of clean energy and \nefficiency credits. Senator Hatch and I have been interested in moving \nforward this spring through the regular order and markup of this kind \nof energy package in the Finance Committee.\n  I will close by talking about natural gas because to capture all of \nthe climate benefits we also have to factor in the dramatic shale gas \nrevolution. We understand that natural gas has turned the energy \nequation upside down over the past few years. Along the way, it has \nprovided a low-cost way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the same \ntime. Increased usage of natural gas has helped our country to reach \nits lowest level of greenhouse gas emissions since 1994, even as the \neconomy has been picking up steam. Manufacturing and industrial \noperations have been moving back to the United States to take advantage \nof cheap reliable gas.\n\n  This is good news that was almost unimaginable just a few years ago, \nbut we have some major challenges as well. I am concerned that methane \nemissions from leaky compressors and leaky pipes could undermine the \nemission benefits of natural gas in a way that isn't being accounted \nfor. A recent report which showed a leakage rate of just 3 percent \nthrough the entire natural gas supply chain can make burning natural \ngas the same as burning coal from a climate perspective. So I have been \npushing hard with colleagues here in the Senate to keep that leakage \nrate below 1 percent from production to usage to make sure that climate \nbenefits come to reality.\n  There are technologies that can address the issue of leakage, and \nthey already exist. They can be put in place at almost no net cost, \nwith many of the measures paying for themselves. There has been a \ncomprehensive survey of the measures for reducing methane leaks through \nthe natural gas supply and usage chain, and it found emissions could be \nreduced by 40 percent with technologies that already exist and are \npractical today.\n  The scale of this problem is, of course, immense, and it is what \nSenators are talking about here tonight. It is going to take everyone \npulling together at every level to make the meaningful changes actually \nhappen. We are going to need continued leadership from our \nentrepreneurs, who aren't sitting idly by but are innovating to come up \nwith solutions to climate change. We are going to need savvy consumers \ndemanding lower carbon and more efficient goods and services. We will \nneed leadership from retailers who are going to ask more of their \nsuppliers and supply chains to\n\n[[Page S1390]]\n\ngive them products to sell to those consumers. Of course, the key is \nalways innovation in the private sector--the private-sector leaders \nworking with our national labs and universities.\n  I am especially proud that my home State of Oregon is going to lead \nthe State efforts in trying to promote sustainability, renewables, and \nefficiency at the local level.\n  To wrap up my remarks, let me state the obvious. It is going to take \nnew leadership from the Congress. The Congress is going to have to lead \nif we are going to get a long-term framework for a low-carbon economy \nthat innovators, entrepreneurs, and others can use in the days ahead to \naddress the global nature of this problem, and I think we are up to it \nhere in the Senate. I think we are up to doing it in a bipartisan way, \nand that is what I look forward to being part of in the days ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, Senator Feinstein is scheduled to \nspeak next, and we are delighted that she is.\n\n\n                           Dinner Invitation\n\n  I just wanted to make a public service announcement at this point in \nthe evening. Any staff, Senators who are here through the night, any \nfloor staff, Republican floor staff as well, all are invited; and for \nany of the parliamentary staff who are interested, there is dinner \navailable in Room S. 219, and better to get it while it is hot.\n  That is the end of the public service announcement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order with respect \nto alternating blocks of time be vitiated and that the Senate remain in \na period of morning business until 8:45 a.m., Tuesday, March 11, with \nSenators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nbetween 20 and 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I want to begin by thanking my friend and colleague, \nSenator Boxer, for her leadership. It was 2 years ago that she began a \nclimate action task force that took place at noon, when all our \nstomachs were grumbling for food, but it provided some very interesting \nadvice, very interesting knowledge, from interesting scholars who came \nto speak. She was then joined by Senator Whitehouse, when he came. Now \nthere is Senator Markey, and there is quite a large number--certainly \nof Democratic Senators--who attend these Tuesday meetings at noon. So I \nwant to thank them very much for this leadership.\n  As we have heard already, debate over climate change has raged for \nyears here on Capitol Hill, but the scientific facts actually have been \nconclusive for some time now. Most people I have found don't realize \nthat the greenhouse gases we put into the atmosphere just don't go \naway. They do not dissipate. These gases can stay for decades. Our \nactions--the greenhouse gas pollution we put into the air and the \nforests we cut down--are changing the composition of Earth's \natmosphere, increasing the concentration of carbon dioxide in the \natmosphere to above 400 parts per million.\n  Just look at this chart. As this chart shows, these are global \nwarming gases. This is carbon dioxide. You can see how it has run quite \nalong at this level, and then in the last few years it has begun to \njump up, so much that the average in 2013 was 396 parts per million. \nPeople don't know this--that all these gases remain in our atmosphere \nyear after year, decade after decade, and century after century.\n  This change is altering how our atmosphere interacts, with massive \namounts of solar energy radiating out from the center of our solar \nsystem. It is well known within the scientific community that the \nEarth's blanket--our atmosphere--is getting more effective at trapping \nheat. The full effects of this stronger blanket--or shield or whatever \nyou want to call it--must be projected into the future. Different \nprojections show different effects, but we know this. Change is coming, \nand it has already begun.\n  A lot of people also believe our Earth is immutable, that we can't \ndestroy it and that it can't change. They assume our planet has always \nbeen pretty much the same. But the last time the Earth's atmosphere \ncontained 400 parts per million of carbon dioxide was more than 3 \nmillion years ago when horses and camels lived in the high Arctic in \nconditions that averaged 18 degrees warmer than today. Seas were at \nleast 30 feet higher, at a level that today would inundate major cities \naround the world and flood the homes of a quarter of the United States \npopulation.\n  Concentrations of carbon dioxide have risen, as I said, from the 280 \nparts per million to more than 400 parts per million in just the last \n150 years. Scientists tell us there is no known geologic period in \nwhich concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have increased \nas quickly. Bottom line: Never has our planet faced a faster or more \necologically devastating change.\n  To settle the scientific debate over climate change, the Bush \nadministration appointed a National Academy of Sciences Blue Ribbon \nPanel. The group, which included former climate change deniers, \nreported to Congress in 2001 that greenhouse gases are ``causing \nsurface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures to rise.'' \nThey said: ``Temperatures are, in fact, rising.''\n  The United Nations created its Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange, a group of more than 600 leading scientific experts; and what \ndid they say? They said the ``warming of the climate system is \nunequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are \nunprecedented over decades to millennia.''\n  Average temperatures over lands and ocean surfaces globally have \nincreased 1.53 degrees Fahrenheit from 1880 to 2012, with the highest \nrate of increase in the past 3 decades.\n  Just look at this. See the line indicating carbon dioxide \nconcentration. Start from here. Now notice that the temperatures are \nstill down. Watch the line start to go up and notice the climate warm \nup to where it is today.\n  The IPCC report continued: ``The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, \nthe amounts of snow and ice have diminished, sea level has risen, and \nthe concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased.''\n  This makes that clear. If we don't reduce the greenhouse gas \nemissions, the National Research Council predicts the average global \ntemperatures will increase by as much as 11.5 degrees--11.5 degrees by \n2100. Such a dramatic and rapid increase would be catastrophic to our \nplanet Earth. It would change our world permanently.\n  As temperatures have increased, we have seen that ice sheets that \ncover the North and South Poles have begun melting. The average annual \nArctic sea ice area has decreased more than 20 percent since 1979. That \nis when satellite records first became available. The Greenland ice \nsheet has melted by nearly 30 percent.\n  Here we can see the Arctic, the red line shows what it was in 1979, \nand current picture shows what has been lost and what is left.\n  The melting of glaciers and ice caps, along with expansion of ocean \nwater due to the increase in temperature have caused the global sea \nlevel to rise by 8 inches since 1870, with over 2 inches just in the \npast 20 years. If we do nothing to stop climate change, scientific \nmodels project that there is a real possibility of sea level increasing \nby as much as 4 feet by the end of this century--4 feet.\n  Now, what would 4 feet do? At risk are nearly 2.6 million homes \nlocated less than 4 feet above high tide nationwide.\n  Let me speak about my home State of California. We have, within those \n4 feet, the homes of 450,000 people, 30 coastal power plants with \ngenerating capacity of 10 gigawatts, 22 wastewater treatment plants \nwith capacity of 325 million gallons per day, 3,500 miles of roadway, \n280 miles of railway, 140 schools, and 55 hospitals and other health \ncare facilities. These could all be inundated by the end of the \ncentury.\n  Oakland and San Francisco International Airports are susceptible to \nflooding, and both are today studying expensive new levy systems to \nhold back the tides.\n  Sea level rise in California would also cause flooding of low-lying \nareas, loss of coastal wetlands, such as portions of the San Francisco \nBay Delta,\n\n[[Page S1391]]\n\nerosion of cliffs and beaches, and saltwater contamination of drinking \nwater. Bottom line: Rising seas put California's homes, public \nfacilities, and environmental resources in great peril, and adapting to \nthis change will impose great cost.\n  Temperatures in California have increased 1.26 degrees Fahrenheit \nover the past 4 decades. The warmer climate could be particularly \ndevastating to us where threats from catastrophic wildfire and \nreduction in water resources will likely make sunny California a desert \nState. The Sierra Nevada snowpack--and we are hearing a lot about that \nnow--which includes Lake Tahoe--is the State's largest source of water. \nIt equals about half the storage capacity of all of California's man-\nmade reservoirs. If we do nothing, the Sierra Nevada spring snowpack \ncould drop by as much as 60 to 80 percent by the end of the century, \neliminating the water source for nearly 16 million people.\n  Only four States have populations as large as 16 million people, and \nthe largest agricultural State in the United States--California--needs \nwater resources to farm and grow crops. The 38 million people living in \nCalifornia also need water to drink, to bathe, to water flowers, for \nbusinesses to flourish.\n\n  Major fire is another danger because the size, severity, duration, \nand frequency of fires are greatly influenced by climate. This is the \nRim Fire, from not too long ago. It gives us an idea of how things \nburn. Fire seasons in the West are starting sooner and lasting longer. \nThe average length has increased by 78 days since 1970, a 64-percent \nincrease. This isn't a coincidence, and climate change is suspected as \na key mechanism for that change. The change is apparent.\n  During a recent Senate hearing, U.S. Forest Service Chief Tidwell \ntestified:\n\n       On average, wildfires burn twice as many acres each year as \n     compared to 40 years ago, and there are on average seven \n     times as many fires over 10,000 acres per year.\n\n  I believe this: We cannot stop climate change from happening. We do \nnot have a silver bullet. There is no action we can take to stem the \ntide. But if we can hold the warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius, we \ncan accommodate for it. But if the warming reaches 5 degrees to 9 \ndegrees Celsius, the effects are catastrophic for our planet Earth. \nDramatic and catastrophic effects are far more likely. Through a series \nof incremental but somewhat aggressive policy steps, we can slow the \nchange.\n  The combustion of fossil fuel--coal, oil, and natural gas--accounts \nfor 78 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in our country. Most of the \nfossil fuel emissions come from the smokestacks of our power plants and \nthe tailpipes of our vehicles.\n  The bottom line: To address climate change, we must take steps to use \nfossil fuels more efficiently, and we must initiate a shift away from \nfossil fuels where we can and toward cleaner alternatives.\n  I believe we can attack this problem by: establishing aggressive fuel \neconomy standards to reduce emissions from the transportation sector; \nenabling a shift to renewable sources of power; limiting the emissions \nfrom stationary sources, especially power plants; and, most important, \nputting a price on heat-trapping carbon pollution.\n  Let me mention some steps we have taken because we have begun a \ntransition to a cleaner energy economy. The good news is that carbon \ndioxide emissions have dropped 12 percent since 2005, due in part to \nthe policies we have adopted.\n  One of my proudest achievements was working with Senators Snowe, \nInouye, Stevens, Cantwell, Lott, Dorgan, Corker, Carper, and many \nothers in the 2007 Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy Act, raising the corporate \naverage fuel economy known as CAFE at the maximum achievable rate.\n  Let me say what these new standards mean. They mean we will have a \nfleetwide average of 54.5 miles per gallon in 2025. These standards \nwill cut greenhouse gas emissions from cars and light trucks in half by \n2025, reducing emissions by 6 billion metric tons over the life of the \nprogram, more than the total amount of carbon dioxide emitted by the \nUnited States in 2010. Better yet, these standards will save American \nfamilies more than $1.7 trillion in fuel costs, resulting in average \nfuel savings of more than $8,000 per vehicle.\n  Our legislation also directed the administration to establish the \nfirst ever fuel economy standards for buses, delivery trucks, and long-\nhaul 18 wheelers. The first standards, which apply to trucks and buses \nbuilt from 2014 to 2018, will reduce greenhouse gas pollution by \napproximately 270 million metric tons.\n  I am very sorry Senator Snowe from Maine isn't here today because I \nbegan this effort with a simple sense of the Senate resolution in 1993 \nwith Senator Slade Gorton from Washington, Senator Bryan from Nevada, \nand myself, and we couldn't get a simple statement passed. We then \ntried an SUV loophole closer, which was to bring SUVs down to the \nmileage of sedans and we couldn't do this.\n  We then did the Ten-in-Ten and we didn't think it was going to go \nanywhere. Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye put it in a commerce \ncommittee bill. Senator Stevens changed his view on it, put it in a \ncommerce committee bill, and it swept through the Senate and through \nthe House, was signed by the President, and is now the law. Today \nPresident Obama has made completing CAFE standards for trucks built \nafter 2018--which are required by our 2007 law--a key part of his \nClimate Action Plan.\n  Power plants are our largest single source of greenhouse gas \nemissions. It is fair to say Federal tax incentives and financing, \nState mandates, federally funded research, and a dramatically improving \npermitting process have led to a recent shift away from coal-fired \npower plants and toward renewable energy and lower emission natural \ngas.\n  Additionally, renewable energy production has more than doubled since \n2008, and it continues to boom. Last year 4,751 megawatts of solar were \ninstalled nationwide. This is a 41-percent increase over the previous \nyear. Power plant carbon dioxide emissions have dropped 17 percent \nsince 2005.\n  The lesson is clear: We must continue the policies which are working, \nsuch as the wind and geothermal production tax credits, the solar \ninvestment tax credit, and a project-permitting process which advances \nprojects on disturbed and less sensitive lands expeditiously, but we \nmust also take longer term steps to ensure that power plant emissions \ncontinue to drop.\n  I support the President's plan to use Clean Air Act authorities to \nlimit greenhouse gas emissions. The Supreme Court's landmark global \nwarming case, Massachusetts v. EPA, found greenhouse gases are \npollutants with the potential to endanger human health and welfare. \nPresident Obama and EPA have an obligation to comply with these \ndirectives to limit such emissions. So I very much look forward to the \nPresident advancing a strong rule which will use market-based \nmechanisms.\n  I also believe Congress could act to reduce greenhouse gas emissions \nfrom power plants by putting an explicit price on pollution. It has \ntaken me a long time to get there--approximately 20 years. I supported \nvarious other mechanisms--and will continue to support--but I am \nconvinced, based on information by the Energy Information \nAdministration, a fee on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants \nstarting at only $10 per ton could reduce emissions 70 percent to 80 \npercent by 2050, if the fee steadily increases over time. This is the \nemissions reduction level experts say is necessary to stabilize the \nclimate at less than 2 degrees Celsius warmer than today. If we can do \nthis, we save planet Earth. If the climate goes 5 degrees to 9 degrees \nwarmer by the end of the century, we have lost.\n  Such a fee could be responsive to emissions performance. If emissions \nwere falling consistent with science-based emissions targets, the fee \nwould not have to go up every year. It is estimated a fee on power \nplant emissions would be nearly as effective in reducing heat-trapping \nemissions as an economy-wide fee. The difference is 2 percent. So both \npolicies deserve consideration.\n  Such a fee would provide industry with cost certainty, and the \nrevenues--exceeding $20 billion annually--could help address our \nNation's debt. They should go back to the general fund. The revenue \ncould finance other important national priorities, such as tax reform,\n\n[[Page S1392]]\n\nincome inequality, energy research development.\n  An MIT study found that if the fee revenues were used to cut other \ntaxes or maintain spending for social programs, ``the economy will be \nbetter off with the carbon (fee) than if we have to keep other taxes \nhigh or cut programs to rein in the deficit.''\n  Science has clearly shown the planet is warming and now at a faster \nrate than ever. We know this. Now we as leaders must make a choice: Do \nwe act, do we lead, do we tackle the problem or do we wait until it is \ntoo late? Do we continue the progress we have made on fuel economy by \ntaking on other large emitters or do we simply claim it is impossible, \nit is intractable, we can't do anything about it? Do we blame the \nproblem on China? And China has a big problem. Do we deny undeniable \nfacts due to current politics?\n  I believe we have an obligation to lead. There is no question it is \ndifficult and there is no question there are hard choices, but we have \nan obligation to control our own pollution. Our Nation has the \nopportunity to demonstrate to the rest of the world it can be done, and \ntonight shows there are some leaders.\n  I thank Senator Boxer, Senator Whitehouse, Senator Markey, and \nSenator Schatz for their leadership, not only on this evening but for \nthe years they have led on this issue. So let's get it done.\n  Before I end, I would note that my legislative assistant, the young \nman sitting next to me, is leaving to work for the Department of \nEnergy. He has worked on fuel efficiency standards, climate change, \nenergy, transportation, and a number of other issues.\n  Matthew Nelson, I want you to know your expertise, your unique \ncreativity and capacity, and your dedication will be missed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, may I thank the distinguished \nSenator from California for her speech. For those who know of her \nhistory with this issue and her leadership on pollution issues over \nmany years, this was an important speech, and I thank the Senator very \nmuch.\n  Before we turn to Senator Boxer, I wish to say a few things about the \ncomments the Senator from Oklahoma made earlier, I suppose in an effort \nto suggest climate change is not all that we shake it up to be. The \nfirst point he made was about a group of emails that came out of East \nAnglia University, which the climate denier community seized on and \nnicknamed climategate, as if like Watergate there was a big scandal in \nthose emails. There were some probably not entirely appropriate \ncomments that were said in the emails, but the question is, Was the \nscience underlying it affected or compromised in any way?\n\n  So-called climategate was actually looked at over and over again. \nBecause it was at the University of East Anglia, the University of East \nAnglia did an investigation. Because it involved scientists at Penn \nState, Penn State did an investigation. Both of those universities gave \na complete clean bill of health to the underlying science that was at \nthe base of this.\n  The House of Commons--the British House of Commons did its \ninvestigation. That is how much fuss the deniers kicked up about this. \nThey came back and they said: Nothing wrong with the science there. \nNothing wrong with the science. The U.S. Environmental Protection \nAgency and National Science Foundation also did investigations, as did \nthe inspector general of the Department of Commerce. Three for three, \nthose investigations came back as well, saying: If they did say \nanything inappropriate, nothing wrong with the science.\n  After all that, after six published reviews whose results confirmed \nthat there was nothing wrong with the science as a result of these \nemails, for people to continue to come to the floor and to suggest that \nthe email chain revealed some flaw in the data or some flaw in the \nscience, it is untrue. It is as simple as that. It is just not true.\n  In fact, if you wanted to nickname this properly, you would actually \ncall it climategate-gate because the real scandal is the phony scandal \nthat was whipped up about these emails when the underlying science had \nbeen confirmed by every single investigation that followed. So much for \nclimategate or climategate-gate, more properly said.\n  He also indicated that because the IPCC report had said the Himalayan \nglaciers were retreating, but they weren't, that there was something \nobviously wrong with the science. Let us start with some glaciers \ncloser to home. This is Grinell Glacier in Montana. Here is what it \nlooked like in 1940. That is all snow. Here is what it looks like in \n2004. It is melted down to this little puddle of snow and ice.\n  We are indeed losing our glaciers. Have a look in Washington at \nLillian Glacier in Washington's Olympic National Park. This is in 1905. \nLook at the size of that glacier. Here it is, the same bowl, virtually \ndried of snow--glacier gone.\n  The fact that glaciers are disappearing is something people see in \nfront of them all around the world. All you have to do is go to \nmountains with glaciers and look. I went with Senator Boxer to the \nglaciers in Greenland. You could see the glaciers retreat. You could \nsee the increased speed as the ice moved more rapidly down and out to \nsea because of the melt.\n  Now the question of the Himalayan glaciers has also been reviewed. A \nrecent article in Nature said:\n\n       The Tibetan plateau and surroundings contain the largest \n     number of glaciers outside polar regions. These glaciers are \n     at the headwaters of many prominent Asian rivers and are \n     largely experiencing shrinkage. . . .\n\n  Which is exactly what one would expect from the science of climate \nchange.\n  Now the National Academy of Sciences recently did a report on this \nvery subject about 6 months ago, and a quote on that report says:\n\n       The report examines how changes to glaciers in the Hindu \n     Kush-Himalayan region, which covers eight countries across \n     Asia, could affect the area's river systems, water supplies, \n     and the South Asian population. The mountains in the region \n     form the headwaters of several major river systems--including \n     the Ganges, Mekong, Yangtze, and Yellow rivers--which serve \n     as sources of drinking water and irrigation supplies for \n     roughly 1.5 billion people. So the irrigation and drinking \n     water for 1.5 billion people is nothing to laugh about.\n\n  Here is the conclusion:\n\n       The entire Himalayan climate is changing, but how climate \n     change will impact specific places remains unclear. . . . The \n     eastern Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau are warming, and the \n     trend is more pronounced at higher elevations. Models suggest \n     that desert dust and black carbon, a component of soot, could \n     contribute to the rapid atmospheric warming, accelerated \n     snowpack melting, and glacier retreat.\n\n  The Senator also mentioned the cost of a carbon fee. Just to make the \nrecord completely clear, I would propose a carbon fee whose every \ndollar of revenue was returned to the American people if as a result of \na carbon fee they end up paying more in their energy bill somewhere.\n  Every dollar of that should come back to the American people. It \ncould come back in the form of a check to the head of a family. It \ncould come back in the form of lower tax rates. It could come back in a \nvariety of ways, and I hope soon we are actually having that \ndiscussion. But do not think there is any need for this to be a net \ncost to the economy. Every dollar can go back to the American people. \nBecause of the nature of this tax, it is actually probably more \nefficient than others, so it should create economic lift for a net \neconomic gain if you are truly offsetting the revenues. So I reject the \nproposition that this would create a cost. It would be easy to design \nit in such a way that it is actually net improvement.\n  Finally, I will agree with something Senator Inhofe said. He said \nthis has to be international; and indeed it does have to be \ninternational. India has a vote. They have a lot of powerplants. China \nhas a lot of powerplants. They have to work together. We can do that.\n  America can lead in the world. If the others are slow to come, we can \nerect tax adjustments at our border that protect us and our products. \nWe can make this happen, and we should.\n  The last is job loss claims. If you go back through the history of \nregulation of big industries, every time you roll something out they \nsay it is going to be a huge economic disaster. They said this about \nthe ozone layer; the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act. In fact, in \nsome cases such as in the Clean Air Act, subsequent review showed the\n\n[[Page S1393]]\n\namount that is saved from not being polluted exceeds the cost of \ncompliance by as much as 30-to-1. Why would we not want a deal like \nthat, particularly where the costs of climate change are going to be so \nsevere?\n  The Senator said it is important to look at what has happened since \nthe original IPCC report. Here is what happened since the original IPCC \nreport. They doubled down. They are even more sure than they were of \ntheir findings on climate change. Other scientific organizations such \nas NASA have chimed in in unflinching language. I happen to have a lot \nof respect for NASA. If you can put a vehicle the size of an SUV up and \nout of our atmosphere, into orbit, send it to Mars, land it safely on \nMars, and then drive it around, I think there is a pretty safe bet that \nyou have some good scientists who know what they are talking about. I \nwill put them up against the scientists paid for by the polluters every \nday.\n  I will yield the floor first to Chairman Boxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Ms. BOXER. I wish to thank Senator Whitehouse for his leadership. We \nare now 30 minutes behind, so I would take up to 30 minutes, and then I \nwill be followed by Senator Franken.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n  Ms. BOXER. Madam President, I have been on this floor since early \nthis evening and it is very clear that deniers are standing with 3 \npercent of the scientists while we Democrats who are here tonight \ncalling for action are standing with 97 percent of the scientists.\n  As I mentioned before, every time the Republicans call a so-called \nexpert to the Committee on Environment and Public Works, I track their \npath and they seem to be tied to the oil industry or to major \npolluters. That is just a fact. I am going to talk a little bit later \nabout what has happened and why this suddenly has become a bitter \npartisan fight. It never used to be. It never used to be, but it is and \nit is wrong.\n  No one party can put together the votes needed. We have to share \nresponsibility and that is critical. People have said to me, the press: \nWhat is the point of this all-nighter? I said, very simply: The Senate \nClimate Action Task Force, which has membership of getting toward 30 \npercent of the Senate, we want to wake up the Congress to the fact that \ntime is running out. We have to act now. We have to do everything we \ncan legislatively in every way.\n  The good news--and there is some good news which has nothing to do \nwith the Senate. It is all bad news for the Senate, frankly. But the \ngood news is that we have a President who gets this and who is moving \nforward with a climate action plan. I am sorry to say every step he \ntakes we have people trying to repeal what he is doing. So far we have \nbeat back those naysayers and those voices of the polluters.\n  One of the major functions of the Senate Climate Action Task Force is \nnot just rallying around the scientists and calling attention to \nclimate change, but it is clearly to play defense when we see attempts \nto roll back the President's plan.\n  We have already seen a CRA, which stands for congressional review \nact, that is in the works to overturn what the President is trying to \ndo to clean up coal-fired plants before they even finish the rules. \nSenator McConnell is talking about a race to repeal it before it is \neven put into place. I do not understand this--well, I understand it, \nbut it is wrong.\n  We have to stand up for our families. As I said in my earlier \nremarks, if you saw any member of your family or any one of your \nconstituents standing in the wake of a disaster, say an oncoming car, \nyou would do everything in your power--everything in your power--to \nsave that constituent or that family member.\n  We are facing an out-of-control problem here with our climate. It is \nout of control. If we do not wrap our arms around it, we will have \ncatastrophic warming. It has already started and it will lead to \nhorrible pain and suffering whether it is heat waves and deaths. We \nhave already seen it in Europe. Colleagues from New Mexico and Colorado \nhave already talked about horrible floods and fires. I can tell you \nmore about fires in my State.\n  I have never seen anything like it. We have seen drought. All of this \nwas predicted by the scientists back in the early nineties. I cannot \nbelieve that is 20 years ago that they told us. I think we have proven \nthe point that deniers are standing with 3 percent of the scientists \nand every major scientific organization has warned us to act.\n  One of my colleagues, Senator Inhofe, came down and said: Oh, it is \nsnowing. It is cold. It is called extreme weather, and it is what was \npredicted. The vortex up in the Arctic, we are feeling the impacts of a \nweakened jet stream. We are seeing these terrible temperatures in an \nextreme fashion hit the lower 48 States, some of which have never had \nit before. We have seen with our very own eyes snow in places such as \nAtlanta, people stuck on highways. No one knew what to do because it \nhas never happened before. I think we have made the clear case.\n  I say to my colleague Senator Schatz, who has worked so hard with \nSenator Whitehouse to put this together, we have proven the point. I \nbelieve that we stand with science in the mainstream, and our \ncolleagues--most of whom have not come to the floor to debate us--are \nstanding with the extreme and, frankly, the special polluting \ninterests. Now, after they get done with denying, they have a fallback \nposition, and they say: Well, even if you believe there is climate \nchange, we should not act until China acts. Since when does the \ngreatest country on Earth sit back and allow China to lead us out of a \nclimate change impending disaster? Since when do we cede that \nauthority?\n  I want to talk about that. All you have to do is take a look at China \nto see what happens to a country that throws the environment under a \nbus. Let's take a look at some of the people in China and what it looks \nlike. These are people on their bicycles. You can't see anything around \nthem. They have masks on. We are going to wait for China to lead us out \nof the climate change problem? I don't think so.\n  I went to China on a very interesting trip with Leader Reid a couple \nof years ago. We were there for a good 10 days. We really saw the \ncountry. It is fascinating. There are a lot of interesting things going \non there with transportation and so on. We never saw the Sun--never.\n  One day the Sun was behind the smog, and the guy who was with us \nsaid: What a beautiful day.\n  I said: No, it is not. This is terrible.\n  We went to the American Embassy. They have a measuring tool that \ntells them how dirty the air is in China. It is a hazardous duty post. \nPeople who were there with their kids were told not to go out because \nit was too dangerous. China has hazardous levels of pollution and toxic \nemissions which have had very harmful effects on the Chinese people.\n  We are supposed to wait for China to clean up carbon pollution? I \ndon't think so. According to a scientific study from the Health Effects \nInstitute, outdoor air pollution contributed to 1.2 million premature \ndeaths in China in 2010 alone. This is not fiction; this is fact.\n  We have voices on the Republican side of the aisle who are begging \nus: Don't do anything on carbon pollution until China acts. Air \npollution was the fourth leading risk factor for deaths in China. The \nthreat is expected to get worse.\n  Urban air pollution is set to become the top environmental cause of \nmortality worldwide by 2050--ahead of dirty water and lack of \nsanitation. It is estimated that up to 3.6 million people could end up \ndying prematurely from air pollution each year, mostly in China and \nIndia. Think about that. Yes, we will hear our colleagues say China and \nIndia too.\n  I represent a very large and great State with a population of 38 \nmillion people. We are on the cutting edge of a clean environment. We \nare tackling carbon pollution. We are seeing great jobs being developed \nin solar, wind, and geothermal. We are going to have one-third of our \nelectricity generation come from clean sources by 2020. I am so proud \nof my State. The special interests came in there and they tried to \nrepeal all of our laws that had to do with cleaning up carbon \npollution, and the people--even though they were faced with millions of \ndollars in oil company ads--said no.\n\n[[Page S1394]]\n\n  So the people who say this isn't real, we have already disproved \nthat. I put out the names of every possible organization. If you ask \nthe American people about those organizations, they would say: We \nrespect those organizations. So that is out.\n  Then they say: Wait for China. That is out. In January the U.S. \nEmbassy issued warnings to China's citizens that the air quality in \nBeijing was so bad it exceeded the upper limits of its measurements, \nand the exposure to fine soot was many times above what the World \nHealth Organization considers hazardous. They call it an \n``airpocalyse.'' It forced the Chinese Government to close highways \nbecause the visibility was so bad.\n  This goes on in cities across China. A woman looked out her window in \nHarbin and said: ``I couldn't see anything outside the window, and I \nthought it was snowing.'' Then she realized it wasn't snow; it was \ndangerous toxic smog. That is what the people are living with. They are \nbeside themselves. They walk around with masks. They can't go out. They \nare suffering and dying. And this is the country that my colleagues say \nwe ought to wait for before we tackle climate change? You have to be \nkidding me. This is an embarrassment. Citizens of Harbin can see only \n10 yards in front of them because small particle pollution soared to a \nrecord 40 times higher than international standards.\n  By the way, the cost of environmental degradation in China was about \n$230 billion in 2010 or 3.5 percent of the Nation's gross domestic \nproduct.\n  We know that Superstorm Sandy cost us about $60 billion. One storm \ncost $60 billion. So when you talk about the economic impact of putting \na price on carbon polluters who are polluting this country, put that \ninto the context of what happens if you let them continue polluting. \nSuperstorm Sandy--we all lived through it. We all saw what happened.\n  I have seen the fires in California. We have seen them in New Mexico \nand Colorado. We know the costs that come from those fires. We have \nseen the drought. The President was out there. Thank God he came out \nthere to give some money. Do you know that our ranchers were destroying \ntheir cattle, killing their cattle because there was no feed? The \nPresident went out there and made sure that emergency help was \ndelivered so they could buy feed for those cattle.\n  When people say it is going to cost a lot to solve climate change, I \nbeg them to think about the costs if we do nothing. Look at China. They \ndid nothing about clean air, and they are paying the price with \npremature deaths, lost productivity, and people who are miserable.\n  Here is the thing: We learned a long time ago that stepping up to an \nenvironmental challenge pays off. Decades ago, the United States \nexperienced damage and degradation--tremendous damage--to our \nenvironment. The Cuyahoga River in Ohio was on fire, massive air \npollution hung over our cities, and lakes were dying from pollution. \nThe American people demanded action. Guess what. We didn't wait for \nChina or India or anybody else to act. We came together as Democrats \nand Republicans and said: This isn't appropriate.\n  President Nixon helped on the environment, President George Herbert \nWalker Bush helped on the environment, Jimmy Carter helped on the \nenvironment, Bill Clinton helped on the environment, and Barack Obama \nis helping on the environment. But now it has become a partisan issue.\n  The Clean Air Act goes back to 1970, and it was strengthened in 1990. \nSince 1990, the United States has cut fine particulate emissions. Those \nare the emissions that get into your lungs and cause all of our \nproblems. Since 1990 we have cut those particulates by 57 percent \nbecause Democrats and Republicans came together. Now Republicans want \nto repeal all of that, but we won't let them. Fine particulate \nemissions is what is making the Chinese people sick.\n  In 1976 there were 166 days when health advisories were issued in \nsouthern California to urge people with asthma and other people with \nlung sensitivities to stay indoors. That was in 1976. The American \npeople said: No, no, no; this isn't right. The people of California \nsaid: This is terrible. There were 166 days where I couldn't go out and \nbreathe the air and take a walk and take my kids out.\n  Thanks to the action taken by Democrats and Republicans who worked \ntogether to pass the Clean Air Act and carry it out, the number of \nsmog-related health advisories in 2010 in southern California dropped \nto--drum roll--zero days. So anyone who stands here and says, ``Oh, \nthis problem is too big. I can't wrap my arms around it. China and \nIndia have to act,'' no, no, no, that is not America.\n  We have brilliant people in this country with great technological \nskills. Many of our States--and I am so proud of my State--have the \nlatest technologies to clean up the air and water, make cars fuel \nefficient. My friend Senator Feinstein spoke about fuel efficiency in \ncars, and I am so pleased we have done that. President Obama is now \napplying it to trucks.\n  We are literally saving lives because we know outdoor air pollution \ncauses cancer. We know that. Let me tell you what the National Climate \nAssessment--that is our country--is saying about climate change:\n\n       Climate change threatens human health and well-being in \n     many ways, including impacts from increased extreme weather \n     events, wildfire, decreased air quality, diseases transmitted \n     by insects, food and water . . . Some of these health impacts \n     are already underway in the U.S.\n\n  Clearly we have proven tonight that we stand with science. We are not \nscientists, but we are humbled before the science.\n  We know our Nation has shown great leadership in the environmental \nmovement for years. We started this back in the 1970s when that river \ncaught on fire and we said: What are we doing to our planet?\n  We should not and we must not wait for other countries to act. We \nmust take action now, and that is the purpose of the Senate Climate \nAction Task Force. I am so proud of my colleagues who are here tonight \nand who go to those meetings every Thursday. Ed Markey is leading us in \nmeetings on Tuesdays, which is the clearinghouse. The clearinghouse is \nmore of a think tank where we bring in the experts. We listen and \nquestion them. On Thursdays we meet with the task force. Members of the \ntask force speak to the Democratic caucus.\n  I say to Harry Reid, if he is listening, how much I appreciate his \nleadership on this issue. He has seen some of the horrible impacts of \nclimate change in his great State. His State has leaders in alternative \nclean energy. They are moving away from coal and toward clean energy. \nThey are creating good-paying jobs.\n  When we put a price on carbon, the dirty industries start to pay for \nthe pollution they are causing, and that will move us toward clean \nenergy. When we move to clean energy, we will see a tremendous \ndifference in the amount of carbon pollution in the air, and we will be \nable to avert the most dire predictions for climate, which is 7 degrees \nFahrenheit. We don't want to see that for our children and our \ngrandchildren and our great grandchildren because that will literally \nchange the face of the way America lives.\n\n  We have it in our hands. Tonight we are saying: Wake up, Congress. \nPlease, wake up. To my colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe, who is \nmy friend, who said: You guys are just talking to each other; good \nluck, good night, I respond: I am proud to say more than 100,000 people \nhave so far signed petitions calling on Congress to act, and this is \njust early in the evening. We are going to be going another almost 11 \nhours.\n  To Senator Whitehouse and Senator Schatz I say thank you for \norganizing this. It is a little like herding cats, getting us all here, \nbut it is working. It is working because Senators here get it. They \nknow they are going to be here for a finite time, and when we get a \nchallenge such as this, we stand up to it. We find the solutions and we \nfight for them, and we fight for the people of this great Nation.\n  Thank you so much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaine). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank Senator Boxer and \nSenator Schatz and Senator Whitehouse for organizing this.\n\n[[Page S1395]]\n\n  I rise tonight to talk about climate change, along with 25 to 30 of \nmy colleagues who will be speaking through the night.\n  The recent extreme weather events we have experienced across the \nUnited States are our call to action. We in this body need not just to \ntalk about climate change but to take action to address it. If we fail \nto act, the extreme weather events we have seen will only grow more \nextreme in the future.\n  This winter has been exceptionally cold in many areas of the United \nStates, including Minnesota. Some deniers have taken this as a sign \nthat climate change isn't happening. They have pointed to the cold \nweather as evidence that global warming is not occurring. But they are \nmissing the point. We already know that on average the Earth is \nwarming. This isn't complicated. We have been using thermometers to \nmake measurements around the globe for a long time. We know average \ntemperatures have gone up significantly in recent years.\n  But climate change isn't just about the average temperature. As the \naverage temperature continues to rise, most experts agree we will see \never more frequent extreme weather events, including drought, storms, \nfloods, and other extreme events. It is important to remember that we \nare not attributing any one event to climate change, but we can say \nthere will be more extreme weather events as the Earth grows warmer.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, we have seen the polar vortex bring \nArctic weather to much of the United States during this winter. \nAccording to White House Science Adviser Dr. John Holdren, we can \nexpect to see more of this kind of extreme cold as global warming \ncontinues. This is going to have serious consequences--it already has.\n  In my home State of Minnesota, the extreme cold has contributed to \nvery serious propane shortages. Many rural residents are unable to \nproperly heat their homes. Turkey growers are finding it difficult to \nheat their barns and, therefore, their turkeys. This is not just a \nproblem in Minnesota. Other areas of the country have been affected. We \nin the Senate have to talk about what is happening and start taking \naction in the face of climate change threats.\n  The ongoing drought in California and other States is another \nexample. The situation is particularly grave in California where vast \nregions have been classified as D4, which is the most severe drought \ncategory. This has cost farmers their crops and livestock and created \nsevere water shortages for residents and businesses. Farmers have had \nto stop farming half a million acres of what normally is irrigated \nland. That is about 6 percent of the entire State of California. \nAccording to the California Farm Water Coalition, it is already costing \nthat State $5 billion. These costs get passed on to every American. As \na result of this drought, Americans have to pay more and will continue \nto pay more for groceries this winter.\n  Unfortunately, droughts such as this are becoming commonplace. In \n2012, drought caused more than 70 percent of U.S. counties to be \ndeclared disaster areas. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration estimated the economic impact of droughts to be $30 \nbillion. The droughts destroyed or damaged major crops all over this \ncountry, making corn and soybeans more expensive and increasing animal \nfeed costs. Again, Americans pay more for meats and other animal-based \nproducts because of drought.\n  In the Midwest, the 2012 drought dramatically lowered water levels in \nthe Mississippi River, seriously interfering with our ability to \ntransport our agricultural goods to market to compete with those from \nother countries. So that barges wouldn't run aground, shippers sent \nthem down the Mississippi only half full with, say, soybeans. This made \nMinnesota soybeans less competitive with Brazilian soybeans.\n  Climate change is also exacerbating our Nation's wildfires, as we \nheard Senator Wyden from Oregon describe about his State. When Forest \nService Chief Tom Tidwell testified in 2012 before the Senate Energy \nCommittee, I asked him about the link between climate change and forest \nfires. He told us that throughout the country we are seeing longer fire \nseasons--more than 2 months longer--compared to fire seasons in the \n1970s. Wildfires are also larger and more intense. I asked Chief \nTidwell whether scientists at the Forest Service thought climate change \nwas causing this increase in the size and intensity of wildfires and \nextending their season, and without hesitation he said yes. The Forest \nService is spending more and more fighting wildfires--now about half of \nits entire budget.\n\n  Longer fires and larger, more intense fires are going to eat up more \nand more of that budget. In addition, these wildfires--especially ones \nthat occur at the wildland-urban interface--are increasingly \nthreatening homes and property. Most importantly, more intense fires \nare costing lives. The 19 brave firefighters who perished in Arizona \nlast June should be a reminder of the gravity of this issue.\n  Of course, we cannot talk about climate change without talking about \nsea level rise. As I said, I serve on the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources. In 2012, I attended a hearing on sea level rise and \nheard testimony about how rising sea levels are increasing the size of \nflood zones and increasing damage from storm surges. One example they \nused--they said this is a possibility--is that a few inches of sea \nlevel rise could result in a storm surge that could flood the New York \nCity subway system. It sounded like something out of science fiction. \nYet 6 months later, that is exactly what happened when Hurricane Sandy \nhit New York City and flooded the subways. My colleagues do not need to \nbe reminded of the cost of Hurricane Sandy. It cost taxpayers a \nstaggering $60 billion.\n  So when people talk about the harmful consequences of climate change \nand its costs in terms of homes and dollars and lives, they are not \ntalking about some far-off future problem. Climate change is already \nhurting us.\n  Unfortunately, only one of my colleagues from the other side of the \naisle--the ranking member of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, Senator Murkowski from Alaska--attended that hearing. This \nhas been pretty much the case whenever we have a hearing that even \ntangentially relates to climate change.\n  A number of my colleagues in Congress don't believe human activity is \ncontributing to climate change. Many others, I suspect, don't talk \nabout climate change because addressing it requires that we make some \ndifficult choices.\n  This is despite the fact that even some of the major fossil fuel \ncompanies that previously funded anti-climate change efforts have \nturned the page on this issue. ExxonMobil used to fund the Heartland \nInstitute, one of the leading organizations spreading climate change \ndenial propaganda. But if we go to ExxonMobil's Web site today, it \nstates: ``Rising greenhouse gas emissions pose significant risks to \nsociety and ecosystems.'' That is ExxonMobil.\n  Shell Oil states on its Web site: ``CO2 emissions must be \nreduced to avoid serious climate change.'' That is Shell Oil.\n  So even the major oil and gas companies have begun to acknowledge \nthat climate change is real. I would respectfully suggest that my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle here in Congress also need to \nengage in a serious conversation on climate change.\n  At a time when Americans are dealing with record droughts and other \nextreme weather events, the Senate cannot afford to simply ignore \nclimate change. Ultimately, we have to come together to start \naddressing climate change before its damage and costs to society get \nout of control.\n  I know this is not going to be easy. Some will point out that climate \nchange is a global problem--sometimes called global climate change--and \nthat we can't solve it alone. They are right. Emissions in the \ndeveloping world are on the rise. China now surpasses the U.S. in total \ngreenhouse gas emissions. But China is also starting to wake up to its \nserious pollution problem. In fact, at the opening of the annual \nmeeting of its parliament last week, the Chinese Premier stated that \nhis country is declaring a war on pollution. Overcoming pollution \nchallenges will require China to invest heavily in renewable and other \nenvironmentally friendly technologies. It is going to make the global \nclean energy race even more competitive. If we are going to\n\n[[Page S1396]]\n\nwin this race and create good-paying jobs for Americans, we have to \ninvest in clean energy.\n  We know that government investment in energy can pay off. Take the \nexample of natural gas. We are currently experiencing a natural gas \nboom in this country. Sometimes my colleagues forget that this boom \nhappened in large part because of years of Federal support to develop \nhydraulic fracturing technology. The Eastern Gas Shales Project was an \ninitiative the Federal Government began back in 1976, before hydraulic \nfracturing was a mature industry. The project set up and funded dozens \nof pilot demonstration projects with universities and private gas \ncompanies that tested drilling and fracturing methods. This investment \nby the Federal Government was instrumental in the development of the \ncommercial extraction of natural gas from shale. In fact, microseismic \nimaging--a critical tool used in fracking--was originally developed by \nSandia National Laboratory, a Federal energy laboratory.\n  The industry was also supported through tax breaks and subsidies. In \nfact, Mitchell Energy Vice President Dan Stewart said in an interview \nthat Mitchell Energy's first horizontal well was subsidized by the \nFederal Government. Mr. Mitchell said:\n\n       DOE--\n\n  That is the Department of Energy--\n\n     DOE started it, and other people took the ball and ran with \n     it. You cannot diminish DOE's involvement.\n\n  This is from one of the pioneers of horizontal drilling: ``You cannot \ndiminish DOE's involvement.''\n  So the basis of the natural gas revolution that is helping make \nAmerica more energy independent can be traced back to Federal research \nand Federal support.\n  In the same way, we have to support the renewable energy sector now. \nWe have to be the ones who will develop these technologies and the ones \nwho sell them to other nations. We need to lead the world in clean \nenergy innovation.\n  (Mr. MERKLEY assumed the Chair.)\n  At the moment, we are not doing enough. Last year the Senate Energy \nCommittee heard testimony regarding a report from the American Energy \nInnovation Council entitled ``Catalyzing Ingenuity.'' The report, \nauthored by Bill Gates, Microsoft; former Lockheed Martin CEO Norman \nAugustine; and other business leaders, states:\n\n       The country has yet to embark on a clean energy innovation \n     program commensurate with the scale of the national \n     priorities that are at stake. In fact, rather than improve \n     the country's energy innovation program and invest in \n     strategic national interests, the current political \n     environment is creating strong pressure to pull back from \n     such efforts.\n\n  The report is a wakeup call and makes a convincing case for why \ngovernment needs to support innovation in the energy sector.\n  Unfortunately, it has been difficult for Congress to pass \ncomprehensive clean energy legislation, even though this is an \nessential prerequisite if we are going to win the global clean energy \nrace. The good news is that many individual States, which really are \nthe laboratories of our democracy, have gone forward with their own \nclean energy programs.\n  As chair of the Energy Subcommittee on the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, I recently held a hearing on lessons from State \nenergy programs. Among the innovative programs developed by many States \nare goals and mandates for renewable energy production as well as for \nincreased energy efficiency of government and commercial buildings.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, you probably know this because you \nare Senator Merkley and you know a lot. You probably know this. But \nover half the States have renewable portfolio standards. These \nstandards are improving the air, creating jobs, and growing the \neconomy.\n  My home State of Minnesota is one of the leaders in this area. We \nhave a 25-by-25 renewable portfolio standard in place, which means that \n25 percent of the State's electricity must come from renewable sources \nby the year 2025. Excel Energy, Minnesota's largest utility, is \nfollowing an even more ambitious plan of generating over 30 percent \nrenewable energy by the year 2020, and they are on track to do that.\n  I believe the Federal Government should follow what the States are \nalready doing and put a comprehensive and long-term clean energy plan \nin place.\n  One of the issues we discussed in my subcommittee was the upcoming \nEPA rules to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from existing coal-fired \npowerplants. I know that a number of my colleagues are concerned about \nthese regulations and have argued that they will increase the cost of \nelectricity, especially in areas that are heavily dependent on coal and \ncoal-fired plants.\n  I understand these concerns. I believe these regulations should be \ncrafted using common sense. For example, if you give flexibility to \nStates to implement these regulations, you can allow powerplant \noperators to offset their emissions by investing in energy efficiency \nin homes and buildings. Buildings consume about 36 percent, 37 percent \nof the energy in this country. If you retrofit our buildings, you will \nget the same environmental result at a lower cost to powerplant owners. \nAnd just as important, you will unleash energy efficiency manufacturing \nand installation jobs throughout the country. It will reduce our energy \nuse. It will benefit the environment and send a signal throughout the \nbusiness sector that we are serious about deploying long-term energy-\nefficient solutions. That is why NORESCO, a major energy service \ncompany that testified at my hearing, was a strong proponent of this \nproposal.\n  In fact, we learned during my hearing that there was universal \nagreement among witnesses--both Democratic and Republican witnesses--\nthat giving States more flexibility to implement these regulations \nwould be good.\n  So when we talk about taking on climate change, let's start with what \nwe can all agree on. Let's do that stuff first. Let's do Shaheen-\nPortman.\n  The stakes are simply too high to ignore this issue. We cannot leave \nit to future generations. Last year my first grandchild Joe was born, \nand I do not want to look back in 20 years and tell Joe that when we \nwere in a position to do something about climate change we chose not to \nbecause it involved some difficult choices.\n  Now, Joe is going to live through this century and, God willing, into \nthe next. Unless we act now, his generation will pay a very high price \nfor our inaction. Tonight, throughout the night, you are going to be \nhearing about that. You are going to be hearing about the Department of \nDefense research into this and the costs that we will pay when we have \nto address this.\n  I do not want to have to have my grandson think of me long after I am \ngone and ask: Why didn't we do anything to address climate change while \nwe could.\n  So I invite my colleagues from both sides of the aisle--both sides--\nto join in this endeavor. We really owe it to the Nation, and we owe it \nto future generations.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as I begin, I thank Senator Boxer for her \nwonderful leadership of the Environment Committee and for her strong \nactivism regarding climate change. I thank Senator Whitehouse and \nSenator Schatz, as well, for organizing this important discussion \ntonight.\n  The scientific community has been extremely clear--no debate--climate \nchange is real, climate change is manmade, and climate change is \nalready causing severe damage in terms of drought, floods, forest \nfires, rising sea levels, and extreme weather disturbances. Given that \nreality, I find it extremely disturbing that virtually all--not all but \nvirtually all--of my Republican colleagues continue to ignore the \nscientific evidence and refuse to support serious legislation which \nwill address this planetary crisis. My hope is that my small State of \nVermont will be a national leader, will be a model for the rest of the \ncountry in transforming our energy system, moving us away from fossil \nfuels and into energy efficiency and sustainable energy. And doing \nthat, by the way, will not only help the United States become a leader \nin reversing climate change but can, over a period of years, create \nmillions of good-paying jobs in this country. And that has to be the \ngoal.\n  Some people ask--many people ask--they say: Well, why aren't you guys\n\n[[Page S1397]]\n\ndoing anything on this issue? The scientific community is almost \nunanimous about the causation of climate change or about its severity. \nWhat are you doing?\n  Let me answer that by just very briefly reading an exchange that took \nplace in the Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee on April \n11, 2013. Let me preface my remarks by saying Senator Jim Inhofe of \nOklahoma is a friend of mine. I like Jim Inhofe. He is an honest \nperson, a straightforward person. But on this issue, he is dead, dead \nwrong. This is the exchange that took place on April 11, 2013. I was in \na committee hearing, and this is what I said:\n\n       What Senator Inhofe has written--\n\n     And he has published a book on this issue--\n\n       What Senator Inhofe has written and talked about is his \n     belief that global warming is one of the major hoaxes ever \n     perpetrated on the American people. That it's a hoax pushed \n     by people like Al Gore, the United Nations and the Hollywood \n     elite.\n\n  Senator Inhofe was also in this committee hearing, and I said:\n\n       I think that is a fair quote from Senator Inhofe. Is that \n     roughly right, Senator Inhofe?\n\n  He was right here, and Mr. Inhofe said:\n\n       Yes, I would add to that list: Moveon.org, George Soros, \n     Michael Moore and a few others.\n\n  So that is where we are. We have a gentleman--again, a very honest, \ndecent man whom I like--a former chair of the Environment Committee, a \nformer ranking member of the environment committee, who believes that \nglobal warming is a hoax pushed by people like Al Gore, the United \nNations, and the Hollywood elite. So when people ask me why we are not \ndoing anything, I would say that is pretty much the reason.\n  But let me respond to that, to Mr. Inhofe's views, by saying the \nfollowing: Climate change is real, and there is no longer a scientific \ndebate about that. In the words of the U.S. Global Change Research \nProgram, which includes EPA, NASA, the National Science Foundation, and \nthe Departments of Defense, Energy, State, Health, Interior, \nTransportation, and Commerce: ``global warming is unequivocal and \nprimarily human-induced.''\n  It is not my view. It is not Senator Boxer's view, not Senator \nSchatz's view. That is the view of the U.S. Global Change Research \nProgram, which includes some of the major agencies of the U.S. \nGovernment. By the way, clearly it is not just the U.S. Government or \nagencies that believe that. There are agencies representing virtually \nevery country on Earth that have come to the same conclusion.\n  Now, when some people say: Well, there is a debate; the evidence is \nnot yet clear; the scientific community is not quite sure, let me clear \nthe air on that one. According to a study published in the journal \nEnvironmental Research Letters in May of last year, more than 97 \npercent of the peer-reviewed scientific literature on climate supports \nthe view that human activity is a primary cause of global warming.\n\n       I believe I read yesterday that the minority leader, \n     Senator McConnell of Kentucky, was saying: Well, for every \n     person who believes that climate change is real, there is \n     another person who disagrees. Well, the polling indicates \n     that is not quite accurate. But what is really important is \n     not what this person feels or what that person feels, it is \n     what those people who have studied the issue extensively \n     believe. That is really what matters. And for those people--\n     the 97 percent of the peer-reviewed scientific literature on \n     this issue--they say very clearly that climate change is real \n     and that human activity is a primary cause of global warming.\n\n  I am reminded--I think Senator Boxer made this point a while ago--\nthat the debate we are having now is very reminiscent of the debate we \nhad 30 or 40 years ago about the role tobacco plays in cancer, \nemphysema, heart conditions, and so forth. We had people, well-funded \nby the Tobacco Institute, coming before the American people, putting \nads on television, saying: You know smoking is okay; there is no \nevidence linking smoking to cancer.\n  Well, they were lying, as a matter of fact. Many of these people were \nbeing funded by the Tobacco Institute. I think we are in the same \nposition now. A lot of the information--misinformation--which is coming \nforward is funded by the fossil fuel industry. We should be clear about \nthat.\n  Is there still a scientific debate about anything related to climate? \nWhat is the debate? Well, the only remaining scientific debates are \nabout just how devastating climate change will be. Of that, the \nscientists are not exactly sure. There is a disagreement. Are we on \ntrack for a 2-degree change by the end of the century? Will the planet \nwarm by 2 degrees? Will it warm by 4 degrees? Will it warm by 6 \ndegrees? People are not exactly sure. But they are certainly sure that \nit will warm. Will sea levels rise by 1 foot? Will they rise by 3 feet? \nBy 4 feet? Again, scientists are not clear. But they are absolutely \nclear that sea levels will rise.\n  As a result of industrial greenhouse gas emissions, Earth's climate \nwarmed more between 1971 and 2000 than during any other 3-decade \ninterval in the last 1,400 years, reports a paper in the journal Nature \nGeoscience, based on research conducted by 78 scientists from 24 \nnations, analyzing climate data from tree rings, pollen, cave \nformations, ice cores, lake and ocean sediment, and historical records \nfrom around the sea.\n  The globe has already warmed 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit from 1880 to \n2012, and the vast majority of that warming, 1.1 degrees Fahrenheit, \nhas happened since 1950. According to NOAA, November 2013 was the \nhottest November on record, and 2012 was the warmest year on record in \nthe contiguous United States, and saw at least 69,000 local heat \nrecords set.\n  2013 was the fourth warmest year ever recorded since 1880. The World \nBank, no bastion of left-leaning environmental thinking, is among those \nexpressing grave concern about the trend. The World Bank concluded that \nlimiting the global temperature increase to 2 degrees centigrade might \nallow us to keep sea level rise by 2100 to less than 2.3 feet.\n  Unfortunately, the World Bank also acknowledges we are on track for a \n4-degree centigrade increase, which would result in extreme heat waves \nand life-threatening sea level rise. Since 1901, the global sea level \nhas risen about 7.5 inches and it is getting worse; over the last 20 \nyears seas have been rising nearly twice as fast.\n  All over the world glaciers and icepacks are melting. Glaciers in the \nMount Everest region have shrunk by 13 percent in the last 50 years. \nGlaciers on Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania have already shrunk by 80 \npercent and are expected to be completely gone by 2020. Greenland's ice \nsheets lost ice at a rate of about 60 cubic miles per year between 2002 \nand 2011. This is six times faster than the ice was melting during the \ndecades before that. All of these impacts and more can be traced \ndirectly to carbon emissions and their effect on the atmosphere.\n  In 2013, as the Presiding Officer knows, we witnessed an ominous \nmilestone: The daily mean concentration of carbon dioxide in the \natmosphere surpassed 400 parts per million. The last time \nCO2 levels were this high was probably between 2.2 million \nand 3.6 million years ago, when it was so warm there were forests in \nGreenland.\n  What does climate change mean? What are the consequences of global \nwarming? How is climate change already impacting our lives--not in 5 \nyears, not in 50 years, but right now? For one thing, climate change is \nmaking droughts in the Western United States and in other parts of the \nworld more severe, longer lasting, and more frequent. Scientists expect \nthe precipitation pattern will continue shifting, expanding the \ngeographic extent of the dry subtropics, leading to warmer and drier \nweather, which then causes air temperatures to increase even more.\n  This helps explain why drought-stricken Texas saw the hottest summer \never recorded for a U.S. State in 2011, leading to a combination of \ndrought and wildfires, costing $10 billion in damage, and the drought \ncontinues. As of last month, Texas had only received 68 percent of its \nnormal rainfall between 2011 and 2013, and reservoirs are at their \nlowest levels since 1990.\n  We should be very clear about this: When we talk about global \nwarming, we are talking about the globe, the global community, not just \nthe United States, not just Texas, not just California. Australia last \nyear endured an ``angry summer,'' which is what it was called, which \nbrought both the hottest month and the hottest day the country had ever \nwitnessed, and a 4-month heat\n\n[[Page S1398]]\n\nwave, severe wildfires, and torrential rains and flooding, causing $2.4 \nbillion in damage.\n  Last year's heat wave in China was the worst in at least 140 years. \nThese droughts have very real consequences for water availability. Many \nregions in Southeast Asia, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa, for \nexample, are expected to experience a decline of 20 percent in water \navailability if the climate warms 2 degrees centigrade and a 50-percent \ndecline if the climate warms by 4 degrees centigrade. What we are \ntalking about here is the inability of people to get water to drink, \nthe inability of people to get water to farm. This then leads to other \nproblems, including mass migrations and struggles of limited natural \nresources.\n  With sustained drought and heat waves comes wildfire. As Thomas \nTidwell, Chief of the US Forest Service, explained to Congress last \nyear: America's wildfire season now lasts 2 months longer than it did \n40 years ago--2 months longer than just 40 years ago--and burns up \ntwice as much land as it did then because of the hotter, drier \nconditions from climate change.\n  We are seeing this very horrendous and expensive situation of \nwildfires in the southwest of this country. The wildfires, in fact, are \nexpected to increase 50 percent across the United States under a \nchanging climate, while some studies predict increases of more than 100 \npercent in parts of areas of the Western United States by 2050. When \nyou think about climate change and you think about drier forests, we \nare looking at very serious problems regarding wildfires.\n  Rising sea levels, another great concern and impact of climate \nchange, also lead to more destructive storm surges. According to NOAA, \nHurricane Sandy's storm surge exceeded 14 feet in places, which was a \nrecord for New York City. The National Academy of Sciences estimated \nevery 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit increase in global average surface \ntemperature could be a twofold to sevenfold increase in the risk of \nextreme storm surge events similar to Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy.\n  When some people tell us: Well, gee, we cannot afford to address the \nproblems of climate change, I would suggest we cannot afford not to \naddress this crisis, if only for the kinds of money we are going to \nhave to be spending repairing the damage of hurricanes like Sandy, and \nmaybe hurricanes that are even worse.\n  We heard during a recent Senate environment committee hearing that \nthe State of Florida has already seen 5 to 8 inches of sea level rise \nin the past 50 years, with no end in sight. In the Florida Keys we \nexpect that nearly 90 percent of Monroe County would be completely \ninundated at high tide, with just 3 feet of sea level rise, and New \nOrleans can expect to see an ocean level increase of well over 4 feet \nby the end of the century.\n  In other words, what we are looking at here, in Florida, Miami, \nLouisiana, New Orleans, Massachusetts, Boston, New York City, what we \nare looking at is seas rising, which actually threatens the very \nexistence of parts of those cities.\n  Experts are predicting that cities such as Miami, Fort Lauderdale, \nNew York, and New Orleans will face a growing threat of partial \nsubmersion within just a few decades as sea levels and storm surge \nlevels continue to climb. What will it mean if the seas continue to \nrise and extreme weather events--severe drought, wildfires, storms, \nflooding--become much more common? One of the most important \nconsequences will be massive human dislocation all over the world.\n  More than 32 million people fled their homes in 2012 because of \ndisasters such as floods and storms. An estimated 98 percent of this \ndisplacement was related to climate change. So when you look into the \nfuture--and one of the reasons that agencies such as the CIA and the \nDepartment of Defense and other security agencies worry very much about \nclimate change is they see the national security implications of \nmassive dislocations of people in different States or regions of the \ncountry fighting over limited resources, water, land, in order to \nsurvive.\n  The Department of Defense, in its 2010 Quadrennial Review, called \nclimate change a potential ``accelerant of instability or conflict.'' \nThe potential economic impact of climate change on agriculture, for \nexample, is huge. Water scarcity will make it harder to irrigate \nfields, and higher temperatures will make some areas unsuitable for \ngrowing crops. A study from the International Food Policy Research \nInstitute found that globally climate change will greatly increase \nprices for staple crops such as corn, wheat, rice, and soybeans, \nincluding an approximately 100-percent increase in the price of wheat.\n  What this means for Americans, for people all over the world who are \nalready struggling economically, is that climate change will mean less \nareas being farmed and higher food prices, something we cannot afford \nright now.\n  I think the question some viewers may have is, if the science is so \nclear--and it really is quite clear here in the United States and \naround the world--why do we not fix it? Why do we not come up with the \nbold strategy we need so America is a leader in the world in cutting \ngreenhouse gas emissions and transforming our energy system? The good \nnews here is the transformation of our energy system is going to be \nless expensive, if you like, than doing nothing.\n  Doing nothing means that we will see higher food prices, we will see \nwildfires, we will see scarcities of food, and we will see weather \ndisturbances wreaking havoc on communities all over America and around \nthe world, requiring huge amounts of monies to address those problems. \nWhat is the alternative? What do we begin to do?\n  The answer and the good news is that we--right now, today--have the \ntechnology to begin the process of significantly transforming our \nenergy system. We know how to do it with today's technology, and that \ntechnology will only be improved in months and years to come.\n  I will give a few examples of some of the good news that is happening \nin terms of the ability that we now have to move to sustainable energy.\n  The cost of solar--which certainly will be one of the major \nsustainable energy technologies that we look to in the future--\ncontinues to plummet.\n  The Solar Energy Industries Association, in a report issued only last \nweek, reported that the average weighted cost of a solar PV system was \n$2.59 per watt, a 15-percent drop from the year before.\n  According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, utility-scale \nsolar--perhaps the best comparison to utility-scale conventional \nelectricity generation--now costs on average 7.7 cents per kilowatt \nhour compared to about 10 cents per kilowatt hour on average for power \nplants now operating across the United States.\n  The cost of wind energy is also comparable to or even less than the \ncost of other more traditional energy sources. The average cost of wind \npower coming online between now and 2018 is estimated to be 8.6 cents \nper kilowatt hour, even without including the value of the production \ntax credit.\n  Moving to sustainable energies such as solar, wind, geothermal, \nbiomass, and hydropower clearly is something that we should be doing \nvery aggressively.\n  When we do that, we not only cut greenhouse gas emissions, we not \nonly significantly cut air pollution but in the process we create many \njobs as we transform our energy system. But sustainable energy is only \none part of the equation. What we must also do is invest very \nsignificantly in energy efficiency and in sustainable energy. Every \ndollar invested in efficiency and low-income households through the \nWeatherization Assistance Program results in $2.53 in energy and \nnonenergy benefits for a community.\n  I suspect the story is the same in Maine as it is in Vermont, but I \ncan remember meeting with two older women who were sisters. They lived \nin Barre, VT, and they were able to get their homes weatherized. Their \nhome, as many of the homes in Vermont, was old, leaking energy, not \nwell insulated, did not have good windows, did not have good roofing, \nand the heat was just going right through the walls. As a result of a \nweatherization project in their home, their fuel bill went down by 50 \npercent.\n  These were seniors and low-income citizens. When we move in this \ndirection, we can save Americans substantial sums on their fuel bills. \nWe create local jobs. We cut greenhouse gas emissions. If that is not a \nwin-win-win situation, then I don't know what is.\n\n[[Page S1399]]\n\n  It seems to me that we should be investing substantially in subsidies \nsuch as the Investment Tax Credit and the Production Tax Credit. Every \ndollar we invest in these efforts yields many more in savings.\n  It is also true that when some of my friends object to the government \nhelping to assist sustainable energies or putting money into energy \nefficiency, they seem to forget that the very mature and very \nprofitable fossil fuel industry benefits very substantially from the \nsubsidies that we have provided them. In fact, American taxpayers are \nset to give away over $100 billion to the oil, gas, and coal industries \nover the next decade through a wide range of subsidies, tax breaks, and \nloopholes.\n  If we can subsidize the coal industry, if we can subsidize ExxonMobil \nand the oil industry, if we can subsidize the gas industry, we sure as \nheck can subsidize and provide support for wind, solar, and other \nsustainable energies.\n  I come to the end of my remarks and suggest the following: The time \nis now for us to take bold and decisive action. As my colleague Senator \nFranken mentioned, those of us who have kids--and I have four--and \nthose of us who have grandchildren--I have seven beautiful \ngrandchildren--they will look us in the eye 20 years from now and say: \nWhy did you let this happen? Didn't you know what was happening? Didn't \nyou understand what lack of action would do for our country and the \nplanet?\n  That is the issue we face. We need to have the courage now to stand \nup to extremely wealthy and powerful forces in big energy--and that is \nthe coal companies, the oil companies, the gas companies--and come up \nwith an alternative vision for energy in America.\n  In that regard, I am proud to have joined with my colleague, the \nchair of the environmental committee, Senator Barbara Boxer, to \nintroduce last year the Climate Protection Act.\n  Our bill does what, at the end of the day, every serious person \nunderstands must be done, and that is to establish a fee on carbon \npollution emissions--an approach, by the way, endorsed not only by \nprogressives but also by moderates and even prominent conservatives \nsuch as George Shultz, Nobel laureate economist Gary Becker, Mitt \nRomney's former economic adviser Gregory Mankiw, former Reagan adviser \nArt Laffer, and former Republican Congressman Bob Inglis.\n  In other words, there is an understanding that if we are to be \nserious about addressing the need to cut carbon emissions, there has to \nbe a tax on those emissions.\n  Our legislation, which has been endorsed by, I believe, almost every \nmajor environmental organization, does several things. What we do in a \nvery significant way is to invest in energy efficiency and \nweatherization because that is the low-hanging fruit. What we also do \nis invest, very significantly, in sustainable energy. Also, \nimportantly, in the event that folks are paying increased costs for \nelectricity or for other areas, much of the money is returned directly \nto taxpayers.\n  Let me conclude by saying we can have an honest debate about the best \npath forward to transform our energy system. This is complicated stuff, \nand I don't think anyone has the magic answer, but we can debate that. \nWhat we can no longer debate is whether climate change is real, whether \nit is caused by human activity or whether it is today causing serious \nharm to our country and serious damage all over this planet or whether \nthat devastation will only get worse in years to come.\n  Right now we have to summon up the courage to acknowledge that we are \nin a crisis situation and that bold action is needed now. I happen to \nbelieve that with the United States playing a leadership role, China, \nIndia, Russia, and other major consumers of fossil fuels will follow \nour leadership. Our credibility is not much if we are not what we are \ntalking about. If we want to lead the world, we have to act. This is \nsomething our children, and our grandchildren expect of us and \nsomething I hope we can, in fact, do.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. King). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. I thank my colleagues for drawing attention to this \ncritical issue and problem.\n  I want to start with the solution. The solution to climate change is \nAmerican innovation. The solution to climate change is American \ninnovation.\n  We have to get beyond the idea first that we need to choose between a \nclean environment and a strong economy. We all want cleaner air and \nwater. We all want jobs. They don't have to contradict each other.\n  When we frame the debate as a conflict between an economy and the \nenvironment, we talk past one another and we are not realistic about \nour own history. This is, at the beginning, kind of a math problem. \nAccording to the EPA's annual inventory of greenhouse gas emissions, \nthe U.S. pumped about 6 billion tons of greenhouse gases into the \natmosphere in 2005--6 billion tons.\n  The overwhelming scientific consensus is that putting this much \npollution into the air is bad for the planet, bad for our kids, and bad \nfor our grandkids. Most scientists tell us we need to reduce emissions \nabout 17 percent from that peak by 2020 and over 80 percent by about \n2050 in order to contain climate change to manageable levels.\n  So the question is this. How do we establish the appropriate \nincentives to get that number lower to produce energy more cleanly, at \nprices we can afford, in quantities that support modern life.\n  We have to reduce pollution. We need to create jobs. Instead of \narguing which is more important, let's figure out how we can use \nAmerican innovation to do both.\n  My colleague from Vermont has talked a lot about some of the \nevidence. It is important to pay attention to patterns. In Virginia, we \nhave huge areas of risk of the negative impacts of climate change, \nespecially sea-level rise, all effects that can be traced to carbon \npollution.\n  The Hampton Roads area of Virginia is the second-most populous part \nof our State, 1.6 million people, and it is the second-most vulnerable \ncommunity on the east coast after New Orleans, the eastern half of the \nUnited States, to sea-level rise.\n  Our second-largest area, which is the home of the largest \nconcentration of naval power in the world, and critical to our defense, \nis deeply vulnerable to climate change.\n  In fact, I have friends who live in Hampton Roads in a historic \nneighborhood where homes have been occupied for 150 years. In the last \n15 years, their home has become completely unable to be occupied. They \ncannot sell it. There is no way the bank will take it back, and there \nis no way anyone will issue insurance to them.\n  In addition to being vulnerable because of our coast, our largest \nindustry in Virginia is agriculture and forestry. If we want to talk \nabout an industry that is affected by climate, that is our industry, \n$70-plus billion a year of economic activity in our State--our largest \nindustry affected by climate.\n  Tourism is big in Virginia industry--outdoor tourism. That is $20-\nplus billion a year. We are directly affected by climate, and we see \nextreme weather patterns. It is not only a Katrina, a Sandy or an Ike. \nIt is the pattern of one after the next, droughts one after the next, \nfire damage one after the next.\n  To use a recent example, we are having to deal with this in these \nhalls. We passed a flood insurance bill to delay sharp premium \nincreases for flood insurance policies that are subsidized by the \nNational Flood Insurance Program.\n  For those who weren't around when we had that debate, these increases \nin premiums were not because of new beach homes that millionaires are \nbuilding on the flood plain out on the beach. No, these were policies \nfor homes whose owners had lived in them for decades. They were never \nin flood plains before, but they are now in flood plains because of \nsea-level rise.\n  My Portsmouth friends are people who fit into that category, with a \nhome that never had these challenges--that is now a home that they \ncannot sell because of the sea-level rise in that area.\n  The debate in the Chamber focused on what it would cost to delay \npremiums, how many people would be affected and impacted by the \nsolvency of this national program. The larger point is this: Premiums \nare higher because flood risk is higher. When we see flood risk getting \nhigher in every coastal area of the country, we have to pay attention \nto what the pattern tells us. If we don't, we are foolish.\n\n[[Page S1400]]\n\n  Now, we have naysayers. There are two kinds of naysayers. There are \nscience deniers and leadership deniers, and I want to talk for a minute \nabout both. The first are a group of people who, despite the \noverwhelming scientific consensus, say: Oh no, there is no scientific \nevidence that humans affect climate change or that there is even any \nchange in the climate going on at all, despite this overwhelming \nscientific consensus. The Senator from Vermont mentioned some quotes \nfrom Members in this body who deny science exists.\n  To science deniers, I am happy to say that Virginians are pro-\nscience. We are pro-science. The quintessential Virginian, Thomas \nJefferson, was the preeminent scientist of his day. You cannot be a \nproud Virginian and be anti-science. We accept the science in Virginia. \nIn fact, the polling overwhelmingly, among the Virginia public--and we \nare not the bluest State in the country; we are a coal-producing State, \nwhich I will get to in a minute--even in coal-producing Virginia, the \npolling shows overwhelmingly that the Virginia public accepts that \nhumans are affecting climate, causing bad things to our economy, and we \nhave to do something about it.\n  Now, there is a second argument. It is not science denial; it is \nleadership denial. These folks may not deny the climate science, but \nthey deny that the United States can or should be a leader in taking \nsteps. They say: Look, even if we reduce U.S. emissions to zero, it \nwouldn't offset world emissions unless China or India did something, so \nlet's just not do anything.\n  It is just not the American way, folks, for us not to lead on \nsomething as important as this. It is true that we need every country \nto reduce emissions in the long run, but that is not an argument for \nthe United States to do nothing; that is an argument for the United \nStates to step up and be leaders.\n  Part of leadership is sending the right signals into the market at \nthe right time. That is one of the reasons I think it would be very \ngood if the President rejected the proposal to expand use of tar sands \noil in the Keystone Pipeline program. We ought to send the right \nmessage right now. That is one of the most powerful things we could do \nin our country and beyond to show we are going to be leaders.\n  It is very difficult to lead and impossible to get people to follow \nif you are not willing to take a step as the most powerful and \ninnovative economy in the world. We are the largest economy in the \nworld, and we have been since 1890. We are the global economic leader. \nWe have a burden of leadership. And if we lead, we will succeed.\n  It is not too hard to reduce emissions. We can reduce them. In fact, \nwe are already starting. The Senator from Vermont mentioned this. I \nmentioned that in 2005 the United States was putting 6 billion tons of \nCO2 into the atmosphere. That was our base year. We have now \nactually dipped down to 5.6 billion tons. We have reduced it since 2005 \nthanks to greater energy efficiency, natural gas, uptick in renewables, \nand better fuel standards in our vehicles. So we are already on a \npositive path. We are actually on the way to meeting our goal of \nreducing emissions 17 percent by the year 2020. We are on the right \ntrack; we just have to take more steps forward.\n  So what is the strategy we need? I hear the President sometimes and \nothers--and I may even use these words on occasion--talk about an ``all \nof the above'' energy strategy, and I have decided I really don't like \nthat phrase. When I hear somebody say ``all of the above,'' it is like \nwhen I ask one of my teenagers something and he says: ``Whatever.'' I \ndon't like ``whatever'' as an answer because it kind of sounds \nindifferent and anything goes and who cares and what difference does it \nmake. ``All of the above'' kind of has that attitude a little bit.\n  Now, sure, we should use all of our energy resources--I get that--in \na comprehensive strategy, but what we really need is a comprehensive \nstrategy that reduces CO2 emissions--that reduces \nCO2 emissions. Such a strategy to reduce emissions does mean \neverything: wind, solar, geothermal, tidal, and advanced biofuels. I \nthink it also means natural gas as bridge fuel to reduce our carbon \nfootprint; nuclear, if we can reduce costs and resolve disposal issues; \nand, yes, coal, so long as we always work to make it burn cleaner.\n  This is my punch line of what we have to do: We have to do everything \ncleaner tomorrow than we are doing it today--everything cleaner \ntomorrow than we are doing it today.\n  We will have fossil fuels with us for some time, and we won't bring \nemissions to zero anytime soon. But just because we can't immediately \ngo from 6 billion to zero tons of CO2, we can't rest in our \neffort to reduce our CO2 every day a little bit more. On \nfossil fuels, we have to take any progress we can that replaces dirty \nwith less dirty even if it doesn't get us the whole way. Over time, the \nportion of our total energy footprint that is carbon based will get \nsmaller as we develop more noncarbon alternatives, and it will also get \ncleaner as we reduce carbon-based energy emissions with better \ntechnology.\n  This is why I am against dirty fossil fuels, such as tar sands, which \nmake us dirtier tomorrow than today. I want to be cleaner tomorrow than \ntoday. Tar sands oil is about 15 to 20 percent dirtier than \nconventional oil. Let's not be dirtier tomorrow than today. We have the \ntrendline moving in the right direction. We are reducing CO2 \nemissions. Let's be cleaner tomorrow than today. Why would we embrace \ntar sands oil and backslide to be dirtier tomorrow? The bottom line is \nthat we have to create energy cleaner tomorrow than today.\n  Remember, it is a math problem--6 billion tons a year. We have 6 more \nyears to reduce it 17 percent, 36 years to reduce it by more than 80 \npercent. So we have our goal. We have our goal. We have to give \ninnovators the tools they need to meet it. Since innovators will solve \nthis problem, here is the really fundamental challenge. This is the \nfundamental challenge. Will Americans be the innovators? See, \ninnovation will solve this problem. Will Americans be the innovators or \nwill we bury our heads in the tar sands and let other nations' \ninnovators be the ones who grab leadership in this new energy economy. \nI don't want to bury my head in the tar sands. I want us to be the \nleader. Will we create the new technologies and sell them to other \nnations or will we be late to the game and have to buy all the \ntechnologies from other nations?\n\n  The good news is, as I said, we are already on our way to the 2020 \ngoal, so we don't have to make it all dire. Let's celebrate a little \nsuccess and then figure out how to accelerate our success.\n  The transportation sector, the fuel economy standards for cars, \nchanging to natural gas in power production--all these things have \nhelped us move toward lesser emissions. Wind is the fastest growing \nsource of new electricity capacity in the world and in the United \nStates, even above natural gas, which is growing rapidly. In a few \nyears Virginia will be contributing, with some of the first offshore \nwind turbines near Virginia Beach.\n  I would like to talk now for a second about a specific Virginia issue \nbecause I am not sure how many folks who are in this all-nighter \nspeaking on this come from States that have coal and have produced \ncoal, and Virginia does. I want to talk about coal for a second.\n  EPA is expected to issue standards later this year on reducing \npollution from coal-fired powerplants, and, in fact, there is already \ntalk on the other side of introducing a bill to repeal the regulation \nbefore the regulation has even come out. I am not exactly sure that is \nkosher, but I suspect we will be having that debate later.\n  There is a natural anxiety in a coal-producing region such as \nsouthwest Virginia. That is where my wife's family is from. It is five \ncounties in southwest Virginia. They are hard-hit counties. Coal is a \nbig part of their economy, and traditionally it has been. We mine as \nmuch coal today in Virginia as we did 50 years ago with one-tenth of \nthe workers because it is a heavily mechanized industry, but there are \njobs at stake. And it is not just jobs; coal has been traditionally low \npriced, and so the issue that is important--and even States that don't \nhave any coal often use a lot of coal to produce power, and the low \nprice has been helpful to consumers who rely on cheap and abundant \nelectricity made possible by coal.\n  Coal has been hit hard in some recent years, but I disagree \nfundamentally\n\n[[Page S1401]]\n\nwith the cynical argument that is made by some--mostly in the coal \nindustry--who blame coal's woes on a regulatory ``war on coal.'' When I \ntalk to folks in the industry, they are always talking about there is a \nFederal ``war on coal.''\n  I am going to tell you what is hurting coal. What is hurting coal is \ninnovation and natural gas. Innovation in the natural gas industry has \nbrought natural gas prices down, and utilities are deciding to use \nnatural gas rather than coal. That is what is hurting coal these days, \nand we ought to take a lesson from that. Innovation is driving \nenvironmental cleanliness. Innovation is driving lower cost. The \nsolution is not to stop innovation. The solution is not to shake your \nfist and blame regulation. The solution is to innovate.\n  Coal currently accounts for 37 percent of U.S. electricity generation \nand about the same percentage in Virginia. Today we don't have 37 \npercent of anything else that can step right in and replace coal, which \nmeans we need coal and we are going to be using it for a while.\n  Since we need to reduce emissions--do it cleaner tomorrow than \ntoday--and we are going to need coal for a while, the challenge is to \nconvert coal to electricity more efficiently and with less pollution \nthan we do today. We have to innovate to make coal cleaner for that \nportion of the pie chart. I learned this as Governor working to permit \na state-of-the-art coal plant in Wise County, VA. It opened in 2012. It \nis designed in a way that dramatically reduces sulfur dioxide, nitrous \noxide, mercury emissions, and water use. It was also a plant that was \nonly permitted when the company that wanted it agreed to take a dirty \ncoal plant--one that preexisted the Clean Air Act and was grandfathered \nin for all of its pollution--and to convert that to natural gas. That \nwas innovative. The fuel mix of this plant needed to run the burners \naccommodates biomass and waste coal as well.\n  If we can use innovative practices to reduce these emissions, we can \ndo the same with carbon emissions. But coal cannot stand still, let \nothers innovate, and then complain if it is not competitive. Coal has \nto be as innovative as everything else, and we have to figure out ways \nto assist.\n  That is why I support Federal investments in advanced fossil energy \nresearch and development. Last fall the Energy Department made \navailable $8 billion in advanced fossil energy loan guarantee authority \nfor low carbon fossil technologies. I advocated for appropriations for \nfossil energy R, and there is a strong boost for those programs in \nthe omnibus budget bill. There is a great Center for Coal & Energy \nResearch at Virginia Tech that is doing some of this research that can \nhelp us take that portion of the pie chart, make it cleaner, and over \ntime make it smaller as we expand noncarbon energy.\n\n  We have to make sure the upcoming standards the EPA will put out are \nambitious and appropriate incentives to get cleaner and disincentives \nto get dirtier and at the same time avoid catastrophic disruptions in \nreliability or affordability.\n  I am going to come back and conclude where I started. Remember, when \nI started I said I am going to give a solution. The solution to climate \nchange is American innovation, and I want to finish there.\n  Reducing CO2 emissions is a hard problem, maybe harder \nthan any pollution problem we face because most pollutants tend to come \nfrom a particular economic sector, but CO2 comes from \ntransportation and buildings and manufacturing and power production--\nall sectors. So the solution won't be simple. But we do not have to \naccept the false choice of an environment against the economy. Instead, \nwe just need to innovate to find the solution. That is the innovation \nchallenge we have.\n  I make it a habit--apparently unlike some of my colleagues here--to \nnever bet against American innovation. We are the Nation that said we \nwould put a man on the Moon in a decade with computers that had less in \nthem than your cell phones do, and we did it. We are the Nation that \nharnessed the power of the atom. We are the Nation that unwrapped the \nriddle of DNA and are now using that knowledge to cure disease. Nobody \nshould ever bet against American innovation.\n  In fact, we have already shown it again and again, that innovation \nand regulation--smart regulation--can help us tackle pressing \nenvironmental problems.\n  When we were kids and my wife was growing up in Richmond, where we \nnow live, nobody--and I mean nobody--fished or swam in the James River \nin downtown Richmond. You would be taking your life into your hands if \nyou swam or if you ate fish you caught in that river because of ketone \npollution, other industrial pollution, and poor treatment of municipal \nsolid waste. But the Nation passed the Clean Water Act and we got \nserious about cleaning up our rivers.\n  Naysayers said: It will damage the economy. It will bring our economy \nto its knees.\n  But come and see what the Clean Water Act has meant to my hometown. \nYou can swim or fish in the James River today, and you can eat the fish \nyou catch. You can see herons and bald eagles there that were never \nthere before. You can see residents and tourists who flock to the James \nRiver because they enjoy it.\n  It took a law, it took some tough regulations, it took American \ningenuity in finding new ways to clean up industrial and municipal \nwaste, but we did it, and our environment and economy are better off as \na result.\n  When we needed to reduce nitrous oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions \nbecause of acid rain, industry said that any new law would be a \nburdensome job killer, just as they are saying today. But President \nGeorge H.W. Bush worked with Congress to pass a cap-and-trade law to \nbring down these emissions. After the new law, somebody invented the \ncatalytic converter. After the new law, somebody invented the sulfur \nscrubber. Not only weren't they burdensome job killers, they improved \nair quality, and they created jobs for American companies that \nmanufacture catalytic converters and sulfur scrubbers, and our economy \nand environment are better off as a result.\n\n  Not long ago we heard requiring automakers to make cars which got \nbetter gas mileage would be devastating to the American auto industry. \nBut President Obama struck a deal with the industry, and guess what. \nThe quest to build more fuel-efficient vehicles helped revitalize an \nAmerican auto industry which was on its back. Plants operating with \nskeleton crews just sweeping the floors at night now have multiple \nshifts making better vehicles which save drivers more money every day. \nThe skeptics were loud, but we moved ahead with smart regulation and \nAmerican innovation, and our environment and economy are better off as \na result.\n  It is the skeptics and the deniers who fight against these strategies \nwho are actually naive, because again and again they always claim that \ntaking steps to help the environment will hurt the economy, and again \nand again they have been proven wrong. Protecting the environment is \ngood for the economy and good for the planet.\n  So I say to the skeptics of whatever variety, climate denier or \nleadership denier, don't underestimate American innovation. We can \nsolve the problem of climate change for the good of the economy and the \ngood of the planet. The story of American innovation is a story of \nsolving the hard problems, and I know we can solve this one.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I appreciate the words of my colleague \nfrom Virginia, especially his focus on innovation and how it must be a \nmajor part of the solution to our climate change problem.\n  As I look around the Chamber and see Senators from Vermont, Virginia, \nHawaii, California, we may be 5,000 miles apart, but what unites us \ntoday--including the Presiding Officer's home State of Maine--is the \nfocus on climate change and the recognition we are connected by the \nimpact of global climate change. It is time for Congress to wake up and \ntackle this issue. This is why we are staying up all night tonight to \nmake that major point.\n  The consequences of climate change include rising seas and larger \ntidal surges for seaside communities, the devastating drought and water \nshortage we are seeing in California, extreme weather harming the \nhabitat for\n\n[[Page S1402]]\n\nnative animals in Hawaii, but it also impacts the Midwest, which I \ndon't think is the first area of the country people think about where \nwe are seeing climate change problems.\n  We have seen increased potential in my home State of Minnesota for \nextreme weather wreaking havoc on our local economies, particularly \nthose anchored in forestry and farming. In Minnesota we export about \none-third of our agricultural production which contributes \nsignificantly to our country's record high agricultural trade surplus \nof $38 billion. This is a major part of our economy and the second \nbiggest industry in my State.\n  The 2012 drought in Minnesota threatened our ability to produce the \nfood needed to feed a growing world. Look at our lakes and our rivers. \nFor many years our snowmobilers, the tourism industry, and ice fishers \ncouldn't even get out. They had to cancel many activities because--not \nthis year but many years before--we had issues with the heat in the \nmiddle of the winter. We certainly have issues with the heat in the \nsummer.\n  What is this industry? Every year nearly 2 million people fish in our \nlakes and streams, and close to 700,000 people hunt our fields and \nforests nationwide. The hunting and fishing industry is valued at $95.5 \nbillion a year and brings in $14 billion in direct tax revenue. This is \nwhy, as a member of the farm bill conference committee, we worked very \nhard with conservation groups such as Ducks Unlimited and Pheasants \nForever to make sure we had strong conservation protection in the bill \nand new ideas, such as the sod saver provision Senator Thune and I \nintroduced and got signed into law.\n  For the people of our State, the economic impact of climate change is \nabout their livelihood. It is about a way of life. I mentioned the 2012 \ndrought. It was the worst drought since 1956 and cost over $30 billion \nin damage nationwide. The drought was uneven in our State. For one \nfarmer their crops were fine; in the next county crops would be \ndevastated. At the same time, as some farmers were experiencing not \nenough rain, farmers in other parts of our State actually lost their \ncrops due to flash floods.\n  Research which looks at weather changes in Minnesota indicates that \nextreme weather events, which include heavy rainfall, are becoming more \nand more frequent. These are costs borne heavily by farmers, ranchers, \nand consumers. These production costs lose revenue, they lose supply, \nand they drive up costs at the grocery store for everyone.\n  One of the things I don't think people always think about when they \nthink about the economic connection with climate change--in the Midwest \nwe think about our crops; we think about extreme weather, with \ntornadoes, flash floods, and extreme heat and drought. But it actually \naffects the transportation of goods to market.\n  In 2012 Lake Superior was near its lowest level in the last 80 years, \nimpacting our ability to transport cargo. It is simple: The heat was \nthere, the water wasn't. The barges couldn't be filled all the way \nbecause the water was simply too shallow. Why is this happening? In the \nyears when we don't have solid ice cover, the ice is melting more \nquickly so the water evaporates and you see lower water levels in \nplaces such as Lake Superior.\n  This isn't just a problem for Lake Superior; it is also a critical \nissue impacting the shipping industry on the Mississippi River. The \nMississippi moves hundreds of millions of tons of goods, such as corn, \ngrain, coal, and petroleum. The Mississippi River starts in Minnesota. \nIn Minnesota one can actually walk over the Mississippi at Itasca State \nPark. The 2012 drought led to low water conditions which made barge \ntravel down the Mississippi very difficult. If shipping were completely \ncut off, as was possible, the economic repercussions would be severe. \nIf barge traffic is disrupted, cargo valued at over $7 billion could \nexperience shipping delays, including 300 million bushels of farm \nproducts, 3.8 million tons of coal, and 5 million barrels of \ndomestically produced crude oil. A prolonged shipping delay would be \ndevastating to the bottom lines of farmers, businesses, and common \ncitizens. These are just a few examples of the economic costs of \nclimate change.\n  Global climate change is a challenge with so many dimensions, some \nmoral, some economic, some scientific, and I will spend a few minutes \ntalking about the science. My colleague from Virginia talked about \nVirginia being the home of science. I kind of wanted to break in and \nsay we have the Mayo Clinic. Minnesota is truly a home of science. We \nare the home of great medical institutions. We helped launch the green \nrevolution in agriculture with University of Minnesota alumni Norman \nBorlaug one-half century ago. We have brought the world everything from \nthe pacemaker to the Post-it note. We believe in science.\n  As we know, climate change doesn't mean every day we will have a \nhurricane in the Gulf of Mexico or every day will be as hot and sticky \nas a 100-degree, humid Minnesota afternoon. But scientists say we are \nsure to see more days outside the range of normal, which includes \nextremes of all kinds.\n  In fact, scientists at NASA found that at 2013, factoring all the \ncold temperatures Minnesotans bravely endured last year, the United \nStates was still warmer by 1.1 degrees Fahrenheit than the mid-20th \ncentury average.\n  The last time the United States had a below-average annual \ntemperature was 1976. Climate change means simply, over time, the \naverage temperature is getting warmer and weather patterns are changing \nand becoming less predictable. How many times have we heard in our \nStates: This is the hottest summer I can remember. I can't believe it \nwarmed up this quickly. I can't believe the ice is melting this \nquickly.\n  The debate on whether climate change is happening should be over. The \nfacts are in and the science is clear.\n  The National Academy of Sciences finds climate change is occurring, \nis very likely caused primarily by the emission of greenhouse gases \nfrom human activities, and poses significant risk for a range of human \nand natural systems. We know certain kinds of gases, including carbon \ndioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, absorb or trap the Sun's heat as \nit bounces off the Earth's surface.\n  This wouldn't be such a big problem except that carbon dioxide \ndoesn't dissipate quickly. It stays in the atmosphere for five decades \nor more, causing Earth's temperatures to rise. This means most of the \ncarbon dioxide produced in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s is still \nin the atmosphere. It means carbon dioxide produced today will still be \nin the atmosphere in 2050 and beyond. This carbon dioxide-trapping heat \nis in our atmosphere. Over time, it means global temperatures rise; in \nturn, sea levels rise, both because water expands and glaciers melt.\n  The 2013 draft National Climate Assessment found human-induced \nclimate change is projected to continue and accelerate significantly if \nemissions of these heat-trapping gases continue to increase.\n  In short, there is robust scientific evidence that human climate \nchange is occurring. Climate change is impacting our Nation's systems \nin significant ways, and that is likely to accelerate in the future. \nThe result is ocean levels are rising, glaciers are melting, violent \nweather events are increasing, and certainly we have seen them in my \nState.\n  When it comes to climate and environmental policy, I think we all \nknow we have seen gridlock in this country, just as we have seen in so \nmany ways--despite the Presiding Officer's good efforts as the Senator \nfrom Maine in trying to break through and mine as someone who came out \nof a background which wasn't at all partisan. I was involved early on \nin Kent Conrad's bipartisan energy group during my first few years in \nthe Senate, where we were trying to forge some kind of a compromise on \na policy approach to energy and the environment which brought people \ntogether. We were stymied in our effort. I served on the environmental \ncommittee for many years under Senator Boxer's leadership. We were \nagain stymied in our efforts.\n  As I look back at the moments where we could actually move on the \nissue, where the Nation was captivated, I think we blew it.\n  We blew it when President Bush stood before the American people after \n9/11; and if he had truly sold the Nation on energy independence from \nthe countries involved in that tragic historic moment, if he had made \nthe case for a\n\n[[Page S1403]]\n\nnew American energy agenda, I believe 80 percent of Americans then \nwould have said sign me up. That didn't happen.\n  The second moment we lost was during the summer of 2008. The \nPresiding Officer wasn't a Senator then; I was a brandnew Senator. We \nactually took action. We raised gas mileage standards for the first \ntime since I was in junior high. We also made some energy efficiency \nimprovements. I called them ``building a bridge to the next century.'' \nBut we fell short of one important thing, and we didn't just fall \nshort. We fell one vote short of beating the filibuster to get a \nnational renewable electricity standard like we have in Minnesota. That \nwas a lost moment by one vote.\n  The third moment we lost was when President Obama first came into \noffice. We had some new Senators. We were in the middle of a downturn. \nIt was an incredibly tough time. But I still believe, as I have said \nmany times, if we had moved forward on a renewable electricity standard \nat that time in those first 6 months with those new Senators, we would \nhave passed it with the House of Representatives. We chose to do some \nother things with the environmental committees. We passed a bill, but \nwe were, unfortunately, unable to get it done on the Senate floor. That \nis where we are.\n  So when is the next opportunity? The next opportunity is now. We have \nthe potential for leadership on energy. We have the potential because \nof the people in this country--the innovators Senator Kaine so \neloquently talked about. I continue to be optimistic. I wouldn't be \nstanding here late at night if I wasn't. This desk is the desk of \nHubert Humphrey, who was known as the Happy Warrior. He was willing to \ntackle anything which came his way.\n  Why am I optimistic? The first is the leadership of Gina McCarthy at \nthe EPA. Her background working with Republican Governors, her \nreputation among business leaders as being tough but fair, and her \nexperience navigating the ways of Washington make her well suited to \nlook at the bigger picture issues.\n  As someone who comes from an agricultural state, I understand full \nwell how the EPA can sometimes get bogged down in minor issues from my \nperspective, taking on things that create a huge firestorm that \nactually do not solve the problem. I believe this Administrator, Gina \nMcCarthy, is going to look at the larger mission of the EPA, especially \nwhen it comes to climate change.\n  Secondly, I am optimistic because we still have some good happening \nhere. There is some realism going on in Congress. The Washington Post \nran an editorial last fall where the editorial board wrote:\n\n       The overriding problem is that Congress hasn't faced up to \n     the global warming threat. Instead of updating clean air \n     rules and building a policy that addresses the unique \n     challenge of greenhouse emissions, it has left the EPA and \n     the courts with a strong but sometimes ambiguous law that \n     applies imperfectly to greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n  That is true, and that is why we have something to do here.\n  Given the current mix right now, given what we are facing on this \nissue, I still believe.\n  What can we do this year? This year we can be pragmatic. We can \nfoster leadership. We passed the farm bill. It had good measures in it \nfor conservation and the environment.\n  Another example is the Shaheen-Portman energy efficiency bill which \ncontains a range of policies that would reduce residential, commercial, \nand industrial use. Not every bill is supported with everyone from the \nChamber and NAM to many environmental groups. This bill is.\n  This leads to my third reason for hope. There are a lot of businesses \nout there that realize they cannot afford the pure cost of the old way \nof doing things. More and more businesses are seeing the good in going \ngreen, whether it is Walmart in its push toward energy efficiency or \nApple which is working toward a goal of getting 100 percent of its \nenergy from renewables.\n  The fourth reason to be positive is because there are some current \neconomic positives and market changes out there that are actually \nmoving in the right direction. We have reduced our dependency on \nforeign oil in just the last 7 years from 60 percent to 40 percent. It \nis a combination of things. Yes, some of the natural gas and drilling \nin North Dakota is a major force, but we also have stronger vehicle gas \nmileage standards. We have biofuel. We have cleaner fuel. We are moving \non a number of fronts.\n  Look at the efforts on the State level ranging from the rules in \nTexas that are helping to encourage the construction of transmission \nlines bringing wind energy from the plains to the homes and businesses, \nto Colorado's strong renewable portfolio standard and the use of woody \nbiomass for power.\n  I would add my own State of Minnesota where we have a renewable \nelectricity standard requiring 25 percent of electricity coming from \nrenewable sources by 2025. Xcel Energy, our largest utility, is on its \nway to meet their even more ambitious standard. By law they will get 30 \npercent of their electricity from renewable sources by 2020. I have met \nwith their CEO. They are more than on their way to meeting that \nstandard. They believe in wind. They believe in renewable.\n  The bill we passed in Minnesota, which could be a model for the \nNation, has overwhelming bipartisan support. It had bipartisan support, \nand when it passed, nearly every legislator voted for it and it was \nsigned into law by former Governor Tim Pawlenty.\n  What does this mean? The investment in renewable energy and energy \nefficiency technology means that Xcel is actually on its path to reduce \nits greenhouse emissions by 31 percent. Xcel will cut its emissions a \nfull 11 percentage points by 2020, more than the standards proposed by \nthe passed cap-and-trade law that came out of the environment \ncommittee.\n  Minnesota Power is another utility in our State that is working to \nmeet the State's renewable portfolio standard by bringing more wind \nenergy onto the grid. They are looking to keep costs low to their \nconsumers by using Canadian hydropower to back up their wind resources. \nBecause the wind doesn't always blow in Minnesota, the hydropower will \nact as a battery, storing energy when there is too much on the grid, \nand providing electricity when it is needed. By working together we can \nget more wind and solar energy on the grid in a way that provides \nreliable service and keeps prices low for our consumers.\n  The Rural Electric Co-op also implemented another way to make better \nuse of wind energy in Minnesota, to make our goal of 25 percent by \n2025. They installed large capacity hot water heaters in people's \nbasements. How can something as basic and boring as a hot water heater \nplay a role in reducing energy consumption and climate change? The hot \nwater heaters are only turned on at night when the wind blows the \nstrongest and the demand for energy is the lowest. In the morning when \npeople wake up and turn on their lights, the heater is already off. The \nwind energy is stored in the form of hot water that can be used \nthroughout the day. Heating water is a major source of energy \nconsumption and our co-op could find a way to provide an important \nservice in a way that incentivizes wind development and saves consumers \nmoney.\n  It was the Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis who said that ``the \nstates are the laboratories of democracy.'' We are certainly seeing \nthat right now with energy and environmental policy.\n  I would like to see a major Federal policy back at those moments that \nI went through back when Bush was President and the tragedy of 9/11 \noccurred, back when we had that vote in the summer, when we missed the \nrenewable electricity standard by just one vote. But I am hopeful that \nwe are going to get back to a point where compromise is possible in \nWashington, and we will get there just as the American people have \ndemanded. And when we get there, we know that the States are useful \nmodels for how to get this done.\n  Before we can act on a comprehensive national blueprint for climate \npolicy in this country, we need to bring together Americans who share \nthese values and speak with a common voice. We are starting that \ndiscussion tonight. The message is to get Congress to wake up and get \nthis job done.\n  As I close, I think about this challenge and I recall a prayer from \nthe\n\n[[Page S1404]]\n\nOjibwe people in Minnesota. Their philosophy told them that the \ndecisions of great leaders are not made for today, not made for this \ngeneration, but leaders must make decisions for those who are seven \ngenerations from them. That would be an Ojibwe philosophy, that led \nthem to take care of their land. This is now a part of our burden and \nour challenge as we approach this issue. I have always believed we \nshould be stewards of the land.\n  In the past, leaders from both parties--you know this so well from \nme--have worked to protect our land, keep our air and water clean. \nPresident Theodore Roosevelt took executive action to create the \nNational Parks System which Ken Burns famously called ``America's best \nidea.''\n  Congress has come together to make great progress to protect our \nnatural resources. The 1970 Clean Air Act passed in the Senate 73-0 and \nthe House by a vote of 371-1. The Clean Water Act in the House, the \nfinal vote was over 10-1 in favor of this landmark legislation to \nprotect our water.\n  Global climate change is our generation's challenge to solve. It is \nour generation's challenge. I believe if we work together \nconstructively, we can address this threat. We can be stewards of our \nworld.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I am honored to be joining Senator Schatz \nwho has been working with Senator Whitehouse and with Senator Boxer to \nput together this very important discussion, very important evening.\n  While we are discussing climate change, I thought I would first talk \na little bit about baseball. Something very funny happened in baseball. \nFrom 1920 all the way through the entire modern baseball history, the \naverage number of players who hit more than 40 homeruns in a season was \n3. That is all--Babe Ruth, Hank Greenberg, Willie Mays, Mickey Mantle, \nTed Williams, Joe DiMaggio. No matter who was playing in the United \nStates, the average number of players was 3.3 who made it over 40 \nhomeruns in a season.\n  Then something very strange started to happen. All of a sudden there \nwas a dramatic spike in the number of players who could hit more than \n40 homeruns. In 1996 it went up to 17 players all of a sudden, with an \naverage of only 3.3 who hit more than 40 homeruns. Year after year the \nsame thing was occurring.\n  Then it occurred to someone, maybe they are injecting these players \nwith steroids. Now some people said, no, the ballparks are getting \nsmaller, maybe they are corking the bats, maybe they are juicing the \nbaseball. But, no, it turned out that they were injecting steroids into \nbaseball players. And all of a sudden the average of 3.3 players \naveraging more than 40 homeruns in a season had spiked to three and \nfour times that, until Major League Baseball decided that they were \ngoing to test for steroids. A very strange thing started to happen. The \naverage number of players hitting more than 40 homeruns went right back \ndown to the traditional average.\n  Well, ladies and gentlemen, NOAA has the same kind of chart for our \nclimate. NOAA has been able to do the calculation going back to 1880 of \nwhat the average temperature is on the planet. As you can see, it \nstayed at a pretty current level until all of a sudden, especially \nbeginning in the 1970s, there is a dramatic spike. As we all know, 20 \nof the warmest 30 years ever registered have occurred in the last 30 \nyears. As we all know, the fourth warmest year of all time ever \nrecorded occurred just last year, 2013. But we haven't applied the same \nsteroids equivalent test for this change in temperature. We have a \npretty good idea of what has happened because scientists all across the \nUnited States agree on this issue: It is manmade. The chemicals we are \nputting into the atmosphere are causing the same kind of chemicals \nballplayers were putting into their bodies were causing in the dramatic \nrise in the number of homeruns that were being hit in Major League \nBaseball.\n  (Ms. KLOBUCHAR assumes the Chair.)\n  This is basically an obvious correlation between what we are doing as \nhuman beings and impact on the world in which we live. And just as \nthose homeruns went up when the players used chemicals, so too has the \ntemperature on the planet. And the same distortions that occurred in \nour national pastime are now occurring on our planet.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, the planet is running a fever, but there are no \nemergency rooms for planets. There are no hospitals to go to. We have \nto engage in preventive care. We have to put in place the measures that \nreduce dramatically the likelihood that we are going to see the worst \ncatastrophic effects of this dangerous warming of our planet.\n  If you are still skeptical, perhaps the findings of another skeptic, \nDr. Richard Muller and his colleagues at the Berkeley Earth Surface \nTemperature Project, will reassure you. Let me quote from Dr. Muller's \nJuly 2012 New York Times column entitled ``The Conversion of a Climate \nChange Skeptic.'' Here is what he said:\n\n       Our results show that the average temperature of the \n     earth's land has risen by two and a half degrees Fahrenheit \n     over the last 250 years, including an increase of one and a \n     half degrees over the most recent 50 years. Moreover, it \n     appears likely that essentially all of this increase results \n     from the human emissions of greenhouse gases.\n\n  Our current understanding of human influence on climate change rests \non 150 years of wide-ranging scientific observations and research. It \nis informed by what we see today with our own eyes measured by our own \nhands. Global temperatures are warming, glaciers are melting, sea \nlevels are rising, extreme downpours are increasing. The ocean is \nbecoming more acidic.\n  But climate change is more than just numbers in a scientist's book. \nIn my home State of Massachusetts it is having tangible impacts now. My \nState, Massachusetts, loses an average of 49 football fields of land to \nrising sea levels each and every year. Rates of sea level rise from \nNorth Carolina to Massachusetts are two to four times faster than the \nglobal average. Extreme downpours and snowfall in New England have \nincreased by 85 percent since 1948.\n  According to scientists at the University of New Hampshire, New \nEngland winters have become 4 degrees warmer on average since 1965. In \nother words, we now have in New England the same weather that \nPhiladelphia had in 1965. We are 4 degrees warmer than we were in New \nEngland in 1965. We have Philadelphia's weather. Thank God in Boston we \ndo not have their athletic teams, but we do have their weather and it \nis getting warmer.\n  In Massachusetts and most of New England, spring has sprung 5 days \nearlier on average than it did in the latter part of the 20th century.\n  Around the iconic Walden Pond, plants now flower 10 days earlier on \naverage than they did in the 1850s, according to the careful records \nkept by Henry David Thoreau. Our iconic cod have been moving north as \nocean temperatures warm. Cod need cold water. As the ocean warms, they \nare moving farther and farther north. In Massachusetts, Cape Cod is our \niconic beach front, ocean front, and fishing front. The cod are moving \nnorth and away from our State because they need cold water.\n  The coastal communities that depend upon them are being affected \nnegatively by the absence of these fish. Scientists are just beginning \nto understand the consequences of the increasingly acidic ocean on \nscallops, lobsters, and plankton, which are the base of the food chain \nin the gulf of Maine.\n  As Dr. Aaron Bernstein, from the Harvard School of Public Health, has \nwritten, climate change is a health threat, no less consequential than \ncigarette smoking. Increasing temperatures increase the risk for bad \nair days, and in turn it increases the risk of asthma attacks. It is \nworse for people with lung disease.\n  I have two stories. Rachel is from Cambridge and Sylvia is from \nAmherst. Their moms talked about the impact of pollution on the health \nof their children. I think it is important for us to understand that \nasthma and other illnesses that are created by pollution are \npreventable but only if we here in the Senate put in place the policies \nthat make it possible for us to reduce the risk to these young people \nall across our country.\n  I strongly support all of the efforts the Members are putting \ntogether tonight to focus on this issue. It is not\n\n[[Page S1405]]\n\njust the planet, it is the children of the planet who are negatively \nimpacted by all of this additional pollution. Left unchecked, the \nimpacts of climate change will only become worse in the future.\n  An analysis by the Sandia National Lab found that changes in rainfall \nalone could cost Massachusetts $8 billion in GDP and nearly 38,000 jobs \nbetween 2010 and 2050. That is Massachusetts alone. New England could \nsee a $22 billion hit to our GDP and almost 100,000 jobs lost from \nchanging precipitation patterns. Sea-level rise will also threaten \ncoastal communities where one-third of the Massachusetts population \nlives.\n  The seas are getting hotter and they are getting higher. Those \nhotter, higher seas are making storms more damaging. Storm surges on \ntop of sea-level rise could cause hundreds of billions in damages to \ncities on the Massachusetts coast during the next decade.\n  In 1775 Paul Revere warned Massachusetts revolutionaries of an \ninvasion coming from the sea. With climate change, Boston and the Bay \nState could face an invasion of the sea itself in Massachusetts and all \nacross New England.\n  As sea levels rise and storms become more severe, many of Boston's \nbest known landmarks will be threatened, including Faneuil Hall, Quincy \nMarket, North Station, Fan Pier, Copley Church, John Hancock Tower, the \nPublic Garden. The Back Bay will revert to its original personality as \na bay.\n  We have to be realistic about this. The threats are there. The \nscientists are warning us. This can happen. There but for the grace of \nGod and a few degrees, Hurricane Sandy would have damaged the city of \nBoston. We have been warned. Anyone who hasn't been hit by a Hurricane \nSandy yet has been warned. It is coming, and it will be worse than \nHurricane Sandy.\n  By the end of this century, Massachusetts summers could feel like \nNorth Carolina's summer--not Philadelphia. By the end of the century, \nthe temperatures are going to keep warming. By 2100, Maine could be the \nonly State in New England that still has a skiing industry. That is how \nrapidly the snows are disappearing. The economic impact of climate \nchange isn't confined to New England because we already feel the cost \nof climate disruption. The GAO added climate change to its 2013 high-\nrisk list based in large part on two reports they did at my request. \nGAO found that climate change presents a significant financial risk to \nthe Federal Government. GAO could just as easily say it presents a \nsignificant financial risk for all of America.\n  As daunting as the impacts of climate change are, the good news is we \nhave the solutions to address it. We can generate good jobs in America \nthat are also good for saving all of creation.\n  With wind and solar, we have a tale of two tax policies. Here is the \nsolar industry in the United States. Back in 2007, there was a \nproduction of perhaps 200 megawatts of electricity from solar. It was \nat the dawn of the solar industry. It wasn't as though the Sun had not \nbeen up there or that the technologies did not exist or could not have \nbeen created in order to capture it, but the tax policies were not \nthere.\n  In 2008, Congress passed a law which added an 8-year tax incentive \nfor the solar industry. We can see what happened to this industry. It \nhad been denigrated for years--up until last year when there was 5,000 \nnew megawatts. Think of five Seabrook nuclear powerplants of \nelectricity generated by solar in 1 year. That tax break stays on the \nbooks until the end of 2016, and by the end of 2016, there is an \nexpectation that 10,000 new megawatts of solar will be installed in the \nUnited States in 1 year, ladies and gentlemen, if we keep those tax \nbreaks on the books. We can see what happens when there is a \nconsistent, predictable tax policy on the books.\n  Let me show you another tax policy. This is the tax policy for the \nwind industry. The wind industry has not had the same good fortune \nwhich the solar industry has had. Every time there is a tax policy that \nis put on the books, wind starts to build upwards of 2,000 megawatts in \n2001, but then the tax policy evaporated and it collapsed as an \nindustry. When we put it back on the books, it went back up to 2,000 \nmegawatts. It expired at the end of that year and collapsed again.\n  In 2005, we put a policy on the books that began to see the kind of \ninstallation of wind that we knew was possible from the beginning of \ntime. We all knew it. We all knew the Dutch were right with those \nwindmills. We all knew there was something to it, but there was no tax \npolicy that was consistent, until we reached 2012 when, \nunbelievably, 13,000 new megawatts of wind was installed in the United \nStates--13 nuclear powerplants. There is only 100,000 megawatts of \nnuclear power in the United States after 70 years of tax subsidies. \nLook at what happened with wind in 1 year--13,000 megawatts. But then \nit expired, and it collapsed down to only 2,000 megawatts in the year \n2013.\n\n  That is our challenge, ladies and gentlemen. If we give the same kind \nof predictable tax and policy treatment to these renewable energy \nresources that were given to the oil industry over the last century, \nthey have a lot to worry about. By the way, you don't have to worry \nabout the oil or the gas industry. Their tax policies stay the same. \nThrough the good times and the bad times, the oil industry keeps the \nsame tax breaks on the books. They know they can rely upon that. Those \ntwo industries know the $7 billion in tax breaks they rely upon are \ngoing to be there year after year after year.\n  Let's talk about what else can happen in other industries. Let's talk \nabout the automotive industry. The Senator from Minnesota just talked \nabout the fuel economy standards we put on the books. Look what \nhappened since the fuel economy standards were put on the books and \nimplemented by Barack Obama. George Bush did not implement them. I am \nproud to be the host author of those fuel economy standards, but it \ntook Barack Obama to put them on the books--54.5 miles per gallon by \nthe year 2026. Look what has happened. We are now nearing 600,000 \nhybrids, plug-in vehicles, and all-electric vehicles per year. It is \nskyrocketing. Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler are reporting record \nprofits and record sales. People will buy them, but you have to create \nthe policy in the country.\n  By the way, that one policy--the fuel economy standards that were put \non the books in 2007 in this body, and over in the House of \nRepresentatives--backs out 4 million barrels of oil per day that we \nimport into our country by the year 2040 when all of these standards \nthat we put on the books are finally implemented.\n  How much is that? The United States imports 3 million barrels of oil \na day from the Persian Gulf. We are backing out 4 million barrels just \nby putting together a policy that incentivizes the industry to invest \nin the kinds of technologies that Americans want to buy and citizens \naround this planet want to buy. Wind, solar, hybrids, all-electric \nvehicles--it is all there. It is what we can do in order to create jobs \nand at the same time save the planet.\n  I will talk about some other numbers that I believe are really \nrelevant. The coal industry now has 80,000 employees. The wind industry \nhas 80,000 employees in the United States. We saw how low it was in \n2007. Well, they now have 80,000 employees. The solar industry has \n142,000 employees. Coal only has 80,000 employees. We saw what happened \nfrom the moment that predictable tax policy went on the books until \ntoday, and it is continuing to go off the charts, but we know there \nwill be people who are going to be out here fighting to take away those \ntax breaks and will compromise the ability of the EPA or the Department \nof Transportation to keep those standards on the books.\n  Back in the 1990s, I was the chairman of the Telecommunications \nCommittee in the House of Representatives, and I was able to put three \nbills on the books. One bill created the 18-inch satellite dish, \nanother one created the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cell phone \nlicense. That is what drove the price of a phone call from 50 cents a \nminute down to 10 cents a minute. It was 1996 when you started to have \none of these devices in your pocket. At 50 cents a minute, you didn't \nhave one. By the way, it was the size of a brick before that bill \npassed.\n  Finally, the 1996 Telecommunications Act moved us from analog to \ndigital. It moved us from narrow band to broadband. It created this \nrevolution of Google, eBay, Amazon, YouTube, and Facebook. All of that\n\n[[Page S1406]]\n\nhappened because of the policies created by the House and Senate and \nsigned by the President, and it unleashed $1 trillion worth of private \nsector investment. It revolutionized villages in Africa and Asia. We \ninvented those technologies and sold them around the world.\n  We have the same kind of economic possibility for renewable energy \nand new energy technologies as we had in the telecommunication sector, \nand we have a chance to cap another $1 trillion to $2 trillion worth of \ninvestment in the private sector.\n  Let's move on to our Nation's carbon emissions from energy due to \nfossil fuels. The total amount of greenhouse gases in our country from \nenergy sources fell from 2005 to 2012 by 12 percent. We installed more \nwind, solar, and fuel-efficient vehicles. We got more efficient and we \nreduced our coal use from 2005 to 2012, but in 2013 that reversed, and \nthe U.S. carbon dioxide emissions from energy sources increased by 2 \npercent in 2013. What happened? The price of natural gas increased in \n2013 by 27 percent. As a result, U.S. electric utilities returned to \nburning more coal and using less natural gas. U.S. energy-related \ncarbon emissions are still 10 percent below 2005 levels, but to keep \ndriving them down, we need to keep the price of natural gas low and \ncontinue to drive the deployment of wind and solar up.\n\n  For the oil and gas industry, the crisis in the Ukraine is an \nopportunity to throw open the doors to unrestrained exports of American \nnatural gas. But the notion that gas exports will help Ukraine is an \nillusion. It is a talisman, some lucky charm. This is a simple matter \nof geo-economics, geology, and geopolitics. We have already approved \nfive export terminals that could send 4 trillion cubic feet of natural \ngas abroad every year. That is nearly equal to all the gas consumed by \nevery home in America. Just take that slice of the pie, and we are \ngoing to export all that natural gas. That is twice as much as Ukraine \nconsumes every year.\n  Exporting natural gas could raise U.S. prices upwards of 50 percent \nand create an energy tax of $62 billion each year on American consumers \nand businesses, and it will put the coal industry back in business \nbecause coal will then be less expensive than natural gas. Then our \nability to meet this goal of reducing greenhouse gases will be replaced \nby a policy to export all the natural gas we can get to the ports of \nthe United States, and the lower our supply is, the higher the price is \ngoing to be for the remaining natural gas within our boundaries. The \nEnergy Information Agency says that just with the terminals that are \nnow being proposed, it is a 52-percent increase in the price of gas \nhere. We saw it last year. When gas went up 27 percent, coal replaced \nnatural gas, and our emissions went up, not down. So we just have to be \nrealistic about this whole debate in Ukraine about what it means for us \nin handling this issue.\n  By the way, it is what has been leading to manufacturers returning to \nthe United States. It is what is a big part of why there is a move \ntowards natural gas vehicles, which also backed out imported oil. But \nthe higher natural gas prices are the more we undermine our ability to \nmake real progress on climate change, on manufacturing, on natural gas \nvehicles, on utilities moving from coal over to natural gas. That is \nour challenge as a people.\n  Then, finally, we are the leader, not the laggers. The whole world is \nlooking at us. So much of that CO2 is red, white, and blue, \nand they look to us to be the leader. You started your industrial \nrevolution in the 19th century, they say to us. If you want us to \nreduce our greenhouse gases, you reduce yours. So we cannot abdicate \nthis responsibility.\n  Last week I attended a conference here in Washington called Globe. \nThere were 100 legislators from around the world who came here--the key \nplayers on energy and the environment in each country in the world. We \nhad a conference over in the Russell Building. Each of these \nlegislators said they are looking to us for leadership. Five hundred \nnew laws have been put on the books over the last 15 years in these \ncountries on climate change. But the question comes to us. What are you \ngoing to do this year, next year, the year after on these issues? Their \ncountries are even more vulnerable than our country. They do not have \nthe resources which our country has. So that is our opportunity.\n  Henry Waxman and I built a coalition of utilities, of businesses, of \nlabor, of faith and environmental groups, and concerned citizens in \n2009. The pieces are still out there, I say to my colleagues. We can do \nit again, but we are going to need everyone's help.\n  Recently, the books of Massachusetts author and national treasure \nDoctor Seuss have been popular and read on the Senate floor. I wish I \nhad time to read the entirety of his environmental classic ``The \nLorax.'' But since there are so many Senators who want to talk about \nthe impacts of climate change and the benefits addressing it will bring \nour country, I will just have to close with this short portion. Here is \nwhat it says:\n\n       But now says the Once-ler, now that you're here, the word \n     of the Lorax seems perfectly clear. Unless someone like you \n     cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It's \n     not.\n\n  So to my colleagues in the Senate and to everyone watching and \nfollowing tonight, thank you for caring a whole awful lot. This is not \nfor us; it is for all the subsequent generations of this country and \nthis planet who are looking to this Chamber for leadership. We are \ngoing to make things better from tonight onward. This is a moment. The \nscience is clear; the economics are clear; and now the politics is \nclear. We are going to have a big fight about this in 2014 because \nfuture generations are going to look back and know that this Senate \nstood up and we had the debate on the most important issue facing this \nplanet.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. KING. Facing challenges is hard. The bigger the challenge, the \nharder it is to face it because facing a significant challenge always \ninvolves risk, always involves a little uncertainty, always involves \neffort, always involves cost, always involves inconvenience, and always \ninvolves change. The most profound observation I ever heard about \nchange is that everybody is for progress and nobody is for change.\n  In the 1930s, Europe and particularly England faced a challenge. They \nfaced a challenge that was to their very survival. But for almost the \nentire decade of the 1930s, England didn't face that challenge. They \ndid not act, even though the data was overwhelming, even though the \nfacts were compelling, even though their greatest parliamentarian, the \ngreatest parliamentarian in English history--at least recent English \nhistory--continuously warned them. Winston Churchill spent a good part \nof the 1930s warning his country about the dangers of the rise of Nazi \nGermany. But people didn't listen, and they didn't listen for much the \nsame reason I think people aren't listening now--because it is hard to \ntake on a new challenge. It is hard to take on something that will have \na cost. It is hard to take on something that will entail risk. But \nignoring warnings has consequences. In the case of the 1930s in England \nand ignoring Winston Churchill's warnings, the consequences were 55 \nmillion people dead. Most historians believe Hitler could have been \nstopped in 1938, 1939, but instead of facing the challenge, people said \nit was too expensive; it was too inconvenient; it was too much of a \nchange. They were exhausted from World War I.\n  That was perfectly understandable, but the consequences were \ncatastrophic.\n  That is where we are today. We are facing a daunting challenge. For \nall of us speaking tonight, this isn't easy. We can outline the \nproblems, but the solutions aren't easy, and the solutions aren't going \nto be free. The solutions are going to involve change; they are going \nto involve investment; they are going to involve innovation; and they \nare going to involve facing up to a challenge that is very serious.\n  There are lots of ways to think about this. One way is this example: \nAll of us have health insurance. We all have homeowners insurance--even \nsimpler than health insurance. Homeowners insurance means basically we \nare insuring our home against burning down. What is the risk of our \nhouse catching fire? One in two? No. One in 365. Will your house burn \ndown once a year. No. One in 3,650? I suspect the risk is somewhere \naround 1 in 10,000 or 20,000. But every family in America is paying an\n\n[[Page S1407]]\n\naverage of $800 or $900 a year to insure against a 1 in 10,000 risk. \nBut we are being told in this body--in this country--that we can't take \nsteps to insure ourselves against a risk which 98 percent of the \nscientific evidence says is a dead certainty. I don't want to take that \nrisk.\n  People say: You are wrong, Angus. This isn't true. It isn't going to \nhappen. Maybe I am. Maybe we are. Maybe that 98 percent of climate \nscientists who have spent their lives studying this issue is wrong. I \nhope they are. I hope I am. But what if we are not wrong? The \nconsequences are almost unimaginable.\n  Although I have a long history of involvement in environmental \nmatters in Maine, I was a climate skeptic. I heard all the arguments \nabout it, and I said, I don't know whether this is really true. We can \nargue it both ways. Then, about 5 years ago, I ran across a little \nchart and the chart to me answered the whole question. Here is the \nchart.\n  This chart shows a million years of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. \nWe often hear carbon dioxide naturally goes up and down in the \natmosphere. Well, yes, it does. That is what these figures show. But \nfor 900,000-plus years, it ranged between 160 parts per million to \nabout 250 or 275. That is the range. Then all of a sudden, we get up to \nthe year 1,000, and it is still in the same higher range. Then right \nhere, 1860, when we started to burn fossil fuels in large quantities, \nand there it goes. It goes to levels that we haven't seen on this \nplanet for 3 million years. The last time we saw 400 parts per million \nof CO2 in the atmosphere, the temperatures were 12 to 14 \ndegrees warmer and the oceans were 60 to 80 feet higher.\n  This isn't politics. This isn't speculation. These are actual \nmeasurements based on the Greenland ice cores. This is what the \nCO2 concentrations were, and here we are at the beginning of \nthe industrial revolution.\n  This chart, it seems to me, answers two of the three basic questions \non the subject. The first question is: Is something happening? Yes, \ninevitably. We just can't look at this and say this point and this \npoint are so different, and this is a million years. Something is \nhappening.\n  The second question about this whole issue is this. Do people have \nanything to do with it? This is when we started burning stuff. This \nanswers that question. Of course, people have something to do with it. \nIt is just too weird a coincidence to say all of a sudden, when we \nstarted to burn fossil fuels in large quantities and release them into \nthe atmosphere and increase the CO2, it just happened to \nhappen at the same time. One fellow I know said it is volcanoes. I am \nsorry. We didn't have an outburst of volcanoes in the 1850s and 1860s. \nWe had little fires all over Europe, all over America. We had steel \nmills. We had the beginnings of the industrial revolution. We started \nto burn coal and later oil. This is what happened.\n  I mentioned there were three questions. No. 1, is something \nhappening? Yes. No. 2, do people have anything to do with it? Yes.\n  The third question is, So what. CO2 is going up in the \natmosphere. So what. What does that mean? This answers that question. \nThis is the relationship between CO2 and temperature. The \nred line is carbon dioxide and the black line is temperature, an almost \nexact correlation. If the CO2 goes up in the atmosphere, and \nwe are at about 500,000 years, we can see CO2 goes up, \ntemperature goes up; CO2 goes down, temperature goes down. \nSo this is the answer to the third question, so what. The answer is \ntemperature.\n  One of the things that worries me, and the reason I am here tonight, \nis some research that has been done at the University of Maine. We have \na climate study center at the University of Maine. I was there a year \nor so ago, and I was meeting with them. It was one of these meetings \nwhere we are going around and we go to the university, factories, and \nschools and meet with people and they give us briefings, and I was \nlistening to a briefing on climate change when a word crept into that \ndiscussion that I had not heard before, and the word was ``abrupt.''\n  Climate change, I always assumed, happened in a very slow, long, \nhistoric, geological time kind of way. That is not the case.\n  These are two lines on this chart. The yellow line is temperature; \nthe red is the extent of the ice in the Arctic. The point of the chart \nis, look at these vertical lines. That is in a matter of a few years. \nIt is not a matter of 1,000 years or 10,000 years; it is a matter of a \nfew years. It is as if someone throws a switch, and I do not want to be \naround when that switch is thrown, and I certainly do not want to be \nthe cause of the switch being thrown.\n  Abrupt climate change, that is what keeps me awake at night; that \nthis is something we are sort of assuming is going to be the next \ngeneration's problem or the generation after that or by 2100. Who knows \nabout 2100? Who thinks about 2100? Well, it could be a lot sooner than \nthat.\n  If things such as this cause a melt-off in the Arctic ice and the \nGreenland ice sheet, and it changes the currents in the Atlantic or \nanywhere else in the world, for that matter, everything changes.\n  Without the Gulf Stream, England, Scotland, Ireland, and Scandinavia \nare essentially uninhabitable. I do not know about the Presiding \nOfficer, but I have always thought of England as a being to the east. \nIt is not to the east; it is way to the northeast. England is on the \nsame latitude as Hudson Bay. The only reason it is of temperate climate \nis because of the Gulf Stream. If something happens to the Gulf Stream, \nNorthern Europe is almost uninhabitable.\n  These changes can happen abruptly. Again, maybe I am wrong. I hope I \nam wrong. But what if I am right? What if the science is right. Are we \nwilling to take that risk? Do you want to be the person who says to \nyour grandchildren: We saw this coming. All these people talked. They \ntalked all night in the Senate. But we decided not to do anything \nbecause it would be expensive and it would disrupt some of our \nindustries and might cost us a few jobs, which, by the way, would be \nreplaced in other industries.\n  Do you want to be the person who says: Well, we had this warning but, \nno, we didn't feel we had to do anything. I do not want to be that \nperson.\n  Does it have practical effects? It does have practical effects. There \nis not a theoretical discussion. This is not just a science lesson. \nThis has effects in all of our States. We have heard them here \ntonight--about the water temperature in the streams in Minnesota, the \nforest fires in Colorado, the drought in the West, in California, that \nis rendering millions of acres potentially unproductive that have been \nthe breadbasket of America.\n  In Maine, it is the lobster, the iconic product of the coast of \nMaine. What is happening is the ocean is getting warmer. As the ocean \nis getting warmer, the lobsters do not necessarily--they are not too \nunhappy about it getting warmer, but the center of gravity of lobsters \nis going to go where the water is colder, and that is what is \nhappening. That is what the lobstermen have told me.\n  The center of gravity of lobstering in Maine used to be right off of \nPortland in what is called Casco Bay, where I live. But over the last \n10 or 15 years, it has slowly moved northward. Now the lobsters \nthemselves have not moved northward, but the heavy catch has moved \nnorthward.\n  Here is a dramatic picture of what has happened. In 1970, here was \nthe hotspot for lobster: south of Massachusetts, south of Rhode Island, \noff the end of Long Island. This is where they were catching the most \nlobster. Here is where they are in 2008. They are up along the coast of \nMaine, headed for Nova Scotia. This is the center of gravity of the \nlobster industry.\n  People around here may not know what is happening in the climate, but \nthe lobsters of Maine know it, and the green crabs and the shellfish \nand the moose and the deer and the trees, they know it because that is \nwhat is changing in my State.\n  There is another thing that is happening that I do not think has been \ndiscussed tonight; that is, that the ocean is becoming a giant sink for \nall this carbon that is in the atmosphere. When the atmospheric carbon \ndioxide goes into the water and is dissolved in the water, it turns \ninto something called H2CO3--carbonic acid. Carbonic acid attacks \nshellfish. Shellfish cannot form their shells because the ocean is \nbecoming acidic. This is a recent observation, and it is the result of \nthe massive load of carbon that we have been putting into the \natmosphere.\n\n[[Page S1408]]\n\n  Here is another practical result, and the Presiding Officer talked \nabout this in terms of Boston. These are charts that show what happens \nif the sea goes up varying levels--6 meters, 1 meter. One meter is \nshown in dark red on the chart. Look what happens to Virginia Beach in \nNorth Carolina at just 1 meter, and that is predicted in the next 100 \nyears as the sea level goes up. Then we look at all these communities: \nNew York, Boston, Savannah, and Charleston, Virginia Beach, Miami, \nLouisiana. Then we can multiply this all around the world. I do not \nknow the percentage, but a very significant percentage of the world's \npopulation lives within about 40 miles of the coast--everywhere in the \nworld.\n  These are real consequences, and these are the kinds of consequences \nthat are unbelievably expensive and unbelievably destructive.\n  There is another piece of evidence, which is the sea ice extent. We \nare now talking about the famous Northwest Passage actually existing. \nShips can now go from the Atlantic to the Pacific across the Arctic \nbecause the ice is disappearing.\n  Here it is, as shown here, just from 1979 to the present. This is \nevidence. This is data. This is irrefutable.\n  Here is essentially a chart of the Arctic sea ice. The red line was \nthe extent of the ice, the average place the ice was in 1979 through \nthe year 2000, and here is where we are in 2012. As it continues to \nshrink, several things happen: the ocean levels rise, the acidification \nof the ocean continues, and there is a threat of a change in the \nocean's currents, which would be catastrophic for many parts of the \nworld.\n  Another example is the Muir Glacier in Alaska. These two photographs \nI have in the Chamber were taken from exactly the same spot. In 1941, \nhere is the glacier. In 2004, here is the lake. The glacier is gone. \nThat has changed, and that is a change that is the canary in the coal \nmine. That is the change that tells us something is happening and we \nignore it at our peril.\n\n  What are the consequences? What are the consequences? I have talked \nabout the economic consequences: forest fires, floods, lobsters, \nagriculture, all of those people living in low-lying areas. Multiply \nSuperstorm Sandy by two, three, four, five, and we are talking billions \nof dollars of economic costs; we are talking about lost jobs. Something \nlike 30 percent of the businesses that were wiped out by Superstorm \nSandy never came back. They never came back. To each one of those \nbusinesspeople, to each one of those insurers that insured those \nbusinesses, to those families it is gone forever. That is the result of \nthese superstorms we are seeing more and more frequently.\n  An enormous economic risk, an enormous cost. Yes, it is going to cost \nsomething to prevent this, but it is going to cost us either way. The \nold ad I remember when I was a kid: Pay me now or pay me later. In this \ncase, it is pay me now or pay me more later.\n  But there is a second level of risk that is almost as significant as \nthe economic risk; that is, the national security risk. We have had \npanels of retired judges and admirals who have looked at this issue. \nGlobal climate change is a major national security risk. Why? Because \nit is going to lead to friction, to riots, to famine, to loss of \nagricultural land, to loss of homes, to territorial disputes about \nwater, and that increases our risk.\n  I am on the Armed Services Committee and Intelligence Committee. I \nhave spent the last year and a half listening to testimony about Al \nQaeda and what we are doing to confront Al Qaeda. Part of our strategy \nis to fight them and to kill them, but we cannot kill them all. It is \nlike the Hydra. You cut off one head and two come back. What we have to \ndo is get at the basis of why young people are joining an organization \nsuch as that and change their lives. This climate change, which \nthreatens people's livelihoods, particularly in the developing world, \nis a grave threat to our national security because it generates the \nvery people who are dangerous. The most dangerous weapons of mass \ndestruction in the world today are large numbers of unemployed 20-year-\nolds who are angry and dispossessed and have no hope and are willing to \ntake up arms against any authority they can find, and unfortunately \nthat may be us.\n  This is a national security risk. Water, I predict, will be one of \nthe most valuable commodities of the 21st century. It is going to be \nsomething people fight about. It is going to be something people get \ninto wars about. Water is an enormously valuable commodity that global \nclimate change threatens.\n  Finally, on the question of what are the consequences, it is an \nethical risk. It is an economic risk, a national security risk, but it \nis also an ethical risk. Another aspect of this that has struck me that \nis not strictly related to climate change but is related to our \nconsumption of fossil fuels is what right do we have in two or three \ngenerations to consume the entire production of fossil fuels that the \nworld has produced in the last 3 or 4 or 5 or 10 million years.\n  It reminds me of a dad sitting down at Thanksgiving dinner, where all \nof his children are sitting around the table, mom brings in the turkey, \nputs it in front of him, and he says: This is all mine. None of you get \nany. I am going to take it.\n  None of us would do that, but that is exactly what we are doing. We \nare saying this oil, this precious oil that is an amazing commodity, \ncan do all kinds of different things, we are going to burn it up in \nabout 200 years. It takes millions of years to make it, and we are \ngoing to burn it all up. I think that is an ethical risk.\n  OK. I hate talking about problems and not talking about a solution. \nWhat are the solutions?\n  I believe in markets. I believe in free markets as the best way to \nallocate goods and services. But the market, in order to be efficient, \nhas to be accurate, and it has to accurately reflect the true costs and \nprice of the commodity. Right now we are not paying those costs. The \ncost of climate change is not factored into the cost of consuming \nfossil fuels. If you factor it in, then you have a free market and \npeople will make their decisions based upon their economic situation \nand also their commitment to the environment, but the real costs are \nnot factored in.\n  I am old enough to remember when this debate took place in the 1970s, \nwhen I worked here. But the debate then was about environmental law \nitself, and the debate was characterized as payrolls versus pickerel. I \ncan remember that term, ``payrolls versus pickerel.''\n  The idea was that if you clean up the water and clean up the air, it \nis going to put people out of business, we are going to lose jobs, \nindustry is going to run away, we can't possibly do it. Well, a man \nnamed Edmund Sixtus Muskie from the State of Maine did not believe \nthat. He was raised in a paper mill town on the Androscoggin River--one \nof the most polluted rivers in America. They used to say it was too \nthick to drink, too thin to plow. Muskie did not believe it, and Muskie \nstood in this body and fought for the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water \nAct.\n  Here is the amazing thing. I was asked to do some research and to do \na presentation about Muskie's environmental leadership. I went back and \nlooked at the record. I could not believe my eyes, particularly in \nlight of where we are here today--tonight--in this body and in this \ncity. The Clean Air Act passed the Senate unanimously. In the midst of \nthe debate, Howard Baker, the minority leader, the Republican leader, \ngave his proxy to Muskie. Can you imagine that happening today? It \npassed unanimously. We could not pass the time of day unanimously in \nthis body. Yet it happened.\n  That brings me to a question that really puzzles me. How did this \nbecome a partisan issue? How did it come to divide us so cleanly along \nenvironmental lines? This discussion tonight is important, but it is \nall Democrats and people--Bernie and I, the two Independents--Senator \nSanders, the Senator from Vermont, and I, the two Independents--no \npeople from the other party. I do not understand that. The leaders, the \ngiants of the environmental movement in Maine when I was a young man \nwere all Republicans.\n  When Ed Muskie got the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act passed \nthrough this body, it was with the support of the overwhelming \nmajority--in the case of the Clean Air Act, all of the Republicans, \nincluding very conservative Republicans. Senator Buckley\n\n[[Page S1409]]\n\nfrom New York supported the Clean Air Act. I do not know how or why \nthis became a partisan issue. Maybe it was because it was invented by \nAl Gore. I do not know. But somehow it has become this divisive \npartisan issue. It should not be. This is our future that is at stake. \nThis is our children and grandchildren's future. This should not be a \npartisan issue.\n  In my experience, if we can develop a common understanding of the \nfacts, we can find solutions. They will not be easy, but they are \nthere. Right now the problem is that we do not have a common, shared \nunderstanding of the facts.\n  So what are the solutions? The market is one. Innovation, as Senator \nKaine from Virginia said, is another. There are ways to use electricity \nand generate electricity through innovation that will be much cleaner, \nsupport just as many if not more jobs, and help prevent this tragedy \nfrom befalling us.\n  By the way, it does not mean we cannot burn coal. Coal is an abundant \nresource that we have in this country that is loaded with energy, but \nunfortunately it is also loaded with CO2 and other \npollutants. So I think part of our commitment should be intense \nresearch on how to use coal efficiently, effectively, and cleanly. That \nshould be part of the deal. We are not trying to put any region of the \ncountry out of business or control people's use of valuable resources, \nbut let's use them in the most efficient and effective and \nenvironmentally safe way. That can be done in part through innovation.\n  I was a lobbyist in Maine 30 years ago. One of the things I lobbied \nfor was to get rid of pop-top beer cans. The Presiding Officer probably \nremembers the first ones. You grabbed the ring, pulled it off, and it \nbecame a little razor. People threw them on the ground. You would step \non them. They were dangerous.\n  I remember going to the lobbyist for the bottlers and I said: We want \nto get rid of those things.\n  He said: There is no way. Our engineers have looked at it. It is \nimpossible to make one that you do not have to tear off.\n  Well, lo and behold we passed a law banning those pull-off tabs, and \nthe industry found a way to do it safely and in an environmentally \nsound manner. Sometimes you have to help people find a way.\n  The final piece when it comes to solutions is that this has to be \ninternational. I agree with my colleagues who say we cannot just do it \nhere. We cannot just do it here. If we just do it here and nobody else \nin the world does it, if China and India do not do it, then it is not \ngoing to be effective. We will have imposed costs on our society that \nwill simply make their businesses more competitive if they are ignoring \nthese externalities, these realities of price. It has to be done \nthrough international cooperation.\n  I think the moment may be right. From everything I understand about \nthe air quality in China, they may be ready to discuss this. They may \nbe ready to take steps along with us. But we are going to have to be \nthe leaders. We are going to have to show what can be done and how it \ncan be done. We are going to have to innovate our way out of this. But \nwe have to do it with our international partners. Movement of air does \nnot respect boundaries.\n  When Ed Muskie was promoting the Clean Air Act, he would take a \nglobe--I do not think we are allowed to take props onto the floor of \nthe Senate--he would take a standard globe--imagine I have it here--and \neverybody used to have these in their library. On a globe is a coating \nof shellac to make it shine. That coating of shellac is the same \nthickness in proportion to the globe as our atmosphere is to our real \nglobe. In other words, it is very thin and very fragile. We destroy it \nand threaten it at our extreme peril.\n  I can boil it all down to one simple concept. This is a Maine \nconcept. It is the Maine rototiller rule.\n  For those of you from urban States, a rototiller is a device that you \nuse to turn the ground in your garden. I guess it is a homeowner's \nplow. It turns the dirt. Not too many people own rototillers, but \nenough do so that you can borrow one when you need it for that one day \nin the spring when you are going to put in your garden.\n  The Maine rototiller rule is very straightforward: When you borrow \nyour neighbor's rototiller, you always return it to them in as good \nshape as you got it with a full tank of gas. That is all you need to \nknow about environmental policy. We do not own this planet. We have it \non loan. We have it on loan from our children, our grandchildren, and \ntheir grandchildren. We are borrowing it from them. We have a moral, \nethical, economic, and security obligation to pass it on to those \npeople in as good or better shape than we got it. That is what this \nissue is all about.\n  I deeply hope we can put aside the partisanship and the arguments, \nagree on the facts, and then have a robust and vigorous discussion of \nsolutions. It is not going to be easy. It is not going to be free. But \nit will make all the difference in the world to the people to whom we \nowe our best work--the future of America and the world.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I appreciate so much the comments of my \ncolleague from Maine, bringing his insights and his expertise through \nthe years and his stories about how the land and waters of his home \nState are being impacted and our responsibilities to the broader \nplanet.\n  I am reminded of the comment that Henry David Thoreau said, which is, \n``What is the use of a house if you haven't got a tolerable planet to \nput it on?'' His comment now seems very much ahead of the time and the \ncontext of the issue we are discussing tonight.\n  Then we have the insight from Theodore Roosevelt, who said, in terms \nof our responsibility, ``Of all the questions which can come before \nthis Nation, short of the actual preservation of its existence in a \ngreat war, there is none which compares in importance with the great \ncentral task of leaving this land even a better land for our \ndescendents than it is for us.''\n  But right now we are failing that challenge. Carbon pollution is a \ndirect threat to our resources on this planet, a direct threat to our \nforests, to our fishing, and to our farming. So I am going to take a \nlittle bit of time tonight to talk about those aspects.\n  I would like to start by taking a look at our forests. Indeed, if \nthere is something that symbolizes some of the dramatic impacts carbon \npollution is making, it is the spread of the pine beetle.\n  This is a picture of a forest devastated not by fire, not by drought, \nbut by the spread of the pine beetle. I have gone up in a plane and \nflown over a vast zone of the Cascades known as the red zone, where the \npine beetle has killed thousands of acres in my home State. They start \nout looking red because the needles turn red. That is why it is called \nthe red zone. Then the needles fall off, and you have essentially this \nbrown desolate remainder of what was once a thriving forest.\n  Timber is something that is very close to our hearts in the State of \nOregon. So many of us--myself included--are children of the timber \nindustry. My father was a millwright--that is the mechanic who keeps \nthe sawmill operating--a job he absolutely loved. He used to say that \nif he did his job right, then everyone had a job to come to, and the \nmill made money and everyone was happy as long as the machinery ran. \nOregon is still the top American producer of plywood and softwood \nlumber. The industry certainly is a big component of our gross domestic \nproduct in my State.\n  When this happens, then not only do we have zones that are not good \nenvironmental zones, but they are not good timber zones either. It is a \nlose-lose situation. It happens, and it is spreading for one reason: \nThe winters are not as cold as they used to be, and the pine beetle is \nvery happy about that because it is not knocked back and largely wiped \nout with cold snaps each winter, and it is easy to spread much more \nquickly, and it is able to spread to much higher elevations.\n  Then these dead forests become a component in another huge problem, \nwhich is forest fires.\n  This picture you will see in a moment is a picture of the Biscuit \nFire in 2002--a wall of flames.\n  The summer before last, I went down and flew about the State of \nOregon to look at the innumerable forest fires that were burning. One \nof the reasons we had so many forest fires--10 years after this fire--\nwas because the floor of the forest was so dry. It is estimated\n\n[[Page S1410]]\n\nthat a 2-by-4 that you see in a Home Depot has about a 6-percent \nmoisture content. The material on the floor of the forest was even \ndrier than that. Then you throw in far more lightning strikes due to \nthe pattern of the weather, and you have this magic combination, this \ncombination of tinderbox dryness, pine beetle devastation, and then \nlightning strikes. What you have are some of the largest fires we have \never seen. Indeed, the Biscuit Fire in 2002--500,000 acres. Half a \nmillion acres. Fast-forward 10 years. In 2012, 750,000 acres burned in \nmy State. With the combination of the ongoing effects of carbon \npollution--that being pine beetle damage, more lighting strikes, and \nfar drier, drought-driven fire seasons--it is going to get worse and \nworse.\n  The seven largest fire years since 1960 have all happened in the last \n13 summers. It is pretty amazing to recognize how that transition is \noccurring. If we think about projecting into the future, the National \nResearch Council predicts that for every 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit \ntemperature increase, the area burned in the western forests will \nquadruple.\n  This led our Energy Secretary to tell me a few weeks ago about a \ndraft of a study that says the western forests will be dramatically \nimpacted, devastated in the course of this century due to these \nfactors.\n  We have a triple threat, that of drought and bark beetles, increased \ntemperatures, and the result is decimation of an incredibly important \nworld resource, our forests.\n  But carbon pollution is not only an attack on our forests, it is also \nan attack on our farming. Indeed, drought across the U.S. is a huge and \ngrowing threat to agriculture.\n  In the State of Oregon, we have had the three worst-ever droughts in \nthe Klamath Basin in a 13-year period. It was 2001, then the worst-ever \ndrought of 2010, then the worst-ever drought of 2013--and now we are \nlooking at the possibility of a drought even worse than any of those--\nthe worst-ever drought of 2014. Hopefully, we will have a lot of \nprecipitation and a lot of snow in the coming weeks and that won't be \nthe case, but if we are looking at the snowpack, it is possible that we \nwill have the fourth worst ever in a 14-year period. It is absolutely \ndevastating to our rural economy, absolutely devastating.\n  Let's look at the impact coming from smaller snowpacks. Snowpacks are \na significant piece of this puzzle. If we were to look at the Pacific \nNorthwest, we would basically draw a circle like this. What we see are \nthese zones where there is a huge percentage decrease in those \nsnowpacks. The snowpacks then provide far less irrigation and water \navailable, and therefore dry their foundation for the summer drought, \nwhich then has a devastating impact on agriculture. This is not good \nfor our farming families, and it is certainly not good for our farm \neconomy.\n  Those snowpacks have another impact. I am going to skip forward to \nthe impact on our streams and our fish.\n  Folks who like to fish for trout and go to their summer streams know \nthat it is going to be better if the stream is large and cold than if \nit is small and warm. But the last of those snowpacks means that the \nsummer streams are smaller and warmer, and they are very bad for trout. \nThat is what we are seeing in this particular picture: dead trout from \nthe Deschutes River. Last fall thousands of fish died in the river from \nlow flows attributed to drought.\n  Clearly, not only is it bad for trout, it is bad for salmon; it is \nbad for steelhead. It is certainly bad for our fishing industries.\n  Let's turn to another part of our fishing industry, and this is an \nimpact that we see over on the coast of Oregon.\n  I specifically want to take a look at the impact that we see on our \noysters. Oysters have to fixate a shell at the beginning of their life. \nThey are called oyster seed, the baby oyster. We have hatcheries, and \nthose hatcheries have been having challenges. The Whiskey Creek oyster \nhatchery in Oregon has had a big problem. Indeed, at one point it had a \nhuge impact.\n  I will read part of an article:\n\n       Peering into the microscope, Alan Barton thought the baby \n     oysters looked normal, except for one thing: They were dead. \n     Slide after slide, the results were the same. The entire \n     batch of 100 million larvae at the Whiskey Creek Shellfish \n     Hatchery had perished.\n       It took several years for the Oregon oyster breeder and a \n     team of scientists to find the culprit: a radical change in \n     ocean acidity.\n\n  This is why, because when we have greater carbon pollution in the \nair, that carbon then is absorbed by the ocean, a significant portion \nof it. That dissolved carbon dioxide combines with water and becomes \nH2CO3, otherwise known as carbonic acid.\n  That carbonic acid is preventing the baby oysters from forming their \nshells. We can think of this as the canary in the coal mine for our \nworld's oceans because if baby oysters are having a challenge forming \ntheir shells because of a 30-percent increase in acidity since the \nstart of the Industrial Revolution, what other impacts are there going \nto be along in the shellfish world and the food chains that depend on \nthose shellfish, not to mention the impact on our shellfish farmers.\n  I was noting this in Washington State and I was told: You know, our \noyster farmers are experiencing a similar problem, and they are going \nto Hawaii and to Asia. This is not only an Oregon problem.\n  The manager of the hatchery in Oregon, David Stick, said in an \narticle:\n\n       I do not think people understand the seriousness of the \n     problem. Ocean acidification is going to be a game-changer. \n     It has the potential to be a real catastrophe.\n\n  Let's recognize another part of the planet that is having a problem \nwith warmer waters and ocean acidification; that is, our coral reefs. \nWe have, in Oregon, a researcher at Oregon State university. His name \nis Professor Hixon. Professor Hixon is recognizing that the coral reefs \naround the world are in trouble. As he said in a presentation, he \nstudied dozens of reefs. They are his children. Then he said: My \nchildren are dying. One of the key reasons is acidification, but \nanother is the oceans are getting warmer.\n  I have a chart showing the warming of the ocean. The oceans are \nabsorbing carbon dioxide, and they are also absorbing heat. As they \nbecome warmer, they create a real problem for coral reefs. Coral is an \nanimal. We may think of it as a plant, but it actually is an animal, \nand it lives in a symbiotic relationship with a type of algae.\n  They depend on each other. What happens when the water gets warmer \naround a coral reef is that the algae start to multiply in a fashion \nthat overwhelms the coral.\n  The coral, in an effort to survive, ejects the algae, throws them out \nof the host. Then the coral, having ejected the algae, dies. This is \ncalled bleaching, and it is something we are seeing in coral reefs \naround the world. That is why Professor Hixon noted: My children are \ndying.\n  I will state something else about the warming that is occurring, and \nthis is more about warming that is occurring in terms of the \ntemperature of our planet. It is affecting our recreation industry and \nour snow industry.\n  I am going to start by taking a look at what is driving that in terms \nof a chart related to carbon dioxide. Specifically, this chart shows \nthe dramatic change that has gone on. We see the fluctuations in carbon \ndioxide over hundreds of thousands of years, into the modern time and \nthen, boom, 400 parts per million of carbon pollution.\n  What does this come from? It comes from burning fossil fuels.\n  This carbon--carbon dioxide, as a component of the atmosphere, traps \nheat. To summarize, our planet has a fever. The temperature is going \nup. Let's take a look at how that carbon dioxide correlates with \ntemperatures.\n  We have, in this case, showing since 1880--basically, the start of \nthe Industrial Revolution--the increase in temperature on our planet, \nthe global surface mean temperature. We have seen a significant \nincrease.\n  If we want to find a way that this impacts our economy, let's take a \nlook at how it impacts our recreation industry. This is an article that \nI grabbed from the New York Times. It is a lengthy article, but it is \nthe title and the picture that I really wanted to show. It is from the \nSunday Review and it is called ``The End Of Snow.''\n  This article basically documents how our ski resorts around our \nplanet are suffering because they don't have as much snow as they used \nto have. There is a picture of artificial snow being created and put on \nthe slope. It notes how much energy this requires, how many dollars it \ncosts to provide that energy,\n\n[[Page S1411]]\n\nhow this is making many of our resorts not feasible, and how many of \nthem will go out of the business. This is just another angle on the \nimpact that carbon dioxide is having, in this case, on our recreation \nindustry.\n  Of course, it is having other impact on our recreation industry. When \nwe think of those smaller streams, we can think of fewer kayaks, for \nexample, and rafting companies operating.\n  Let's turn from these multitudinous impacts. First, before we return \nto recognizing that we have the power to take on carbon pollution, \nlet's recognize when folks say isn't that global warming issue about \nsome computer programmer using some assumption and some model. Isn't \nthere some dispute about it; is it real.\n  Put all of that aside. We don't need a computer model to show us the \nimpact from the pine beetle. We don't need a computer model to show us \nthe impact on our trout streams. We don't need a computer model to show \nus the impact today on droughts. We don't need a computer model to show \nus impact on forest burning. We don't need a computer model to show us \nthe impact on our coral. We don't need a computer model to show us the \nimpact on the oyster industry, and we don't need a computer model to \nshow us the impact on our snow-based recreational activities and the \nindustries that are associated with it.\n  In other words, carbon pollution is here and now. Global warming is \nhere and now. It is making an impact wherever we look. We can feel it, \nwe can touch it, we can see it, and we can smell it. It is here, and it \nis our responsibility, our responsibility as American citizens, our \nresponsibility as policy leaders in this esteemed Chamber of the Senate \nto take on this issue.\n  There is so much we can do because it boils down to this. We have to \nreplace our appetite for fossil fuels with renewable fuels, renewable \nenergy. We can do that. We can do that in a host of ways.\n  I will start. Let me start by noting a little bit about the growth of \nsolar energy. When one realizes this chart is just from 2001 to 2013, \nit is phenomenal the deployed amount of installed capacity in megawatts \nin solar energy. From 2012 to 2013, we have more than 3,000 additional \nmegawatts of energy, solar energy, solar potential, deployed.\n  A similar explosion of renewable energy is happening in the source of \nwind. Let's take a look at that.\n  We have deployed capacity in wind energy. If we were to recognize \nthat, again, from 2001 to 2013 there was a huge growth in the \nindustry--and I want to point out a particular factor here going from \n2011 to 2012. This large bump on the chart was 13,000 megawatts of \ninstalled capacity and wind energy in 1 year. The next year there was \nonly 1,000.\n  The difference, as pointed out by one of my colleagues earlier on \nthis floor, is the difference in tax credits, of consistently available \nproduction tax credits that the wind industry can depend on.\n  We give all kinds of subsidies to the fossil fuel industry. Why can't \nwe create a steady, reliable source to promote renewable energy to help \nreplace those fossil fuels. We have this policy potential in our hands, \nand we need to exercise it. There are many other forms of renewable \nenergy. There is offshore wind, there is geothermal energy, and there \nis wave energy. Oregon has some of the best winds for offshore wind \nenergy and waves for wave energy, but we already have the ability \nthrough the technologies we have today to dramatically reduce our \nconsumption of fossil fuels.\n\n  What this chart shows is that in different parts of the country the \nmix between biomass and geothermal and wind onshore, wind offshore, \nwave energy and solar energy, concentrated solar power energy would be \ndifferent in different parts of the country, but everywhere around the \ncountry there is the potential to essentially replace our appetite for \nfossil fuels.\n  Then there is the conservation side. We can certainly do a tremendous \namount in our fuel standards for cars, a tremendous amount in our fuel \nstandards for trucks, and a significant amount in terms of energy-\nsaving retrofits to our buildings.\n  In the farm bill we just passed, we have a program for low-cost loans \nfor energy-saving retrofits, and that program--the Rural Energy Savings \nProgram--will help retrofits occur in commercial buildings and \nresidential buildings, and it will allow people to pay back the loan on \ntheir electric bill. Often, they will be able to pay back that loan \nsimply with the savings in energy--electricity consumption--from the \nchanges they make to their building. So it is a win-win--creating jobs, \nsaving energy, yet being paid for without much additional expense for \nthe consumer.\n  All of these possibilities exist and more. It is our challenge as \npolicymakers to take on this issue, to work on how we can generate \nelectricity with far fewer fossil fuels, how we can conserve \nelectricity in transportation. How do we conserve electricity and other \nfuels? In fact, in both cases--transportation and heating our homes, \nenergy consumed in our buildings--how do we do this with far fewer \nfossil fuels and do it with renewable energy?\n  I applaud my colleagues for coming here tonight to raise this issue \nand say we must come together and take on these challenges. My \ncolleague from Delaware is about to speak and share some stories from \nhis experiences that bear on this, but every Senator in this Chamber \ncan talk about issues from their home State and where they see the \nimpact of carbon pollution and call upon us, call upon our moral \nresponsibility to tackle this issue.\n  With that, I yield the floor to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleague from \nOregon, Senator Merkley, who has done a tremendous job laying out the \nscientific case, the compelling economic case, the cultural case, and \nthe global case for why we here in the Senate need to wake up, need to \nlisten to the indisputable evidence of what climate change is doing in \nour home States, to our country, and around the world.\n  Mr. President, even now as we speak in this Chamber, my own three \nchildren--Maggie, Michael, and Jack--are asleep at home. And as I \nreflected on this past summer, I was struck by something--an experience \nwe had--that was a simple and telling reminder of the steady changes \nwrought by climate change in our Nation.\n  Last summer we took a family vacation--a trip--to Glacier National \nPark. For those who have had the opportunity to hike in this majestic \nnational park in Montana, it is the site of many striking and beautiful \nscenes, but there was one hike we took in particular that stayed with \nme. It was a hike to historic Grinnell Glacier--a glacier that is by \nmany photographs over decades documented in its steady receding. In \nfact, since 1966 it has lost nearly half of its total acreage. We took \na long and winding hike up the trail that takes you to Grinnell \nGlacier. You can't quite see until you come up over the last rise that \nmost of what is left of Grinnell Glacier in the summers today is a \nchilly pool of water.\n  For my daughter Maggie and for my sons Mike and Jack, as I look ahead \nto the long-term future, I think we all have to ask ourselves this \nquestion: How many more changes are we willing to accept being wrought \non creation, on this Nation, and on the world by the steady advance of \nclimate change?\n  I know we can't simply take the examples of things such as Grinnell \nGlacier or what to me seemed a striking change in the cap of Mount \nKilimanjaro. I first climbed it in 1984 and visited it again last year. \nThere is a striking change, a visually powerful change. These aren't \nscientific.\n  There are lots of other arguments, perhaps, as to why these two \nparticular glaciers have retreated, but I still remember hearing a \npresentation at the University of Delaware by Dr. Lonnie Thompson of \nOhio State University, a glaciologist who presented a very broad and I \nthought very compelling case based on ice cores for the actual advance \nof climate change over many decades.\n  In fact, I see my colleague from Rhode Island has a photographic \nhistory of Grinnell Glacier in Montana's Glacier National Park, so the \npoint I was just making in passing he is able to illustrate here. That \nis as of 10 years ago. The glacier has retreated even further from \nthat. But this striking glacier from 1940 is now almost completely gone \nin just one generation.\n\n[[Page S1412]]\n\nThis and so many other glaciers that were monuments in our national \nparks are today receded or altogether gone.\n  Well, I think we have to ask ourselves fundamentally, what is our \npath forward? We have heard from other Senators. Tim Kaine of Virginia \nspoke about the importance of innovation, and Angus King, the Senator \nfrom Maine, spoke about the importance of markets and of making sure \nour inventions and innovations in trying to solve these problems are \nalso shared internationally. I think these are great and important \ninsights.\n  One of the things I wanted to bring to the floor today first was \ninsights from my own home State of Delaware, where our Governor, Jack \nMarkell, impaneled a sea level rise advisory committee starting in 2010 \nthat looked hard at how climate change might affect my home State.\n  At just 60 feet, Delaware has the lowest mean elevation of any State \nin the country, and that already makes it more susceptible to sea level \nrise than almost any State in the country. In my State of Delaware, we \nhave seen and will continue to see the impact of climate change on our \nbusinesses, our communities, and our local environment. As the sea \nlevel rises, we are seeing the effects more and more.\n  Sea level rises essentially for two reasons. First, as the planet's \nice sheets melt--the much larger sheets than Grinnell Glacier--they add \nto the amount of water in the ocean. Second, saltwater actually expands \nas it warms as well. So as the planet's average temperature has \nsteadily risen, so too has the level of its saltwater seas.\n  The fact that the Earth's oceans are rising each year isn't new \ninformation. It has been rising as long as we have been keeping track. \nBut what is really jarring is that rate of rise is increasing and \nincreasing significantly. When the data was tracked from 1870 to 1930, \nthe sea level was rising at a rate of 4 inches per 100 years. Over the \nnext 60 years it rose at a rate of 8 inches per 100 years--more than \ndouble. In just the last 20 years the sea level has been rising at a \nstrikingly more rapid rate of 12.5 inches per 100 years. The water is \nrising, and in Delaware it is rising fast.\n  The land itself in my State is also actually sinking. There is \nactually a documented vertical movement of the Earth's crust under the \nmid-Atlantic coast. It is called subsidence. It has been happening in \nDelaware slowly but gradually since the ice age at a pace of just 2 \nmillimeters of elevation every year. I know that doesn't sound like a \nlot, but it adds up to another 4 inches over the century.\n  So we have the water rising and the land sinking, making climate \nchange and sea level rise--specifically for my home State--a very real \nissue.\n  A wide array of scientists have studied this and its impact on \nDelaware, and they have developed three models for a future scenario. \nIn the conservative model, by the year 2100 the sea level in Delaware \nwill have risen about 1.5 feet. In another model, the water off \nDelaware rises another full meter. In another and the most \ndisconcerting model, it is 1.5 meters or about 5 feet. Unfortunately, \nat present, this broad group of scientists--inside and outside of \ngovernment--are estimating that is the most likely scenario.\n  Let's make this real. Here is a projection of these three different \nscenarios in one area of Delaware. This is Bowers Beach. This shows how \nnow this is a well-established beach community. The most conservative \nmodel, we still have something of the land; in the middle, it is \ncompletely cut off here from the mainland; and then in the most likely, \nsadly, given the most current evidence, there is literally nothing left \nexcept a little sandbar out by itself in the Delaware Bay. That gives \none example of why the difference between these three scenarios matters \nso much. Unfortunately, there is no scenario in which Bowers Beach is \nstill a viable beachfront community by the end of this century. This \nbeach community of Bowers Beach is very close to Dover Air Force Base \nand ends up underwater.\n  Now let's take a look at South Wilmington. The city in which I live \nis Wilmington, DE, and South Wilmington is a neighborhood in the \nlargest city in our State. As the water rises in the Atlantic Ocean, it \nalso rises up the Delaware Bay, the Delaware River, and the Christina \nRiver, which runs right through most of my home county, Newcastle \nCounty, and rises in the Peterson Wildlife Refuge too.\n  The impacts here are potentially devastating. We are talking about \nwater 1.5 feet higher than what Delaware experienced during Superstorm \nSandy--not for a brief storm surge but each and every day. Again, take \na look at today the conservative, the middle, and the most likely, most \naggressive scenario in which virtually all of South Wilmington is \nunderwater by the end of this century. The calculation of whether we \nare hit with a half a meter, a full meter, or 1.5 meters of sea rise \ncomes down to the rate of acceleration of climate change globally, and \nit leaves for us a central and so far unanswered question: whether we \ntry to slow the rate at which climate change is affecting our planet \nand maybe somehow turn the tide. This is the part of climate change \npolicy called mitigation.\n  Priority one in this strategy is cutting the emissions we are pumping \ninto our atmosphere. To do that, we can and must diversify our energy \nsources and reduce our dependence on polluting fossil fuels. Clean \nenergy technology, energy efficiency programs, public transportation, \nand more will help cut down on these emissions, but it will require a \nglobal effort in order to avoid or minimize local impacts.\n  The second part of climate change policy is adaptation based on an \nacceptance of the reality that our climate is changing and will have \nreal effects on our planet and all of our communities. The truth is \nthat even if we stopped all greenhouse gas emissions today--if we shut \ndown powerplants, stopped driving cars, stopped using gas-powered farm \nequipment, trains, and ships, and all the rest--the amount of \ngreenhouse gases, of CO2 and others already in the \natmosphere would still take many years to dissipate. Changes in the \nworld's climate are at this point inevitable. It is already happening \nand affecting communities, and we can expect these impacts to intensify \nas the rate of climate change continues to accelerate. We can modify \nour behavior to prevent those effects from being catastrophic. We can \nand should make better choices now to prevent disaster later.\n  In Delaware, for example, we have had two laws on the books for now \n40 years that have helped us adapt. The first was championed in the \n1970s by a Republican Governor, Russ Peterson, a hero of mine and of \nour Governor's and others. It is called the Coastal Zone Act, and \npassing it cost him his career in politics. It prohibited future \nindustrial development on a long strip of coastal land, allowing the \nState and Federal government to preserve it and reduce the impacts of \nflooding and coastal erosion. Ultimately, in the long run, Governor \nPeterson has been proven a visionary in preserving this vital barrier \nall along Delaware's coast.\n  The second law empowered the State to protect and replenish the \nState's beaches, including the beaches on Delaware Bay, which are often \noverlooked. This has allowed our State to build a berm and dune system \nthat protects infrastructure and protects property from being washed \naway.\n  More important than these significant landmark laws of 40 years ago, \ntoday, instead of running away from the science, Delaware's leaders \nhave embraced it. The State agency that manages environmental issues \nfor Delaware--known as DNREC and ably led by secretary Collin O'Mara--\nhas taken the lead on a governmentwide project to assess the State's \nvulnerability to sea level rise and, as I mentioned, recommend options \nfor adaptation.\n  Delaware's Sea Level Rise Committee spent 18 months looking at 79 \ndifferent statewide resources--roads, bridges, schools, fire stations, \nrailroads, wetlands, people and their homes and businesses--and layered \nall of this onto maps to show just how far the water would reach at \ndifferent models for sea level rise.\n  If the sea level does get to 1.5 meters, we lose more than 10 percent \nof our State. The water claims 20,000 residential properties, \nsignificant percentages of wetlands, farms, highways, and industrial \nsites. We would lose 21 miles of our Northeast corridor rail lines to \nflooding, shutting down the vital Northeast corridor that transports so \nmany millions every year.\n\n[[Page S1413]]\n\n  The Port of Wilmington would be rendered useless, nearly all the \nState's acreage of protected wetlands could be inundated, nearly three-\nquarters of our dams, dikes, and levees flooded out. In short, this \nscenario for our lowest-lying State would be devastating.\n  As Secretary O'Mara said:\n\n       We're looking at big risks for human health and safety, and \n     not just at the Delaware Bay beaches. We have big concerns \n     about [communities in Delaware]. It's much more complex than \n     just the bay beaches or a community here or there.\n\n  He is right. So once again, remember, we have two basic approaches to \nclimate change policy: adaptation and mitigation.\n  Once Delaware compiled its 200-page vulnerability assessment on sea \nlevel rise, the committee got to work on an adaptation strategy to \nprotect our State and came up with slightly more than 60 options and \nhosted a whole series of public meetings and townhalls to discuss it. \nWe are now working on a broader vulnerability assessment to examine the \nfull range of impacts from climate change, even beyond sea level rise--\nchanging temperatures, extreme weather, changes in precipitation--\nimpacts which will affect us and our neighbors.\n  Climate change will affect the distribution, abundance, and behavior \nof wildlife, as well as the diversity, structure, and function of our \necosystem. We are already seeing changes in natural patterns. As \nSenator Markey of Massachusetts commented earlier this evening, many \ncommercial and recreational fish stocks along our east coast have moved \nnorthward by 20 to 200 miles over the past 40 years as ocean \ntemperatures have increased. Scientists expect migratory species to be \nstrongly affected by climate change, since animal migration is closely \nconnected to climate factors, and migratory species use multiple \nhabitats and resources during their migrations. These changes are \nimpacting our own multimillion bird watching and waterfowl hunting, an \nimportant economic driver for us and critical parts of our heritage.\n  According to the draft National Climate Assessment released in 2013, \nour farmers are expected to initially adapt relatively well to the \nchanging climate over the next 25 years. But later, as temperature \nincreases and precipitation extremes get more intense, crop yields and \nproduction of poultry and livestock are expected to decline. More \nextreme weather events--drought and heavy downpours--will further \nreduce yields, damage soil, stress irrigation water supplies, and \nincrease production costs. All in all, this is a fairly grim long-term \noutlook in the absence of decisive action.\n  I am proud of my State. Delaware was the first State to thoroughly \nassess the vulnerability of specific resources in as comprehensive a \nway as they have, and we are determined to confront these changes to \nour planet head on and to protect our communities and the way of life \nwe have built.\n  I will briefly review. There is so much we can and should do here in \nCongress in a bipartisan way to lay the groundwork for the actions we \nhave to take. We can improve our energy efficiency. We could take up \nand pass the bipartisan bill recently reintroduced by Senators Shaheen \nand Portman to increase the use of energy-efficient technology across \nall sectors in our society. The new version of the bill has 12 \ncosponsors--six Democrats and six Republicans--and includes 10 new \ncommonsense amendments which would save consumers electricity and \nmoney, a small but meaningful start on a journey toward changing our \ndirection on climate change. Or we could level the playing field and \nhelp new clean energy technologies get off the ground by giving them \nthe same tax advantages currently utilized by fossil fuel projects. The \nbipartisan Master Limited Partnerships Parity Act--which I am proud to \ncosponsor with my colleagues Senators Moran, Stabenow, Murkowski, \nLandrieu, and Collins, Democrats and Republicans working together--\nwould level the playing field for renewables and give them and other \nnew technologies a fighting chance in our energy market.\n  There are so many other steps we could do in combination, if we would \nbut get past this endless, pointless debate which has long been \nresolved in the halls of science, and move forward in a way which \nbetter serves our country and our world.\n  The bottom line is that our climate is changing. We know this. With \nthis knowledge comes the responsibility to reduce our emissions, to \nmitigate the impacts, and prepare for and take action to deal with the \ncoming changes.\n  As I reflect on our own responsibilities as Senators, I am in part \nmoved to respond to the challenge of climate change--not just because \nit is an environmental issue, an economic issue, a regional issue or \nglobal issue, but it is also for me and for many others a faith issue. \nIt is a question of how we carry out our responsibility to be good \nstewards of God's creation, to be those Senators we are called to be \neach from our own traditions who stand up and do what is right, not \njust for the short term, not just for the concerns of the day, but for \nthe long term.\n  As I move toward my close, I will share with those in the Chamber and \nwatching one of the things most encouraging to me as I have reflected \non the change in the climate change movement over recent years is it \nhas begun to draw support from all across the theological spectrum. \nThere was last year, July of 2013, a letter sent to Speaker Boehner, \nMajority Leader Reid, and all Members of Congress by 200 self-\nidentified Christian evangelical scientists from both religious and \nsecular universities all across the United States, a powerful and \nincisive letter which says:\n\n       As evangelical scientists and academics, we understand \n     climate change is real and action is urgently needed. All of \n     God's Creation--human and our environment--is groaning under \n     the weight of our uncontrolled use of fossil fuels, bringing \n     on a warming planet, melting ice, and rising seas.\n\n  I urge any watching to consider reading it. It is posted on line. It \ngoes on to quote Christian Scripture at length in making the case we \nhave an obligation, if we are concerned about our neighbors and about \nthe least of these in this world, to take on the challenge of making \nsure we are good stewards.\n  Those of the Roman Catholic faith might be inspired by Pope Francis, \nwho has taken the name of the patron saint of animals and the \nenvironment, and recently issued a call for all people to be protectors \nof creation.\n  Last, I might read from a letter issued by the president of the \nNational Association of Evangelicals, a group not commonly known for \ntheir close alignment with my party. Leith Anderson wrote in a letter \nin 2011:\n\n       While others debate the science and politics of climate \n     change, my thoughts go to the poor people who are neither \n     scientists nor politicians. They will never study carbon \n     dioxide in the air or acidification of the ocean. But they \n     will suffer from dry wells in the Sahel of Africa and floods \n     along the coasts of Bangladesh. Their crops will fail while \n     our supermarkets remain full. They will suffer while we \n     study.\n\n  This couldn't be more true. I urge all of us in this Chamber to \nreflect on whatever traditions sustain and bring us here that we have \nan obligation to those who sleep soundly in our homes now, to those \nfrom our home States around the country, to stand up and take action, \nto look clearly at the challenge which lies in front of us and to act \nin the best traditions of this body and of this Nation, to be good \nstewards of creation and to stand up to the challenges of this time.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I thank all of my friends who are \nspeaking on the floor tonight for their continued commitment to not \njust bring attention to climate change, but to push for decisive action \non the issue.\n  As experts from around the world show us beyond a reasonable doubt \nthat we, as a global community, are contributing to rising \ntemperatures, there are those that would deny that human actions can \nhave any effect on our climate and environment. Too often, lawmakers \ntry to legislate their own ``science'' rather than properly utilizing \nthe conclusions and recommendations made by skilled experts--yet nature \ndoes not conform to our laws. That is why the United States must be an \ninnovator in reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, and a leading light \nin the clean energy sector.\n  My own home State of New Jersey has shown strong leadership in moving \nour country towards a sustainable energy future. We have developed and \nimplemented an aggressive Renewable Portfolio Standard that requires \nover\n\n[[Page S1414]]\n\n20 percent of New Jersey's electricity to come from renewable sources \nby 2021. We have put in place strong incentives for energy customers of \nall sizes, from single families to the many businesses that call New \nJersey home, to become energy efficient and even clean energy \nproducers, by installing solar panels on their homes and buildings. New \nJersey is also beginning to realize some of its extraordinary potential \nto harness wind power off our coast, with multiple offshore wind \nprojects currently in development. I am encouraged by some of the \nprogress that I have seen in the renewable energy sector in New Jersey \nand other leading States, and hope that others will follow suit.\n  New Jersey's many exemplary institutions of higher learning have also \nbeen at the forefront of the vital research that has helped us to \nunderstand the causes and consequences of global climate change. \nImportant work is being done at the Institute of Marine and Coastal \nSciences at Rutgers University into how climatic changes in the Arctic \nimpact weather in the U.S., and Princeton University's Cooperative \nInstitute for Climate Science is at the forefront of climate change \nmitigation options and response strategies.\n  Some of my Senate colleagues from fossil fuel producing States have \nbeen hesitant to act, they say, because oil and coal production are \nhome State issues for them. Well, for me, climate change is a home \nState issue. Not just because of the excellent work being done in New \nJersey, but because my State has seen firsthand the devastating effects \nof a warmer climate that brings with it powerful storms, rising seas, \nand destructive flooding.\n  Not 18 months ago, New Jersey and much of the eastern seaboard was \nbattered by an unprecedented superstorm that washed away much of the \nNew Jersey coastline. Superstorm Sandy caused an estimated $65 billion \nin economic losses. 159 people lost their lives, 650,000 homes were \ndamaged or destroyed, and 8.5 million households and businesses lost \npower, many of them for weeks. Power outages caused severe gas \nshortages, with traffic backed up for miles, and people waiting for \nhours to obtain fuel to feed the generators that were keeping their \nfamilies warm and their food from spoiling.\n  Now, New Jersey has persevered. We worked together and helped each \nother rebuild lives, businesses, homes, and our famous beaches and \nboardwalks. Efforts have been undertaken to make our coastal \ncommunities and critical infrastructure more resilient to future storms \nof this magnitude. But unless we act to implement responsible energy \npolicies that cut our greenhouse gas emissions and incentivize \ninvestment in renewable energy infrastructure, these damaging \nsuperstorms will only become more powerful and frequent. Those who deny \nthe reality of climate change tend to emphasize the economic costs of \nregulating carbon emissions, but these costs pale next to the economic \nand social costs of doing nothing.\n  I am proud to join my colleagues tonight, and for the duration of my \ntime serving the people of New Jersey in the Senate, to call for real \nsolutions to our climate challenges. The decisions that we make in this \nbody now will shape the future for our children and grandchildren. \nYears from now, I hope to humbly reflect on my time in the Senate, and \nbe able to say I was a part of the Congress that finally reigned in big \noil and coal, and put the United States on a path towards \nsustainability and environmental responsibility. Future generations of \nAmericans deserve no less, and our planet demands it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, nearly 30 years ago, I joined a good \nfriend, the late Hub Vogelmann, along with a Republican Congressman, a \nDemocratic Governor, and President Reagan's EPA Administrator, on a \nhike to the summit of Vermont's iconic peak, Camel's Hump. We had a \ngoal in mind. We wanted to observe first-hand the effects of acid raid. \nWhen we arrived at the summit, we saw the evidence we feared. You did \nnot have to be a scientist to see it: a scar burned across the peak of \nCamel's Hump and across all of the peaks of the Green Mountains and the \nAdirondacks. Due to human action, weather patterns had changed, \naltering the very chemistry of rainfall on a grand scale. As a result, \nwe caused profound and large-scale damage to life sustaining \necosystems.\n  There were Democrats and Republicans, scientists and bureaucrats on \nthat mountain. We returned to Washington, united and eager to address \nthe problem. It was not easy. We had to overcome strong objections from \nindustry and develop an entirely new cap-and-trade regulatory \nframework. In the end, a Democratic majority in Congress passed, and \nRepublican President George H.W. Bush signed into law, the Clean Air \nAct amendments.\n  Once again, we are confronted with irrefutable evidence that humans \nhave altered not just the weather of a region, but the climate of the \nentire planet. This time, we do not need to climb mountains to see the \ndamage. We see it in New England's flood ravaged river valleys, \nCalifornia's scorched farmland, Alaska's retreating glaciers, Wyoming's \nburnt forests, and super-storm ravaged coastlines.\n  Before we even get to the accumulated--and accumulating--scientific \nevidence for climate change and the carbonization of our fragile \nenvelope of atmosphere, we only need to apply common sense. As we look \naround us, anywhere, everywhere, and at any time, doesn't it just stand \nto reason that human activity is contributing to documented changes in \nour atmosphere, and to climate change? I certainly have seen it in my \nlifetime. But I have also seen people try to deny all reason and the \nevidence all around us.\n  The scientists have done their work. We now better understand the \nhuman causes of climate change and we understand its profound and \naccelerating impact. Unfortunately, too many policy makers deny the \nevidence, or refuse to cross political lines to solve the problem. I \nsay it is time we wake up and act on climate change.\n  We have taken some steps in the right direction. This past summer, \nPresident Obama announced his Climate Action Plan to cut carbon \npollution. The Environmental Protection Agency has begun creating new \ncarbon emission standards for future power plants. The Department of \nEnergy is working on ground-breaking energy technologies, and the \nDepartment of Transportation is studying transportation planning to \naddress future risks and vulnerabilities from extreme weather and \nclimate change. The Transportation Department is also addressing \nvehicle fuel efficiency which is saving vehicle owners and operators \nbillions of dollars a year. These are all positive changes, but before \nwe rest on our laurels, we have to understand that there are not nearly \nenough to address the problem at hand. Congress needs to cast aside \npartisan blinders by enacting legislation that prioritizes renewable \nenergy development, supports energy efficient technologies, and taxes \ncarbon pollution.\n  It is time to take a stand against misguided policies and projects \nthat put future generations at risk, and in my State, we believe that \nincludes the Keystone XL pipeline. The State Department recently \nreleased its long-awaited environmental impact statement on the \nKeystone XL pipeline. I am deeply troubled that the State Department's \nanalysis did not take into account the overwhelming evidence that this \nproject will further accelerate the release of greenhouse gas \npollution, which will intensify climate change. There is a mountain of \nevidence that the carbon pollution, drinking water threats, public \nhealth threats, and safety threats from this pipeline are so great that \nit is not in our national interest, and its permit should be denied. I \nrealize this goes against some public opinion polls, but I believe we \nmust stamp out our addiction to fossil fuels and fight back against \nthese threats to our land, water, air, and healthy communities around \nthe world.\n  We have to understand that climate change is not simply an \nenvironmental challenge. Creating a green energy sector is not just \nabout cutting greenhouse gas emissions. It is about providing jobs for \nAmericans in the renewable energy and energy efficiency fields. It is \nabout strengthening national security in America by having greater \ncontrol over our energy sources and breaking the stranglehold of oil on \nthe transportation system. What should unite all of us, Republicans and \nDemocrats alike, is assuring that our children and grandchildren have \nclean air to breathe.\n  We have come together before. We did it back in the time of President\n\n[[Page S1415]]\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush. We joined hands across the aisle and across regions \nof this great country to solve problems. Why can't we do it again? \nIsn't that the least we owe to our planet? Isn't that the least we owe \nto our children and grandchildren?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/10/senate-section/article/S1415-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/10/senate-section/article/S1415-2", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/10/senate-section/article/S1415-3", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    FISCAL YEAR 2015 BUDGET: APPENDIX, ANALYTICAL PERSPECTIVES, AND \n HISTORICAL TABLES, RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE ON MARCH \n                            10, 2014--PM 34\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with accompanying \nreports and papers; which was referred jointly, pursuant to the order \nof January 30, 1975 as modified by the order of April 11, 1986; to the \nCommittees on Appropriations; and the Budget:\n\nHon.

A bill to promote the use of clean cookstoves and fuels to \nsave lives, improve livelihoods, empower women, and protect the \nenvironment by creating a thriving global market for clean and \nefficient household cooking solutions; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Clean \nCookstove Support Act. This legislation addresses a serious global \npublic health and environmental issue, and I am very pleased to be \njoined in this effort by my friend and colleague, Senator Durbin.\n  Nearly half of the world's population cooks over open fires or with \ninefficient, polluting, and unsafe cookstoves using wood, agricultural \nwaste, dung, coal, or other solid fuels. Smoke from these traditional \ncookstoves and open fires is associated with chronic and acute diseases \nand affects women and children disproportionately.\n  Alarmingly, the Global Burden of Disease Study of 2010 doubled the \nmortality estimates for exposure to smoke from cookstoves referred to \nas household air pollution from 2 million to 4 million deaths annually \nin the developing world. The GBD indicates this is more than the deaths \nfrom malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS combined. The GBD ranks \nhousehold air pollution as the fourth worst overall health risk factor \nin the world and as the second worst health risk factor in the world \nfor women and girls. Millions more are sickened from the toxic smoke \nand thousands suffer burns annually from open fires or unsafe \ncookstoves.\n  Traditional cookstoves also create serious environmental problems. \nRecent studies show that the emissions of black carbon or common soot \nfrom biomass cookstoves significantly contribute to regional air and \nclimate change. In fact, cookstoves account for some 25 percent of \nblack carbon emissions. Each family using a traditional cookstove can \nrequire up to 2 tons of biomass cooking fuel, and where demand for fuel \noutstrips the natural regrowth of resources, local land degradation and \nloss of biodiversity often results.\n  Moreover, the collection of this fuel is a burden that is shouldered \ndisproportionately by women and children. In some regions of the world, \nwomen and girls risk rape and gender-based violence during the up to 20 \nhours a week they spend away from their families gathering fuel.\n  Replacing these cookstoves with modern alternatives would help \nreverse these alarming health and environmental trends. This would be \nrelatively inexpensive. In fact, there are stoves that are coming on \nthe market now that cost as little as $20 and are 50 percent more \nefficient than the traditional cooking methods. It also could be done \nquickly. It is what scientists call the low-hanging fruit of \nenvironmental fixes.\n  Through the leadership of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton \nand the United Nations Foundation, the Global Alliance for Clean \nCookstoves was formed in 2010. Recognizing the serious health and \nenvironmental issues posed by traditional cookstoves, the alliance aims \nto save lives, improve livelihoods, empower women, and combat pollution \nby creating a thriving global market for clean and efficient household \ncooking solutions. Alliance partners are working to help overcome \nmarket barriers that currently impede production, deployment, and use \nof cookstoves that are clean in the developing world.\n  To assist in this important endeavor, several Federal agencies and \ndepartments have committed a total of up to $125 million to the sector \nfor the first 5 years of the alliance. These include a wide variety of \ndepartments, including the Departments of State, Energy, and Health and \nHuman Services, the U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID, \nthe Environmental Protection Agency, the National Science Foundation, \nand the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. The U.S. Department of \nAgriculture, NOAA, and the Peace Corps have also made commitments to \nprovide technical assistance in the developing world.\n  To help advance the alliance's goal to spur the adoption of clean \ncookstoves in 100 million households by the year 2020, the U.S. \nGovernment has focused its commitments on applied research and \ndevelopment, diplomatic engagement to encourage a market for clean \ncookstoves, and to improve access, international development projects \nto help build commercial businesses, and development efforts, including \nhumanitarian and empowerment programs for women and girls.\n  The legislation Senator Durbin and I are introducing today reinforces \nthis commitment and would require the Secretary of State to work to \nadvance the goals of the alliance. In addition, the bill authorizes the \nexisting funding commitments made by our government to ensure that \nthese crucial pledges toward preventing unnecessary illness and \nreducing pollution around the globe are met.\n  By supporting the work of the alliance and the commitments of the \nU.S. Government to replace traditional cookstoves with modern versions \nthat emit far less soot, this bill aims to directly benefit some of the \nworld's poorest people and to reduce harmful pollution that affects us \nall. It offers a way for us to address the second leading contributor \nto greenhouse gas emissions in a way that is inexpensive, not \nburdensome to the people of this country, and will benefit poor people \nliving in developing nations.\n  There is yet another reason for my colleagues to support this \ninitiative. Addressing persistent global issues of poverty and \nunderdevelopment makes our country more secure by undercutting some of \nthe key drivers of extremism and militancy around the world.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Durbin and me in supporting the \nClean Cookstoves and Fuel Support Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/10/senate-section/article/S1418-2", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1418-S1419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 377--RECOGNIZING THE 193RD ANNIVERSARY OF THE \n  INDEPENDENCE OF GREECE AND CELEBRATING DEMOCRACY IN GREECE AND THE \n                             UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr. Barrasso, and Mrs. Shaheen) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nForeign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 377\n\n       Whereas the people of ancient Greece developed the concept \n     of democracy, in which the supreme power to govern was vested \n     in the people;\n       Whereas the founding fathers of the United States, many of \n     whom read Greek political philosophy in the original Greek \n     language, drew heavily on the political experience and \n     philosophy of ancient Greece in forming the representative \n     democracy of the United States;\n       Whereas Petros Mavromichalis, the former Commander in Chief \n     of Greece and a founder of the modern Greek state, said to \n     the citizens of the United States in 1821, ``It is in your \n     land that liberty has fixed her abode and . . . in imitating \n     you, we shall imitate our ancestors and be thought worthy of \n     them if we succeed in resembling you.'';\n       Whereas the Greek national anthem, the ``Hymn to Liberty'', \n     includes the words, ``most heartily was gladdened George \n     Washington's brave land'';\n       Whereas the people of the United States generously offered \n     humanitarian assistance to the people of Greece during their \n     struggle for independence;\n       Whereas Greece, in one of the most consequential ``David \n     vs. Goliath'' victories for freedom and democracy in modern \n     times, refused to surrender to the Axis forces and inflicted \n     a fatal wound at a crucial moment in World War II, forcing \n     Adolf Hitler to change his timeline and delaying the attack \n     on Russia, where the Axis forces met defeat;\n       Whereas Winston Churchill said, ``if there had not been the \n     virtue and courage of the Greeks, we do not know which the \n     outcome of World War II would have been'' and ``no longer \n     will we say that Greeks fight like heroes, but that heroes \n     fight like Greeks'';\n       Whereas hundreds of thousands of people of Greece were \n     killed in Greece during World War II in defense of the values \n     of the Allies;\n       Whereas, throughout the 20th century, Greece was one of a \n     few countries that allied with the United States in every \n     major international conflict;\n       Whereas Greece is a strategic partner and ally of the \n     United States in bringing political stability and economic \n     development to the volatile Balkan region, having invested \n     billions of dollars in the countries of the region, thereby \n     helping to create tens of thousands of new jobs, and having \n     contributed more than $750,000,000 in development aid for the \n     region;\n\n[[Page S1419]]\n\n       Whereas the Government and people of Greece actively \n     participate in peacekeeping and peace-building operations \n     conducted by international organizations, including the \n     United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the \n     European Union, and the Organization for Security and Co-\n     operation in Europe, and have more recently provided critical \n     support to the operation of the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization in Libya;\n       Whereas Greece received worldwide praise for its \n     extraordinary handling during the 2004 Olympic Games of more \n     than 14,000 athletes and more than 2,000,000 spectators and \n     journalists, a feat the Government and people of Greece \n     handled efficiently, securely, and with hospitality;\n       Whereas Greece, located in a region where Christianity \n     meets Islam and Judaism, maintains excellent relations with \n     Muslim countries and Israel;\n       Whereas the Government of Greece has taken important steps \n     in recent years to further cross-cultural understanding, \n     rapprochement, and cooperation in various fields with Turkey, \n     and has also improved its relations with other countries in \n     the region, including Israel, thus enhancing the stability of \n     the wider region;\n       Whereas the governments and people of Greece and the United \n     States are at the forefront of efforts to advance freedom, \n     democracy, peace, stability, and human rights;\n       Whereas those efforts and similar ideals have forged a \n     close bond between the people of Greece and the United \n     States; and\n       Whereas it is proper and desirable for the United States to \n     celebrate March 25, 2014, Greek Independence Day, with the \n     people of Greece and to reaffirm the democratic principles \n     from which those two great countries were founded: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) extends warm congratulations and best wishes to the \n     people of Greece as they celebrate the 193rd anniversary of \n     the independence of Greece;\n       (2) expresses support for the principles of democratic \n     governance to which the people of Greece are committed; and\n       (3) notes the important role that Greece has played in the \n     wider European region and in the community of nations since \n     gaining its independence 193 years ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/10/senate-section/article/S1419-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2807.

The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware for his \npowerful words and his participation in this great debate.\n  There is plenty of room for a robust discussion about what set of \nchoices we need to make in order to deal with this very real challenge. \nWe are here tonight to ask for that discussion, for that debate, in the \ntradition of this great body. Climate change is the challenge of our \ngeneration, and the debate of how we confront it belongs here in the \nSenate.\n  We have no illusions about being able to reach the number of votes we \nneed to pass significant legislation during this Congress, but we must \nstart this conversation now. We must start now. We are here agreeing it \nis time for us to find a way to work together to find solutions.\n  The Senate is supposed to be the place where we address and debate \nthe big issues. I hope we can work with the House on how best to tackle \nclimate change as well. But there is no room for those who deny science \nitself exists or those who deliberately propagate misinformation and \nscare tactics because they profit from pollution.\n  I know people are smart enough to know the difference between today's \nweather and what is generally happening with the climate. People cannot \nbe misled into thinking that just because winter still exists, the \nplanet isn't warming in totality. We can't possibly believe that \nbecause there was a snowstorm last week, there is no such thing as \nclimate change.\n  Since 1991, scientists have published more than 25,000 scholarly \narticles on climate change. Only 26 out of the more than 25,000 \narticles reject the existence of climate change. This is 1 in 1,000. \nThe idea that because scientists, frankly, are scientists and always \nleave a little room for additional information or for the possibility \nof revising their projections, assessments, and estimates somehow \nintroduces significant doubt about what climate change is does violence \nto the very principles on which science operates.\n  This problem is no longer confined just to our wilderness areas or to \nthose of us concerned with biological diversity or environmental \nissues. In other words, this is no longer an environmental problem. \nThis is an economic one. All we have to do is look at the extreme \nweather and the way it has affected both the Nation's fiscal condition \nand our continuing ability to deal with natural disasters, and the very \nreal possibility that many of our coastal communities will be literally \nflooded by the end of the century. There is no way we can allow this \nissue to remain a priority for only one party in American politics. \nThis is everyone's problem. This issue impacts every single American.\n  Every single Senator should be down here. This is our responsibility \nfor future generations, not just to preserve birds and butterflies but \nto preserve the American economy and our way of life. Scientists, \nleaders of States, cities, and counties, the leadership in our \nDepartment of Defense, the rest of the world, the business community, \nthe largest insurance companies--which insure actual risk--all agree on \nthe reality of climate change. The only place where we are proceeding \nas if this is an actual open question, as if the science is not \nsettled, is in the four corners of the U.S. Capitol.\n  I am not going to point to any one extreme weather event and say it \nwas caused by climate change, but climate change has increased the \nlikelihood of increasingly strong and frequent storms, drought, and \nfloods.\n  Through the 1980s, the United States experienced an average of two to \nfour billion-dollar disasters per year for storms severe enough to rack \nup more than $1 billion in damage. But 2011 and 2012 together \nexperienced 25 individual billion-dollar storm events. This is over $25 \nbillion in damages in just 2 years.\n  I will talk a little bit about what is happening with our Department \nof Defense. There is growing consensus within the Department of Defense \nthat climate change is shaping the global security environment in new \nand profound ways which will affect the U.S. military. Climate change \nis dramatically shaping the U.S. military's strategic operating \nenvironment. In its 2010 strategic planning document, the Quadrennial \nDefense Review, the Department of Defense concluded that:\n\n       While climate change alone does not cause conflict, it may \n     act as an accelerant of instability or conflict, placing a \n     burden to respond on civilian institutions and militaries \n     around the world.\n\n  The U.S. military concluded that it is increasingly likely to be \ncalled on to respond to crises which manifest as a result of climate-\nrelated instability. These include natural disasters which emanate from \nextreme weather events, which climate scientists expect to become more \nfrequent and more severe as a result of climate change, because, like \nmany first responders, the U.S. military has an obligation to respond \nwhen called for help, and indeed, the U.S. military is often the only \norganization capable of helping, with its fixed-and rotary-wing lift \ncapacity and personnel to get relief supplies to those most in need.\n  Admiral Locklear, the head of the U.S. Pacific Command, headquartered \nin my home State of Hawaii, said last year that climate change is the \ngreatest long-term security threat in the Asia-Pacific region, an area \ncovering more than half the Earth's surface area and almost 60 percent \nof its population. Upheaval and political instability from climate \nchange, he said, ``Is probably the most likely thing that is going to \nhappen . . . that will cripple the security environment, probably more \nlikely than the other scenarios we all often talk about.''\n\n[[Page S1422]]\n\n  Eleven retired three-star and four-star admirals and generals in 2007 \nstated that climate change is ``a significant national security \nchallenge'' which can serve as a ``threat multiplier for instability in \nsome of the most volatile regions of the world.''\n  Climate change is also likely to impact the U.S. military's \nfacilities and capabilities. America's military installations may be \nparticularly vulnerable to climate change, and the Department of \nDefense has dedicated resources to assess the risks. According to a \n2008 National Intelligence Council finding:\n\n       More than 30 U.S. military installations were already \n     facing elevated levels of risk from rising sea levels.\n\n  The Department of Defense's own QDR acknowledged that the U.S. \nmilitary's operational readiness hinges on continued access to land, \nair, and sea training and test space, which means ensuring that climate \nchange does not prevent the military from accessing these critical \ntraining and range areas. This may require costly intervention to adapt \nto sea level rise and other climate impacts that might otherwise \nundermine defense readiness and preparedness.\n  The Department of Defense is already working to map out its \nvulnerabilities with offices like the Strategic Environmental Research \nand Development Program, helping installation planners develop the \ntools they need and to plan accordingly. Climate change has become an \nurgent national security challenge that our military cannot and will \nnot ignore.\n  Secretary of State John Kerry was right when he said that among the \nglobal challenges ``know no borders''--``terrorism, epidemics, poverty, \nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction''--``the reality is \nthat climate change ranks right up there with every single one of \nthem.''\n  Let me talk about the insurance industry. I make this point about the \nDepartment of Defense not because this admiral or these generals are \nmembers of the Sierra Club or the National Resources Defense Council. \nIt is because when they do their defense review, they have a single-\nminded objective: To analyze what they see as their strategic \nchallenge. They are not grinding an ideological ax. They are talking \nabout what is real.\n  Insurers are risk experts in a different way. They are not paid to \ncare about the environment or conservation or future generations or to \nsteward resources. If insurers have personal environmental opinions or \nwhether they voted for President Obama or Governor Romney, they do not \nbring that point of view to the table when it comes to risk assessment. \nThey can only think about and quantify risk. Their goal is to figure \nout what is going to happen and how much it is going to cost to cover \nit. What they are saying about global climate change is it is \nhappening. Climate change is presenting real risk. They have determined \nthat climate change is underway already and is causing economic damage \nand therefore needs to be insured and underwritten. From their \nstandpoint, when billions and trillions of insurance and reinsurance \ndollars are in play, they recognize what is real, which is the threat \nof climate change.\n  When it is the highest stakes, projections, and assessments, these \npeople look at the world with very clear eyes and say climate change is \nreal. It is happening now, and it is already causing economic damage. \nWhen money is on the line, whether these people are Democrats, \nRepublicans or Independents or do not vote, they are looking at the \nfacts and measuring the risk. They have determined that this risk is \nalready upon us. It is not imaginary.\n  Let's talk about big business. Big businesses, from Nike to Coca-Cola \nto Starbucks, and insurers like Lloyds of London, recognize the \neconomic threat of climate change as well because it affects their \nbottom lines. For them it is simple numbers. Their motivation is \nsimple: Protect the bottom line. With billions and trillions of dollars \nat play, risk experts such as Lloyds are making high stakes risk \nprojections to protect their business models. These projections are \ntelling them that the risk is increasing.\n  For many multinational companies, climate change has moved from a \ncorporate social responsibility issue to a bottom-line issue. They are \nstarting to see the impact of unpredictable and extreme weather and \nrealize that investing in environmental protection means investing in \nthe economy. Climate change affects the supply of key inputs, disrupts \nfactories, demolishes infrastructure, and drives up prices. The \neconomic calculus is shifting for them.\n  Major companies doing business in America have signed the climate \ndeclaration, which acknowledges that tackling climate change is one of \nAmerica's greatest economic opportunities of the 21st Century, and it \nis the right thing to do. These companies include Apple, Avon, eBay, \nGM, Ikea, Intel, Levi's, Mars, Microsoft, Nestle, Nike, Owens Corning, \nStarbucks, Swiss Re, Symantec, The North Face, and Unilever. If we do \nnot make serious changes, the only thing we can be certain of is that \nuncertainty will increase. Extreme weather events, drought, floods, \nspreading infectious diseases, resource wars and other tests of human \ncivilization will test us repeatedly. Our economy thrives on certainty. \nClimate change increases uncertainty. The pragmatic, conservative \napproach requires us to take action.\n  We have heard the argument tonight, earlier in the evening from the \nSenator from Oklahoma, from some in this body at other moments, about \nclimate change today, that there is either nothing we can do or that \naction will be too expensive. Regulations will kill jobs and hurt the \neconomy, driving up prices on everything from gas to bread. Opponents \nof the Clean Air Act, vehicle efficiency standards, energy efficiency, \nand removing lead from gasoline all used the same arguments. They \ndenied it was happening, they spread misinformation, and they sowed \nfears of economic destruction. In every case they were wrong.\n  Largely as a result of government regulations between 1970 and 2011, \ntotal air pollution dropped 68 percent while the U.S. gross domestic \nproduct grew by 212 percent, more than doubling.\n  Well designed solutions to environmental problems can, in fact, \ncontribute to a healthier and growing economy. America can innovate its \nway out of this problem. Inaction comes with financial costs. Climate \nchange is absolutely right now hurting our economy. It is affecting \nindividual fishermen everywhere from my home State of Hawaii, to the \nPresiding Officer's home State, to the lobstermen in Maine--which my \ngood friend from Maine has already discussed.\n  A 2012 study commissioned by 20 governments which was written by more \nthan 50 scientists, economists, and other experts found that climate \nchange is already contributing to multiple deaths per year costing the \nworld $1.2 trillion in 2010, and reducing global GDP by 1.6 percent.\n\n  The study also said by 2030 the cost of climate change and air \npollution combined could rise to 3.2 percent of global GDP with a 2 \npercent hit to the U.S. GDP. Similar effects could cost China $1.2 \ntrillion. Every time we try to move forward with environmental or \npublic health legislation there are people who will say that the U.S. \neconomy will collapse as a result. This happened with the Clean Air Act \nand the Clean Water Act. Almost every time they are proven wrong.\n  The American economy is an innovation economy. Whenever we require \nour American companies to innovate, whether in the interest of public \nhealth, the environment or the economy, they have thrived. They step up \nto the plate. Climate change is a challenge where America can once \nagain be the global leader. We have to believe in our ability to \ninnovate our way out of this problem.\n  When the U.S. economy and our businesses are presented with \nopportunities to innovate, they thrive. During the debate on the Clean \nAir Act we heard those standards would destroy the economy, but since \n1970 every dollar invested in compliance with the Clean Air Act \nstandards has actually produced $48 in economic benefits. It is not \njust that the American economy and business can innovate and thrive in \nthis context, it is also that we are still the indispensable Nation. \nAmerica is still the Nation where other countries look to see whether \nreal leadership will be displayed. For that reason we need to act.\n  On this issue that affects every single American and the entire \nplanet, we cannot afford to give up on American leadership. We have to \nbelieve in our\n\n[[Page S1423]]\n\nideas and the power of our ability to innovate, in the strength of our \neconomy and in the American ideal that whatever problem our generation \nis faced with, we will meet it.\n  The idea--and we have heard it before on this floor from climate \nchange deniers--that we shouldn't do anything because China won't do \nanything misses the point. If we do something, China will do something.\n  Some are saying let's not do anything because of China and India. I \nam saying let's do something because of China and India. If we lead \nhere we will have the economic advantage.\n  In fact, China has already begun the work to fight pollution and to \ntransition to a clean energy economy. Last week at the opening of \nChina's annual meeting of the parliament, the Chinese Premier said that \nChina will declare war on pollution in the coming years. China faces a \ntwo-fold threat of extreme local pollution and the effects of climate \nchange, and it recognizes that transitioning to clean energy sources is \nan economic and political stability imperative.\n  In January the executive secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention \non Climate Change said that China is ``doing it right'' as it begins to \ntackle climate change. She said that the Chinese are ``not doing this \nbecause they want to save the planet, they are doing it because it is \nin their national interest.''\n  The Chinese State Council's September Atmospheric Pollution \nPrevention Action Plan set specific goals: A reduction in the \nconstruction of new coal-fired power plants, a goal of generating 13 \npercent of its electricity from clean energy resources by 2017.\n  Last year China installed 12 to 14 gigawatts of solar panels and is \nexpected to do it again this year. Prior to 2013 no country had ever \nadded more than 8 gigawatts of solar in a single year. A price \nguarantee for utility-scale solar projects known as a feed-in tariff, \nas well as low-cost panels drove this dramatic growth. China is taking \ndecisive action. I, for one, do not want to give up on American \nleadership here.\n  We have to believe in our ideas, in the power of our ability to \ninnovate, and the strength of our economy, and the American idea that \nwhatever problem our generation is faced with, we will address it.\n  I would like to talk a little bit about our Hawaii experience. I have \nseen firsthand from our experience in Hawaii that with commitment and \nspecific goals, real progress can be made. We have led the way to \nbuilding clean energy infrastructure, producing renewable energy, and \nreducing our petroleum dependency. I know we can achieve this kind of \nchange across the Nation. As Lieutenant Governor, I led our efforts \ntoward Hawaii's 70-percent clean energy goal by the year 2030, and we \nhave made encouraging progress. The Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative \nPartnership has the enthusiastic support of our business community, the \nU.S. DOE and DOD, the State government and even our monopoly electric \nutility company. By 2013 it would surpass our 2015 goal of 15-percent \nclean energy while having one of the lowest unemployment rates in the \nNation. Hawaii's progress has taken creativity, collaboration, and \ninnovation, the same qualities that have helped America overcome other \nseemingly unsolvable problems.\n  Transformation did not come easily and would not have occurred \nwithout collaboration between Federal, State, county, and private \nsector partners. But because of their hard work, we are now on track to \nachieve the highest renewable energy portfolio in the Nation, with 40 \npercent by the year 2030. Not everything we are doing in the State of \nHawaii will work in all states, but we are learning that some policies \nhave broad application. We know that climate change is a real problem, \nand that it is caused by humans, but we also know that it is a problem \nthat we can fix, and we know what to do.\n  The challenges of climate change won't disappear overnight if \nCongress acts, but for the U.S. or the world to fight climate change \nwhile Congress sticks its head in the sand is like trying to fight with \none hand tied behind their back. Americans agree that climate change is \nreal and caused by humans. They agree that something must be done. \nCongress is a necessary but not sufficient part of this problem, for we \nface the biggest collective action problem in the history of \nhumankind--bigger than war, bigger than disease, bigger than poverty.\n  America must continue our role as a leader that does not shy away \nfrom the big problems. Climate change is an economic issue, a health \nissue, and a national security issue.\n  I would like to take a moment to recognize the many professionals who \nhave made tonight possible. The Senate stands out as the greatest \ndeliberative body in the U.S. and, in my opinion, the world. Even in \nour disagreements, our remarks are generally at least collegial and \nusually friendly. The reason is simple: Respect. Respect for one \nanother as representatives of the concerns of our home States, respect \nfor the diversity of experiences that qualify us to serve as Senators \nbut, most of all, respect for this institution, which is so much more \nthan the physical infrastructure.\n  Even for the short time I have had the honor of serving, what I see \nis an institution built on people. The Capitol may be made of bricks \nand mortar, but the Senate lives and breathes through the people who \nwork here. Often in the course of our daily business, we thank the \npeople we work with for their help. But in light of the unusual demands \nthat our event requires tonight, I would like to thank not only the \nindividuals but their offices and departments. Without them, we would \nbe unprotected, we would be in the dark, and we would be unable to \nfunction.\n  I would like to start with the Sergeant at Arms and all of its \ndepartments: doorkeepers, capitol facilities, media galleries, \nexecutive office, recording studio, printing and graphics, direct mail, \nthe fleet office, and the U.S. Capitol Police. You keep our Senate \norderly, safe, and functioning smoothly, and we thank you for that.\n  We almost must recognize the Secretary of the Senate: the executive \noffice, the office of the Bill Clerk, the Captioning Services office, \nthe Daily Digest office, the office of the Enrolling Clerk, the office \nof the Executive Clerk, the office of the Journal Clerk, the \nLegislative Clerk, our Parliamentarians, and the Official Reporters of \nDebates. You maintain order in the legislative process and record our \nactions so this body's work can be transparent and accountable to the \nAmerican people, and we thank you.\n  The cloakrooms help to preserve order on the floor so that our \ndeliberations perpetuate the rule of law in our great Nation, and we \nthank you.\n  The Senate librarians and CRS make it possible for us to make \ninformed statements based on the best information available, and we \nthank you.\n  The Senate pages stepped away from their usual classrooms and \nschoolmates to support our actions here and participate in American \ndemocracy. We thank you.\n  While all have roles to keep tonight moving smoothly, I would like to \ncall special focus on the Official Reporters of Debates. These folks \ntranscribe every word we speak here tonight for the Congressional \nRecord, which is then distributed the following day to more than 20,000 \nsubscribers.\n  In 1956, then-Senate majority leader Lyndon Johnson explained the \nimportance of the Congressional Record:\n  Locked in its pages are the debate, the resolutions, the bills, the \nmemorials, the petitions, and the legislative actions that are the \nreason for the existence of the Senate. Without them, our words tonight \nwould be lost, so I offer on behalf of all the Members who have helped \nto coordinate tonight our sincerest thanks.\n  I am happy to yield to the Senators from New Mexico and New Jersey if \nthey are ready; otherwise, I would be happy to continue to speak.\n  Does the Senator from New Mexico need a few minutes to prepare or \nwould he like to start?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Speaking through the Chair to the Senator from Hawaii, \nI am happy to get started and give an opening statement and focus on \nthe State of New Mexico and some of the climate impacts we have seen in \nthe last decade, and then perhaps engage in a conversation with my \ncolleague the Senator from New Jersey.\n  I think it bears saying that this is a historic evening. This is an \nincredible\n\n[[Page S1424]]\n\nfirst step in recognizing the challenge that lies ahead. I am here \ntonight as a member of the climate change task force. I join my \ncolleagues in calling for action on tackling what is unquestionably one \nof our country's greatest challenges but a challenge we are up to \nmeeting.\n  We are here to illustrate, for starters, that climate change is not \ntheoretical. We are here to discuss how sound science can be used to \nbetter understand and manage the very real impacts of climate change \nthat we are seeing and to highlight the moral imperative we have in \nCongress to implement real solutions.\n  I thought I would start tonight with something that is just about \nanywhere in the United States. If you are a gardener, if you are a \nfarmer, if you are a horticulturist, if you have an orchard of fruit \ntrees, you probably know these maps. They are the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture plant hardiness zone maps.\n  When I hear people deny our climate is changing and how much our \nclimate has already changed, I think it is very helpful to look back to \nthe year 1990--the year I graduated from high school--and to look at \nthe USDA plant hardiness zone map for the United States and to compare \nit to the one that came out in 2006. What you see when you look at this \nmap is literally every single plant hardiness zone. If you are a \ngardener, you take these to the bank. This tells you whether a certain \ncrop can grow in your zone. If you are in Minnesota, the answer to what \nis going to thrive in your garden is going to be very different than if \nyou are in Arizona or New Mexico. What you see when you look at these \nmaps is all of these zones have literally moved north.\n  In the case of my home State of New Mexico, there are zones that \nexisted in the northern part of the State--up around Taos and Chama, \nand at a high elevation, where the Sangre de Cristo mountains reach up \nto over 13,000 feet. There are zones that existed in 1990 that exist \nnowhere in the State today because it has warmed so much. In fact, \nthose zones only exist at the highest elevations in the State of \nColorado to our north.\n  I don't think you can look at this map and say our climate is not \ngetting warmer. It captures year after year of real-world experience of \nthe people who rely on these maps to make sure our food supply and all \nthe plants we use for other purposes as well are safe and productive.\n  In my home State of New Mexico, one of the other impacts we are \nseeing we have heard from other Western States tonight, as well as up \nand down the intermountain West and the Rocky Mountains, has been the \nimpact of forest fire. We are seeing bigger fires and drier summers. We \nare seeing more severe floods when it does rain and less snowpack in \nthe winter.\n  In 2012, looking back just 2 years ago, it was our Nation's second \nmost extreme year on record for weather. In New Mexico, it was actually \nthe hottest year we have experienced since we started collecting \ntemperature records. With humidity levels lower and temperatures \nhigher, we are dealing with fire behavior in the Southwest that is \nmarkedly more intense than anything we have seen in the past.\n\n  When people think of the State of New Mexico, and if they have not \nbeen to New Mexico, they often think of it as one of the southwestern \narid desert low-elevation States. The reality that I grew up with was \nthe high elevation forests of New Mexico. We literally have millions of \nacres of mountains and forests. If you just saw a photo, you might say: \nWell, that looks like Colorado or that looks like Montana. Those are \nall up and down our mountain ranges from the southern part of the \nState. We have the Gila. Up in the northern part of the State, we have \nthe Santa Fe National Forest, the Carson National Forest, the Jemez \nmountains, and the Sangre de Cristo mountains.\n  One of the things that has evolved over the years which exists in the \nhigh elevation western forests is the ability to deal with forest fire, \nin particular, our Ponderosa pine forests. We used to have a regime \nwhere every 10 years or so we would have a fire in those forests. That \nfire would not burn the forest down. It would move through the \nPonderosa pine. It would burn fine fuels, as we call them, such as the \nneedles that fall from the canopy of the Ponderosa pine forest, the \nsmall pieces of woody debris, and the grass that grows in between the \nPonderosa pine trees, and it would sort of clean out the understory and \nit would leave this incredible cathedral of high elevation Ponderosa \npine forest with grass in between the trees, but that is changing.\n  This incredibly sad photo is exhibit A on what happens when the \ntemperature increases just a little bit. We are seeing fire behavior in \nNew Mexico that is like nothing in the historical record and nothing \nwithin the context of normal behavior. We are seeing what they call \nstand-replacing fires. I believe this was a couple of months after the \nLas Conchas fire a few years ago. If I remember correctly, the Las \nConchas fire was in 2011 in the Jemez mountains. It was the single \nlargest fire in our State's history at the time. Since then, we have \nhad a bigger fire, the Whitewater-Baldy fire.\n  What was particularly concerning about the Las Conchas fire is how it \nburned--how intensely it burned, how it burned down slope with stand-\nreplacing flames, and how it literally didn't leave behind any of those \nbig fire-protected trees. Those Ponderosa pines are built to survive \nfire after fire throughout the course of their lives. They may live to \nbe 300 years old. They have such thick bark that typically in the past \nthey survived dozens and dozens of fires in the course of their \nlifetimes.\n  As we can see from this, almost nothing survived large parts of this \nfire, and that is what we are seeing as temperatures increase. As those \ntemperatures increase, the humidity level in the fuels goes down, and \nthe fuels burn hotter. The fuels are able to jump up into the canopy \nand literally burn out the entire forest. We can see a few patches of \ngreen here. This is one of the most destructive fires in our State's \nhistory.\n  Over the last 4 years alone, as I mentioned, we have seen the two \nlargest fires in our State's history. With elevated temperatures, \nstudies by Los Alamos National Labs predict that three-quarters of our \nevergreen forest in New Mexico could be gone by 2050. In my lifetime, \nthree-quarters of our high-elevation conifer evergreen forest could be \ngone.\n  These are places we rely on for our economy. They hold snow in the \nwinter. They produce an enormous number of jobs. We have approximately \n68,000 jobs that are tied to public lands recreation in the State. Many \nof those are centered around these high-elevation forests where people \nhunt for elk in the fall. They produce the waters that allow people to \nraft in the Rio Grande during the summer. They are the places where \npeople cross-country and alpine-ski in the winter. They are under \ndirect threat from a changing climate.\n  We now know that the extreme weather we are seeing comes at an \nenormous economic cost. There was a new study produced in the journal \nFrontiers in Ecology and Environment that reveals the trend and how \nmuch ignoring this problem has cost the American taxpayer over the \ncourse of the last couple of decades. They went back and looked at \nfirefighting in the early 1990s, around 1993. The average cost of \nfighting fires in our national forests at that time was $350 million a \nseason. That is a lot of money; that is real money; and that is spread \nover many different States. Fast forward to today, and on average we \nare spending $2 billion, with a B, a fire season fighting fires.\n  Yesterday the Washington Post reported that the study's conclusions \n``underscore what the agencies responsible for fighting wildfires--the \nInterior Department, the Agriculture Department's Forest Service--have \nsaid for years. Global warming is accelerating climate change in the \nWest, resulting in winters with less precipitation and a drier \nlandscape. The wildfire season that historically started in June and \nended in September now starts in May and ends in September.'' I would \nsay that in New Mexico we haven't been lucky enough to have it begin in \nMay and end in September; we have actually had some fires that were \ncompletely outside of that window.\n\n  I remember a few years ago as I was running for Congress in the fall \nof 2007, leading up to the 2008 elections, I watched as the Monzano \nMountains near my home in Albuquerque burned in November, around \nThanksgiving time. We saw extreme fire behavior\n\n[[Page S1425]]\n\nthere--fires once again burning down slope, in November, and fire \nbehaviors even in the middle of the night that we normally wouldn't see \nexcept in the middle of the day in the middle of summer.\n  It has been something that has touched our State dramatically. It \nhappens now with such regularity that we are almost used to it, but it \nputs lives at risk. It puts property at risk. Many people in this \nChamber probably remember all of the brave firefighters who literally \nlost their lives in Arizona last year fighting these fires. In fact, \nthose firefighters helped on a New Mexico fire before in the very area \nwe saw with the picture I showed of how the Las Conchas fire burned.\n  One of the related issues is the relationship between the economy of \nmy home of New Mexico and the impact of snowfall and how snowfall has \nchanged as a result of a changing climate.\n  This is a map of the Four Corners States. This is Albuquerque, NM, \nhere, Santa Fe; this is the Four Corners area where Utah, Arizona, \nColorado, and New Mexico all come together. Historically, our economy \nrelies very much on not just rainfall and precipitation but the value \nof a strong snowpack. Agriculture in the Southwest does not work as it \ndoes in other parts of the country where crops are literally watered by \nrain. We store our snowpack in reservoirs. We rely on the fact that \nsnow lasts longer and is released slowly from the high elevation \nforests and mountains. It gets stored in reservoirs and then is used to \nirrigate hundreds of square miles up and down the Rio Grande Valley \nthroughout the heart of New Mexico, as well as other valleys in the \nState, such as the Pecos Valley. We have seen dramatic changes in the \nextent of both snow cover as well as the amount of water that is stored \nin that snow.\n  These two images show snow cover in 2010 and in 2014. They illustrate \na trend that is becoming all too common with the current drought \nconditions and with warming winter temperatures. So 2010 was a \nrelatively good year for us. We had snow cover, as my colleagues can \nsee, across much of the northern part of the State. As we move into \neven higher elevation areas up in Colorado, very intense snows in the \nSan Juans that drain down into the Rio Grande, the San Juan rivers in \nNew Mexico. If we look at the Mogollon Rim, which goes all the way from \nGila, NM, up through Arizona on its way toward the Grand Canyon, just a \nlong, high-elevation geologic feature that stores snowpack for both \nArizona and New Mexico, we can look over at the 2014 image and what we \nsee is a dramatic reduction in the amount of snow cover. As a result, \nthe runoff we have experienced in this drought has been a fraction of \nwhat we used to think of as normal. It is sort of the new normal.\n  In December of 2012, two researchers affiliated with the University \nof New Hampshire unveiled a study around snow and winter tourism \nimpacts called ``Climate Impacts on the Winter Tourism Economy in the \nUnited States.'' That report, completed for the Natural Resources \nDefense Council and Protect Our Winters, an organization founded in \n2007 by professional snowboarder Jeremy Jones, concluded that the \neconomies that rely on winter sports tourists have a lot to lose if we \nfail to take action on climate change.\n  The Presiding Officer probably heard some of the recent stories \naround the Sochi Olympics--stories I couldn't have imagined as a \nchild--of literally covering up huge amounts of snow to insulate it \nfrom the elements so it didn't melt, so it could be used in some of \nthose sports. The report states that December 2011 through February \n2012 was the fourth warmest winter on record since 1896 and the third \nlowest snow cover extent since 1966 when satellites began giving us \nimages just like these.\n  When it doesn't snow in the Intermountain West, communities that rely \non winter sports tourists take an enormous economic hit. Fewer people \nlodge in their hotels, fewer people shop in their stores, and fewer \npeople eat in their restaurants. If we were to ask the businesses in \nplaces such as Taos, NM, or Ruidoso in the south central part of the \nState, Red River and others spread across the high-elevation portions \nof my State, they will tell us when there is no snow; they see an \nenormous reduction in the amount of business activity, in the gross \nreceipts in those small towns, and it ripples through the entire \neconomy.\n  That report points out that ski resorts in the northern part of New \nMexico are the primary drivers of New Mexico's $182 million ski \nindustry. Winter tourism in New Mexico provides more than 3,100 jobs. \nWe are a State of only 2 million people, but 3,100 jobs has a $104 \nmillion impact on our economy. In low snowfall years, New Mexico lost \nout on an estimated $48 million in ski resort revenue and had nearly \n600 fewer jobs compared to higher snowfall years. Winter sports \ntourists are an extremely important part of my State's economy, and I \nam very concerned that if we continue to do nothing about climate \nchange, we will lose those tourist dollars.\n\n  Climate change is very real and it is impacting our bottom line in \nthe State of New Mexico. Climate change is also leaving a devastating \nimprint on our agricultural industry in the State of New Mexico. These \nimages are striking to me, and these are satellite images from NASA.\n  This is the largest reservoir in the State of New Mexico. It is \ncalled Elephant Butte Reservoir. It is in the central part of the \nState. If a person is used to growing up in a State such as New Mexico \nand a person knows there are certain crops that are just iconically \nconnected to the State, including green chili being at the top of the \nlist, red chili--they are actually the same plant, but we will save \nthat for another day--pistachios, pecans, all of these things are tied \nto irrigation and the ability to irrigate hundreds of square miles of \nagricultural land along the Rio Grande throughout the State.\n  In 1994, in the midnineties, Elephant Butte Reservoir was functioning \nas it had since the early 1900s, storing all of that snowpack we talked \nabout a few minutes ago, making sure it was released to serve \nagriculture, to extend the irrigation season, to make sure those crops \nwere realized. Then we began to get into this long-term, persistent \ndrought. My colleagues have probably heard the stories about California \nand its drought and its impact on agriculture. New Mexico has \nexperienced just as intense a reduction in snowpack, in predictability \nof summer precipitation. We get a lot of our moisture in the summer \nmonsoon, the wettest time of the year outside of the winter. So we get \nsome in the wintertime in snowpack typically and then in the summertime \nwe have the summer thunderstorms, and the predictability of that has \nall changed now. But as we can see, so has the quantity.\n  Elephant Butte Reservoir is about 2 million acre feet in capacity. An \nacre foot of water is literally taking an acre of land and covering it \nin water 1 foot deep. It is about 325,000 gallons, if my memory serves \nme well. This is about 2 million acre feet. People can do the math. But \nit is literally the largest single body of reservoir water for \nagriculture and other uses in the State of New Mexico.\n  Fast forward to 2013. These were both taken in the same month, the \nmonth of July, which is kind of the height of the irrigation season. \nThree percent is what was left in Elephant Butte Reservoir. It \nliterally doesn't even look like the same place. The northern extent of \nthe reservoir has been dry land for much of the year in this photo. \nThis has enormous ramifications for agriculture in our State and for \nother industries that use and rely on that water.\n  Farmers and ranchers are often first to see the effects of extreme \nweather. A 2012 study found that by 2020, New Mexico agriculture and \nranching will lose $73 million annually due to climate change. We can \nlayer that on to the $48 million we talked about a little while ago \nfrom impacts to the winter ski season. We start to see the very real \ncost of not doing anything about climate change.\n  The agricultural sector is incredibly vulnerable due to the sustained \nthreat to the water supply, to soil and vegetation from sustained \ndrought. Livestock levels in many areas of New Mexico were one-fifth of \nnormal levels last year due to the scarce forage. So year after year of \ndrought--not just 1 year but over and over again--is what leads to this \nincredible inability to even manage water. We don't have the water in \nthe reservoir to be able to deal with the fact that we are not getting \nenough\n\n[[Page S1426]]\n\nprecipitation. We have over the years sort of used our savings account, \nand now we are down to a very small amount of water that has to be \nstretched as far as we can in summer irrigation season. We have seen a \nnumber of parts of the Rio Grande run dry in the summer as a result.\n  Things are only going to get worse if we don't act and begin to \naddress some of these conditions. If we have any hope of reversing the \neffects of climate change--and we truly must--it is critical we embrace \nthis challenge now and that we lead the world in innovation, in \nefficiency, and in clean energy.\n  As our colleagues Senators Portman and Shaheen know, there is no \ncleaner source of energy than the ones we don't use in the first place. \nEnergy efficiency and conservation should be the centerpiece of any \nstrategy to address climate change. The easiest way we can reduce the \namount of carbon pollution, methane pollution, and other greenhouse \ngases that make it into the atmosphere is to not use those in the first \nplace.\n  Conservation pays enormous dividends. I remember when my wife and I \nbought our first home, we decided we wanted to make it as sustainable \nas we could, but it was a retrofit, so where do we start. Well, we have \nhad solar on the roof of that home in Albuquerque for many years now, \nbut that is not where we started. That wasn't the first place we put \nour investment. It wouldn't have made sense. The first thing we did is \nwe insulated a home that had been built without insulation. We replaced \nwindows that were leaking warm air to the outside all through the \nwintertime, not keeping cool air inside during the summertime. \nEfficiency is absolutely critical if we are going to begin to address \nour overall energy usage in this country and to reduce the amount of \ncarbon pollution in particular we are putting into the atmosphere.\n  Getting the most out of each unit of energy, kilowatt, Btu should be \na concern at every level of our government. The U.S. Federal Government \nis the largest energy consumer in our country, and the Federal \nGovernment has an obligation to lead by example when it comes to energy \nperformance.\n  We heard a lot about the transportation sector and the advances we \nhave made due to the fuel economy standards. But buildings are also an \nenormous part of our carbon and our pollution footprint in this \ncountry. They account for about 40 percent of our energy use, and they \noffer the greatest opportunities for savings. Investing in energy \nefficiency in those buildings isn't just good for our environment and \nfor reducing air pollution; it is literally one of the fastest and most \ncost-effective ways to grow our economy.\n  We have seen business energy efficiency take off in recent years and \nproduce high-quality jobs all across this country. Energy efficiency is \na large, low-cost, underutilized U.S. energy resource. Increasing our \nenergy efficiency in the residential sector, commercial sector, \nindustrial and governmental sectors offers Americans savings on their \nenergy bills, opportunities for more jobs, improves our Nation's \ncompetitiveness, and it stretches every tax dollar further.\n  To help the Nation transition to cleaner and renewable sources of \nenergy, I am also supporting efforts to streamline permitting for \nrenewable energy projects on our public lands, while protecting access \nto those public lands for families and sportsmen to enjoy.\n  Another key to further development of renewable energy is to \nalleviate the bottlenecks in our electric power grid. Much of our power \ngrid was developed decades ago, some of it nearly 100 years ago, and I \nam working in New Mexico to help tap our renewable resources by adding \nnew transmission capacity and smart grids to an aging infrastructure.\n  We need to find better ways to make sure new transmission projects \nare well planned to protect the environment but can also move forward \nin a reasonable timeframe. Whether for our national security, our \nenergy independence or our Nation's ability to compete in the global \neconomy, our efforts and our solutions should be rooted in fact and \ndriven by the best available science.\n  As we heard earlier tonight from our friend and colleague from \nOklahoma, not everyone agrees. There are some who deny that climate \nchange exists. There are some who are simply paralyzed by how big the \nproblem is--the fear of the economic or political costs along the way. \nBut one of the things that has bothered me the most, as we have had \nthis debate, is too often we see scientific integrity undermined. We \nsee scientific research politicized in an effort to advance ideological \nor purely political agendas or to protect certain industries and \ninterests. Too often we see that some in Washington believe they are \nnot just entitled to their own opinions but believe they are somehow \nentitled to their own facts. Frankly, none of us are entitled to our \nown facts.\n  No area of innovation in science will be more important than our \nNation's ability to tackle climate change and lead the world in clean \nenergy technology. We saw a lot of information earlier in the evening \nabout the incredible growth we have seen in renewable sources of energy \nin recent years, particularly in wind and solar. The cost of solar has \ncome down precipitously in recent times. It reminds me that in 1961 \nPresident John F. Kennedy made a bold claim that an American would walk \non the Moon by the end of the decade. To many people that seemed \nabsolutely ludicrous.\n  This is a similar challenge we face. Eight years after President \nKennedy made that claim, Neil Armstrong did just that. It did not even \ntake a decade. We need that kind of effort to be able to address the \nincredible challenge we have with a warming globe. We need to think \nbig, we need to execute, and we need to innovate, as the Presiding \nOfficer said.\n  Innovation is going to be so important as we deal with this issue. \nFrankly, in the United States we have met issue after issue that people \nsaid could not be solved or was too big or would cost us too much. We \nturned those around and into opportunities to grow new jobs and grow \nnew industry.\n  As we look at this particular challenge, the real question is, is the \neconomic activity that is going to be associated with solving these \nchallenges--are we going to get the benefit of those technologies? Are \nwe going to get the jobs from manufacturing, installing, developing \nthose things or are we going to cede that leadership to other countries \naround the world?\n  Even the sleeping giant in China, with all of their policies over the \nyears that have led to the incredible, dangerous pollution levels we \nsee--where students actually put masks on statues in China to make a \npolitical point that there is no clean air to be had--even China is \nrealizing they have to invest in this innovation, that they have a \nnational interest in it.\n  We have the most innovative folks in the world. We have our National \nLaboratories. We have scientists and entrepreneurs who can come up with \nsolutions that will take us further than we have seen with the \nincredible growth in wind and solar in the last few years. We need to \nmake the commitment and move from just having a debate about these \nissues to employing the policy changes that will drive that innovation.\n  (Mr. SCHATZ assumed the Chair)\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, I would be happy to yield to the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. The Senator's point about China makes me think that \nif you look at the behavior of the Chinese with respect to this power, \nyou see a couple things. You see, first of all, that they have worked \nvery hard to try to undercut our domestic innovation by dropping prices \non solar artificially. You see that particularly if you are involved on \nthe Intelligence and Armed Services side, the extraordinary efforts \nthey have made to hack into our intellectual property and to try to \nsteal it back to China so their companies can compete unfairly against \nours.\n  When you see this activity, particularly in the area of solar and \nrenewables, and you see the extent to which the Chinese are investing \nin solar and renewables, what conclusion must one draw about what the \nChinese see as the future of solar and renewables?\n  Mr. HEINRICH. The Senator from Rhode Island brings up a very good \npoint because obviously the Chinese have come to the conclusion that it \nis in their best interests to innovate and\n\n[[Page S1427]]\n\nto do it as rapidly as possible. He brings up some issues that, \nfrankly, are not necessarily what I would call the most responsible or \nmoral ways to move rapidly through that ladder of innovation. But, \nnonetheless, it is unmistakable that they are realizing just how \nimportant this is.\n  I think it is important for us to come to the same conclusion. I \nthink it is important for us to realize if we cede these industries to \nChina, they will be selling us the products of the future. We have seen \nthis already with their ability to undercut the price and artificially \nlower the cost of producing solar panels and how deleterious that has \nbeen to our domestic manufacturing base for those technologies.\n\n  We need to make sure we are making the technologies of tomorrow's \nclean energy economy here and installing those technologies ourselves \nand getting the jobs, all the way from the innovation to the \nmanufacturing, to the supply chain, to make sure we see the \nopportunities in this as well as other challenges.\n  I think what motivated me to be part of tonight is that, similar to \nthe Presiding Officer, I have a couple of young kids at home--a 7-year-\nold named Micah, a 10-year-old--soon to be 11 years old--named Carter.\n  When I think of some of the issues the Senator from Rhode Island \nbrought up and the briefings I receive on the Intelligence Committee--\nand not only the intellectual property theft that has been reported in \nthe open media but also the impacts we are seeing in places such as \nCentral Asia, the glaciers that an enormous part of the world's \npopulation relies on for their fresh water, a place that has inherent \nand sometimes volatile conflicts right below the surface, where \nPakistan and India and other countries come together--when we look \naround Southeast Asia and realize there is an enormous amount of the \nworld's population living just a few feet above sea level who are \nexposed to those superstorms in a way that even those of us who have \nhad to deal with superstorms such as Sandy cannot imagine because they \ndid not have a home to shelter in or at least a home that looks like \nthe places we have, it certainly sobers one.\n  I see the Senator from New Jersey is here.\n  Mr. BOOKER. If I may interrupt for a question because I would like to \nstay on point.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Absolutely.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a colloquy with \nthe Senator from New Jersey who knows firsthand what some of these \nsuperstorms are capable of.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOOKER. I would like to continue to have the Senator from Rhode \nIsland as well involved in this colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Because he brings up a tremendous point.\n  For all of us who are competitive and have this belief that this \nNation of ours should remain a leader in the globe, the Senator from \nRhode Island makes a very good point. We are a nation that has led in \ninnovation, led in ingenuity. Generation after generation, we have seen \nour country excel and exceed economically because of American \ninnovation.\n  What the Senator from Rhode Island brings up so pointedly is that in \nthis area--the technologies of the future that are going to have us \nhave an ability to produce the energy of the future--America runs the \nrisk of falling behind some of our most fierce competitors.\n  But what I would like to ask the Senator from Rhode Island--because \nit goes further than that--we know that as to the challenges of the \nfuture, we can look at the past and see how economic policy has so \ndramatically influenced foreign policy. You can go back to right after \nWorld War II, how America's economic dominance helped us to advance.\n  Looking at the Suez crisis, when America and Britain had different \nagendas, it was a fact that we held their debt, that we had the \neconomic advantage that allowed us to press our interests, but there \nare other threats too.\n  What is interesting to me is, as has been stated tonight already--and \nI would love to talk to folks because both of you have already talked \nabout Senate intelligence briefings and military briefings--I would \nlike to read from a document that talks about Navy ADM Samuel J. \nLocklear, III, the commander of U.S. forces in the Pacific, stating \nvery dramatically--and I would love to get the reaction of the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island to this--that significant upheaval related to the \nwarming of the planet, the admiral says, ``is probably the most likely \nthing that is going to happen . . . that will cripple the security \nenvironment, probably more likely than the other scenarios we all often \ntalk about.''\n  You see, Admiral Locklear focuses on risk management and preparedness \nfor our Nation. He does not have time for philosophy. He does not have \ntime for politics. He is focusing on a concrete risk analysis when it \ncomes to the safety, security, and preparedness of our Nation.\n  He goes on:\n\n       While resilience in the security environment is \n     traditionally understood as the ability to recover from a \n     crisis, using the term in the context of national security \n     expands its meaning to include crisis prevention.\n\n  I read on:\n\n       Admiral Samuel Locklear had a meeting the other day with \n     national security experts at Tufts and Harvard. After this \n     session, he met with a reporter who asked him what the top \n     security threat was in the Pacific Ocean. Rather than \n     highlighting Chinese ballistic missiles, the new Chinese Navy \n     aircraft carrier, North Korean nuclear weapons, or other \n     traditional military threats, Admiral Locklear looked to a \n     larger definition of national security.\n       Locklear commented that ``People are surprised sometimes'' \n     that he highlights climate change--despite an ability to \n     discuss a wide range of threats from cyber-war to the \n     North Koreans. However, it is the risks--from natural \n     disasters, to long-term sea level rise threats, to Pacific \n     Nations--that have his deepest attention.\n\n  Here he is being quoted:\n\n       You have the real potential here in the not-too-distant \n     future of nations displaced by rising sea levels. Certainly \n     weather patterns are more severe than they have been in the \n     past. We are on super typhoon 27 or 28 this year in the \n     Western Pacific. The average is about 17. Climate change \n     merits national security military attention for very \n     pragmatic reasons.\n\n  So the Senator from Rhode Island--we have talked about many things \ntonight--understands this issue, and he is one of the motivating \nfactors for an amazing array of Senators from all around the country \ntonight to be talking about the impacts on our individual States, which \nI hope to do about New Jersey soon.\n  But the bigger issues at stake are long-term economic \ncompetitiveness, which the Senator from New Mexico has talked about, \nand also the threat that our military experts see to our Nation and \nglobal security. I wonder if the Senator for a moment would comment on \nthat.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. On the point the Senator from New Jersey makes about \neconomic power being the foundation for military power and the power of \npersuasion around the globe, one really does not have to look any \nfurther than back to the decline and fall of the Soviet Union, which is \nwidely viewed as being based on a country that spent so much on its \nmilitary without an underlying economic engine powerful enough to \nsupport it that it finally fell in.\n  So when we are looking out at a clean energy market that has been \nestimated to be a $6 trillion market, the idea that it is in America's \ninterest to cede that entire market to the Chinese, to let them be the \nmanufacturers, to trust that we will be fine if they are manufacturing \nsolar and wind and all of the new battery technologies and that we are \njust consumers of that, is crazy. That economic weakness has national \nsecurity overtones.\n  In addition, as the distinguished Senator from New Jersey pointed \nout, in addition to Admiral Locklear--and the distinguished Senator \nfrom Hawaii mentioned Admiral Locklear as well, but he is not alone. \nSecretary Mabus, Secretary of the Navy, has pointed out the same thing. \nWe are at risk from global warming from a national security \nperspective. The Joint Chiefs of Staff is on record about the national \nsecurity consequences of climate change to our country. As the Senator \nfrom New Mexico knows from his time on the Intelligence Committee, \nthere are NIEs--National Intelligence Estimates--that speak to the \ndanger climate change presents for America, for our national security \ninterests when it happens in other lands. The Defense\n\n[[Page S1428]]\n\nQuadrennial Review, which is the key document that drives our defense \npolicy, has over and over again emphasized climate change as a national \nsecurity risk, as a liability for our country. So, yes, it is very \nimportant that we deal with this.\n  I had a conversation with Henry Kissinger the other day. He was \nspeaking generally. He used an interesting phrase. He said that the big \nupheavals and revolutions in the world have always come from a \nconfluence of resentment--a confluence of resentment.\n  So I would add to the immediate risk of climate change causing \nupheaval and causing military problems that threaten our national \nsecurity interest the larger problem is that America stands for \nsomething in this world, and we all benefit because America stands for \nsomething in this world, and the rest of the world knows it. If we come \nto the point where around the world people are seeing in their homes, \nin their lives, in their villages, in their hamlets, and on their \nshores the effects of climate change and it is bad for them--the fish \nthey used to catch are not there; the crops they used to grow will not \ngrow any longer; the river they used to irrigate is not running as \nstrong any longer; and their lives have been hurt as a result of that, \nand they look around, what greater resentment could there be than a \nresentment of the country that knew this was coming, that said it was a \nleadership nation, and that did nothing about it when it knew.\n  Now, there is a confluence of resentment around the world. That, too, \ncreates a national security risk for our country.\n  Mr. BOOKER. I appreciate that from the Senator from Rhode Island. I \nhave only been in the Senate for about 4 months. As soon as I made a \ndecision to run for this office, I asked for national security \nbriefings to study hot points in our country. I figured if I was going \nto win this office, New Jersey would expect me to be prepared to serve \nand deal with national security issues.\n  I was amazed that, when I was being briefed by a group of folks who \nfocus on national security issues, a general came up to the briefings \nin New Jersey as well and began to be very intent and intense on \nletting me understand that the military is not waiting for us to figure \nthis out in Congress. They are preparing. He told me about flying \nplanes on biofuels, thinking about the resiliency of our military bases \nhere and abroad. It was amazing to hear this general talk in such \nfierce pragmatism about what we must do to protect the safety and the \nsanctity of our country.\n  But I will tell you this: We are in a bad economy right now. When I \ngo back to New Jersey, I hear people talking to me about jobs. I hear \npeople talking to me about government spending. I hear about the \nstrength of our country.\n  If the Senator from New Mexico would allow me to ask him a question, \nwhat moved me about your remarks--I have to say, again, I am a new \nSenator. But the Presiding Officer and I have both gotten to know the \nSenator from New Mexico. The Senator lives and bleeds New Mexico. Our \nconversations when we are in the cloakroom are amazing. I have learned \nmore about New Mexico than the Jersey boy ever did back in my own \nState. It is amazing the pride with which you talk about your State. I \nhope your constituents understand how much you are about New Mexico \nevery day you are here.\n  What was amazing to me as I listened to you speak was the numbers \nthat rolled off your tongue about the financial impact of climate \nchange on the New Mexico economy. When you started talking about the \nbillions--you emphasized ``b''--spent on fire protection, you mentioned \nthe grievous loss of life of firefighters in Arizona who nobly fought \nfires in New Mexico. You talked about the grievous impact--hundreds of \nmillions of dollars--on industries in your State, and those numbers, to \nme, which fly off the tongue, represent jobs, represent government tax \ndollars which are being used in your State to fight forest fires but \nwhich could be reinvested in the things that rebuild infrastructure, \neducate children, do research.\n  It is an undeniable fact that fires are burning hotter, that \nreservoirs are getting emptier, and that is having a serious impact on \nyour economy, but this is the truth about our country: We are not New \nMexico, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Hawaii; we are the United States of \nAmerica. As much as we might think your economy is insulated from mine, \nthat is not true. When I heard Senator Klobuchar talking about what it \nis doing to crops in her State, that affects food prices in New Jersey. \nWhen I heard the Senator from Maine talking about the lobster industry, \nwe eat lobster in New Jersey as well. We are one integrated economy. \nKing said it so profoundly--that ``injustice anywhere is a threat to \njustice everywhere.''\n  So if the Senator would comment for me a little deeper because I know \nwhen you leave here and go back to your State, you are not looking at \ndata or the statistics, you are talking to people whose lives are not \njust being disrupted by climate change but severely affected, I wonder \nif the Senator could--we have seen lots of data and charts tonight and \nall day, but I was hoping the Senator could speak a little bit more to \nthe grievous financial damage it is doing in our interconnected \neconomy, to the people of your State and thus to the people of America.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. I thank my friend the Senator from New Jersey. These \nissues have such a profound impact on individual people and \ncommunities. When I think back to that Las Conchas fire that I talked \nabout a little bit in my comments, I cannot help but think about Santa \nClara Pueblo. Actually, maybe we can put up this other image too, \nbecause normally the fires lie down at night. That is what they used to \ndo, at least. Here you can see the fire burning north of Los Alamos in \nthe Jemez mountains in the middle of the night. You can imagine, this \nwas sort of a scene from Espanola and Santa Fe across the valley. \nEveryone I talked to at the time had never seen a conflagration in the \nnorthern part of the State quite like it.\n  One community that was particularly impacted and is still recovering \ntoday is Santa Clara Pueblo. They have this incredible, beautiful \ncanyon that is tied to their identity and their religion and who they \nare as a people. Unfortunately, this fire burned the headwaters of that \ncanyon, and that produces the water for their irrigation, as well as \nwith the Rio Grande. It is more than just economics. It is an identity. \nIt is a place that cannot be separated from the community and the \npeople there.\n  The impact of that, unlike a typical disaster we think about, such as \nan earthquake, where you have the disaster and then you have the \nrecovery from the disaster, these fires in these communities happen \nmultiple times. You have the fire, and it is usually in May or June, \nwhich is the driest time of the year in the State of New Mexico. It is \nthe time when the snowpack is long gone and we have not had \nprecipitation, oftentimes in months. Then you get these early lightning \nstrikes that do not actually have rain associated with them.\n  You have the fire. Finally, the fire goes out when the rains come, \nand then you have the thunderstorms that come and flood these \ncommunities and take their farmland and bury it under 6 inches of \ncobble and gravel or a foot of everything but topsoil, so they cannot \nuse it. You have roads literally impassable and infrastructure \ndestroyed, irrigation ditches that have been in place for hundreds of \nyears blown out or filled with sediment so they cannot be used.\n  It happens not just that first year, but until these places recover \nwith some sort of vegetation--I have to say that they are not coming \nback as the same kind of forest in many cases. But as the vegetation \ndoes recover, you finally get a more moderated situation where you do \nnot get those floods.\n  But I just have been too many times now with people at the Pueblos \nNambe across the valley, same situation, different fire. It is touching \neveryone and their communities. It is really a struggle, when we cannot \neven recognize the problem here in Washington, DC, to look at my \nconstituents, you know, and say: Hopefully, through FEMA and other \nmeasures, we can address the emergency. But we have to start addressing \nthe problem.\n  I want to ask the Senator from New Jersey--I mean, your State just \ncame through one of the most unbelievable superstorms in our country's \nrecent\n\n[[Page S1429]]\n\nhistory with Superstorm Sandy. I can only imagine--we have very \ndifferent States. My problem is usually not enough moisture. Oftentimes \nin extreme weather events you have too much. We certainly do not have \ncoastal issues. I would love to hear more about the direct economic \nimpact of what it meant--the Senator from New Jersey is someone who \ncomes to this Chamber with something that I value enormously, which is \nthe experience of governing at the local level where you are close to \nthe people. I was a city councilor. You were a mayor of a huge city. \nYou know what those impacts are to infrastructure and economy and to \nsmall businesses when a storm such as that hits your State. I would \nlove to have a little bit of that perspective because I think it is \nimportant, as this grows and grows and the challenge faces us head-on, \nto understand how it is impacting your constituents and their small \nbusinesses and all of the things you have direct experience with from \nyour local government work.\n  Mr. BOOKER. I am grateful to the Senator from New Mexico for giving \nme this opportunity to say a word about my State. To keep the \nconversation going, if the Senator from Rhode Island would indulge me \nin answering that question, but I would like to get back to the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island.\n  I want to say to the people who are watching this, perhaps on C-SPAN \nor others, the reason why I am so grateful to the Senator from Rhode \nIsland is because I have been here, again, for a little over 4 months. \nBut the Senator from Rhode Island is--and forgive me if this sounds in \nany way disrespectful to say it this way, but I almost think the \nSenator from Rhode Island reminds me of the movie ``Shawshank \nRedemption.'' I say that because one of my favorite moments in \nShawshank was that guy----\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I am just waiting to hear what character I remind the \nSenator of, because this could be for good or it could be for very ill.\n  Mr. BOOKER. No. I am reminded that Morgan Freeman or the main \ncharacter of the movie wanted to get a library for the prison. Frankly, \ntheir strategy was every single day they sent a letter. The reason why \nI have great respect for the Senator from Rhode Island is he has been \nrelentless, to my knowledge, in a way I did not know about before I \ncame to the Senate--but relentlessly and constantly nonstop, not only \none time when we are going for an entire day, but every single week \ngoing to the floor and speaking to this issue, speaking truth to power, \nusing his office to try to not only speak to issues pertaining only to \nhis State, but to speak to issues that relate to our planet, and I have \ngenerated a lot of respect for the Senator in his consistency.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I appreciate that very much.\n  Let me say for the Record I would be Morgan Freeman all day long and \nall night long, for that matter.\n  Mr. BOOKER. The Senator has it. But before I get to my Senate \ncolleague from Rhode Island, allow me for a moment to answer the \nquestion of my colleague because I am grateful that he asked me about \nwhat is happening in New Jersey.\n  We know this, that no storm, no flood, no drought, was caused \nsingularly--no single episode could be said to be caused by climate \nchange. That would be irresponsible and give an opening for those \npeople who choose to criticize those who talk about climate change, \ngive an opening to pounce on that.\n  But we do know, when these extreme weather events happen--and I \nbelieve they are happening more frequently because of climate change--\nwhat we know factually is that when these extreme weather events \nhappen, they become more extreme because of indisputable climate change \nthat is happening.\n  Forest fires, as the Senator said, become more extreme because of a \nwarming climate. We know in New Jersey, and we have seen painfully from \nHurricane Sandy, that when flooding happens it is more extreme and more \nsevere because of rising sea water.\n  We know in New Jersey that the storm had painful effects. Let me put \nit in numbers, and then I want to talk about people.\n  The numbers that affect people so dramatically are powerful. I am \ngoing to read some of them. This is a Rutgers University report that \nrising sea levels, as I mentioned before, mean hurricanes will produce \nmore severe damage such as the damage caused by Hurricane Sandy, more \nfrequent extreme weather events, heat waves. Inland flooding from heavy \nrains present a growing challenge to our New Jersey economy, to the \nenvironment, and to the everyday way of life of New Jerseyans and I say \nto Americans.\n  The images left by Sandy's wakes are seared into the minds of so many \nNew Jerseyans. We saw what happened to some of the most precious parts \nof our State up and down the coast. The State's vulnerability to these \nextremes we see, the storm and its immediate aftermath resulted in 34 \npeople dying in the State of New Jersey, and it cost New Jerseyans an \nestimated $37 billion. The storm, in its entirety, impacted and claimed \nmore than 150 lives and exceeded $50 billion in damage. In New Jersey, \nnearly 7 million people and 1,000 schools lost power. Transit systems \nand streets were completely flooded, damaging our infrastructure. More \nthan 8,000 jobs were lost in the month after the storm.\n  (Mr. WHITEHOUSE assumed the Chair.)\n  There were power interruptions that lasted for days and days, putting \npeople into hardship. As the mayor of a city, I saw that the power \ndisruptions actually cost people lives. There were two people who were \nwithout power in the city of Newark who tried to sustain themselves \nwith artificial heat. It produced carbon monoxide from which they died. \nHurricane Sandy displaced more than 116,000 people and damaged or \ndestroyed 346,000 homes in New Jersey.\n  We have seen in our State these horrific stories and know for a fact \nthat should more hurricanes hit with rising sea levels, they are going \nto do more and more extreme damage.\n  What I wanted to do, in answer to your question, is those were \nnumbers, but the stories that came from Hurricane Sandy rip your gut.\n  This is one story of Christina, a homeowner from Toms River, as \nreported in the Huffington Post. They had evacuated her house before \nHurricane Sandy hit, Christina did, and then returning found a \nmysterious note. The letter was hastily scrawled by a person who had \nbroken into her house and taken a blanket and a black jacket to keep \nhypothermia at bay. The author of the note was sure he was dying.\n  These storms rushed in so quickly and so severely that it put people \nin conditions where life and death happened quickly.\n  I saw them as mayor of Newark. One of the people who died in my city \ndue to Hurricane Sandy was with folks we came to evacuate from Sandy in \na low-lying area east of Newark. I will never forget this because the \ngroup of men said they did not want to leave. They were going to stay \non the higher floor of a structure, but one of them went to move his \ncar at the exact time the water was rushing in so quickly and so fast \nthat he drowned in his car.\n  This story continues. The man identified himself as a 28-year-old man \nnamed Mike and left contact information so that the homeowner could \ncontact his father and tell him he had died.\n  The note reads: Whoever reads this, I am dying. I am a 28-year-old. \nMy name is Mike. I had to break into your house. I took blankets off \nthe couch. I have hypothermia. I didn't take anything. A wave threw me \nout of my house and down the block. I don't think I am going to make \nit. The water is 10-feet deep at least. There is no rescue. Tell my dad \nI love him, and I am trying to get out. His number is--he gives it to \nthe newspaper and his name is Tony.\n  He continues: I hope you can read there in the dark. I took a black \njacket too. God Almighty, help me.\n  The heartbreaking last words of a Hurricane Sandy victim made its \nrounds on social media. In an interview later, Mike told listeners the \nharrowing story of how he was swept out to sea.\n  I wish to give a couple more quick vignettes. This is Theresa, 41, \nMiddlesex County, NJ: Walking out of my house the morning after the \nstorm and seeing my neighbors, it was unreal. It was like a war zone. \nWe were unprepared for what happened.\n  June, 51, Union Beach, NJ: Living through the storm in one of the \nhardest hit bay towns of New Jersey, I\n\n[[Page S1430]]\n\nlearned that God is good. In the midst of the hardship and trauma, I \nsaw His love through average people, people who care enough to smile, \nserve, hug, and weep with me. I saw such compassion in the young and \nold. I saw the best in humanity.\n  This is what should be driving us at the core. The heroism we see at \nthese extreme weather conditions, made worse by climate change, shows \nthe grit of America. It shows our strength and our courage, our \nwillingness to be there for one another in times of crisis.\n  But the point of the matter is we are in a larger crisis right now, \nand that demands we should act. There is an old saying the only thing \nnecessary for evil to triumph is for good people to do nothing. Well, \ngood people in New Jersey did a lot during Hurricane Sandy as our State \nhad billions of dollars of damage to their communities, displaced \npeople who are still not back in their homes. But as we look at rising \nsea levels in and around New Jersey, we know that if future storms hit \nthat the damage as the sea level rises will be increasingly worse. So \nwe have an affirmative obligation to act. That is who we are as \nAmericans. We see that right now in our country there is a crisis. It \nis unmistakable. Every Senator who has spoken tonight has pointed to \ncharts with the facts. We talked earlier about the military recognizing \nwhat is happening. They are active.\n  But of this body, the question will be asked, did this body, when the \nevidence was clear, when the damage was being done, when homeowner \nafter family after neighborhood after farm town after urban area--when \nwe knew the crisis was coming, did we do everything we could to prevent \nthat challenge, that damage, that infliction of economic, emotional, \nphysical pain from coming?\n  I ask the Senator, as I wish to switch back in a second, the cost of \nnot doing anything is great. But the Senator mentioned before the \nbenefit of acting. I thought that was one of the more powerful remarks \nof the Senator. But actually there are rewards for acting, in creating \neconomic activity, in creating jobs, in improving environmental \nconditions, and in saving money.\n  I was wondering if the Senator would highlight some more of that \nintelligent, enlightened action that could actually not be as much of a \nsacrifice as people are talking about at the beginning.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Through the Chair, I thank the Senator from New Jersey \nin particular for sharing those stories, because we need to take some \ninspiration from people all across this country, and certainly in New \nJersey, who have faced up to incredible challenges such as Superstorm \nSandy and shown that when we put our minds to it Americans can \naccomplish just about anything. We need to take that inspiration and \nfind the will in this body to move forward on what we know are the \nfacts and to start to have a conversation about what are the policies \nwe are going to put in place to make sure we do meet that challenge. \nHow are we going to do it in a way that recognizes what the Senator \nfrom New Jersey had said a number of times tonight, that right now \npeople care so much in this country about the fact that we need jobs \nand we need economic development. Even though one can look at the stock \nmarket and say there has been some sort of recovery in this country, \nmost of our constituents will tell us they are not feeling it.\n  We have an opportunity to create a whole new generation of jobs. The \nquestion is are we going to create them in the United States or are we \ngoing to let someone else create them somewhere else in the world.\n  One of the speakers earlier tonight, the Senator from Massachusetts, \nbrought up the incredible innovation that has happened in recent years \nin the auto industry with hybrids, plug-in hybrids, and even electric \nvehicles. Certainly my State is one of the Southwestern States \ncompeting, if you will, to try to get Tesla, a disruptive technology \nmanufacturing company, to possibly put their battery manufacturing \nfacility in the State of New Mexico. They are looking at a number of \nStates in the Southwest, but we think with our combination of two \nnational laboratories, Los Alamos and Sandia, the rail lines that we \nhave in the State, the innovativeness around renewable energy that is \npart of their values, that we offer something unique we hope they will \nlook at as their site and where to put that facility. But think of all \nthe jobs in an industry and a company that a few years ago a few people \nwouldn't have believed in.\n  Mr. BOOKER. I beg the indulgence of the Senator, because I am going \nto put him on the spot. The Senator was talking about Tesla, the \ninnovative company of today. The Senator and I were sharing stories \nearlier, and this goes to the point of the ingenuity of our country. I \nknow some of the people involved in Tesla, and they are so inspiring.\n  But the Senator, years ago, when he was in not quite in high school \nor college----\n  Mr. HEINRICH. College.\n  Mr. BOOKER. College. The Senator got involved in building solar cars \nand racing around our country. To me, that is a tribute to the lessons \nof what you are talking about; that is, No. 1, we are the leader \nglobally in innovation, but we are also one of the leaders globally in \neducation and training and preparing people.\n\n  So this idea--and I see it in schools in Newark and in New Jersey--is \nkids innovating in robotics competitions, kids innovating in sciences, \nkids using technology and using the platforms created by big companies \nto do things that have value and work.\n  So let me put my colleague on the spot. Forget Tesla. Long before we \neven knew what Tesla was, my colleague was doing something with solar \ncars back in college.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Before there was a Tesla, when I was in college in the \nearly 1990s--and this is one of the things that makes me such a strong \nbeliever in innovation and really gives me the optimism to say that we \ncan do just about anything as a country when we set our mind to it--my \nfellow students and I joined the Sun race in 1993. At the college I \nattended, a number of my colleagues who were studying electrical \nengineering--I was studying mechanical engineering, and we had people \nwho were studying material science--we all got together and we designed \nand built a car, a solar car, that we raced across the United States. \nWe raced from Dallas, TX, up to Minneapolis, MN.\n  People were asking us along the way: When are we going to be driving \nsolar cars? That really wasn't quite the point, but it was a great \nopening to say this isn't about having solar cars. We are not going to \nhave solar cars because you need a pretty big car to get enough \nsunlight to do the job. But it is about driving that innovation and \nengaging the best--and we have the best--education system at the \ncollegiate level in the world and putting that to work to make sure we \nare growing the next generation of jobs and the opportunity that \nrepresents.\n  While there are not solar cars riding around in the United States \ntoday, there are now electric cars, and many of the fundamental \ninnovations we made are now showing up throughout the auto industry. In \nfact, one of the things, if you look at how disruptive the Toyota Prius \nwas a few years ago, one of the reasons why it was so efficient was a \nlittle thing called regenerative braking, where when you step on the \nbrakes, instead of all that energy being wasted, the heat through the \nbrakes is turned into electricity and put back in the batteries in the \ncar. Now you are seeing that in hybrids throughout the auto industry. \nThat is something we used in the early 1990s in this contest with our \nsolar car.\n  We had LED lights long before anybody had LED lights in their cars. \nWe were making turn signals and lights on the solar car with LEDs. We \nbuilt our car out of carbon fiber. It kind of looked like an upside-\ndown wing. All of these kinds of innovations are now standard fare. \nThey are things that get used in the American auto industry in cars \nbuilt right here in the United States to make all of our cars more \nefficient and to create some really good jobs along the way.\n  I believe we ought to be able to do that more broadly with clean \nenergy technology to help address some of these climate issues.\n  Mr. BOOKER. I think my colleague's point has been seen in history, \nbefore he and I were even born. We had a President put forth a noble \nambition to make the Moon not a dream but a destination. What he did \nwas he set in motion, by charting a course for America to be first, to \nlead the globe to be the\n\n[[Page S1431]]\n\ninnovators and to go beyond human imagination. It actually affected \neveryone, all the way down to our schools and our classrooms and what \nkids were studying. Generations came up with that, and not only did we \nwin the space race, but it fueled new technologies, new innovations for \nour generation.\n  Think about this. This company in Silicon Valley, I think it was \ncalled Keyhole, looked at the satellite information borne out of the \nspace race. That company was bought by another company called Google, \nand that turned into Google Maps, something my colleague and I probably \nboth have on our phones.\n  So it is amazing when America has this attitude that we are not going \nto put our heads in the sand and deny a new world is upon us; we are \ngoing to lead the country. That has multipliers of collateral benefits \nthat are not anticipated. As mayor, I became not a convert, because I \nknew this was an issue, but I became a zealot about this idea that you \ncould create a multiplier effect of benefits when you talk and innovate \naround making the American Dream a green dream.\n  Let me share this with my colleague. We see in a 2012 report by the \nRockefeller Foundation that it was estimated that more than $279 \nbillion could be invested in retrofitting existing buildings making \nthem more energy efficient. This goes back to the point we were talking \nabout--job creation and leading. This investment, the Rockefeller \nFoundation study found, could yield more than $1 trillion of energy \nsavings over 10 years, reducing United States emissions by as much as \n10 percent. But this is the kicker. This creates energy savings, \nreduces emissions, and creates a healthier environment for cities such \nas Newark and Camden that are on these heat islands that ratchet up \nasthma. So we lower those emissions, lower the heat in those areas, \nwhich has collateral benefits. Here is the one we should be talking \nabout right now while we are coming out of a recession. It could create \nmore than 3.3 million new jobs, direct and indirect, in the U.S. \neconomy.\n  That is just by investing in retrofitting and getting a return on the \ninvestment, with $279 billion, getting a return of $1 trillion in \nenergy savings, and reducing energy costs for families, for \ngovernments. These jobs cannot be outsourced. They are not about \nforeign competition. It is about putting people here to work, and not \nonly do these energy efficiency retrofits utilize local workers, the \nvast majority of the materials used for the retrofits come from where, \nSenator?\n\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Right here at home.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Right here. Energy retrofits are manufactured right here \nin the United States of America. This is the collateral benefit, the \nmultiplier effect we are talking about. Attic insulation, replacement \nwindows, and new furnaces--more than 90 percent of the energy efficient \nmaterials are made in the USA, putting Americans to work, fueling our \neconomy, and making us strong and successful in a multiple of layers.\n  That is all in just one segment of the green economy. I am just \ntalking about retrofitting. Hundreds of thousands of jobs have already \nbeen created, as we both know, in the wind and solar sectors. People \ndon't know, but New Jersey is one of the leaders in the solar industry. \nOnly California does better than we do, and those sectors are still in \ntheir infancy.\n  We can have a healthy environment and a healthy economy. These false \nchoices that people seem to be putting up are simply that: false \nchoices. It is not the tyranny of the ``or;'' it is the liberation of \nthe ``and.'' They are not mutually exclusive.\n  When I was mayor of Newark we took action. Understanding this data \nand these facts, we worked with the building trades, and they created a \nlaborers local, local 55 in my area, that focused on weatherizing \nresidential properties in Newark. We recruited Newark residents who \nwere taught how to perform energy audits and residential retrofits. Our \nresidents had new job opportunities, and our homeowners who \nparticipated in the program saw energy savings.\n  We first did this as a pilot focusing on senior citizen homes in the \nsouth ward of my city, and it was amazing. They were seeing reductions \nin energy costs of 25 percent or more. It was amazing. So we were able \nto save senior citizens money, employ young people from our community, \nand improve our environment, all at the same time.\n  We found this was of value on all the issues. We knew one of the \nissues was just planting trees. We said: Hey, we are going to take \naction by increasing our tree canopy. We brought in private dollars at \nthe neighborhood level through community organizing, and we began the \nprocess of making Newark greener, thus cooler, and making sure that new \ngenerations had opportunities.\n  My colleague and I both know that one of the great definitions of \nleadership is that great leaders are those who plant trees under whose \nshade they will never sit. By our taking action on climate change, we \nwill benefit generations to come, but the truth is--the exciting thing \nfor me--it is going to help us in our economy right now. This is why \nthis doesn't have to be a political issue. It can be one about \npragmatism where left and right can come together.\n  If my colleague will allow me, on that point of left and right coming \ntogether, I want to explain why this should not be a political issue. \nThe opportunities are too great for America not to lead, for us to \nbolster our economy, for us to improve our environment, for us to \nreduce these savage weather anomalies. What inspires me about this is \nthat there are a lot of people--Republicans--who are realizing this is \nnot a Republican-Democratic issue.\n  When forest fires rage in New Mexico, they hurt Republicans, \nDemocrats, and Independents in that State. When droughts hit the \nMidwest, they hurt the farms of Republicans, Democrats, and \nIndependents. When the lobster industry suffers in Maine or scallops in \nCape May, this affects all of us. If my colleague will allow me, and \nthen I would love to get his comments on this afterwards, I love this \neditorial, and I think it is worthy of reading into the record right \nnow. The writers are former Administrators of the EPA. Listen to this. \nThis was written by Lee Thomas and William Kelly and this incredible \nwoman from New Jersey named Christie Todd Whitman. She was our \ngovernor. She came and joined the Bush administration. These are heads \nof the EPA, people who had to deal with the facts, the pragmatism, \nevery single day. Their job was to analyze what was going on around the \ncountry, and they wrote a letter, and I think it is worthy of reading, \nif the Senator will indulge me.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Please do.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Thank you. They say:\n\n       We served Republican presidents, but we have a message that \n     transcends political affiliation: the United States must move \n     now on substantive steps to curb climate change at home and \n     internationally.\n\n  I'm telling you right now, and my colleague knows this, when we lead, \nother nations follow.\n  The letter continues:\n\n       There is no longer any credible scientific debate about the \n     basic facts: our world continues to warm, with the last \n     decade the hottest in modern records, and the deep ocean \n     warming faster than the earth's atmosphere. Sea level is \n     rising. Arctic ice is melting years faster than projected. \n     The costs of inaction are undeniable. The lines of scientific \n     evidence grow only stronger and more numerous. And the window \n     of time remaining to act is growing smaller: delay could mean \n     that warming becomes ``locked in.''\n\n  I know my colleague and I both believe in the free market.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Absolutely.\n  Mr. BOOKER. But we know we see businesses now that are internalizing \nprofits and externalizing costs. I see this in New Jersey. We are \ncleaning up the Passaic River, and it is costing taxpayer dollars. When \nwe hear complaints about high taxes, it is going to this kind of \nstuff--cleaning up the Passaic River because corporations and \nbusinesses are dumping pollutants in there and do not internalize the \ncost. They said: Some future generation is going to pay for it. We are \nthat future generation.\n  So getting back to this--because I love the free market--I want \npeople who externalize the cost to internalize it. If you are polluting \nthe air and hurting the planet, you need to pay for that.\n  A market-based approach like carbon tax would be the best path to \nreducing greenhouse gas emissions, but that is unachievable in the \ncurrent political gridlock in Washington. Dealing with this political \nreality, President\n\n[[Page S1432]]\n\nObama's June Climate Action Plan lays out achievable actions that would \ndeliver real progress. This is amazing to me. Four Republicans who \nserved under Republican Presidents as heads of the EPA are saying \nPresident Obama's June Climate Action Plan lays out achievable actions \nthat would deliver real progress.\n  The President also plans to use his regulatory power to limit the \npowerful warming chemicals called hydrofluorocarbons. People \nunderstandably don't like overregulation, but the reality is that if \nthis is being released as pollutants into the air, we should be doing \nsomething about it.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. If the Senator would yield, we have heard time and time \nagain that when we allowed the market to innovate and deal with these \nsame kinds of challenges--whether it is NOX and SOx or other \npollutants we have been able to address in the past; whether it is the \nhole in the ozone layer--I mean, talk about a global issue of \npollution--the market was able to solve those.\n  Mr. BOOKER. I don't mean to question the Senator's integrity, but I \njust don't know if he was alive at the time.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. I think I read it in a book somewhere.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Allow me to continue because the Senator is absolutely \nright. I heard some incredible examples from other Senators talking \nabout things we did. I love the story by the Senator from Maine about \nthe pull-top cans.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. It reminded me of growing up as I did. My mother worked \nin the auto industry, and there was a time when we had a great debate. \nMy grandfather complained based on something he heard on the radio \nabout these catalytic converters which were going to ruin the American \nauto industry.\n  What happened is when we decided to clean up emissions from the auto \nindustry, we actually created an entire new industry around catalytic \nconverters, which for many years afterward was an export industry for \nthe United States. Since we took the first step, none of the other \ncountries understood the technology well and could manufacture it well. \nSo as the rest of the world followed our lead to clean up their \npollution, they were importing our catalytic converters.\n  We can look at example after example where this has been the case. \nWhen we allow the market to innovate, we can solve the most challenging \npollution problems.\n  Mr. BOOKER. I love that. Never bet against America's ability to \ninnovate, to be resilient, to be industrious.\n  So I continue on this editorial written by four past Republican EPA \nAdministrators:\n\n       The president also plans to use his regulatory power to \n     limit the powerful warming chemicals known as \n     hydrofluorocarbons and encourage the United States to join \n     with other nations to amend the Montreal Protocol to phase \n     out these chemicals. The landmark international treaty, which \n     took effect in 1989, already has been hugely successful in \n     solving the ozone problem.\n       Rather than argue against his proposals, our leaders in \n     Congress should endorse them and start the overdue debate \n     about what bigger steps are needed and how to achieve them--\n     domestically and internationally.\n       As administrators of the E.P.A. under Presidents Richard M. \n     Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George Bush, and George W. Bush, we \n     held fast to the common-sense conservative principles--\n     protecting the health of the American people, working with \n     the best technology available and trusting in the innovation \n     of American business and in the market to find the best \n     results for the least cost.\n\n  Highlighting the Senator's words.\n\n       That approach helped us tackle major environmental \n     challenges to our nation and the world: the pollution of our \n     rivers, dramatized when the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland \n     caught fire in 1969; the hole in the ozone layer; and the \n     devastation wrought by acid rain.\n\n  These are all points just made by the Senator from New Mexico.\n  They continue:\n\n       The solutions we supported worked----\n\n  Government acted. They worked----\n\n     although more must be done. Our rivers no longer burn, and \n     their health continues to improve. The United States led the \n     world when nations came together to phase out ozone-depleting \n     chemicals. Acid rain diminishes each year, thanks to a \n     pioneering, market-based emissions-trading system adopted \n     under the first President Bush in 1990. And despite critics' \n     warnings, our economy continued to grow.\n       Climate change puts all our progress and our successes at \n     risk.\n\n  It says what the Senator and so many others have said: Climate change \nputs all of our successes and our communities--like Toms River, like \nCape May County--at risk.\n\n       If we could articulate one framework for successful \n     governance, perhaps it should be this: When confronted by a \n     problem, deal with it. Look at the facts, cut through the \n     extraneous, devise a workable solution and get it done.\n       We can have both a strong economy and a liveable climate. \n     All parties know that we need both. The rest of the \n     discussion is either detail, which we can resolve, or \n     purposeful delay, which we should not tolerate.\n       Mr. Obama's plan is just a start. More will be required. \n     But we must continue efforts to reduce the climate-altering \n     pollutants that threaten our planet. The only uncertainty \n     about our warming world is how bad the changes will get and \n     how soon. What is most clear is that there is no time to \n     waste.\n\n  Republicans who echoed to me these words--and I know the Senator \nknows who wrote them, but I will read them first and cite them later. \nWe heard four Republicans speaking today echoing the words of someone \nwho wrote in the 1960s:\n\n       We are now faced with the fact, my friends, that tomorrow \n     is today. We are confronted with the fierce urgency of now. \n     In this unfolding conundrum of life and history, there ``is'' \n     such a thing as being too late. Procrastination is still the \n     thief of time. Life often leaves us standing bare, naked, and \n     dejected with a lost opportunity. The tide in the affairs of \n     men does not remain at flood--it ebbs. We may cry out \n     desperately for time to pause in her passage, but time is \n     adamant to every plea and rushes on. Over the bleached bones \n     and jumbled residues of numerous civilizations are written \n     the pathetic words, ``Too late.''\n\n  As the Senator obviously knows, those are the words of Martin Luther \nKing.\n  I know for the people in New Jersey, who stand with the \nunderstandable anguish of a State still recovering from Hurricane \nSandy, that should the sea levels continue to rise in the coming years, \nwe know cities such as Atlantic City and others could see not hundred-\nyear floods but ten-year floods, which will severally damage those \ncities' ability to continue as we know them today. For my State, there \ncan be no ``too late.'' We must act now. And the Senator sees that \nurgency as well in New Mexico.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. I do. And I think it is worth noting that when we speak \nabout the four Republican Administrators of the EPA, they have all \nlooked at the history of this argument and how it really reflects on a \nconversation we have had since the 1960s--and I think the Senator put \nit so eloquently--that it is not about jobs or quality of life; it has \nto be about both.\n  Those Republican Administrators of the EPA have watched as the Clean \nWater Act and the Clean Air Act and the work done on the Montreal \nProtocol--all those debates were fundamentally identical to this one. \nPeople said that this was going to cost too much, that we were going to \nlose jobs if we made these decisions to clean up our environment. And \nwhat happened? If we look back at 1980 and today and the policy changes \nmade, we have a GDP twice as big as what we had in 1980. We have \ndoubled our country's economic output at the same time we have cleaned \nup our air and water and said we are going to have the cleanest country \nin the world. We are not going to be like China, where kids walking to \nschool have to wear masks and can't play outside.\n  When we think about young people in this country, the thing that \nalways strikes me is that when we talk about climate change and when I \ngo home, people are concerned about impacts and the things we talked \nabout before--not the fact that forest fires are happening but that \nthey are happening too often and with such extreme fire behavior now; \nthe fact that drought is getting to be the norm, not the exception. But \nkids understand this issue, young people understand this issue in a way \nthat calls out for action. I think that is why it is so important that \nwe are doing this tonight, to send a message that we are hearing that \nbecause when I talk to high school students or kids in junior high or \nat college campuses, they understand they are inheriting all the weight \nof inaction.\n  I remember as a kid hearing explanations of how the greenhouse effect \nworks and what this is going to do long term. Here we are close to 35 \nyears later, and we are seeing the impacts.\n\n[[Page S1433]]\n\nOur kids and our grandkids are going to see impacts a whole lot more \nextreme than even what our constituents have already shouldered. We \ncan't wait anymore. We have a moral obligation. We can argue about what \nthe best way to address these challenges is and we should. We should \nfind a way to address these challenges that gets the buy-in of a \nmajority of this deliberative body. But we can't step aside any longer \nand say we are not going to act. That would be irresponsible.\n  Mr. BOOKER. I will ask the Senator about some of the vulnerable \ncommunities in his State, but I will go about it this way. I have such \ngreat memories of my father and grandfather, both of whom passed away. \nProbably the first time I passed through the Senator's State was in a \nmobile home, in which my grandfather took us and drove us across the \ncountry. I saw America, north and south. We did that a number of times. \nI remember standing with him and looking at Mount Rushmore. My \ngrandfather had a great sense of humor, and if he didn't know a \nhistorical fact, he would just make it up. But he taught us to \nappreciate and love this country. My father was the same way. He grew \nup in the mountains of North Carolina and took me there as a little boy \nand with such pride showed me mountains and lakes, and I fell in love. \nMy mom also took me around New Jersey to some of our great parks and \nhiking the Palisades of New Jersey. I have incredible memories of the \nJersey Shore and walking the boardwalk with my hand in my parents' \nhands. All these memories are so great. My father had this story that I \nthink makes this point about tonight. One of the slogans for tonight is \n``Wake Up.''\n\n  My father tells a story about a guy walking along and sees a porch, a \nman sitting in a rocking chair, and this hound dog sitting next to him. \nThe hound dog is just howling away like he was in great pain. The man \nsays, ``What is wrong with your dog? Why is he howling so much?''\n  And the man says, ``Well, he's sitting on a nail.''\n  And the other man says, ``Why doesn't he get up?''\n  And the man says, ``Because he's not hurting bad enough yet.''\n  I tell you, the story used to always get me because my father used to \nalways say: Son, get up. Do not tolerate bad. You are better than that. \nDo not just lie there.\n  I think about our country and know our history.\n  You and I have been talking about our history. You and I were born in \nan amazing generation. We were born after the dawn of the civil rights \nmovement, born after going to the Moon. So much we are talking about \ntonight is the history of our elders who did give to us a country of \nunbridled possibilities. We are America, but we are hurt. We are hurt, \nand we represent communities that feel all this pain.\n  This is the point I wish to make. I heard Senator Landrieu from \nLouisiana in the debate about flood insurance and how these waters are \nrising. These are becoming more severe problems. I heard some of my \nNortheastern colleagues talk about the erosion, how we are losing acres \nand acres every year with rising sea levels. One of the times I got \nvery moved listening to Senator Landrieu talk was when she was reacting \nto people who say this is about people who have lost their vacation \nhome. I heard this in New Jersey as well. What bothered me about that \nis what many folks do not realize is the pain of climate change often \naffects the most vulnerable Americans most--the poorest people.\n  She was talking about those people who make a living, scratch out a \nliving in her State, whose livelihoods--who really have not that many \nother choices. I was in Cape May County talking to these fishermen and \nlistening to the kind of tough jobs they have. These aren't people who \nare millionaires. They go out there. Talk about an honest day's work. I \nhave to say I am a northern New Jersey boy, listening to these men talk \nabout the toils of pulling from the sea. Cape May is one of the most \nproductive areas to bring in the sea's bounty in our country. They say \nit is No. 4.\n  To hear them talk about their jobs--but their fear, their worry in \ntheir eyes that with the warming waters their catch is moving north. \nThey are getting less out of the sea. I know this as a former mayor of \nNewark. I see this when I go to my schools and talk to my school \nnurses, and they use the word ``epidemic'' with asthma, seeing the \nwarming climate, what it is doing to the lung development on these \nchildren.\n  I know from Sandy that when a storm like that hits, everybody assumes \nwhy not get in the car, drive someplace, stay in a hotel. Many people, \nNo. 1, do not have cars, cannot just pull out of their pocket a couple \nhundred bucks to stay in a nice hotel for 1 month or 2 months. When \nthey lose their home, they lose everything, and then when they come \nback, they are told they have to build in a certain way. So this is \nsomething that affects us all.\n  As King said, to quote him again in the letters from the Birmingham \njail:\n\n       We are all part of an inescapable network of mutuality, \n     tied in a common garment of destiny.\n\n  In America there is no rich destiny and poor destiny. There is no \nRepublican destiny and Democratic destiny. There is no Black destiny \nand White destiny. We have one destiny here. But the truth is, in this \ncountry, the people who are most immediately impacted by this growing \nproblem are these vulnerable populations. We have to talk more about \nthose folks. They cannot hire lobbyists to come down here. They do not \nrepresent some industry we give tax breaks to but folks who cannot \nengage in expensive fundraisers. The Senator from New Mexico has a \nState--and again, the goodness you have done to educate me. I hope I \nhave done as good a job educating my friend about New Jersey, and he is \nwelcome to come to our State.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. I am learning everyday, but I am looking forward to \nvisiting too.\n  Mr. BOOKER. My colleague from New Mexico represents everything from \nNative American peoples to a very diverse State. I am wondering if he \ncould talk for a moment about the urgency he sees of this problem for \nthe more vulnerable populations who are becoming--the situation they \nare in right now is becoming much more dire and should call to the \nconsciousness of our country and should challenge our morality as a \npeople, should expand our moral imagination about what we can and \nshould do and must do.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. I think the Senator has hit the nail on the head when \nhe said that those among us with the least economic means often bear \nthe highest cost.\n  That is certainly true in New Mexico. We have enormous economic \nchallenges. We have communities where people cannot afford to get up \nand move because the climate situation changed. We have literally \ncities where wells are dry and there is no water. Reservoirs run dry, \nand there is no water. Las Vegas has come within--Las Vegas and New \nMexico has come within a month or two, several times now, of their \nreservoir literally going dry. A town such as Magdalena, NM. Their well \nlost water to the town for a number of weeks and they had to come up \nwith a plan for how to deal with that and diversify their water supply \nagain at huge costs to local residents and the State.\n  These are real challenges being borne by people who do not have \ndiscretionary income to be throwing at these challenges. We have people \nwho live a very traditional lifestyle, who are living in these forests. \nWhen there are wildfires, they are the first to bear the economic brunt \nof that.\n  We see the impact drought has had. The Senator mentioned fishing off \nthe coast of New Jersey. That is kind of how many of our traditional \ncommunities view mule deer and elk and wild game that have always \ncalled New Mexico home. We see direct impacts to our rival population \nwhen people--when the mule deer population crashes or there is a fire \nthat literally you cannot hunt in the same places because this year it \nis closed due to the damage by fire and they are not letting anyone in.\n  There are people who rely on that activity to literally get them \nthrough the winter. Those impacts are always felt by the people who \nhave the least need to be in control of that situation, and that is an \nenormous challenge. We should do a better job of illustrating some of \nthose stories and making sure we make clear what the impacts are to the \npeople who have the least means.\n\n[[Page S1434]]\n\nThey cannot stay in a hotel simply because there is an extreme weather \nevent on the coast of New Jersey or there is a fire in New Mexico.\n  There are many of my constituents who could not afford to stay in a \nhotel, and they are the ones bearing the brunt of the challenges. \nTraditional farming communities that used to be able to grow, they are \ncut off from the irrigation season. If they get cut off from water \nhalfway to a crop that produces--some sort of production that is not \nlike growing grass or alfalfa, but they literally cut off the water \nbefore their crop comes in, they lose it all. Even if they got to 90 \npercent but didn't quite get to where their crop actually produces, \nthey can lose it all. It is those kinds of impacts my constituents feel \nwhen we have some of these extreme weather events.\n  Mr. BOOKER. I guess what makes me emotional, I have to say, is I do \nnot need to imagine what the future will be like because I have seen it \nin the urban area I have represented for the last 7-plus years. Let me \ngo a little bit deeper into what I mean.\n  We wanted to do urban gardening. We were told by environmental \nregulators in our State that we couldn't dig into our soil because the \nsoil in my city was toxic. Not one of my residents did it, not the \nfolks who had been living there for generations. It is toxic because \nfolks put things in the soil.\n  We have the biggest urban gardening city, Newark, NJ, but they are \nplanting in beds above ground. I already talked to you about the air \nquality. This is why so many cities in New Jersey now are working very \nhard--and I am proud--on two items, and one of them is we have epidemic \nasthma rates. Go to urban places around the country and you will see \nthat. Now we are separated from the air, separated from the soil. Go to \nyour river. It used to be, if you were poor, you could just go to the \nriver and get some shellfish. Go fishing, eat a meal. But somebody took \nthat away, and now you cannot do that. Now you have to find money and \nsee if you can buy something from the store that nature used to provide \nin the safe river. So you are separated from your water. So the \ncollateral damage all through the populations, I do not have to see \nwhat it is going to be, I see it now.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. You see it now.\n  Mr. BOOKER. There is wisdom in my community. There is still wisdom. \nIf you will, allow me to share a story with you.\n  I have learned my best lessons in life from some of the humblest \nfolks who have this wisdom. There is something about the DNA of human \nbeings that knows we have to respect the environment that gives us \neverything. We are a people that used to be an agrarian society.\n  In my city there is a gentleman. I talked about this gentleman in the \nState of the City Address once who was living in a high-rise building \nacross the street from a lot. It was fenced in by some iron, but the \niron had given way, so it was full of debris and junk. There were some \nguys who dealt drugs out there. People looked at that as an area you \njust do not go to. This guy got a stimulus check in the mail. You were \nsaying before how expensive it is. James Baldwin, the great American \nauthor, said something about is very expensive to be poor. But I also \nfind there are those who have the least who are the most generous to \nothers.\n  This retired State worker, instead of just saying, great, I got a \ncheck in the mail--he didn't do that--he said: I am going to use this \ncheck. So he went and bought a lawnmower, a rake, and gardening \nmaterials. He went into the lot the drug dealers were using--the \nelderly man goes into the lot and he tended to the earth; cleaned it \nup, mowed the lawn, a little bit every day. He didn't do it all at \nonce.\n  First, people were worried about it. The drug dealers didn't pay him \nany mind. He tended to the earth. Before he knew it he became a hero in \nhis building, not just because that lot became more beautiful than the \nWhite House lawn down the road but because after he made it look so \nbeautiful, what happened to the drug dealers? They left. They left that \nspot.\n  I heard about this gentleman. I went to visit him in his building, \nand it was just to me this amazing story of the pride people have, of \nthe desire they have to take care of their community.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. The amazing thing is that in our conversations we have \nsort of educated each other on these two States that are kind of close \nto each other in the alphabet----\n  Mr. BOOKER. Right.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. But miles and miles apart. New Jersey has a coastline. \nNew Mexico does not have anything resembling an ocean anywhere near us. \nOur States have incredibly different histories and yet so many of the \nsame kinds of issues. I think another State that could have a different \nset of issues, yet many of the same threads run through it, is \nobviously the State of Hawaii. Our colleague Senator Schatz of Hawaii \ntook it upon himself to help organize this. I have been amazed at the \nthings that my home State of New Mexico has in common with the State of \nHawaii. I wonder if the Senator would maybe spend a little time talking \nabout what with regard to his constituents inspires him when the \nSenator sees how they are stepping up and doing what we need to do in \nthe Senate, recognizing there is a problem that we as a nation or at \nleast in our communities have the potential to solve.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Can we pause for station identification in the sense that \nthe Senator from Hawaii is really the ring leader, so to speak, in \nbringing us together in almost a 24-hour period. The Senator has done a \ngreat job of pulling our colleagues together. There have been a little \nmore than two dozen Senators who have come to the floor.\n  I thank my friend from Hawaii for his extraordinary leadership on \nbringing this issue to the floor. He has spoken so eloquently about \nHawaii and the impact of the severe weather changes. I am very much \nlooking forward to hearing that now.\n  I do want to say that right after I turned 17 and got my New Jersey \ndriver's license, one of the earliest places where I drove was on a \ntrip to Hawaii--the only trip I had ever taken--and I found it to be an \nextraordinary State.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. The Senator didn't drive to Hawaii.\n  Mr. BOOKER. I did not drive to Hawaii. I thank the Senator from New \nMexico for that clarification. I appreciate that for the Congressional \nRecord.\n  I do want to say that Hawaii was a paradise, except that it lacked \nsome fundamental things. For one, it lacked a good Jersey diner. In a \nfuture career, the Senator might want to open a diner. It would be so \nsuccessful there.\n  Please, Senator, go ahead.\n  (Mr. HEINRICH assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. SCHATZ. I thank the Senator from New Jersey and the Senator from \nNew Mexico for such an energetic discussion at this earlier or late \nhour, depending on how you define it. It is nearing bedtime in my home \nState, but for the rest of us across the Nation, many of us are asleep. \nBut we are up for climate. The hashtag is up4climate, and we encourage \nyou to jump on that hashtag.\n  I thank both of the Senators for participating in that discussion.\n  I spent a fair amount of time on the Senate floor today talking about \nhow serious, how dire, and how real climate change is. But I think it \nis important--and consistent with what Senator Kaine from Virginia and \nSenators Booker and Heinrich have talked about--to talk about the \nopportunity for American leadership in economic and technological \ninnovation. There are such incredible opportunities for our country in \ninnovation that it is really worth drilling down and talking about the \ndetails.\n  First, let's talk about battery storage. One of the challenges in the \nState of Hawaii is this. We have abundant wind and solar energy. We are \nthe most isolated populated place on the planet. We still burn 85 \npercent of our energy as low-sulfur fuel oil. In other words, we import \noil and burn it for electricity, which at this point in time is really \nunheard of and overly expensive. Three to four times the national \naverage is what we pay for our electricity. It is really hurting us in \nthe pocketbooks, and so we are adopting solar and wind and other clean-\nenergy resources as fast as we possibly can.\n  The challenge with a grid system that is island by island is this. \nWhen you need the energy, you need the energy. If the sun is not \nshining, and it is the evening time, or if the wind is not blowing, you \nneed either dispatchable power or some other kind of reliable\n\n[[Page S1435]]\n\npower. The breakthroughs with battery storage that are being driven by \nthis new clean-energy economy in the State of Hawaii is really \nextraordinary.\n  The technicians that have run the utility companies for many years \nused to think that the maximum penetration of renewable energy on to \nthe grid--a grid like Hawaii--ought to be around 15 percent. Well, we \nblew through 15 percent in parts of our grid 3 or 4 years ago. There \nare parts of our grid that are in the high 20s to low 30s. We are on \nthe leading edge of all of this.\n  The good news is that on the utility side--in terms of battery \nstorage--the consumer side, and the power-producer side, we are making \ntremendous breakthroughs in battery storage. That brings us to this \noverall question of the smart grid.\n  The smart grid means a lot of things to a lot of people. It means \nincreasing the resilience of our infrastructure in the case of either a \nmanmade or a natural disaster. It means making sure we are not wasting \nenergy by curtailing power. What is curtailing power? It basically \nmeans that sometimes there is clean energy coming onto the grid that \ncannot be used. Because battery storage is still overly expensive, \nthere is no way to store that energy.\n  Although the wind might be blowing on the island of Maui--sometimes \nthe wind is blowing and the turbines are turning, but we can't utilize \nthat power because we don't have a smart enough grid. So what we are \ndoing is attracting investment from all over the planet to develop a \nsmart grid.\n  We have a partnership in Maui County and with the State of Hawaii \nwith the Hitachi Corporation and the Japanese government. They are \ninvesting tens of millions of dollars in little Maui County to better \nunderstand how to integrate large-scale penetration of renewable energy \ninto a relatively small grid.\n  There is a new area that I am learning about where we are really \ninnovating in the State of Hawaii, and that is aerodynamics and \nhydrodynamics. Unlike the Presiding Officer, I do not have a background \nin engineering, but I understand aerodynamics and hydrodynamics in the \nfollowing way: It is basically trying to get things to move through \nwater or air as efficiently as possible. This has tremendous \nimplications.\n  As you can imagine, the Air Force is very interested in aerodynamics \nbecause fuel costs are really out of control for all branches of the \nservice, but in particular in the Air Force and the Navy. The Navy is \nalso looking at hydrodynamics to try to figure out how their ships and \nother vessels can move through the water as efficiently as possible, \nand again, not for conservation reasons. It is not because they are so \ninterested in the climate, but because they want to save money on fuel. \nSo we are making really good progress in aerodynamics and \nhydrodynamics.\n  We have a company that has a test case where they think they can \nincrease the productivity of a wind turbine by 15 to 25 percent. What \nwould that mean? If they can actually prove this technology out, every \nexisting wind farm--if they just swapped out the turbines--could be 15 \nto 25 percent more productive for the grid. That means no additional \nsiting and no additional permitting. If we could simply swap out new \nwind turbines, we could see a massive new increment of clean energy \nonto the grid.\n  Solar energy is another area that is exploding all across the \ncountry. I was talking to somebody who was working in the Capitol \nRotunda as we were doing a live television show this afternoon. He was \ntelling me how he just got solar energy, and that is happening all \nacross the country. Solar is just absolutely going crazy in the State \nof Hawaii. With costs of 38 to 40 cents a kilowatt, solar energy makes \na lot of sense for everybody.\n  We are doing utility scale solar, but we are also doing distributed \nsolar because people want to get their own savings. They want to \nparticipate in a clean-energy economy, but speaking practically--this \nis not ideological, this is not political, this is a pocketbook thing--\nthey are doing the math. These people are not Democrats or Liberals or \nIndependents. They don't wake up every morning--like many of us--\nthinking about how to solve this problem. They are looking at their own \nbottom line and saying solar makes sense.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SCHATZ. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Michael Brune, who is the head of the Sierra Club, \ncame in to see a number of Senators the other day. He told an \ninteresting story that lines up with what Senator Schatz said about how \nsolar is a pocketbook issue and not a political issue.\n  This story involves Atlanta, GA, which is not exactly a hotbed of \nliberal sentiment. In Atlanta, the cost of solar on a residential \nrooftop--the cost of putting a solar panel on your home--has now \nleveled out with the cost of electricity at the plug in your home. As a \nresult, residential installations of solar energy started to boom.\n  Now, for economic reasons, the fossil fuel polluters were against \nthat, and so the Koch brothers and the polluters got behind this group \ncalled ALEC, the American Legislative Exchange Council, which is \nbasically a front group for them. They tried to put through a tax on \nrooftop solar installations so that if you put a solar panel on your \nroof, you would get taxed for it because they didn't like the fact that \nsolar had actually caught up to polluting fossil fuel power at the \nplug.\n  Who came together to fight that tax? The Sierra Club and the tea \nparty. The Sierra Club and the tea party worked together to beat that \ntax and to beat ALEC and to beat the Koch brothers and the polluters \nback on that. Again, if you have the Sierra Club and the tea party \npulling side by side, you know it is not ideology. You know at that \npoint it is a pocketbook issue, and that people are starting to see \nsavings from putting solar on their own home and they don't want \nanybody to interfere with that. That is a story that is a long way from \nHawaii, but it helps to illustrate that point.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. I thank the Senator. Although the tea party is in the \nState of Hawaii, they are not as strong there as they are in other \nplaces across the country. We do have a strong strain of conservatives \nacross the State of Hawaii who want to get off the grid or at least \nwant to participate in the clean-energy economy, and it has to do with \nthe very simple fact that we pay 38 cents a kilowatt hour for the \nprivilege of burning low-sulfur oil for electricity. That is not a \nleft-right issue. That is a ``this makes no sense'' issue.\n  We are one of the very few States where we have a good bipartisan \nconsensus. We have been moving forward with our clean-energy initiative \npreviously under a Republican Governor with the participation of the \nRepublicans in our legislature, with our Chamber of Commerce, with our \nbusiness roundtable, with our tourism industry, with our Department of \nDefense. It is exactly what the Senator from Rhode Island has been \ntalking about. It is about doing what makes sense rather than \nsubscribing to any particular political ideology.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. It is interesting that my friend should mention his \nChamber of Commerce. In Rhode Island, we too are seeing very active \nparticipation by our local Chambers of Commerce in green, solar, \nalternative energy, energy efficiency, and other such endeavors. They \nsee it is a pocketbook issue. They see it makes sense.\n  It is a stark comparison with the so-called U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce--the national organization--which tends to represent the \nmultinational corporations which have very little, if any, allegiance \nto this country and the big polluters. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has \nbeen an absolute menace in terms of any responsible dealings with \nclimate change. But as soon as you get away from the so-called U.S. \nChamber of Commerce--the multinational Chamber of Commerce is what it \nshould probably be called--and get down to these Chambers of Commerce \nthat are grounded with our States, grounded with local businesses, \ngrounded in commonsense, you immediately see that they step right up \nand want to be a part of this solution.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we be given \npermission to engage in a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Booker). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. One of the things I would like to add is a specific \ntechnology that is happening that is trying to be developed in the \nState of Hawaii\n\n[[Page S1436]]\n\nand which is a perfect example of the kind of partnership between the \nclean-energy industry and some of the more traditional companies. It is \ncalled seawater air conditioning. Even with my nonengineering \nbackground, I can understand it. It is cold water from deep within the \nocean that cools air conditioning systems.\n  Rather than using electricity to try to cool water and cool air and \nblow it through, you just grab the cold water and put it into the pipes \nand it cools systems. This makes perfect sense for Waikiki and for the \nphysical plant of Waikiki as well as our millions and millions of \nvisitors and our thousands and thousands of hotel rooms and our 38-cent \nkilowatt costs.\n  One of the highest cost drivers--more than labor and more than our \nphysical plant--is the cost of energy for the Waikiki hotels. We \nbelieve that having a private sector company--one that is trying to \nbuild a seawater air conditioning system which would be environmentally \nconscious--move into Waikiki can literally save 40 percent for all \nWaikiki hotels. This is an extraordinary opportunity.\n\n  The Sheraton and the Royal Hawaiian and the Hilton Hawaiian Village \nand the Queen Kapiolani Hotel, and all of these wonderful hotels, I \nknow their GMs, I know the work they do, I know their employees, and \nthey are all doing great work. But they are not interested in sea water \nair-conditioning necessarily because of its environmental benefits. \nThey are looking to save 40 percent on their electricity bill and that \nit just makes sense. That is what this is all about.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Let me mention one thing. The Senator from Hawaii was \ngood enough to mention that our hashtag tonight is up4climate, with the \n``4'' being a numeral, so up numeral 4 climate. There was a remark made \nearlier that we are just going to be up late at night talking to \nourselves and that nobody is going to be paying attention. The reports \nI have are that the League of Conservation Voters is tracking this with \na Web site and 70,000 people have gone to their Web site to support us \nin our effort tonight. 350.org has 15,000 people who have gone to their \nWeb site to support us. Our own Web site has 40,000 people, for a total \nof 120,000 signatories just on these Web sites. We also have people who \nhave been going out on Twitter on this. We have people such as Leader \nPelosi from the other side of the Capitol. They are locked down hard by \nthe polluters over in the House right now. Nevertheless, Leader Pelosi \nwanted her voice to be heard, and so she has tweeted out and put out a \nrelease about this. OFA has tweeted out about what we are doing \ntonight, and they reach 42 million people.\n  So if anybody thinks nobody is listening to what is going on tonight, \nwrong. Millions of people are following this on Twitter, have been \nnotified about it on Twitter, and literally over 100,000 people have \njoined these Web sites with more to come, I hope.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. I wish to ask the Senator from Rhode Island to give us a \nlittle bit of context. The Presiding Officer and I are new to the \nSenate. I think it is important to understand tonight in context.\n  From my perspective, having 30 Senators on the floor, to take the \nfloor for about 15 consecutive hours to speak about one topic, with the \nemphasis, with the clarity, with the unanimity of this group, 28 \nDemocrats and 2 Independents, is significant. It is historically \nimportant. But I am wondering whether the Senator from Rhode Island can \ngive us a little context and let us know what has happened in the past \nand how he views tonight in the arc of our efforts to take action on \nclimate.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I think this is an important turning point, an \nimportant launch point for the final phase of getting to responsible \nclimate legislation. We were so close. We were heartbreakingly close \nwhen the House passed Waxman-Markey and in the Senate we failed to \nbring up any bill that could have gone to conference. We just failed to \ndo it.\n  There was a period after that when the White House would barely \nmention climate change. It was deeply discouraging for people across \nthe country to see the Senate fail that way and the White House retreat \nthat way, but that has changed. The White House is back. The President \nis reengaged. He has announced a very strong climate action plan that \nhas as a critical element putting some regulation on the big \npowerplants that are doing so much of the polluting. By the way, when I \nsay big powerplants that are doing so much of the polluting, I mean 50 \ntop polluting powerplants in this country put out more carbon than \nKorea, which is a very industrialized country, put out more carbon than \nCanada. That is just the top 50 polluting powerplants.\n  So that was a big shift when the White House did that, and this \nsignals a shift that is coming to the Senate. The next big shift we \nneed to get to is one where this line in the Senate, marking Democrat \nfrom Republican, is not such a harsh line on this issue. There is no \nneed for it to be. This has in the past been a bipartisan issue.\n  Senator Lieberman on our side and Senator Warner on the Republican \nside did one of the early climate bills. This is an issue where \nRepublican candidates for President who served here still campaigned \nfor President on the issue of climate change. There is a Member on the \nother side of the aisle who was the original cosponsor of a climate fee \nbill. There are Republican Members who when they were in the House \nvoted for Waxman-Markey. There are a number of Republican Senators who \nhave publicly said they think a carbon tax or a carbon fee is a \nsensible idea or is an idea they would support under the right \ncircumstances.\n  So there is a great opportunity to reach out to colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle. Once we get past people who are elected \npolitically, we see Republicans in abundance supporting doing something \nabout climate.\n  The Presiding Officer, the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, \ndiscussed earlier the Republican former EPA Administrators who came \nforward to say: Hey, guys, time to wake up. This is serious. You have \nto be responsible about it.\n  George Schultz has campaigned for a carbon fee, to put a proper price \non carbon so we can deal with this issue. Former Representative Bob \nInglis is out barnstorming around the country arguing that there should \nbe a Republican conservative carbon fee proposal.\n  So even though that side of the Senate has been empty all night since \nSenator Inhofe left--and he was here to deny there is a problem--so \nthere has been no voice for doing anything responsible about climate \nchange all night from that side of the aisle. It has been absolutely \nsilent, absolutely empty. But it is closer than it looks when we \nactually look at the history of Members on that side of the aisle, when \nwe look at the position of Republicans who are not up for election.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. I wish to speak a little bit about how I believe taking \naction on climate is consistent with conservative principles. My \nunderstanding of conservative principles--and I am a progressive--but \nmy understanding of conservative principles is basically that they \nvalue incrementalism, that they understand the importance of \ninstitutions, that they try to move slowly where possible, that they \ntry not to make radical changes to communities or societies or \norganizations unless it is absolutely necessary. There is no more \nradical change that we could make to our economy, to our physical \nenvironment, to our communities, to our government than to allow \nclimate change to move forward.\n  It seems to me what the Senator is saying is exactly right. There are \nplenty of conservatives who are prepared to take action in this area. \nRight now what we need is a Republican dance partner. I think we have \nthem. I think there are those who understand and may have quiet \nconversations with us and nod and agree that the situation is getting \nincreasingly dire and increasingly real and scientifically based in \nfact, but they don't want to be the first one caught making sense. They \ndon't want to be putting themselves at the tip of that spear.\n  So one of the reasons we are here tonight is to hopefully galvanize \nthe American public to go back to their more reasonable Republican \nMembers and say: Remember when you said you would be a middle-of-the-\nroad Republican. This is the way to demonstrate that you are a middle-\nof-the-road Republican. This is the way to demonstrate that you are a \ntrue moderate.\n  When the Department of Defense is saying this is a real strategic \nchallenge, this is not the province of the League of Conservation \nVoters anymore. I love them. But listen. This is\n\n[[Page S1437]]\n\nbeyond conservation organizations. This is beyond my particular passion \nfor Hawaii's environment. This is about the future of the United States \nof America and our economic viability. So there are going to be \nRepublican dance partners, but we all as--not just as a Senate but as a \ncountry--have to create a political environment in which they can \noperate with us and we can get to 60 votes. We don't have those votes \nright now. But as the Senator from Rhode Island said, it always looks \nmore difficult than it is, and it is always impossible until you get it \ndone.\n  So that is what this is about tonight.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Here is a fairly well-known Republican \nconservationist; indeed, perhaps the greatest conservationist President \nin American history: Theodore Roosevelt, a Republican. He had two very \nimportant characteristics that there is no reason the Republican Party \nshould not be following today; one was he cared about America as a \nphysical and spiritual space. It wasn't just about the money. It wasn't \njust about who could make money buying and selling what, who could make \nmoney extracting this or doing the other. He cared about America as a \nphysical and a spiritual place. He would go out and camp in the forests \nwith John Muir to get the experience and to embody the value of America \nas a physical and a spiritual space.\n  So that was one characteristic that was very important.\n  Here is the other one: He was willing to stand up against the big \nmoney. He was willing to tell the big money, basically: I am against \nyou. I am willing to have a fight with you. The fact that you are big \nmoney is not alone enough for your argument to prevail with me. He went \nafter the big trusts and he stuck up for the little guy against the big \nmoney. There is nothing that says the Republican Party couldn't do that \nagain, although right now that is not their situation.\n  I mentioned earlier how we had a former Republican Presidential \ncandidate who campaigned on climate change, how we have a Republican \nSenator who was a cosponsor of a climate fee bill, how we have a \nRepublican Senator who voted for Waxman-Markey when he was in the \nHouse, how we have Republican Senators who have spoken for a carbon \nfee. All of that happened before 2010. What happened in 2010 that drove \nevery Republican back underground on this issue? I will tell my \ncolleagues what happened. The U.S. Supreme Court decided a case called \nCitizens United, and the instant they decided Citizens United, the Koch \nbrothers and the big polluters put enormous amounts of money into \nelections. They didn't just put the money into elections between \nRepublicans and Democrats, they put money into elections between \nRepublicans and Republicans. They went into primary elections and they \nwent after Republicans who were not consistent with their orthodoxy on \nclimate change. Unless you are a denier, they either punish you or \nthreaten you.\n  Since that time, that is why there has been silence on the Republican \nside. It is not because there is not a tradition of Republicans caring \nabout the environment. The Environmental Protection Agency was \nestablished by a Republican President. Theodore Roosevelt was our \ngreatest conservationist. There is a Republican tradition of this. \nThere is a Republican tradition of standing up to the big money and \nsticking up for regular people but not since Citizens United, not since \nthat baleful decision cast an absolute avalanche of dark money--of \nunlimited money and anonymous money--into the elections. I will speak \nmore about that later, but that is what the problem has been. The only \nthing it takes to cure that is for the Republican Party to become more \nworried about the reality of climate change and the opinion of the \nAmerican public than they are about the Koch brothers' millions and \nwhat is going to be spent against them.\n  If the American public makes it clear in the coming months that they \nare tired of Congress being stuck, if the American public decides it is \ntime to wake up here in Congress, then the choice becomes inevitable. \nAs the Senator from Hawaii said, the dance partners on the Republican \nside have to come off the wall and come back onto the dance floor. \nThere is a conservative way to do a carbon fee, as Secretary Schultz \nand Representative Inglis and Reagan's budget officer, Laffer, have all \ncome forward to say.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. I would just add there is another motivation that I think \nwill come to bear among all of our colleagues. Actually, the Presiding \nOfficer spoke passionately along these lines, and that is our \nconscience. There is no doubt there are people of good will on both \nsides of the aisle in this Senate and in the House, and what is \nhappening to people as a result of climate change pricks everyone's \nconscience.\n  I wish to talk a little bit about a small island state that probably \nmost people have never heard of. It is called Kiribati. It has become a \ncautionary tale for low-lying places across the Asian Pacific region \nand the world. It is 900 miles south of Hilo. Kiribati's Fanning Atoll \nis the closest land feature to Hawaii, making Kiribati actually way \ncloser to Hawaii than to California.\n  Put another way, the people of Kiribati are our neighbors. More than \n100,000 people live on 21 of Kiribati's 33 corral islands. Thirty-two \nof those islands are low-lying atolls where most of the population \nlives just 2 meters above sea level.\n  The close proximity to the sea is already taking its toll, as rising \nseas contaminate water tables with salt water, denude fertile land, and \ndecimate the few island crops the land can support.\n  Kiribati's President, Anote Tong, has taken great pains to focus \nattention on his country's plight. His sobering remarks from last \nNovember are worth recounting. He said:\n\n       The outer island communities have been affected, we have a \n     village which has gone, we have a number of communities where \n     the sea water has broken through into the freshwater pond and \n     is now affecting the food crops.\n       That is happening on different islands, it's not an \n     isolated event, serious inundation is being witnessed. These \n     are the realities we are facing, whether they are climate \n     change induced or not.\n\n  If you travel around Kiribati, it is impossible to miss the long \nstretch of seawalls people have built to protect their homes from the \nencroaching sea. Besides the sea level rise, low-lying atolls such as \nKiribati face risk of being pummeled by the next tempest. Barely above \nthe water's edge, places such as Kiribati face the risk of having storm \nsurge and sea level rise amplified by the typhoon that roars through \nthe Pacific, washing over runways, roads, and homes lying just above \nsea level.\n  The risks are even more acute for families living in these Pacific \nisland states where, because of the limited space for agricultural and \ncommercial development, population density remains extraordinarily \nhigh.\n  Take South Tarawa, the capital of Kiribati, where the population is \nclose to 5,000 people per square kilometer--one of the most densely \npopulated areas on the planet. These densely populated areas make \nMother Nature's destructive power even more devastating. The cards \nwould appear to be stacked against countries like Kiribati, and not \nsurprisingly outside observers have been less sanguine about its fate.\n  Journalist Jeffrey Goldberg described it this way:\n\n       The apocalypse could come even sooner for Kiribati if \n     violent storms, of the sort that recently destroyed parts of \n     the Philippines, strike its islands.\n\n  He said:\n\n       For all of these reasons, the 103,000 citizens of Kiribati \n     may soon become refugees, perhaps the first mass movement of \n     people fleeing the consequences of global warming rather than \n     war or famine.\n\n  Almost 6,000 nautical miles away, in the Indian Ocean, the Maldives \nface a similar fate to Kiribati. The island state of nearly 400,000 \nfaces risks of sea level rise and extreme weather events that threaten \nto inundate its communities with swells of storm surge that leave \nfamilies and their loved ones literally underwater.\n  In 2009, leaders in the Maldives staged a dramatic demonstration \nahead of the U.N. Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, when they \nheld a cabinet meeting on the bottom of the ocean floor to foreshadow \ntheir impending fate if the world failed to act in the face of climate \nchange.\n  Maldives President Mohamed Nasheed told observers:\n\n       We're now actually trying to send our message, let the \n     world know what is happening,\n\n[[Page S1438]]\n\n     and what will happen to the Maldives if climate change is not \n     checked.\n       If the Maldives cannot be saved today we do not feel that \n     there is much of a chance for the rest of the world.\n\n  Leaders spent 30 minutes on the ocean floor that day. When later \nasked about what would happen if the U.N. Climate Change Conference in \nCopenhagen failed to produce an agreement among states, President \nNasheed simply said: ``We are going to die.''\n  In addition to sea level rise, island nations face other immense \nchallenges from climate change. Slight changes in ocean temperature \nfrom increased warming and increased ocean acidity, which scientists \nexplain as a consequence of oceans observing more carbon dioxide from \nthe atmosphere, disproportionately affect communities living on island \nnations.\n  I would like to ask the Senator from Rhode Island to talk a little \nbit about ocean acidification and the impact it is having on fisheries \nin the Northeast. I know it is having a real cultural and economic and \nenvironmental impact, and I am not totally sure people are fully \ngrasping how dangerous this is, not just from an ecological standpoint \nbut from a food security standpoint, from a price of food standpoint, \nfrom the standpoint of jobs and the economy. I am hoping the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island can elucidate this.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I would love to. But before I do that let me follow \nup on the point Senator Schatz was making because you do not have to go \nto faraway island nations to see people who are being hurt by rising \nsea levels and eroding shorelines. You do not have to go to island \nnations. You can go to Rhode Island and you can see it.\n  Here is a photograph of some homes at Roy Carpenter's Beach on the \nsouth shore coast of Rhode Island in Washington County after Hurricane \nSandy.\n  This is Governor Chafee, former Senator Chafee, who used to serve in \nthis body. These homes--I remember speaking to a lady who was with us \nthat day, and I do not remember if it was this house in the picture or \nthis house that was hers. But she had started coming as a very little \ngirl. Her childhood memories were on this beach. This house used to \nhave a lawn in front of it. She can remember playing badminton on the \nlawn in front of her house. On the other side of the lawn was a road--\njust a dirt road--so cars could come in and out. On the other side of \nthe road was a parking lot, where the cars could park, and on the other \nside of the parking lot began the beach.\n  She can remember, as many little children who have been to the beach \ncan remember, that when that hot Sun beats down on the sand, it gets \nhot, and on the child's little feet that heat can hurt. So she would \nhave to run. She would have to run across this long, expansive beach. \nShe can remember the distance running across the hot sand until her \nfeet got into the cool, sparkling waters of the ocean.\n  Those were her memories of a Rhode Island summer: playing on the \nlawn, seeing the cars come to the beach, running across the hot sand to \nthe cool water.\n  In her lifetime the beach is gone, the parking lot is gone, the road \nis gone, the lawn is gone, and the ocean is tearing out the \nunderpinnings of these homes.\n  You can go as far away from Rhode Island in the United States as you \ncan get on the mainland and where do you end up? Alaska. What do you \nsee? A very similar phenomenon of houses falling into the sea. This is \na town called Shishmaref. It is a little bit different in Alaska as to \nthe reasons. It is often because the ice that protects the shore from \nwinter storms--because the waves break against the ice and not the \nshore--the ice is not there. The ice has melted away. So now the winter \nstorms beat directly against the shore.\n  There are villages like Shishmaref that have been at their location \nfor as long as the memories and the traditions of the indigenous tribes \nwho live there go. For as long as the memory of man runneth in those \nareas, those villages have been there. But now, in a generation, they \nare going.\n  We see it in comparisons like this. This was, again, after Sandy. \nHere is a beachfront building at the South Kingstown Town Beach in \nRhode Island. You can see the ocean right up against it.\n  That is what it used to look like not too long ago, as shown in this \npicture, in just 1994. This building is that building now shown in this \nother picture. This walkway is that walkway. As you can see, this \nwalkway was broken up by the storm. The ocean has now come to here. The \nentire beach has gone.\n  So we see it in Rhode Island, I say to the Senator, as much as we do \nin faraway island kingdoms. But to the Senator's point about \nacidification, the seas are an honest witness. The oceans do not lie. \nYou can measure what the oceans are telling us about climate change, \nand they are telling us they are getting warmer. It is not complicated. \nYou measure that with a thermometer. They are getting bigger, higher. \nThe law of thermal expansion means that when you warm fluids, they \nexpand and the seas, therefore, rise. You measure that with, more or \nless, the equivalent of a yardstick. Thermometers and yardsticks--it is \nnot complicated. It is undeniable.\n  The third piece, as the Senator mentioned, is ocean acidification, \nwhich everybody who has an aquarium knows how to measure acidity. It is \na litmus test. You can do it in any laboratory. You do it in school. It \nis not complicated. You can take measurements like that of the ocean \nand you can see it is acidifying.\n  It is acidifying for very simple reasons. One-third of the carbon \nthat goes into our atmosphere gets absorbed by the oceans. Ninety \npercent of the heat from climate change gets absorbed into the oceans; \n30 percent of the carbon. The oceans bear witness to what is happening, \nand right now, if you look at the rate at which the oceans are \nacidifying, it is happening--here is a graphic on the effects. Where \ndoes the heat go? Mr. President, 93.4 percent goes into the ocean; 2.3 \npercent goes into the atmosphere. The oceans are getting bombarded with \nthis heat, and they are also acidifying.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. I ask the Senator, what does that mean as a practical \nmatter for the fisheries industry, for people who like to eat fish? \nWhat is the impact of ocean acidification? Because the Senator has, in \nvery plain language, explained the science of this.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Yes.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. But what does this mean to a regular person?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. When the carbon is absorbed by the ocean, it makes it \nmore acidic; and when the ocean becomes more acidic, it makes it more \ndifficult for all the little critters that live in the oceans that have \na shell to make that shell. Because shells are made out of something \ncalled calcium carbonate, and the calcium carbonate is eaten away by \nacidic waters. So it means a small creature such as a pteropod has a \nharder time making its little shell, so they do not grow as well, and \nultimately they could be eliminated by acidified waters.\n  Who cares about the humble pteropod? Most people have never heard of \nthe humble pteropod. I will tell you who cares about the humble \npteropod. Salmon care about the pteropod. For some species, it is a \nhuge part of their diet.\n  So if they are not there, then the salmon are in trouble. If the \nsalmon are in trouble, the salmon fisherman and the salmon industry are \nin trouble. It really hit home on the west coast of America a few years \nago when oyster fisheries--on the coast of Washington I think it was, \nbut Oregon was hit as well--literally got wiped out when a sudden \nupwelling of Pacific waters that had become heavily acidified washed \ninto where the young oysters were being grown. The waters were so \nacidic that the little baby oysters, the little spat, could not grow \ntheir shells. The water was too acidic for them to grow their shells.\n  Again, you can say: Who cares about an oyster? Well, people who grow \noysters care a lot about them. It is a big industry in a lot of places. \nWe are actually rather proud of our Rhode Island oysters.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. You should be proud of your Rhode Island oysters. I care \nabout oysters.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I will turn it back to you. Because one of the things \nthat Hawaii is famous for that we do not have much of in Rhode Island \nis tropical coral reefs. Coral reefs are affected by acidification, by \nrunoff, by warming, and they can bleach. When they do, what once was a \nhealthy reef, rich with fish, a nursery for all of the\n\n[[Page S1439]]\n\nspecies that we end up consuming, can end up looking like this, dead \nremnants of what was once living coral. I know Hawaii faces that \nproblem. So why don't I turn to you to discuss that.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Well, it is really important to dwell on the question of \nwhat is happening to our oceans, not just because it is critically \nimportant but because I think that because it is more difficult to see \nit does not get enough attention. What is happening to our fisheries is \nevery bit as drastic, in some cases more drastic, than what is \nhappening in our agricultural sector. When there is a drought or when \nthere is difficulty in our agricultural sector, it is ably represented \nin the Senate by its able home State Senators. Yet when there is a \nfisheries difficulty, it is more difficult to pin down. It does not \nnecessarily become the new story a drought or any difficulty in a \ngrowing season may create.\n  This is something we have to talk about both on the recreational \nfisherman side as well as on the commercial fishing side. I know that \nin a lot of States in the Southeast, in the northeast, on the west \ncoast and certainly in Hawaii, people who fish, maybe recreationally, \nmaybe for subsistence, or maybe as a commercial venture, it is really \npart and parcel of the culture of the place. It is not purely an \neconomic issue, it is something you do with your children and their \nchildren. It is part of where you live. It is part of what it means to \nbe from Hawaii or from Louisiana or from Florida or from Rhode Island. \nThis is part of the American experience.\n  To the degree and extent we are diminishing that experience, setting \naside the economics for the moment, that is very significant. I know \npeople across the State of Hawaii grew up fishing and treasure that \nopportunity to share what is in the ocean with their families.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. May I tell you story about a Rhode Island fisherman. \nThere is a fishing captain, Christopher Brown, who came recently to \ntestify before the Environment and Public Works Committee. He has been \nfishing all of his life. He is a real Rhode Island fisherman. He used \nto go out with his dad, who was a Rhode Island fisherman. When he was \nprobably 20 years old, he built himself a fishing boat and then went \nout and began fishing on his own. He fished that fishing boat he built \nfor 30 years. He is the real deal when it comes to fishing.\n  He can remember as a boy fishing offshore with his dad, dragging nets \nbehind them, trawlers. Now he goes out to those same waters, and he \ngets completely different fish. He says he pulled up a net full of \nspot. When he was out with his dad, his dad virtually never saw a spot. \nHe said now he is catching fish like grouper and tarpon that his dad \nnever saw in his life. The waters are changing.\n  When you have regulations over what you can and cannot catch that are \nnot keeping up with the changing fisheries, it is a nightmare for \nfishermen. So we are going to do our best to update our fisheries laws, \nbut the underlying problem is that fisheries that have existed for as \nlong as Rhode Island fishermen remember them are changing in \nunprecedented ways.\n  I will close. As one fisherman said to me when he came to visit here \nin Washington maybe a year ago, he said something unforgettable. He \nsaid, ``Sheldon, it's getting weird out there.''\n  Mr. SCHATZ. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  I am going to talk about something that I think is astonishing. The \nSenator from New Mexico earlier talked about this, but this is mind-\nboggling to me, and it may be a surprise that the Senator from Hawaii \nis talking about this. I have a 10-year-old son and a 6-year-old \ndaughter. It has been at least that long since I have been \nsnowboarding, but I enjoyed it when I was a lot younger and my knees \nwere better. But what is happening to winter recreation is really bad \nnews. One source states that roughly 23 million people participate in \nwinter sporting activities, adding $12 billion to the economy and \nemploying almost 212,000 people. Roughly 20 million Americans over the \nage of 6 ski or snowboard. The industry generates more than $11 billion \nacross 38 States.\n  You do not have to be a climate scientist to recognize that skiers \nare dependent upon consistent, plentiful snow. You do not have to be an \neconomist to realize that ski areas are only sustainable in places with \nplentiful snow and cold weather, aside perhaps from the indoor ski \nslopes in certain places such as Dubai.\n  So what does it tell you when you see ski resorts struggling to meet \ntheir bottom lines due to winters so warm that even with enormous \nartificial snow systems, they cannot keep snow on their mountain? \nMountains cannot move. They cannot migrate. So when the climate warms, \nski resorts that depend on them face difficult choices, if they have \nany choice at all.\n  According to one study on the impact of climate change on the ski and \nsnowboard industry, more than half of all sky resorts in the northeast \nwill no longer be viable by 2039. I will repeat that. More than half of \nall ski resorts in the northeast will no longer be viable by 2039.\n  Another study of Washington State ski resorts found that almost 13 \npercent of the ski areas in the Cascades and fully 61 percent of the \nski areas in the Olympic mountain range are at risk from the future \neffects of climate change.\n\n  Another study of ski areas in southern Ontario Canada cautioned that \nby the year 2080, with current snow-making technology, the ski season \nwill be reduced by anywhere from 11 to 50 percent. Operators of ski \nareas do not have too many ways to adapt. They can move their runs to \nnorth-facing slopes, landscape trails to reduce the need for snowpack, \nand move to higher altitudes. All of these efforts, however, involve \nmassive capital investments. It is difficult to know with certainty if \nthese changes are real solutions or just stopgap.\n  Of course, skiing and snowboarding are just two examples of outdoor \nrecreational activities that are increasingly in peril as a result of \nfuture climate change. Sportsmen such as hunters and fishers should \nkeep a watchful eye on the changing climate as well. We all know that \nAmericans in every State love to hunt and fish. In 2011, almost 14 \nmillion people, or 6 percent of the United States population 16 years \nold and older, went hunting. Hunters spent $34 billion on trips, \nequipment, and licenses. More than 33 million people 16 and older \nfished in 2011, spending almost $42 billion on trips, equipment, \nlicenses, and other items. As the climate warms, hunters and anglers \nwill see decreased opportunities as a result of lower streamflows, \npopulation declines, and changing migration patterns.\n  Organizations such as the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership \nwhich exist to promote hunting and fishing recognize this trend and \nbelieve it is in the best interest of the hunting and fishing \ncommunities to take action on climate change. The organization's \ndirector, Bill Geer, published a cautionary note in 2012 that is worth \nrecounting:\n\n       Contentious or not, climate change is real, and it is \n     already affecting our natural resources, fish and wildlife \n     and outdoor opportunities. At the Theodore Roosevelt \n     Conservation Partnership we aim to educate sportsmen about \n     the effects of climate change and ensure sportsman \n     involvement in mitigation efforts.\n\n  This is another example of conservatives, of independents, of \nprogressives, of basically everybody outside of the four corners of the \nU.S. Capitol recognizing that is what is actually happening is actually \nhappening. It is only in the four corners of this Capitol that the \ndebate rages on, as if we can ignore the facts of the matter. This is \nno longer confined to conservation organizations or people who are \nconcerned primarily with biological diversity.\n  Look, I am a hiker. I am a surfer. I love Hawaii's natural \nenvironment, in particular. So that is the origin of my passion for \nthis issue. But the way this issue has evolved, it is way beyond any of \nthose questions. It is national security; it is economic security; it \nis our ability to grow our own food and catch our own protein; it is \nliterally the American way of life that is at stake here.\n  I think the reason we have had such great participation last night \nand well into the morning is because there is a growing recognition on \nthe left, right, and center that we have got to take action.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. To follow up on Senator Schatz's point in terms of \nthe\n\n[[Page S1440]]\n\nbipartisanship we can hope for here sooner or later, on the skiing \nquestion and snowboarding question that was raised, the Park City \nFoundation in Utah, which runs all of the Park City resorts, the Park \nCity Foundation in Utah predicts an annual local temperature increase \nof 6.8 degrees Fahrenheit by 2075. That would cause a complete loss of \nsnowpack in the lower Park City resort area--a complete loss of \nsnowpack. The foundation--this Utah foundation--estimates it will \nresult in thousands of lost jobs, tens of millions in lost earnings, \nand hundreds of millions in lost economic growth.\n  We have to be able to find a way to work with Senators from Utah on \nthat. The point that Senator Schatz made about the northeast comes home \nbecause when you drill down into the report a little further, they say \nthe number of economically viable ski locations in New Hampshire and \nMaine will be cut in half; that skiing in New York will be cut by \nthree-quarters. I do not know what that does to skiing in New Jersey, \nbut I will say that they said there will be no ski areas in Connecticut \nor Massachusetts. They overlooked Rhode Island. They did not mention \nRhode Island. But I can promise you, knowing geography, if there is no \nski area that can survive in Connecticut or Massachusetts, then Yawgoo \nValley in Rhode Island is in trouble. That is our sky slope. So this \nreally does hit home.\n  I want to mention, the bicameral task force that Henry Waxman and I \nrun brought in all of the major sports leagues to talk about how \nclimate change is affecting their sports. We had the National \nBasketball Association, we had Major League Baseball, we had the U.S. \nOlympic Committee, we had the National Football League and the National \nHockey League. They all agreed we need to take action on climate \nchange. In particular, the NHL talked about the history of their sport, \nwith kids growing up and playing on frozen ponds. Many of those frozen \nponds do not freeze any longer or they freeze so little that a child \ndoes not have a chance to learn to skate and develop that skill out on \nthe pond. So the NHL has been active. I appreciate that.\n  The other point I wanted to mention is a lot of these winter sports \nare part of the Winter Olympics. There was a study done by the \nUniversity of Waterloo that took a look at all of the different \nlocations in which there have been Winter Olympics, all of the way up \nto Sochi. The green shows that from 1981 to 2010, all of these \nlocations for the Winter Olympics were climate reliable for snow \nconditions.\n  Then they run a couple of different scenarios, 2050s with low \nemissions, 2050s with high emission; 2080s with low emissions, 2080s \nwith high carbon emissions; and one by one the sites of previous Winter \nOlympics fall away as reasonable sites. If we go to the 2050s low-\nemissions scenario, there goes Sochi and there goes Grenoble. If we go \na little bit further, Vancouver, Squaw Valley, Sarajevo are in trouble. \nWhen we go to this part of the chart, a number of the sites where we \nhave had Winter Olympics are no longer climate suitable for Winter \nOlympics, including Lillehammer, Nagano, Torino, Innsbruck, Oslo, \nSarajevo, Squaw Valley, Vancouver, Chamonix, Grenoble, and on.\n  So the people who are involved in these winter sports know about \nthis. One hundred athletes of the Sochi Olympics from 10 different \nnations wrote a letter saying we have to take climate change seriously. \nThey particularly focused on the small towns in the mountains where \nskiers and snowboarders train and where the economy is based on \nsnowboarding, skiing, and winter sports, and the devastation that would \nhappen in those small towns if that economy collapsed because of \nclimate change.\n  I yield to the Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  I would like to offer a personal story from a young lady in Hawaii \nbecause I think it is very important to think of this in generational \nterms. Her name is Kara Tanaka, and she is a senior at a school called \nHanalani. She wrote me a letter, and I will read it into the Record.\n  She states:\n\n       Recently, I read that Hawaii is one of two destinations \n     being considered for the World Conservation Congress.\n       The International Union for the Conservation of Nature is \n     the organization that convenes this meeting which brings \n     together nations to discuss conservation on a global scale.\n       As this meeting has never been held in the US, Hawaii hopes \n     to be selected as the host location. For many reasons, Hawaii \n     is the perfect place to hold this meeting.\n       Hawaii is the most remote set of islands in the world and \n     has the most concentrated examples of flora and fauna that \n     are in jeopardy in the United States, our islands could be \n     subjected to rising waters caused by global warming.\n\n  (Mr. Murphy assumed the Chair.)\n  Continuing:\n\n       The outer reefs that protect our shores will be in crisis \n     if the current environmental challenges are not addressed and \n     solutions enacted upon.\n       I have been blessed in growing up on the north shore of \n     Oahu and have experienced the beautiful scenery of nature \n     which surrounds me.\n       As a first generation Japanese American, my 92 year old \n     grandpa loves to tell me stories about spending his youth \n     living on the plantation fields in Mokuleia. During our early \n     morning hikes up Peacock Flats and lunches on the beach, my \n     grandpa enjoys telling me about all the edible plants we walk \n     by and can identify all the animals that we hear and see.\n       My grandpa also shares with me the things that are no \n     longer around: dry streams, less wildlife, and lower water \n     levels. Although there may be other factors affecting the \n     environment, I truly believe that climate change is a major \n     reason causing these changes.\n       For both my grandpa and me, climate change is real, he sees \n     the changes. It is a very important thing because Hawaii's \n     wildlife is a very sentimental and beautiful part of our \n     life.\n       Scientists tell us that the effect of climate change could \n     be catastrophic.\n       For example, the rising temperatures will cause loss of \n     habitat, there will be changes in water supply, and it could \n     push certain species to the endangered species list. The \n     animals my grandpa and I look and hear for may soon no longer \n     be there at all.\n       In addition, I can't even imagine how it will be like if \n     our coral reefs die from global warming. Beach erosions will \n     multiply rapidly and people's homes will be prone to \n     destruction. Hawaii's beaches could be gone. Not only would \n     this affect Hawaii's beauty, but it would affect Hawaii's \n     economy because of the heavy reliance on tourism. Climate \n     change is real and in need of full attention.\n       I have seen many programs for sustainability in my \n     community from the recently built wind turbines by my house \n     to programs in elementary schools, like Aina in the Schools, \n     that have raised the awareness of climate change.\n       I believe that there needs to be more research about \n     climate change and its effect on the environment. When I \n     become a parent, I hope I can share the same sounds and \n     sights that my Grandpa has shared with me, to experience \n     wildlife with my children rather than teach them how the \n     environment could have been or was like before.\n\n  Kara's words, spoken from her heart, reflect the deepest feelings of \nher generation, not only in Hawaii but throughout the United States. I \nrepeat the most resonant of her thoughts:\n\n       When I become a parent, I hope I can share the same sounds \n     and sights that my Grandpa has shared with me.\n\n  Indeed, Hawaii has a remarkably beautiful environment. Yet I think we \nall agree that throughout our home States, from sea to shining sea, \nthere are lands that define who we are and that call upon us to teach \nwhat is right and to rightfully protect them.\n  These thoughts from Kara inspire me. I think they inspire all of us. \nThere is a Kara Tanaka in every community who inspires us to take \naction. It is time to wake up. That is why we are up for climate, and \nthat is why we are in this fight.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. If I may, let me ask people who are listening to \nthink back in time. Think back in time to many years ago when Abraham \nLincoln was President of the United States, when this room was just \nunder construction and soldiers coming down occupied it, camped here, \ncamped in the lounge, and actually made fires in the lounge across the \nway to cook their bacon. One could hear cannon fire from the Capitol. \nThe Civil War was happening in America.\n\n  When that took place, there was a scientist named John Tyndall who \ndelivered a paper that showed that when you added carbon dioxide to the \natmosphere, it warmed the Earth. That is how long it has been that we \nhave known that when you add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, it warms \nthe Earth.\n  Since that time, we have probably added close on 2,000 gigatons, \n2,000 billion tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. What happens \nwhen we do\n\n[[Page S1441]]\n\nthat? This goes back to 800,000 BC. That is nearly 1 million years. We \ncan see that in the time we have measured here, 800,000 years, there \nhas been a very clear range of carbon concentration in the planet.\n  We kicked in around 200,000 years ago as human beings. This is about \nwhere homo sapiens showed up. So long before there were homo sapiens, \nthe Earth stayed between about 170 and 300 parts per million of carbon \ndioxide. For every single year human beings have inhabited this planet, \nwe stayed within that window. But then that 2,000 gigatons started to \nkick in, and here it goes, up through 250, up through 300, up through \n350, and for the first time it hit 400 parts per million. So that is \nvery real.\n  If people are worried about deniers out there, we can't deny \nTyndall's theory. Nobody denies that when we add carbon dioxide to the \natmosphere, it has this effect. Nobody denies that we have put roughly \nclose on 2,000 gigatons of carbon into the atmosphere since then, and \nnobody denies these measurements. These are measurements. This isn't \ntheory; these are measurements.\n  It is one thing if the Republican Party wants to be the party that is \nagainst science. I doubt they want to go so far as to be the party that \nis against measurement, but here we are at 400.\n  Sure enough, some strange behavior is showing up, and this shows \nwhere all the land and ocean temperature anomalies are showing up. If \nwe look, starting in 1880 it goes from blue--the cold anomalies--to \nred, and we can see a very distinct line.\n  People who look at it say: Well, that is that undeniable climate \nchange happening. That is that 400 parts per million. That is the \nincrease in carbon dioxide.\n  How many people think that? Well, about 14,000 peer-reviewed articles \nthink that; 24 reject global warming. That is the little red line if \nyou are comparing the two. The blue is the universe of peer-reviewed \narticles on climate change, and that tiny little red line is the 24 out \nof 14,000 who reject climate change.\n  I ask my friends on the other side of the aisle, you are betting the \nreputation of the Republican Party on your current de facto premise \nthat climate change isn't real? Do you really want to take a 24 out of \n14,000 article bet? Is that the smart place to put the reputation and \nthe honor of the Republican Party? I don't think so.\n  That is another reason I am confident we can get to a bipartisan \nsolution. I don't think it is smart for Republicans to take the \nreputation and honor of their party and bet it on a theory that is 24 \nout of 14,000.\n  If we look a little bit behind the climate denial operation, we will \nsee that it is actually very sketchy. It is very sketchy. A lot of \nthese organizations have a tradition of denial. They denied that the \nozone hole was growing. They denied that tobacco caused cancer. Heck, \nsome of them probably even denied that seatbelts made auto travel \nsafer. That has been their industry. They have been in the denial \nindustry. But that is a dangerous place to be, particularly because the \noceans don't lie. The oceans tell the story, and they tell it in ways \nwe can't deny.\n  It is big--what happens in the oceans--because 93 percent of the heat \ngoes into the oceans. What do we see? We know perfectly well what \nhappens to liquids when they get warmer. That is a law of science. It \nis called the law of thermal expansion. When liquids get bigger--get \nwarmer, they get bigger. Sure enough, when the ocean gets bigger, the \nsea level rises.\n  Here is a time series showing the sea level rise taking place.\n  So we have the principle of carbon dioxide warming the temperature of \nthe Earth. We have the addition of the carbon dioxide. We have the \nmeasurement in the atmosphere of the effect of that addition. We have \nthe laws of nature which show what happens when the ocean warms and \nrises. Then we go back out, measure, and we see it coming through \nexactly as predicted.\n  By the way, it is 93 percent of the heat, but it is 30 percent of the \ncarbon.\n  We can go into a regular chemistry lab and we can do the experiment \nof adding carbon dioxide to saltwater and watching its acidification go \nup. Sure enough, we can go to the ocean and do this as well. Again, \nthis isn't theory; this is measurement.\n  Does the Republican Party want to be the party that doesn't just deny \nscience but denies measurement? I don't think so. There is no future in \nthat.\n  Responsible people who back the Republican Party need to bring their \nparty back from the brink of one of the most embarrassing fiascos any \npolitical party could get itself into.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. If I may, the Senator from Rhode Island has elucidated \nthe problem with respect to climate change deniers. I wish to read a \nfew quotes from Members of Congress, unfortunately. They would be funny \nif they weren't so alarming. These are direct quotes from Members of \nCongress who are denying the reality of climate change.\n  The first quote: Is there some thought being given to subsidizing the \nclearing of rain forests in order for some countries to eliminate that \nproduction of greenhouse gases?\n  Second quote: We don't know what those other cycles were caused by in \nthe past. It could be dinosaur flatulence, you know, or who knows. \nGlobal warming is a total fraud, and it is being designed because what \nwe have got is you have got----\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. May the record reflect that this is perhaps the first \nreference in the history of the Senate to dinosaur flatulence.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. I would hope.\n  Global warming is a total fraud, and it is being designed because \nwhat you have got is you have got liberals who get elected at the local \nlevels, want State government to do the work and let them make the \ndecisions. Then at the State level they want the Federal Government to \ndo it, and at the Federal Government they want to create global \ngovernment to control our lives.\n\n  Here is one about global climate change.\n\n       It could just be a shift on the axis.\n\n  I don't even know what that means. And they are a little humorous \nexcept these are sitting decisionmakers. So it is time to wake up. It \nis time for those folks who are denying the reality of climate change \nto move off of their position, and for those who are quietly agreeing \nwith us about the sciences but not stepping forward and showing \nleadership to show leadership.\n  Frankly, I think it is time for those of us who have been passionate \nabout this issue to work together and to redouble our efforts. But I \nhave 20 or 30 pages worth of quite alarming quotes. Again, they would \nbe funny if they weren't from sitting decisionmakers who have real \nauthority over this question.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. The one we hear the most often right now is: Don't \nworry, climate change has leveled off. Global warming and the \ntemperature increases have leveled off.\n  Well, as you just saw, 93 percent of the heat goes into the ocean. So \nif you are measuring just the atmosphere, a tiny wobble in the 93-\npercent share the oceans take up will make a massive effect in the \natmosphere.\n  But more to the point, if you take a graph, here is the leveling they \nshow over the last 15 years. The problem is, if you go back through the \ndata, you can show it leveled here, and then it leveled here, and then \nit leveled here, and then it leveled here, and then it leveled here, \nand then it leveled here. There are constant levels in an upward-going \nstaircase. If you cherry-pick the data, you can say: OK, it has gotten \nlevel for that period. But if you really look at the trend of the \nidentical data, that is the real trend. That is the actual trendline \nthrough the data.\n  So when somebody comes to you and says: Ignore that trendline; \ninstead look at it having gotten flat. And by the way, forget all those \nother times it got flat before. What do you think about somebody who \nmakes an argument to you like that. It is a ridiculous argument. It \nruins the credibility of the person who makes it. How you can believe \nthat is astonishing.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. I think the Senator is exactly right. In some ways that \nis a\n\n[[Page S1442]]\n\nmore dangerous argument than some of the other denier arguments, \nbecause it sounds like science. It is not, but it sounds like science.\n  But the most recent, and in my view most absurd, and we have now I \nthink seen it for three or four winters, is every time there is snow--\nand at first I thought it was sort of a little jab, a little rhetorical \njoke--but they are actually saying that because it was snowing last \nweek there must not be climate change. That is an argument they are \nrelying upon.\n  I think because in the face of actual evidence they are now having to \nrely on anecdotes, on the fact that it is icy in Antarctica or there \nwas a snowstorm in DC, or it was unseasonably cold for a weekend in \nGeorgia or whatever it may be, but to rely on individual anecdotes \nabout the weather I think is pretty tough stuff to take and I want to \nmake sure we don't let that stand; that the idea you get to look out \nthe window and understand what is happening with the climate is a lack \nof understanding about the climate.\n  Climate is long-term patterns over large swaths of land or ocean. The \nweather is you get to check it on your iPhone app tomorrow morning. \nThat is the weather. It is not the climate. It may or may not be hot or \ncold tomorrow. That doesn't tell you a thing about what is happening to \nclimate change. And to the extent someone wants to pick off a day and \nsay: Look, it is 32 degrees in Seattle and, therefore, climate change \nis not real, I don't think anybody actually believes that argument. But \nit is important the American public realizes how specious that claim \nis.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Climate science doesn't tell you that every day is \ngoing to get a tiny little bit warmer. Climate science tells you that \nputting that extra energy into the system will make the weather \nextremes worse, both warmer and colder. So the fact there have been \ncold snaps is actually perfectly consistent with climate science. Not \nonly does that argument ignore the difference between weather and \nclimate, it also takes advantage of people who haven't drilled into the \nclimate science. Because if you knew the least little bit about the \nunderlying science, you would know the point made no sense because that \nis exactly what the people who predict global warming predicted would \nhappen. If anything, it confirms the argument that people are trying to \nrebut. So it really, really is a dishonest argument.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, may I ask a question of the Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. BOOKER. There are a number of issues here and the first is: Are \ntemperatures going up? And for me, the air temperature is increasing. \nWe have objective measurements on that. Ocean temperatures are \nincreasing. We have objective measurements on that. The ocean is \nbecoming more acidic. We have objective measurements of that. Sea \nlevels are rising because of the expansion of warming oceans. \nObviously, that is just basic, basic science we learned in our earlier \nyears. The amount of land covered in snow is decreasing in the northern \nhemisphere. We have evidence of that. Glaciers are melting away. There \nis evidence of that. Arctic sea ice is decreasing. We have evidence of \nthat. Again, we see in New Jersey evidence of measurements of these \nthings happening.\n  Scientists at Tufts and Rutgers estimate the New Jersey shore will \nexperience a sea level rise of 1.5 feet by 2050. This is based upon \nwhat is happening right now that they can measure. The projections for \nthe New Jersey coast are higher than projected for average sea levels \nthat rise globally. The projected sea level rise of 1.5 feet by 2050 \nfor the New Jersey coast in places such as Atlantic City, if there were \na 10-year storm--not a 50-year storm or a 100-year storm, but just the \nscale of a storm that, on average, we see every 10 years--flood levels \nfrom that storm would be worse than any flooding that has ever been \nseen in Atlantic City, even worse than those from Superstorm Sandy.\n  The temperature issues in New Jersey are the same as well. In New \nJersey, the statewide average temperature in 2012 was the highest in \n118 years of recording it. Nine of the ten warmest calendar years on \nrecord in New Jersey as an objective measurement have occurred since \n1990, and the five warmest years have occurred since 1998. Scientists \npredict that by 2050 summer temperatures in New Jersey will regularly \nsurpass the current hottest temperatures on record, making the State \nbegin to have more such as that of Alabama. I know Senator Sessions and \nSenator Shelby can tell me a lot about those temperatures, but that is \nnot the New Jersey we know.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. We are seeing the same thing in Rhode Island. Indeed, \nNewport, RI, is known for being a summer destination. The first summer \nvisitors to Newport, RI, the first people who made it the summer \ncapital of the United States were traders from the Carolinas, who \nsailed up the coast with their families to get away from the baking \nfetid heat of the Carolinas and enjoy the cool shores of Narragansett \nBay.\n  Well, what is happening is that due to climate change and the warming \nclimate, that very climate those Carolina traders sailed up to Newport, \nRI, to get away from is inching its way up the coast and will soon be \nthe climate in Newport, RI.\n  Mr. BOOKER. So I guess my question is--first of all, there is no \ndenying what is happening. The bait we often get pulled into, by using \na ridiculous paucity of a study, as compared to the grand total of the \nother studies, is what is causing this. Is it manmade or is this some \nregular fluctuation? But let us hold that in abeyance for a second, \nthat question, and just deal with what we talked earlier about--the \nmilitary that deals with the fierce urgency of now. Even not dealing \nwith the question of how this issue is created, we should be doing \nthings right now to deal with the consequences--investments in \nresiliency and adaptability along our coasts. There is so much we \nshould be compromising on both sides of the aisle. If they want to \nargue about what is causing it, that is an argument we should take, and \nI believe we will win, but absent that, even if you say these trends \nare happening, now what are we going to do as a country? Nothing or are \nwe going to prepare for that? Isn't there a lot of action we can take \neven before we get to the argument of whether this was manmade? Because \nthese are trends that are happening and there are things we should be \ndoing about it.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. The Senator knows better than I what is happening in \nNew Jersey. You know how hard New York and New Jersey in particular \nwere hit by Sandy. You have our sympathies, because we had some Sandy \ndamage in Rhode Island but we just caught a glancing blow. The full \nthrust of that hit was on New York and New Jersey, and you guys paid \nthe price.\n  In the recovery, FEMA and other Federal agencies and your State \nagencies are starting to look at this in a whole new way. They are \nsaying: We can't build back the same. The same didn't work last time. \nAnd by the way, with that sea level rising, the same is probably going \nto not only not be enough for the last time, it is going to be way less \nthan is necessary for next time. So the very way in which the U.S. \nGovernment, the State of New York government, the State of New Jersey \ngovernment, the city of New York government are taking a look at how \nthey respond to Sandy and how they recover and how they rebuild for the \nfuture is a perfect living example of the point my colleague is making. \nFor that purpose, it doesn't matter whether this is manmade. The fact \nthat it is happening, the fact you can predict it means it would be \nreckless and foolish not to take that into account as you rebuild.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Right. So that is sort of the frustrating thing for me. \nWe see these challenges mounting up all around us and we still do \nnothing. It reminds me of this crazy story my brother told me when I \nwas a young guy. I think originally it was a story from Lou Holtz. You \nwill appreciate this, because if you are in it, doing nothing is not an \noption.\n  This is a story of a very wealthy man who had no heirs to leave his \nmoney to. So he lined up a whole bunch of young strapping guys in front \nof his big old Olympic-sized pool with a cover over it and said: OK, \nanybody who can swim across this pool gets my inheritance. You are the \nones. So all these young men got ready to jump across the pool,\n\n[[Page S1443]]\n\nand he pushed the button, the pool cover opened, and there in the water \nwere snakes and alligators and piranhas, and a very mean, vicious-\nlooking duck.\n  Basically he waited there, and all the men now backed off and didn't \ndo anything. He finally had enough of it and said: Aw, shucks, and \nturned around. But just as he walked away, thinking none of those young \nmen were going to be up to the challenge, he hears this big splash. He \nturns around and he sees navigating across the pool the youngest of all \nthe men--a guy the age of Senator Schatz--navigating through this water \nand battling alligators, pushing back the poisonous snakes, kicking \nback piranhas, dodging that vicious-looking duck, working his way over, \nand heaving himself onto the other end of the pool. He is now bloodied \nand tired and breathing hard, and the man runs over and says: I can't \nbelieve it, boy. You did it. I can't believe it. You did it. Anything \nyou want, it is yours. Anything you want, it is yours.\n  The young man looks up at the guy and says: Well, all I want is to \nknow who pushed me.\n  I asked my brother, after he told me the story, what is the moral of \nthe story? He said: Cory, the moral of the story is: If you are in it, \nyou don't do nothing. If you have challenges up to your neck, you don't \ndo nothing. You keep moving across those challenges.\n  So my colleague's point is excellent, that we are at a point in \nAmerica where we see clearly the challenges we are facing, but right \nnow, because of a deadlocked legislature, we are not doing that much. \nThe cost of inaction we can actually calculate by watching countries \naround us begin to advance the ball down the field in innovation and \nnew technologies that can help reduce the dependency on carbon fuels. \nWe see vulnerabilities being created from Hawaii to New Jersey, up and \ndown the east coast and the west coast that we are not doing anything \nabout. Lacking the investments and that kind of resiliency will cost us \nmore in the long run.\n\n  The point I am trying to make is, when we hear from the military that \nwe need to do work and they are starting to do things to learn how to \nrun their planes on biofuels and learn how to better secure property, \nwhen we hear from people in industries who say we have to be ahead of \nthe curve on innovation, ahead of the curve on these new technologies \nother countries are challenging us on, when we hear even on the issue \nof job creation and government responsibility in terms of saving \ntaxpayer dollars, retrofitting buildings, lowering energy costs, \nhelping people save more money and keep it there--all of these things \nshould be enough alone to compel us to act before we even get to the \ndebate about what is causing this.\n  So what I am asking is, understanding that debate, having been in the \nSenate only for about 4 months, where is the bipartisan work on what is \nfactually happening--warming seas, rising sea levels and the obvious \nstuff knowing these challenges are there? Why aren't we doing more as a \nNation to wake folks up and invest in what we know will make us a \nbetter, stronger, and safer Nation?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. The bipartisan work I think is mostly being done at \nthe local level--at the level of Governors and mayors, at the level of \nlocal city councils.\n  One example which comes to mind is the City of Miami. Miami is really \nground zero for climate change. On high-tide days, their streets \nalready flood with water which is pushing up through what should be \nways for water to flow off the streets but comes up into the streets--\nsaltwater. The freshwater supply is already being inundated by \nsaltwater as it pushes through the porous limestone the Miami area is \nbuilt on. They realize they have a real problem. So four county \ngovernments came together to deal with this. The four counties are led \ntwo by Democrats and two by Republicans.\n  I mentioned earlier we used to have bipartisanship on this issue \nuntil Citizens United was decided by the Supreme Courts, until all the \nbig money came in, until all the dark money came in, until people on \nthe Republican side who were willing to speak up about climate change \nwere punished and threatened so badly they could no longer do it. The \nCitizens United effect hasn't worked its way down to Governors and \ncounties, so they still see the real action.\n  I think the Senator as a mayor will also remember there were reality-\nbased problems to be dealt with--not every day but 10 times a day or 15 \ntimes a day.\n  Abraham Lincoln in the movie ``Lincoln'' said: I like to get my \npublic opinion bath by having real people in. The Senator got a reality \nbath every day as mayor, and every mayor out there is getting a reality \nbath every day. Here, we don't deal with that. Here, it is different. \nWe don't have to live in the same real world. We live in a more \npolitical world. So people can say things which are, frankly, \nirresponsible, untrue, and get away with it longer. The intimidation \nfactor of big money is worse here.\n  So where is the bipartisanship? It will be back here. It is \ninevitable. But we know there can be bipartisanship here by looking at \nbipartisanship live and healthy and in action on climate at the \nmunicipal, State, and county level.\n  Mr. BOOKER. I share the Senator's sense of hope about our ability to \ncome together as a country, crises after crises, generation after \ngeneration, and we come here to do the right thing. I know this from \nthe history my parents and grandparents have talked to me about--\nwhether it was against an external threat of fascism, and how folks \npulled together, from victory gardens and conserving, to people who \nstormed beaches in Normandy. I know for the civil rights movement we \ncame together as a Nation and overcame those people who were trying to \ndeny equal rights and equal opportunity in this country. It is those \npast victories which fuel my hopes about the present.\n  We as a Nation have already set limits for arsenic, mercury, lead, \nand other types of pollution. We have already done that and said if a \nprivate company is going to spew this filth into our climate, they are \ngoing to have to face limitations and take responsibility for those \nactions. In other words, they are going to have to internalize the \ncosts and not externalize them, not put the burden on people. Again, I \nhave seen this in countless cities across America where, when we didn't \ndo that, people were still paying the price in the money we spent here \nin the Federal Government for brownfield remediation and public tax \ndollars paying for the cleanup of land often in urban spaces which \nother people dirtied up. So it is just common sense not to allow \npolluters to release unlimited amounts of pollutants in the air.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. It is a win. The only thing I would distinguish a \nlittle bit is the example of the boy who went into the pool filled with \npiranhas and alligators and snakes.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Don't forget about the duck.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. And the particularly vicious looking duck. The \nsolution on climate is not the equivalent of piranhas, alligators, \nsnakes, and a vicious duck. The solution on climate is actually a \ntriple win.\n  The Senator mentioned the earlier limits on pollutants. We found over \nand over that despite the regular claims by the industry that this was \ngoing to be the end of civilization as we know it and an economic \ncatastrophe would ensue, when we actually look back, people saved money \nbecause of the harm they were spared. I think the Clean Air Act is $30 \nsaved for every $1 we had to invest in cleaning up. So the limits \nactually saved money.\n  In this case, we will add--as the Senator mentioned before--the \ngrowth in new industries, the $6 trillion clean-energy industry we want \nto be in rather than trailing behind and buying from China. Finally, if \nwe believe in market theory, if we believe markets are the most \nefficient way to make choices, then we have to set up a market which is \na fair one. This business the Senator mentioned of a business being \nable to externalize its costs by saying, ``That is not my \nresponsibility. I don't have to pay for that. I am just going to dump \nit.'' This is no more fair than a New Jersey neighbor or a Hawaii \nneighbor or a Connecticut neighbor or a Rhode Island neighbor, instead \nof cleaning up their lawn, just shoveling their leaves over to the next \nguy's wall. We don't get to do that. We are responsible for cleaning up \nour own lawn when the leaves fall, in the same\n\n[[Page S1444]]\n\nway these companies that are making this mess are responsible for \ncleaning it up.\n  So it is actually a triple win. We have markets which work correctly, \nlimits which save money for people in the long run, and the proper \ninvestment in green industries which are going to grow. So if that is \nalligators, snakes, and piranhas, I think it is the exact opposite. It \nis abundance and opportunity and innovation.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Again, the Senator said it. On the local level, dealing \nwith the urgencies of the moment, we don't have time to philosophize \nand don't have time for politics. We have to solve problems. The \nSenator's point is something I experienced as a mayor on multiple \noccasions. We got teenagers and trained them in solar panel \ninstallation. What happened to the buildings? It reduced the costs. \nPeople saved money. Our surrounding environment actually improved, \nburning less fossil fuels, putting less carbon in the air.\n  Every time we attended to our environment, we were able to find win-\nwins. We looked at that and said: Let's create multiple farms and \ncreate more locally-grown food. We found a way to address crime issues \nin our city.\n  By the way, there are studies which show cities with more trees and \nplant life and what have you often see some correlations with crime. We \ndid it in a different way. We created greenfields, planting food, \nlocally-grown produce, able to source it to restaurants over in New \nYork across the Hudson River. But what excited me is we created a \nreentry program for men and women coming home from prison.\n  So this is the creativity we see in industry and local communities, \npeople realizing that this is not an either-or choice, the economy or \nthe environment. No. That is a false choice.\n  So people who see this as incredibly threatening haven't looked at \nthe facts that we can create wins on multiple levels for the United \nStates of America. So we can get the win on the economy. We can get the \nwin on the environment. We can get the win on the costs being spent. We \ncan get the win from being less dependent upon nations who have helped \ndestabilize our planet. Then the biggest patriotic win of them all is \nan America that can lead again in this area, that can show the world \nthe way to go. Frankly, we can show other countries that are saying: \nWhy should I do anything on this issue, we can show a way forward which \nisn't about self-interest. It is about enlightened self-interest, if \nyou go the way we are going.\n  We heard one of the other Senators talk tonight about what China is \nalready seeing in terms of their pollutants and environment and how the \npublic is reacting to that. That is one area I might question one more \ntime--the hope that somehow bipartisanship will come here. The feeling \nI have is the statistics the Senator was reading about the number of \npeople on the Web site is such an important thing for me. Often as I \nlook at the history of this institution, change does happen here, but \noften it comes from people demanding it, standing up for it, letting \ntheir politicians know: I don't care if you are a Republican or a \nDemocrat; if you don't get on board with this, you are going to pay for \nit at the polls.\n  What gives me hope is it is such common sense that folks are going to \nstart putting pressure on this body--just like I have seen on some \nother issues which have come around of recent--pressure on folks to \nsay: Hey, you have got to get on board because this is common stuff \nwhich is going to benefit my neighbor, my community, my school, my \nkids, my country.\n  I am hoping those numbers you were revealing show some of that \nenergy. I wonder if that is your view.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. The energy is definitely out there. There is no doubt \nabout it. Poll after poll shows how strongly Americans feel about \nclimate change.\n  My favorite one, because it involves Republicans, is a poll taken of \nself-identified Republican voters under the age of 35--young voters, \nthe future of the party, the future of the country, the future \ndemographic they need to reach out to. When asked what they feel about \nclimate denial, 53 percent of young Republican voters described climate \ndenial with three words: Ignorant, out of touch or crazy.\n  So there are lots of reasons to have confidence. But one reason to \nhave confidence is young people in this party view the climate denial \nstrategy which we heard here earlier this evening from the one \nRepublican who came--they view that theory as ignorant, out of touch or \ncrazy. If this is what the young people in their own party think about \nit, that is not a position they can hold. Up against the common sense \nand the reality, up against the force of public opinion, and up against \nthe effort of this evening which Senator Schatz has done so much to \nmake happen, there shows a new spirit of stirring in the Senate. Then I \nthink we win. I think the American people win, more to the point.\n  Mr. BOOKER. I will ask one more question and then invite Senator \nSchatz--who has been the catalytic agent in pulling this all together--\nto address this idea of a level playing field and free markets, the \nsubsidy that is given to oil and coal, and the predictable subsidies \nthat have been given to oil and coal which have helped fuel the \nindustry, compared to the unpredictable subsidies that are given to \nalternative energy sources such as wind, which has led to more \ndisjointed advancements in those areas.\n\n  Again, I think of arguments about picking winners and losers. I heard \na lot about this when I came to Washington. ``Why is Obama picking \nwinners and losers?''\n  It seems to me this is anti-philosophy of allowing the free market to \nwork, because we seem to be favoring--based, I imagine, on very \npowerful lobbies--favoring tax loopholes and tax breaks for certain \nindustries and not allowing them for other industries, and the \nindustries of the future that would help us to have a more blended all-\nof-the-above strategy.\n  I know you have a lot of insight into this, which to me flies in the \nface of conservative ideology. It flies in the face of progressive \nideology. The only ideology that seems to make sense is money interests \nthat want to corrupt a free market, corrupt common sense, and corrupt \nwhat we think should be a unifying force toward moving as a nation \ntoward a more sound energy policy.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. If you have two factories working side-by-side and \none factory is paying attention to making its products and doing the \nbest it can and being as efficient as it can and making a great product \nand going out and selling it, and then the factory next to it has \nfigured out a way to take a big chunk of its costs and push them off on \nto other people--let's say one factory has to clean up its effluent, \nand the other one just dumps it in the river; let's say one factory has \nto pay for cleanup of its trash and disposal and the other just shovels \nit in the neighbor's yard at night; no matter how that second factory \nis cheating by offloading costs onto other people instead of putting \nthem in, you do not have a fair market between those two factories. You \nhave one that is playing by the rules, playing by market theory, and \nyou have one it cannot compete with because the other one is cheating.\n  When fossil fuels dump carbon into our atmosphere and we now know the \nharm it causes, and it comes home to folks at Roy Carpenter's Beach in \nRhode Island, and people's homes are falling into the water; when it \ncomes to storms that smash on the shorefront of New Jersey; when it \ncomes to the wildfires and droughts that we heard of tearing through \nNew Mexico and Colorado; when it comes to ocean acidification, those \nare real costs to real people, and they have been pushed onto the rest \nof us by those polluters, and it simply isn't fair. It is a violation \nof basic market theory. So, if as the Republican party so often says, \n``We want to be the free market party,'' fine, be the free market \nparty, but have it be a fair market. It cannot be a racket of a market. \nIt has to be a free and fair market in which the costs of a product are \nin the price of a product. Otherwise it is just picking winners and \nlosers.\n  Mr. BOOKER. For us then to take the innovators that are trying to \ninvest the money and the resources to keep America on the cutting edge \nof alternative fuels to be denied any kind of flexibility, and for the \nSenator illustrating earlier what is happening at a local level as the \nmoney interests from fossil fuel firms that get involved in \nlegislatures that are trying to do things to create a level playing \nfield, to me that should be something we\n\n[[Page S1445]]\n\nshould all say no to. It should stop completely.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Here are two families. Here are two families who paid \na price. That wasn't built into the price of fossil fuels, but they \nsure as heck paid it and they just didn't pay it in the wrecked front \nof a building and entirely ruined their little house there. They paid \nit also in the loss of all the memories of all the summers where they \ngrew up back when this was their summer home. That is a real price. \nPeople paid a lot when this happened. And to write that off as if it is \nnothing, and have the polluters just keep going at it--no, that is not \nright.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Senator Schatz, I know you have some remarks you would like to make, \nand let me take another opportunity to thank you again for your \nleadership in bringing us together.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island and the Senator \nfrom New Jersey for engaging in such an energetic dialogue about these \nissues.\n  Allow me to brag about Hawaii a little bit. I would like to speak \nabout the incredible work Hawaii has done in energy transformation. We \nhave taken a problem--high energy prices, no in-state fossil fuel \nresources--and turned it into an opportunity to transition the State to \nclean energy. Hawaii, like Alaska and the territories, is \ngeographically isolated from the rest of the country. This relative \nisolation presents unique challenges.\n  Hawaii has some of the highest energy costs in the country. Our \nenergy mix is heavily reliant on oil and our multiple islands mean we \nhave multiple electric grids. This challenging picture also presents \nunparalleled opportunity because the high cost of energy makes \nrenewables not only competitive but often the low-cost option. We have \nabundant natural resources in solar, wind, geothermal, and ocean \nenergy. But that doesn't make a transition to clean energy easy. \nCurrent policies, entrenched modes of thinking, longstanding business \nmodels, along with high upfront costs for capital for clean energy mean \nwe need to aggressively encourage market transformation using a variety \nof policy tools. Thankfully, farsighted and committed policymakers have \nhelped Hawaii to develop and implement some of the most aggressive \nclean energy and efficiency goals in the country.\n  This effort began in earnest in 2008 with a unique partnership \nbetween Hawaii and the U.S. Department of Energy that became the Hawaii \nClean Energy Initiative. Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative, or HCEI, is a \npartnership between the state, the Federal Government, the not-for-\nprofit and the private sectors. It helped to lay out a roadmap for \nHawaii to achieve our aggressive clean energy goals.\n  Our job is far from done, but as a result of this effort I am \noptimistic about Hawaii's energy future and our ability to reduce \ncarbon pollution. I strongly believe that despite Hawaii's unique \ncharacteristics, opportunities exist for other States and regions to \nreplicate the successes we have had. Already energy regulators and \npolicymakers from other parts of the country and the world are coming \nto Hawaii to learn what we are doing. I say that with great \nappreciation for the enormous work others are doing to transition to a \nclean energy future. I do not claim Hawaii has all the answers, but I \ndo think we have discovered some of them.\n  Let's start with a brief overview of the energy sector. We are the \nmost geographically isolated major population center in the world and \nwe are also internally separated, with seven different populated \nislands. We are the most oil-dependent State in the Nation.\n  In 2010, 75 percent of the State's electricity came from foreign \npetroleum. This reliance leads to both high and volatile energy costs. \nHawaii's electricity rates are the highest in the Nation at around 37 \nto 40 cents per kilowatt hour. This is three times the national average \nand twice as high as Alaska's rate, the country's second highest. \nHawaii's multiple islands mean multiple grids that all must be managed \nindependently.\n  Looking forward, the State is considering an undersea transmission \ncable as one of the key possibilities for sharing renewable energy and \nreducing rates throughout the islands. A major consequence of our \ngeography is that the best clean energy resources are not located in \nthe same places as our demand center.\n  Oahu is by far the most populated island with the highest electricity \ndemand, with Waikiki and the Pacific Command, and yet technical \nanalysis has shown that Oahu may only be able to realistically generate \n30 percent of its own energy. Hawaii has been unable to take advantage \nof the mainland's natural gas, while our State continues to pursue its \nclean energy goals. Various groups have begun to explore bringing low-\ncost LNG to Oahu to further transition away from our dependence of low \nsulphur fuel oil for electricity.\n  So back up to 2008 with high energy costs and the desire for greater \nenergy security and the pressing need to get serious about reducing \ncarbon solutions. It was clear we needed to do something. HCEI was \nfounded on a memorandum of understanding signed between the State of \nHawaii and the U.S. DOE in 2008. This partnership resulted in an \nambitious plan to reduce energy consumption by 30 percent and increase \nelectrical generation from renewables to 40 percent of the total mix by \nthe end of 2030. These renewable and efficiency goals are now law. But \nsuch goals, even enshrined in law, need a suite of policy tools to help \nimplement them, and they need the political will to relentlessly see \nthem through.\n  One of the key policy tools aiding compliance with the State's RPS, \nand especially the efficiency standards, is the decoupling of the \nelectric utility's income from fluctuations in sales and revenue. This \nis crucial in a place such as Hawaii where distributed generation is \nplaying an important role in meeting our goals. This way we can ensure \nthat the utility receives financial incentives for increasing renewable \nproduction from independent power producers and decreasing total energy \nuse. Hawaii's decoupling policy began in 2011 and allowed the State \nutility to be compensated through revenue-balancing rate adjustments \napproved by the PUC. Like many other States, Hawaii supplements Federal \ntax incentives to deploy greater technology such as wind, solar, and \ngeothermal. Our incentives create tax incentives for producers at every \nlevel for commercial and resident.\n  In June of last year Hawaii passed legislation to establish a green \ninfrastructure financing program. The Green Energy Market \nSecuritization Program, which we call GEM, creates an integrative \nfinancing model that will help low-to-moderate-income households, \nincluding renters, to take advantage of clean energy improvements and \nenergy efficiency. It aims to address the financial barriers of \ninvesting in and installing energy cost-savings products.\n  The heart of the program is an on-bill financing structure backed by \nstate issue rate reduction bonds that allow customers to overcome the \nhigh upfront costs of clean energy products. What does that mean? It \ndoes this by allowing customers to pay for clean energy investments \nover time via surcharge on their electricity bill. In other words, you \ncan simply sign up for clean energy. Some of the savings go to the \ncompany that is providing you the clean energy, and some of the savings \ngo to you, and all of it gets taken care of by the electric utility on \nyour bill. On-bill financing is a wave of the future whether it is in \nelectricity generation or in energy efficiency. This program will begin \nby targeting distributed solar, but will quickly expand to other \ntechnologies.\n  HCEI also works to promote Hawaii as an attractive place to invest in \ncommercial production of clean energy technologies and serve as a test \nbed for demonstrating and proving out cutting-edge ideas and energy \nmanagement practices. Outside groups have looked at Hawaii, especially \nwhen it comes to smart grid development.\n  In May of 2011, Japan-based New Energy and Industrial Technology \nDevelopment Organization, NEITDO, contributed $37 million as a partner \nto our Maui smart grid project. This is a demonstration project to \nreduce peak loads through demand response to integrate intermittent \nenergy sources, to incorporate grid scale battery storage technology.\n  What does that mean? It means on the island of Maui we have lots and\n\n[[Page S1446]]\n\nlots of wind energy and yet we are lacking in the ability to actually \nutilize all of that energy at the same time. So we are looking at using \ndistributed electric vehicles to take that energy off of the grid and \nbe stored in electric vehicles. Hitachi Corporation, NEITDO, the U.S. \nDOE, our Natural Energy Lab, they are all very interested in trying to \nfigure out how to make our grid more intelligent and more efficient. \nHawaii's high levels of renewable energy penetration, especially on our \nneighbor islands, make it an excellent place for utilities on the \nmainland to come and observe grid operators manage the grid under \ndemanding circumstances. What we are hearing from grid operators across \nthe continental United States is they come to Hawaii to understand the \nkinds of pressures their grid is going to be under in 3 to 5 to 7 to 10 \nyears depending on where they are from.\n  Public investment and early-stage technology companies continue to \nplay a key role. In September of 2013, the Office of Naval Research \nprovided $30 million to support an energy accelerator startup program. \nThis program has already invested in projects that are attracting \nprivate investment including from the local utility. So far it has \nhelped 17 energy companies bring their product to market. These \nproducts have subsequently been able to raise over $38 million in \nfollow-on funding. Let's take a quick look at how Hawaii's energy \nsector has fared in the years since HCEI began.\n\n  In 2012 Hawaii reached an important new milestone by generating \nalmost 14 percent of its electricity from renewable resources. We are \nclose to our stated goal of 15 percent by 2015, which means we are on \ntrack to reach our interim target of 25 percent by the year 2020.\n  In terms of distributed generation--primarily rooftop solar--2012 saw \ninstallations more than double from over 5,000 in 2011 to more than \n12,000 in 2012. At the end of 2012 the cumulative number of systems \nsold statewide totaled 22,000, with a total capacity of 138 megawatts.\n  In energy efficiency, Hawaii had reduced consumption by 14.5 percent \nas of 2012. One of the questions people ask when you make good progress \nin energy efficiency is whether it is simply tracking the economy. In \nother words, generally speaking, when the economy goes down, so does \nenergy consumption. But our energy efficiency gains have been made \nwhether or not our economy has been growing or shrinking. They have \nbeen extraordinarily strong over the last 5 years because we have a \ngreat and aggressive energy conservation program that is really \ngroundbreaking. Rapidly improving energy efficiency efforts, along with \nincreased renewables, have contributed to decreasing energy costs in \nHawaii.\n  From 2008 to 2012 electricity use has declined while the State GDP \ngrew by 9 percent. Hawaii's transformation to a clean energy economy \nhas helped to create many of the State's 14,000-plus green jobs. Hawaii \nranked third in clean energy job growth nationally.\n  The implementation of HCEI goals has not come without challenges. One \nof the biggest challenges has been integrating intermittent renewable \nenergy sources into our various grids--grids that are often quite small \nin scale.\n  Making things even more challenging, much of our renewable energy is \ndistributed, which means that our utility companies don't even know \nwhether they are coming or going. They have no visibility into what is \nhappening with rooftop solar. They are trying to develop technologies \nto understand what is happening with the grid. For example, wind farms \non Maui were recently forced to spill about 28 percent of their energy \nproduction due to lack of demand on the island. In other words, 28 \npercent of our wind energy was actually wasted.\n  Here is a real success story of learning by doing. This fall the Maui \nElectric Company announced recent operational changes to bring that \nnumber down to 9 percent. That is a huge achievement. We didn't have to \ninstall any additional wind turbines, but we are now able to use more \nclean energy on the grid because of technological improvements.\n  In Hawaii we are particularly concerned with ensuring that every \ncitizen can participate in the clean energy economy and benefit from \nthe competitive cost of renewables. I am confident that the State's \nGEMS Program will be a groundbreaking State-level policy that will make \nclean energy and efficiency investments available to all.\n  Finally, we need to keep the momentum going in the face of a changing \nState legislature, State administration, and evolving Federal \npolicies--the latter of which is perhaps the biggest challenge. The \nrecent expiration of the production tax credit and a host of energy \nefficiency and biofuel incentives have had a profound effect on \neconomics of clean energy technologies. These incentives must be \nrenewed, and Congress must and should act to ensure continued growth of \nthe clean energy sector.\n  I am particularly grateful to the chairman of the Finance Committee \nfor joining the task force tonight in calling for action on climate \nchange and greatly appreciate his leadership on these issues.\n  Many, if not most, States and territories are doing excellent work to \nencourage clean energy, and I am sure Hawaii has a lot to learn from \nthose States. But the HCEI model can be an effective tool for States, \nthe Federal Government, and for other countries. It is profoundly \ndifficult to get all or even some of the interests in the energy sector \nto agree. HCEI, especially at the beginning, provided a forum for \nHawaii's different groups to come together and find common ground and \nthen move forward. At its core, HCEI is designed to be a collaborative \neffort between all citizens of Hawaii to leverage their respective \nstrength in achieving a clean energy future. Without the participation \nand cooperation of all of the key players involved and the support of \nthe general public, HCEI would not succeed.\n  I also can't stress enough the importance of the partnership we have \nwith the U.S. DOE. DOE offers a unique ability to act as convener, \nfacilitator, and an active, long-term partner in HCEI. DOE continues to \nserve as a conduit between Hawaii and other entities, such as the \nnational labs, Federal programs, R groups, other Federal agencies, \nand national organizations that support the strategic planning process \nand contribute to the execution of core activities. DOE provides \nassistance to the State for producing technical and economic tools and \nanalysis necessary to realize the goals of initiatives as well as the \nimplementation of pilot projects. If the States are truly the \nlaboratories of democracy, then we in Congress should provide them with \nthe tools they need to experiment and innovate.\n  The United States faces the same energy and environmental challenges \nas the State of Hawaii. A majority of energy assets in this country are \nready for retirement or replacement, and decisions made today will have \nlasting impacts. The energy sector faces a wave of new technology, new \nregulations, and rapidly evolving market and business conditions. These \nuncertainties will impact investment decisions, policy formulations, \nand ultimately economic growth.\n  We must meet the challenge of climate change head-on. We have more \nfrequent and intense extreme weather events, and we need to reduce \nlocalized pollutants and address the increasing number of cyber and \nphysical attacks on our energy infrastructure. These challenges are not \nphysically constrained by State boundaries, jurisdictions, or even our \ninternational borders. Recent blackouts and regional fuel shortages \nhave highlighted the interconnected nature of U.S. energy systems, with \nenergy disruptions starting in one State and extending to neighboring \nStates and regions. This fundamental property of U.S. energy systems \nmeans that preparing for uncertainty and threats in a robust and \neffective manner will require regional and national strategies and \nplans if we are going to successfully address the challenges we face in \nthe coming years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). I welcome and recognize the \nSenator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I would like to offer my grateful thanks \nto the Presiding Officer and Senator Schatz and Senator Boxer, who I \nknow was down here earlier. All of you are true heroes, as well as some \nof our other colleagues who have manned the quiet hours of the \novernight. I know Senator\n\n[[Page S1447]]\n\nHeinrich and Senator Booker spent long hours on the floor arguing with \ngreat voracity and passion about the cause that brings us here today. I \nam humbled to pick up where many of my friends have left off and \nthankful for the bringing of all of us here today.\n  In thinking about this event and thinking about how to frame this \ndebate, I asked some of my friends in Connecticut how they were \nthinking about this issue of climate change. I received a number of \ndifferent responses--one that maybe didn't actually stand out but was \nemblematic about the way my State of Connecticut thinks about climate \nchange--a State that has most of its population right along the \nshoreline.\n  All of our economic assets essentially buffer the State from the \nrising coastal levels. Our State has now gone through--as the Presiding \nOfficer's has--four record and once-in-a-lifetime storms in a period of \na handful of years. This is a State that has been called to action.\n  A rabbi in the greater New Haven area wrote me a very simple note. He \nbecame an activist on the issue of climate change after Superstorm \nSandy. Senator Booker was down here, and clearly his State was hit with \nthe worst of it, but Connecticut was hit hard too. We were hit hard in \na physical sense and economic sense, but we were also hit hard in a \npsychological sense. A lot of people who believed in climate change in \nConnecticut decided to stand up and do something about it when Sandy \nhit.\n  Rabbi Ratner remembers that night when Sandy hit. He said: The winds \nwere so ferocious that my family feared our house would be torn apart \nby the trees on our property. My wife and I grabbed our three little \nchildren and we brought them into our room for safety. Throughout that \nlong night we huddled together, blocking the windows and praying that \nwe would make it through. The experience and the sense of paralysis and \npowerlessness reverberated with me and my family for a long time. As a \nparent, it is not something I am content to let happen again and again.\n  This rabbi has become an activist on the issue of climate. For him, \nit comes from this experience of that evening in Connecticut.\n  I don't live in the extreme coastal parts of Connecticut, but I \nremember that after the lights had gone out that night, the only \nconnection I still had to what was happening along the coastline, as \nthe worst of that storm came in--predicted to be at the level of \nhistoric tidal high tides along the Connecticut shoreline--was my \nsmartphone. I was trying to keep up via Twitter as to what was \nhappening in places such as Greenwich, Bridgeport, and Norwalk. What I \nstarted to see in the moments before I finally lost battery power was \nwhat appeared to be a coming apocalypse. Thanks to lucky coincidence, \nthe worst-case scenario did not happen. In fact, in Connecticut the \nhistoric high tide and the worst of the surge did not actually hit at \nthe same moment as predicted. Lives were spared, and the economic costs \nwere only in the hundreds of millions of dollars rather than in the \ntens of billions of dollars.\n  But for Rabbi Ratner and thousands of others in Connecticut, this was \nthe last straw. This was another once-in-a-lifetime storm happening \nonce again and putting their families, their communities, and our \neconomy at risk. What Rabbi Ratner talks about is this sense of \nparalysis he felt that night. There is a sense of powerlessness as you \nare huddled and holding your children in your home wondering if the \nwalls will still stand up to yet another historic storm as a \nconsequence of changing climate. And what the rabbi figured out is that \nhe actually was not powerless. That night all he could do was really \nhunker down and hope they would survive, but the next morning he could \ngo out and do something about it.\n  The problem is that moment is fleeting. There are only so many hours \nleft before the trendlines that have developed--shown so well by \nSenator Whitehouse in chart after chart--are very hard to turn around. \nIf I have some time later on, I will talk about some of the most \ninsidious trendlines that come not from carbon dioxide emissions but \nfrom what we call fast-acting pollutants, such as methane, HFCs, and \nblack carbon. Once they get into the air, it is very hard to turn back \naround.\n  You are kind of reminded about the parable of the boiling frog. If \nyou put a frog into a pot of boiling water, he will jump right out, but \nif you put him into a pot of cold water and you just gradually turn up \nthe temperature, he will die because he won't recognize over the course \nof those minutes that the water is heating up to an intensity that he \ncan't survive.\n  There are only a handful of moments when that frog can choose to jump \nout before the die is cast because his future is written and his death \nis guaranteed. That is the moment we are in. We can sort of sit back \nand say: Well, it does not seem half bad today. Now we have these \nstorms that are bigger, and crops are vanishing, and species seem to be \nmigrating, but, you know, the water around us is not boiling yet. We \nonly have a matter of minutes for the frog to jump out before it is too \nlate. We are in that period of time in which if we do not make some \ndecisions, pollutants will be so locked into the atmosphere, and the \ntrend lines will be heading so clearly in one way, that there is no way \nto turn around.\n  But this is the moment, as Rabbi Ratner shows, where we have power to \ndo something. I do not want to overstate this analogy because there is \nno reason to equate anyone with the heroism of people like John Lewis \nand Eleanor Holmes Norton. But I went with them this past weekend down \nto Mississippi and Alabama to commemorate what is this year the 49th \nanniversary of the Selma march that resulted in Bloody Sunday, that \neventually inspired LBJ to introduce the 1965 Civil Rights Act, what \nmany people see as a fulcrum point in the civil rights movement.\n  Of course, the idea that had been perpetuated upon African Americans \nin the South was an idea that, one, it is not that bad. Yes, you have \nto go to separate facilities, and, yes, your schools are not the same \nas our schools, but we treat you really nice, and we still allow you to \ndrink from the water fountain, just not our water fountain. We still \nallow you to go to schools, just not the same schools as we do. And \nthere is the sense of powerlessness, that you really cannot do anything \nabout it.\n  As we recreated this march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge with \nCongressman Lewis, I got the chance to march next to one of the foot \nsoldiers in the civil rights movement. Searese Crawford was not a \nfigure that made any headlines, and Searese is not anybody that you \nwill find if you Google her name in the civil rights movement. But \nSearese has a story to tell. She was there in Birmingham when the hoses \nmowed down hundreds of protesters and the dogs were let out to chew up \nthe ankles and knees and legs of those who dared to confront the white \npower structure. She went to jail at 18 years old for 5 days, which has \nto be a harrowing affair, and then she marched on Washington at 19 \nyears old, traveling all the way up here to be a part of that moment.\n  I asked her, I said: Searese, why did you do it?\n  She kind of looked at me with a funny look on her face as if it was a \nsilly question. She said: Well, who else was going to do it?\n  I said: So all of your friends did it?\n  She said: No, none of my other friends did it.\n  I said: Did you tell your parents?\n  She said: No, I didn't tell my parents. I just did it because I knew \nit was the right thing to do.\n  She knew that the situation was not OK. She knew that she was not \npowerless, that she could do something about it. That is why I feel \ninspired tonight to be down here with all of the other Senators--not \nbecause I am trying to equate this small act of civil disobedience with \nthose of the civil rights movement, but because this is an attempt, as \nthe presiding officer has said over and over in his soliloquies on the \nSenate floor, to wake up to this issue and to the idea that what is \nhappening today is real, that it is almost irreversible, and that we \nare not powerless to do something about it.\n  So I want to talk for just a little while this morning about my State \nof Connecticut, which as I mentioned is particularly impacted by \nclimate change. I want to talk a little bit about that dual discussion, \nabout how we recognize that this is a real problem, not\n\n[[Page S1448]]\n\none that can be papered over by the oil companies and by the fossil \nfuel companies and by the Koch brothers and everyone else who would try \nto perpetuate this mythology across this country that we do not have to \npay attention to the issue of climate change, not unlike the white \npower structure in the South perpetuated the mythology that African \nAmericans really did not have to worry about the way in which they were \nbeing treated. Then I also wish to talk a little bit about the path \nforward and how hopeful it is.\n  I thought the presiding officer's comments were spot-on--in response \nto a very apt parable and story from Senator Booker--in which the \npresiding officer sort of challenged this idea that there is really any \ndanger in lurching into all of the things necessary to fix the problem \nof climate change.\n  In fact, there is enormous opportunity, not just moral opportunity \nbecause we are doing the right thing. That is, of course, probably our \nfirst charge as Members of the most powerful legislative body in the \nworld, but also there is enormous economic potential in the ability for \nthis country to capture literally millions of jobs that some nation \nacross the world is going to have as we try to combat climate change.\n  So let me first tell you about what climate change means to us in \nConnecticut. Here is an example of what it means to the Nation as well \nthrough the lens of one company in Connecticut, and that is Electric \nBoat. Electric Boat is a company that employs a lot of folks in both \nthe presiding officer's State and my State. For those of you who do not \nknow what Electric Boat does, they make submarines. They, along with a \ncompany in Virginia, make every single submarine that goes out across \nthis world in order to protect the people of this country. There is \nmaybe no more important defense asset to the United States today than \nthe submarines which provide a multisystemic platform with which to \nprotect this country. We do reconnaissance and surveillance off of \nthem. We use them in times of war to launch attacks to defend our \nhomeland, for charting the maneuvers and operation of other navies \nacross the world.\n  The reality is that you cannot make submarines inland. It probably \ngoes without saying, but you have to make submarines right next to the \nwater because these suckers are big. When you finish making them, you \nhave to deliver them right into the water. So we make them in Groton, \nCT. Since the inception the submarine building program in Groton, we \nhave lost 100 feet of coastline in Groton at Electric Boat.\n  Now, 100 feet of coastline, that is a lot of coastline anywhere. But \nmaybe you can manage that if you are in a residential area or in an \narea of marshland; maybe you can figure out ways to adjust. But when \nyou have a multibillion dollar presence sitting right on the water, \nwhen you have literally hundreds of millions of dollars of machinery \nand equipment and training resources right on Long Island Sound, the \nloss of 100 feet of coastline jeopardizes the ability to make \nsubmarines.\n\n  With sea levels rising at 4 millimeters a year, it is not long before \nthe entirety of our submarine building industry is compromised by \nrising sea levels. Every day, Electric Boat, a for-profit private \ncompany that protects this Nation, is thinking about ways to try to \nforce the water back out of their facility so that they can continue to \nmake boats that protect this country.\n  I know the presiding officer has talked already about the effect on \nlocal agriculture. People do not think about Connecticut as an ag \nState, but we are. We have already seen the impact of these changing \nclimates on Connecticut. I will just give one example. Cranberry Hill \nFarm is a specialty crop producer in Ashford, CT. They produce heirloom \nvegetables. They produce heritage breeds of chickens. They produce a \nlot of firewood for the community, and they produce maple syrup.\n  The owner of Cranberry Hill Farm is adapting to managing a farm in a \nwildly unpredictable climate. In April of 2012, Connecticut faced a 90-\ndegree heat wave for a week. We are used to heat waves in the \nNortheast, but we are certainly not used to the number of extended \nperiods of high-level temperatures that we are having today as a result \nof climate change. So this heat wave caused the strawberry crop at \nCranberry Hill to bloom early. Then, when the temperatures dropped back \ndown to average-April levels, the strawberry crop did not survive. \nStrawberry crops cannot survive a 90-degree heat wave in April. They \nare not built for that. So Cranberry Hill Farm lost the entirety of \ntheir strawberry crop for that season.\n  I wish that was the exception to the rule. But that story can be \nrepeated over and over across Connecticut. Farmers, especially small \nfarmers in Connecticut, that is what we have. We have a lot of farmers. \nWe have a growing number of farms, frankly. We have more and more \npeople going into farming. But they farm pretty small plots of land, \nand they cannot be, with small acreage, terribly diversified. So when a \nfarm like Cranberry Hill loses a strawberry crop, that jeopardizes \ntheir whole operation. There just is not the resiliency in New England \nfarming because of the small size and limited scope that you may not \nhave in other places.\n  But at least when it comes to something like strawberries or other \nspecialty crops, they can hope that they are going to be able to do \nbetter next year. But for their maple syrup operations, which is a big \ndeal in Connecticut and across the Northeast, the prospects are pretty \nseriously dire. As Connecticut summers get hotter and they got longer, \nwhat we are seeing is a receding sugar bush tree line. The sugar bush \nis a temperate tree and the hot summers are driving those trees farther \nnorthward. So with record-breaking heat waves hitting my State every \nsingle summer, Connecticut's maple syrup industry may not survive at \nall.\n  In Connecticut, that is a big deal. That is an industry that employs \na lot of people. I just personally would panic if I did not have my \nConnecticut maple syrup. But what we have seen is that the hotter \ntemperatures are moving industries further north. Senator King maybe \ntold this story earlier tonight if he was on the floor. I have heard \nhim tell it before. He talks about the temporary benefit that Maine has \nreceived because our Nation's lobsters are moving.\n  As the temperature of the water on the Atlantic coastline grows \nhotter and hotter, the lobsters are pretty quickly figuring that out. \nThey are not as dumb as you may think. They are retreating north. So \nfor the time being, Maine is having a bounty because they have all of \nConnecticut's lobsters. That, however, has been disastrous for States \nlike ours. In places like Connecticut and Rhode Island, we have seen \nthe wholesale evisceration of the fishing industry, especially those \nlobstermen in Connecticut who were once a defining feature of our \nlandscape and of our economy.\n  They had to move or just shut down operations because the temperature \nof the water, in part, is forcing the lobsters to move to a different \nplace. So whether it is maple syrup or strawberries or lobsters, \nConnecticut's maritime industry and our agricultural sector have \nalready been fundamentally transformed.\n  Let's talk about two other things that really matter to us in \nConnecticut. I heard the presiding officer reference one of these \nsubjects a little bit earlier. We have a pretty big tourist industry in \nConnecticut. One of the reasons for that is that over the course of the \nfall, we get hundreds of thousands of people, certainly at least tens \nof thousands of people, who drive through the beautiful stretches of \nnorthwestern Connecticut and eastern Connecticut in which the fall \nfoliage just lights up New England like a Christmas tree.\n  Those tourists bring with them to Connecticut their wallets, their \npocketbooks, and they deposit a little bit of money with us in what we \ncolloquially will call leaf-peeping season. It is a big deal to our \nState.\n  Climate change is having today and will continue to have an effect on \nfall foliage. For a lot of people that sounds like maybe a small, minor \nconsequence, that leaves in Connecticut will look a different color, \nbut in Connecticut it is a big part of our fall industry.\n  Climate change is making our summers much hotter, making there be \nmore 90-degree days and this, in turn, will affect these brilliant fall \ncolors on the trees. Many of those trees will migrate north or die out, \nand the timing\n\n[[Page S1449]]\n\nof that transition from summer to fall fundamentally changes in a lot \nof ways. Many of these tree species which present the most vibrant \ncolors may completely be gone.\n  Skiing is another industry that matters to us in Connecticut. We \ndon't have the big mountains Vermont and New Hampshire and Maine have, \nand I know our friends out in the Midwest don't even accept what we \nhave to offer in the northeast qualifies as big mountains, but in New \nEngland, of course, skiing is a very big deal and it is a major \nindustry. We are having trouble, as we speak, keeping Connecticut \nslopes open.\n  We have had one, I guess it is a hill--not a mountain--that brings in \nmillions of dollars to Connecticut's economy called Powder Ridge not \nfar from my home in Cheshire, CT. It has been an off-and-on prospect \nwith families and operators starting it up, stopping it, starting it up \nand stopping it, because they are on a year-to-year lifeline due to the \nfact that there is less snow and less people coming onto the slopes.\n  Estimates suggest that over the course of the next half a century, \nthe skiing industry is likely to vanish in Connecticut.\n  This is a multimillion dollar industry in places such as Ski Sundown, \nMohawk Mountain, and others that are in small towns in places such as \nnorthwestern Connecticut. Those small-town economies will essentially \ncollapse if they don't have the central organizing principle of their \nwinters, which are the ski mountain, the ski lodge, and the thousands \nof families who come from all over Connecticut and all over New England \nto ski there. Our ski industry in Connecticut already is in jeopardy, \nbut it is going to get worse if we don't do something about it.\n  Maybe what is scariest, though, is what is happening with these \nstorms along the coastline. I mentioned this a little bit in the story \nof the rabbi who sheltered his family, but we are not unlike most other \nStates across the Atlantic in that we were initially, as a State, a \nmaritime community, so we built up our State along our waterways. To \nus, that was essentially Long Island Sound and the Connecticut River. \nToday, if you track development, it has migrated outside of those \ncorridors. It is still basically centralized along the Connecticut \nRiver, which now is not coincidental to Interstate 95 and the Long \nIsland Sound which is not coincidental to both Interstate 95 and the \nAmtrak line.\n  What is most troubling is the fact that these storms attacking us \nwith increasing ferocity and severity are no longer a nuisance. They \npresent a catastrophic potential for Connecticut's entire economy.\n  I will give us one example of how close we came during Superstorm \nSandy to an absolutely economy-ravaging disruption of our rail lines. \nThe Amtrak line runs down Connecticut's coastline. If we take a little \nkayak down across the Long Island Sound--which I will do virtually \nevery summer--there are long stretches of that kayak ride in which we \ncan see the Amtrak line lying literally on top of the wetlands that \nshelter the land from the sea or within just a handful of yards. Now \nwhether that was a smart decision, in retrospect, I can't tell you. But \nwe built up our main rail line, which provides billions of dollars of \neconomic benefit to the entirety of the Northeast corridor in \nConnecticut right on the shoreline. This is a line that obviously \nmillions of Connecticut consumers use but connects Boston to New York \nand to Washington, DC. It is the vital life link between some of the \nbiggest economic centers in the entire world.\n  When Superstorm Sandy hit, it completely obliterated a sand dune near \nRocky Neck State Park that essentially took the bullet for a rail \nbridge that was just feet behind it. We were fortunate at this sort of \npoint of exposure to have an enormous sand dune that was standing right \nnext to the rail bridge. All of our ecologists and all of our disaster \nexperts tell us that if that sand dune wasn't there, then that bridge \nwould have been obliterated.\n  If you lose just a stretch of track, you can probably rebuild that in \na handful of days or weeks. But if you lose a bridge along the Amtrak \nline, that is a disruption that will likely take you months to recover \nfrom. That is a disruption that will be, as I said, catastrophic to the \nentire northeastern corridor. If you lose the ability to move people by \nrail from New York to Boston, that kills thousands, tens of thousands, \nof jobs. If you can no longer take a train from Rhode Island to \nWashington, DC, that eliminates commerce. That kills jobs.\n  That sand dune is gone. So if there is another storm, then all that \nis left to protect the rest of Connecticut from that storm surge is \nthat rail bridge, and it is likely to come down.\n  We are going to do the hard work of rebuilding that sand dune, but \nthat is not the only place along the Connecticut shoreline in which the \nAmtrak line is in harm's way. As we talk on the floor about the rising \nsea level tides we have, it is just a matter of time before there is no \nsand dune that is big enough to withstand the storm surge that will hit \nthe Amtrak line and knock it out of service potentially for weeks and \nfor months.\n  Our beaches are part of our economy as well. The estimate with \nrespect to Hammonasset Beach State Park--which is a beautiful beach \nthat tens of thousands of Connecticut residents go to--but people from \nall across the country and all across the world flock to every year--\nfrankly, I am lucky enough to spend a good part of my summer down on \nthe Connecticut shoreline. My family has had a little beach house in \nOld Lyme that I get to go to, which is essentially right next to the \nHammonasset Beach State Park. I can't tell the number of license plates \nwe see from Canada, Quebec, and Ontario, that are coming down to spend \ntheir summers on the Connecticut beaches. They rent a little house or \nthey park their RV or they camp out on the campground surrounding both \nRocky Neck State Park and Hammonasset Beach State Park. They spend \nthousands of dollars, each family, over the course of August or the \nseveral weeks that they come down in the local part of the economy. So \nmuch of that part of the State is built up over beach tourism that \ncomes into Hammonasset Beach State Park and to Rocky Neck State Park.\n\n  The Department of Energy & Environmental Protection tells us that by \nthe end of this century--and it could come faster if the worst-case \nscenarios come true--Hammonasset Beach State Park will be gone. It just \nwon't exist any longer. The scope of the tides and the water will be \nsuch that our economy-driving, dollar-generating State park--which is a \nbeautiful place to go and which brings joy to thousands of families--\nwill not exist any longer.\n  While I don't have the estimate for Rocky Neck, I know the geography \nand it would suggest to me that if Hammonasset is going to be gone by \nthe end of this century, then Rocky Neck is probably not far behind.\n  The insurance industry is not located along our shorelines, but it \nemploys thousands of people. We are the insurance State, Hartford, CT. \nWe are the insurance capital of the world. If our friends on the \nRepublican side of the aisle don't believe the scientists, then \nhopefully they may believe the market. Our Republican friends tell us \nthat they take their cues from the private market. The private market \nis very quickly having to adjust to the reality of climate change \nbecause, as storm after storm hits the northeast and as storms ravage \nthe gulf coast and more severe weather--often in the form of tornados--\nhits the Midwest, it is the insurance companies that in most cases ride \nto the rescue. They ride to the rescue with billions of dollars that \nthey have to pay out. The only way they adjust is by raising premiums \non all the rest of us. Companies such as Travelers and The Hartford, \nsome of the biggest property casualty insurers in the world, which are \nheadquartered in Hartford, CT, will tell us their models are \nfundamentally changing because they know climate change to be a \nreality.\n  They aren't budgeting premiums in the future on the belief that these \nare just freak temporary occurrences. The biggest insurance companies \nin the country--indeed, in the world--are making economic decisions \nbased upon their rock-solid belief that the 99 percent of climate \nscientists that are referred to on the floor are telling the truth. So \nrates are increasing. The exposure for Connecticut's insurance industry \nis expanding.\n\n[[Page S1450]]\n\n  I think about the expansion of flood plain zones. Today, about 11 \npercent of New York City is in a flood-risk zone. Within the next \nseveral decades, the estimates from the insurance industry are that 34 \npercent of New York City is going to be in flood-risk zones. If you are \nin one of these zones, you obviously pay a severe premium when it comes \nto your insurance cost. Now while maybe in some way, shape, or form I \nam glad that part of that money will migrate to Connecticut's insurance \ncompanies, it gets sucked out of millions of businesses all across this \ncountry. They are having to pay the insurance premiums because the \ninsurance companies are planning on climate change.\n  The insurance companies are planning on this body doing absolutely \nnothing about it, resulting in billions of dollars more in premiums \nfrom small companies, big companies, mom-and-pop stores, and homeowners \nall across this country.\n  We are going to become a sicker State as well, and that comes with \ncosts too. Lyme disease--named after a particularly beautiful part of \nthe world, Lyme, CT, and Old Lyme, CT--absolutely ravages tens of \nthousands of people in Connecticut. If someone knows anyone with Lyme \ndisease, they know how insidious a disease it is because it initially \npresents with systems that are a little hard to detect that are masked \nby other illnesses. It is still sometimes very troublesome and tricky \nto treat. Often antibiotic treatments will zap Lyme disease within the \nfirst couple of days or months, but there are people across the State \nof Connecticut with what we refer to as chronic Lyme disease and who \ndon't respond to antibiotic treatment. It is life changing. It really \nis life changing and it forces many people to be bedridden, out of the \nworkforce, and living fundamentally different lives than they had \nplanned.\n  With warmer and wetter conditions in Connecticut, our epidemiologists \nand our disease scientists tell us we are going to see an increase in \nthe deer tick. We are going to see, as we have already, an increase in \nthe diagnosis of Lyme disease. And the mosquito-borne diseases, such as \neastern equine encephalitis virus, along with Nile virus, which impacts \npeople but also livestock--horses--and wild birds, are going to become \nmore prevalent as well.\n\n  As you sort of figure out what the consequence of this is, the story \njust gets worse and worse. So as you have wetter and warmer conditions, \nas we have today, and the mosquitoes and the deer ticks start to \ninfest, especially in our coastal areas, then you have to engage in \nmosquito-control measures, and that historically has involved draining \nor ditching wetlands, which has enormous environmental consequences for \nthose areas. That further erodes a lot of our maritime industries that \ndepend in part on those wetlands staying healthy and happy.\n  The other way you deal with mosquitoes is you spray aerially. After \ndecades of bad history with pesticides and aerial spraying, we know how \ncareful you have to be about that. The reality is that you are going to \nsee a mist floating down on tens of thousands of homes and \nneighborhoods and kids as we try to stamp out the increasing numbers of \nmosquitoes that come to places such as Connecticut as climate change \nguarantees warmer and wetter climates.\n  So we lose jobs, we increase costs, we see entire industries \nevaporate from Connecticut, and we become a more expensive and a sicker \nplace. But the folks I got to spend some time with this last weekend in \nplaces such as Selma and Jackson, and tiny little towns in the \nMississippi Delta, such as Money and Ruleville, saw a better day. They \nsaw the ability to change their circumstances.\n  On the other side of that fight an epic battle that, not unlike the \nfight we have here today, combined individual decisions people had to \nmake to change their lives and the way they treated people, small \ntestaments of courage by people such as Sarah C. Crawford, but it also \ninvolved a fight here in the Senate that eventually culminated in the \nCivil Rights Act. They recognized that the path to justice for African \nAmericans didn't actually come with much pain at all, that the path to \neconomic and racial justice for Blacks across this country lifted up \neverybody.\n  And if you talk to a lot of White Mississippians or White citizens of \nAlabama, they will tell you that they felt as if there was a \npsychological and mental weight lifted from them, and they saw the \neconomies of their States improve.\n  I don't know all of the history, but many people suggest that in the \nyears following World War II, Birmingham, AL, was poised to become the \neconomic crossroads of the South, that it could have become an economic \npowerhouse rivaling cities of today such as Atlanta in the South, but \nit didn't because of the fact that racial injustice held it back. Once \nthey figured out that was both a moral stain on that State and an \neconomic stain, they changed their ways.\n  Again, not to overstate the comparison--it is just in my brain \nbecause I was there this last weekend--so goes the story for the fight \nagainst climate change in the sense that the pathway to addressing this \nissue runs through the creation of millions of jobs in this country as \nwell as cleaner air to breathe and cleaner water to drink for all of \nour citizens and kids across the country. So if I could, I would like \nto run through a handful of examples of how this could matter to my \nState as well.\n  Connecticut has built a pretty serious and I think pretty impressive \nfuel cell industry. Fuel cells aren't renewable resources in the sense \nthat they use a small amount of gas that mixes together with elements \ninside the fuel cell to produce what is essentially an ultra-clean \nsource of energy. There is virtually no pollutant coming out of fuel \ncells, so there is almost no contribution to global warming from these \nfuel cells. They are changing the climate, but they are also creating a \nlot of jobs in Connecticut.\n  On December 20, 2013, Connecticut opened its first utility-scale fuel \ncell farm in Bridgeport, CT. It was manufactured and built by a company \nin Connecticut that employs hundreds of people--the world's biggest \nfuel cell company, Fuel Cell Energy. It is located on a former \nbrownfield. It is the first powerplant like this of fuel cells in North \nAmerica, and at 15 megawatts it is producing enough power to supply \npower to 15,000 homes. It is a serious facility, and it is creating \nhundreds of jobs in places such as Danbury and Torrington, CT.\n  The problem, though, is this fuel cell farm in Bridgeport, CT, is the \nexception rather than the rule. Fuel Cell Energy is selling most of its \nproducts in Asia. It is selling most of its products in Korea. Over the \nyears the Korean Government has kind of figured out what the gig is, \nthat its main seller of fuel cells is creating jobs in the United \nStates while they are selling product into Korea. So Korea has \nessentially said to Fuel Cell Energy: Your time is up. We will continue \nto buy a handful of these fuel cells from you over the coming years, \nbut by the end of this decade we want to produce all of those fuel \ncells in Korea, and we want you to transfer the technology and transfer \nthe jobs to us.\n  Fuel Cell Energy doesn't have any choice in this matter because if \nKorea decides they do not want to buy from them, they will buy from \nsomebody else. So they have to essentially do an agreement in which \nthey transfer that technology and transfer those jobs. Those are \nhundreds of jobs today in Connecticut but potentially thousands of jobs \nin the future as we power up fuel cells all across the country.\n\n  The reason they are not selling fuel cells in this country is because \nwe don't have a renewable energy strategy to really advantage those \nsources, which, admittedly, today costs a little bit more than \npurchasing energy from a grid powered by things such as coal and by \noil. But when you weigh the jobs that can be created in the fuel cell \nindustry against the slightly marginally higher cost of getting that \nenergy from a fuel cell rather than getting that energy from a coal-\nfired powerplant or an oil-fired powerplant, there is a pretty darn \ngood argument that you should invest in fuel cells.\n  So, to Connecticut, this is a matter of jobs, especially in the fuel \ncell industry.\n  Greenskies Renewable Energy is a company in Middletown, CT, and they \ndesign and install big solar arrays. They do not manufacture the \nequipment, but they design these big solar\n\n[[Page S1451]]\n\narrays and they install them. It was started in 2008 by a former Peace \nCorps volunteer in Mali. The company doesn't charge customers any \nupfront costs for solar power. Instead, they typically sign customers \nto long-term contracts, and Greenskies purchases the solar energy they \nare producing on their buildings. Greenskies has installed over 70,000 \nsolar panels across the country, and they have offset 15 million pounds \nof CO2. That is the equivalent of 763,000 gallons of \ngasoline being burned.\n  In 2012 they got their biggest contract yet. They won a contract to \nbuild solar arrays on 27 Walmart stores in Massachusetts. That is a $30 \nmillion contract.\n  In 2013 they announced plans to build a 43-acre solar farm in East \nLyme that is going to be 16,000 solar panels. That solar farm alone in \nEast Lyme will be able to power 6,300 homes. That is pretty significant \nin terms of the amount of power it is going to be able to put on the \ngrid, but it is also significant in terms of the number of jobs that \nwill be created. Today Greenskies may be employing dozens of people, \nbut they are going to be hiring hundreds and thousands of people as \nthey install all of these solar arrays in Connecticut and Massachusetts \nand for clients all across the Northeast.\n  Another company playing in the solar space is a company called Apollo \nSolar. It is based in Bethel, CT. It is a small company. Today it only \nemploys about 10 people. But they manufacture the electronic equipment \nthat filters power from a solar cell and allows it to be stored in a \nbattery. That is really the future, the idea that every individual home \nis going to be a small powerplant where you can put solar panels on \nyour roof, then take the power that is being produced by the solar \npanel, store it in a battery, and then use it at the moment at which \nprices on the grid are the highest or, if you want, sell it back to the \ngrid at the moment at which you can get the most return for this little \nstored amount of energy you have created by the solar panels on your \nroof.\n  Today, Apollo Solar has become a significant supplier for cell phone \ntowers in the developing world, especially in Africa. Countries in \nAfrica just don't have the electric grids we have, so if they want cell \ntowers to be able to provide lifesaving cell coverage to their \nresidents, then they have to essentially power these cell towers on an \nindividual tower-by-tower basis. And if you don't do it with solar \narrays, then you have to do it with diesel generators, which produce \nenormous amounts of black carbon. That makes the air very difficult to \nbreathe, and it is also much more expensive.\n  Apollo Solar has produced this technology for cell towers. Right now \nit is being used in places such as Africa, but eventually this \ntechnology can be used in millions of homes all across Connecticut and \nall across the country, and that is going to fundamentally change the \nway in which we engage with the electric grid.\n  We think Apollo Solar is poised to become an industry leader on this \nissue. Today it is only a handful of people, but this is one example of \nthousands of companies all across Connecticut and all across this \ncountry that are poised to explode in growth if we do the smart thing \nand decide we are going to create a renewable energy market here in the \nUnited States.\n  It is important to say that neither Greenskies nor Apollo Solar is \nmaking those solar panels because much of that work is being done in \nother countries--countries that do have domestic markets for renewable \nenergy, countries such as Germany and China. So despite the successes \nof companies that install these big solar arrays and successes of \ncompanies such as Apollo Solar that create the attendant technology \nattached to the solar panels, there is so much more we could do if we \nhad that domestic market here.\n  The point is that we have an enormous opportunity to create millions \nof jobs in this country based on this technology. The imperative should \nbe one surrounding the public health effects of climate, the imperative \nshould be around the life-changing catastrophic consequences of rising \nsea levels, the added cost to our economy that comes with entire \nindustries such as those in Connecticut--the maple syrup industry, the \nfall tourism industry, the skiing industry, and the lobster industry--\nevaporating and disappearing before our eyes. That should be the \nimperative.\n  Being a country that has only 5 percent of the world's population but \n25 percent of the world's pollution in carbon emissions, we more than \nany other nation in the world have to play a role in this global \neconomic and environmental imperative. But beyond that, there are \nenormous job gains to come if we make the right decision.\n  Lastly, before I turn it back over to the Senator from Hawaii for \nsome remarks--and I will stay on the floor because I would like to \nmaybe talk a little about short-lived climate pollutants, if I have the \ntime--New England is an example of a place that has figured out how to \ndo this the right way. The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative--we call \nit RGGI--is the first market-based regulatory program in the United \nStates to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It is a cooperative effort \namongst Northeastern States to cap and reduce carbon dioxide emissions \nfrom the power sector. It is essentially just a miniversion of \nlegislation which we have debated here in Congress. We essentially set \na cap for how much carbon we are going to produce in the northeast. We \nallow emitters of pollution to trade credits and decide for themselves \nwhat cost point-source polluters are willing to pay for the ability to \nsend carbon dioxide into the air.\n\n  We have heard over and over the horror stories coming from our \nfriends on the Republican side. As a member of the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee in the House of Representatives, when we debated the Waxman-\nMarkey bill, we heard over and over that electricity prices were going \nto dramatically spike; and, yes, you are going to have the benefit to \nthe environment from reducing carbon dioxide, but you are going to have \ncatastrophic consequences for the economy because everybody is going to \nhave to pay for it.\n  I guess I can understand how people would believe that if there \nwasn't any empirical evidence to test their theory. Luckily, New \nEngland has just that evidence. New England has tested this idea. \nFrankly, the whole world has tested this idea because we have reduced \nozone-depleting pollutants based on a similar protocol. But in New \nEngland we have taken on this issue.\n  RGGI has been an unqualified success. Our carbon-reducing plan in New \nEngland has prevented the release of 2.3 million tons of carbon dioxide \ninto the atmosphere, the equivalent of taking 435,000 cars off the road \nfor a year. The program will offset 8.5 million megawatt hours of \nelectricity generation and avoid the release of 8 million tons of \nCO2. The program is going to generate $1.6 billion in net \neconomic benefit regionwide, and it is putting $1.1 billion in \nelectricity bill savings into the pockets of consumers in the region \nover the next decade. That is maybe the most important number.\n  In addition to preventing the release of 2.3 million tons of \nCO2 pollution, it is reducing the energy bills for New \nEngland consumers by over $1 billion. Wow. How does that happen? How do \nyou restrict emissions and then reduce pollution? We take all the money \nwe glean in people buying the credits necessary to pollute and we put \nit right back into energy efficiency. We put it right back into \nprograms which actually allow consumers to use less electricity, to \nmake their homes more efficient, to transfer over to furnaces which \nwill use less energy. All of these energy efficiency investments cancel \nout and override the price to the energy producers of having to comply \nwith the new requirements.\n  It is pretty simple calculus, but it works for us in New England. We \nhave taken the equivalent of two coal-fired powerplants offline, and we \nhave returned $1 billion in savings to rate payers. We have done \nsomething about the scourge of climate change that people have been \ntalking about overnight and we have saved people a whole boat load of \nmoney.\n  I guess this is why the Presiding Officer and Senator Schatz decided \nto engage in this exceptional exercise, to come down to the floor of \nthe Senate tonight because we just don't understand how people don't \nsee this.\n  If this were really a fight as some people make it, between the \nquality of our air and the quality of our economy, then let's have at \nit. Let's come down and have that debate. But it is not, and\n\n[[Page S1452]]\n\nwe have proved that in Connecticut. This isn't just guesswork. This \nisn't estimation. This isn't conjecture. In Connecticut we have proved \nwe can make significant gains to reduce climate pollutants, create \njobs, and save people money.\n  This is a triple whammy. We get a cleaner environment, become a \nglobal leader, create a whole bunch of jobs and save a whole bunch of \npeople money. Why on earth wouldn't you do that? Unless this debate has \nbeen hijacked by the very small number of people today who make money \noff the status quo. I don't have the exact quote. I should have brought \nit down here. We probably shouldn't look to Machiavelli for political \nadvice. He, before anybody else, painted for us a picture of the \nchallenge presented to the reformer. The reformer's job, he said, is \nthe toughest job in the world, because those who will benefit from the \nnew order have trouble seeing it today, but those who will be harmed by \nthe new order, those who exist in the status quo, see the peril in the \nmost acute sense and fight the hardest to preserve it.\n  So, yes, there are people who face a perilous future, but they are a \nvery small number of people, and they are people who run the old-line \nenergy businesses which are clinging to the status quo today, who are \nflooding this debate with millions of dollars to try to affect it. But \nas even they will find, there are even bigger, brighter opportunities \non the other side. I imagine even the Koch brothers are industrious \nenough and innovative enough to figure out how to make a whole mess of \nmoney off of the renewable energy economy. I argue they will make even \nmore money.\n  So I thank Senator Schatz, Senator Boxer, and the Presiding Officer \nfor leading this effort. I will stick around on the floor to engage in \ndiscussion, but this is a triple win: Combat climate change, create \njobs, and save people money. It is time for the Senate and time for the \nCongress to wake up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am honored to follow my colleague \nand very good friend, the Senator from Connecticut, and to join him, \nthe Presiding Officer, the Senator from Rhode Island; the Senator from \nHawaii, Senator Schatz; and Senator Boxer, the Senator from California, \nin this really very inspiring and exciting occasion.\n  I was driving to the Capitol early this morning and I saw in the \nblack sky the beautiful dome which words can barely capture in its \nbeauty. Many have tried. But I felt so fortunate to be here as a \nspokesperson and an advocate for this cause which truly is about the \nrest of this century, the rest of this planet's life, our children and \ntheir children, and to be part of a debate which has reached through \nthe night. But in fact it is night only here. In many parts of the \nworld already it is day.\n  If we think globally, we realize the planet truly never sleeps. It is \nawake for the night here. Someplace in the world there is daylight. \nHopefully, during this debate we have shed light at a time of darkness \non a debate which is so critical to the future of our Nation.\n  We are only a few Members of the Senate here, but I cannot help \nrecalling what the famous scientist and conservationist Margaret Mead \nsaid about this cause and the importance of people in this cause: Never \ndoubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change \nthe world; indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.\n  Around the world where it is daylight or still dark, there are groups \nof committed people willing to put their lives and their voices on the \nline to save this planet from climate disruption. We are not talking \nabout climate change. We are talking about disruption--planet \ndisruption. We are not talking about small consequences which may alter \nthe quality of life a bit here and there. We are talking about \nhorrendous, gargantuan changes because they are incremental and they \naccumulate one by one, bit by bit, until they alter our shoreline in \nConnecticut, our vegetation, our produce, our recreation industry, all \nof what makes Connecticut the great State it is in its scenic and \nnatural beauty, and all of what makes America the great country it is--\nnot only in its beauty but in its economic strength and its vision for \nthe future.\n  I thank Senators Whitehouse, Boxer, and Schatz for bringing us \ntogether, all of my colleagues for joining in this debate, and all who \nworked through the night--whether it is the guards or the pages or all \nwho tirelessly gave us the opportunity to really make the case, much as \nwe would in court--whether it is a closing argument or an opening \nstatement--for the need that all of us unite in this critical cause.\n  The gravity of climate disruption cannot be denied. There are people \nwho deny it. No question that there are deniers. But the science is \nirrefutable. The facts are there. And as Ronald Reagan said, facts are \na stubborn thing. We can't change them by rhetoric in this body, and we \ncan't make them go away in storytelling. We can read our children's \nbooks, Dr. Seuss or others, about the wonderful things which happen in \nfantasy or nightmares which may occur to people also in their dreams.\n  But in the real world, the science is well established. The science \ntells us climate disruption is happening as we speak, relentlessly and \ntirelessly. This is why we are here today.\n  The compassion that we as legislators demonstrate indicates we care \nabout the people who occupy this planet now, but also about the many \nothers who will follow us. We are here to break the culture of \nindifference in a busy world which is awake all the time, is so global \nin its reach, and is digitally connected at all moments. There is a \ntendency to move forward and forget about what is fundamental and \nimportant, and that is climate disruption.\n  To break this culture of indifference toward pollution and climate \ndisruption, we must reverse the practices and policies which accelerate \nthis dramatic and destructive trend in our world.\n  In Connecticut we have already seen firsthand the effects of climate \ndisruption. Severe weather events used to occur once in a generation. \nThey are now becoming the new norm. These monstrous storms--whatever \nthey are called, Irene or Sandy--they are the new norm. In just the \ntime I began serving in the Senate, since January 2011, Connecticut has \nexperienced four major storms claiming lives and costing millions of \ndollars in damage, culminating in the unprecedented Superstorm \nSandy. Now we can call Sandy a hurricane or superstorm or whatever you \nwill. We can call these weather events inevitable or surprising, but \nthey are becoming the new normal because of climate disruption. In \nFebruary 2011 a snowstorm cost the State $20 million, and the \nleadership of our Governor was exemplary, but remedying the effects of \nthe storm does not prevent them, and even preparing for them does not \nforestall them, because the weather is bigger than any action of man, \nand man can control it only by fundamental changes in the way he or she \nlives. The snowfall in February 2011 was followed by tropical storm \nIrene that wreaked $546 million in damages. The people of Connecticut \nhad barely any time to recover before a freak October snowstorm brought \nan additional $614 million of devastation to the State.\n\n  Hurricane Sandy struck a year later, causing record-breaking damage \nand devastation to Connecticut as well as the states of New Jersey, New \nYork, and Rhode Island when the storm cleared. When all this \ndestruction was tallied, Connecticut found itself facing damage of $770 \nmillion as well as incalculable harm to houses, beaches, and other \nplaces along the coast. I toured the coast. I saw the damage. The \nferocity and fury of that storm could be comprehended only by seeing \nthat damage or being in the midst of it, which I was for a short period \nat the very start when I went to tour the energy operations center in \nplaces such as Norwalk and Greenwich, along the coast where preparation \nwas beginning for that storm. Driving back on I-95 as the storm \ngathered in its ferocity and fury, I was frightened in a way that all \nof us should now share as we see the prospect of that fury and ferocity \nof nature, destructively impacting our entire planet, our world, and \nour children's world.\n  We must heed Hurricane Sandy's warning as well as the alarms sounded \nby other storms and take steps to stop climate destruction and global \nwarming. The evidence beyond the anecdotal\n\n[[Page S1453]]\n\nfacts that we all see is irrefutable scientific evidence. Climate \ndisruption impacts our ocean and atmosphere, disrupting actual \ntemperature cycles and variations in climate, leading to an increasing \nnumber of severe weather events, snowstorms as well as hurricanes, cold \nand rain, as well as heat and drought across the country.\n  Severe storms and other things such as floods and tornadoes and \ndrought are happening at a rate four times greater than the average 30 \nyears ago. These storms are costing us. They are costing our families, \nlocal communities, and taxpayers more and more of their hard-earned \ndollars, and Connecticut families and our people are impacted severely. \nSo Washington has an obligation and opportunity to act. This body must \nface the responsibility at hand and act in the interests of the \nAmerican people. Climate change is a real and present and urgent \ndanger. The threat is now. We should face this with a sense of \nimmediacy just as we would a house burning or a storm coming, much as \nwe did the coming of Sandy when the brave first responders, our firemen \nand police, braved the storm but did the right thing knowing they must \nact to protect our people.\n  The sense of urgency this issue requires and, indeed, demands is \nlacking today, which is why we are here, to break the culture of \nindifference and despair. Outside the insularity of Washington, outside \nof repeated recalcitrance and political stagnation--dysfunction I think \nis the word most often used--which has paralyzed our politics, the \nAmerican public is understanding. The American public gets it. They \nunderstand that climate disruption is happening. It is happening in \ntheir everyday lives. It is affecting their homes near rivers and \noceans, affecting their drinking water supplies and the crops we need \nfor food. They understand that if nothing is done this problem will \nonly get worse. Communities in the Midwest know why they are \nexperiencing some of the worst drought in decades. Families in \nCalifornia know why their water supply is dwindling dangerously lower \nand lower. Lobstermen in Connecticut, Long Island Sound, dwindling in \nnumber, understand why lobster numbers are shrinking. Surviving lobster \npopulations are moving farther north. The lobsters are our modern-day \ncanary in the coal mine. From Montana to Arizona to New Mexico people \nsee why clearly the wildfire season is starting earlier in the year and \nlasting later into the fall. We have seen the pictures here on the \nfloor of some of those wildfires that have devastated our forests. The \nAmerican people understand why our forests are burning, and the \nAmerican people get it, but Congress still does not.\n  We have reached the time where we must do the job we were elected to \ndo. It is time to fight for a remedy, fight for relief, to \nfirefighters, to farmers, to lobstermen, to ordinary American people, \nwho want to take their families to the shore and see it as they knew it \nwhen they were children.\n  Every generation in this Nation makes a covenant. Every generation \nhas an obligation to leave this Nation better than when we found it. We \nare in danger of leaving a lesser America in so many ways, most \nimportant in what matters to everyday life, our climate, our weather, \nour soil and trees, what we see when we wake in the morning and before \nwe go to bed, the natural world that is essential to our survival, not \nto mention our thriving.\n\n  In my home State of Connecticut the people are not waiting for \nanswers from Washington. We have waited long enough in Connecticut, \nbecause Congress has not fully awakened. Indeed, it is still asleep. As \nmy colleague Senator Whitehouse has said time after time, just a few \nfeet from me, America and the world must wake up. The failure to do so, \nwaiting and watching as disaster develops, could spell devastation for \nAmerica and for our climate. That is why Connecticut is taking steps to \naddress climate change effects like rising sea levels and storms. State \nofficials are researching areas especially along our coast and along \nour waterways that are vulnerable to storm surges and inland flooding, \nand figuring out how best to protect infrastructure that is at risk.\n  I know the citizens of Senator Schatz's State of Hawaii are doing the \nsame, taking an issue and implementing policy to rein in solutions, \ntaking steps on their own, voting with their feet, not just their \nvoices but their actions. And that is what the citizens of Rhode Island \nare doing as well, seeking to do whatever they can as individuals. They \nare a small group of intelligent and dedicated people, but they are \nseeking to change the world for the better, because a small group \nseeking to do so is the only thing that ever has, as Margaret Meade has \nsaid. The citizens and states from California, in the Northwest and all \nthe way to New England, are joining in this effort. This citizens' \nmovement to save the planet from climate disruption eventually will \nprevail. Eventually there will be action. But will it be in time?\n  I want to read an article in the Hartford Courant on January 27, \n2014, just a few weeks ago. It captures how people of Connecticut are \npaying attention to the growing threat upon them and how they are \ntaking steps to address it. I am quoting:\n\n       The changing climate is expected to make Connecticut a \n     different place with more extreme weather, hotter summers and \n     more precipitation, disrupting the natural world around us \n     and testing our ability to respond and adapt.\n       Some changes will be volatile and abrupt while others will \n     be more nuanced.\n       For example, maple syrup production could decline while \n     grape growing improves which would bode well for \n     Connecticut's wine industry.\n       At the end of the century Connecticut summer heat is \n     expected to feel more like the sticky dog days of Washington, \n     DC or perhaps, Savannah.\n       A warmer summer could seem rather pleasant on its face if \n     Connecticut were to have a summer more like those in the \n     south, but the changes come with greater volatility.\n       ``As the climate gets warmer, you put more moisture into \n     the atmosphere, and it just gets a little more violent,'' \n     said Richard Houghton, president of the Woods Hole Research \n     Center in Falmouth, MA, a nonprofit research organization \n     that focuses on environmental sciences.\n       ``There's a lot more energy around. . . . that comes out in \n     unexpected ways, generally not to the betterment of gardens \n     and forests and so on,'' Houghton said.\n       The changes have been studied and monitored by \n     universities, state and federal agencies and others who have \n     combed for decades of data on everything from changes in \n     trees' growth rings to lobster habitat in Long Island Sound. \n     Extensive collections of scientific data have been the source \n     of documents for metaanalyses saying, in effect, that big \n     changes are underway disrupting a mostly climatological \n     period of thousands of years.\n       Perhaps more worrisome is the likelihood of severe weather \n     events such as floods.\n\n  Quoting here:\n\n       ``Even if you had the same amount of rain, it is going to \n     be delivered in these more punctuated, very intense rain \n     events, which are more likely to wash out bridges, roads, \n     cause damage to people's basements, flooding, things like \n     that that cost more,'' said Brenda Ekwurzel, senior climate \n     scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, an \n     organization started in Massachusetts Institute of Technology \n     in 1969, and which is now an alliance of more than 400,000 \n     citizens and scientists.\n       ``We haven't designed our infrastructure, especially the \n     aging infrastructure of the Northeast to handle these times \n     of drainage needs.''\n       In 2007, the Northeast Climate Impacts Assessment was \n     conducted by scientists at more than a dozen universities, \n     including Harvard and Princeton, in addition to experts at \n     the U.S. Geological Survey, the National Oceanic and \n     Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Department of \n     Agriculture.\n       In 2009, several Federal agencies that are part of the U.S. \n     Global Research Program released another large report with \n     specifics about what will change and what will happen to the \n     northeast and Connecticut as a result of climate change.\n       Here are some highlights of the two reports: The northeast \n     could see 20 to 30 percent more winter precipitation and more \n     of that could be rain rather than snow, assuming a greater \n     level of heat-trapping emissions from human activities.\n\n  The higher emission scenario assumes a continued heavy reliance on \nfossil fuels while a lower emission scenario assumes a shift to cleaner \nenergy by the middle of the century. Heavy downpours of rain have \nincreased across the Northeast in recent decades causing intense spring \nflooding in 2006, 2007, and 2010.\n  Cities that experienced only a few 100-degree days each summer might \naverage 20 such days per summer while others, including Hartford, would \naverage nearly 30 days at 100 degrees or hotter.\n  Large portions of the Northeast could be unsuitable for growing \npopular varieties of apples, blueberries, and cranberries in a higher \nemission\n\n[[Page S1454]]\n\nscenario. Heat stress could reduce milk production in dairy cows. \nHowever, the longer growing period could be better for gardeners and \nfarmers so long as they can adapt to the likelihood of summer droughts \nand flooding rains in the spring.\n  Hotter weather is expected to shift growth range for maple, beech, \nand birch forests to the north, disrupting the maple sugar industry and \nshifting the food sources for animals that rely on those forests, such \nas migratory song birds, such as the Baltimore oriole. Long-lived trees \nmight endure, but they would be vulnerable to stresses of competition, \nbugs, and disease. Some parts of northern Connecticut will retain those \nhardwoods.\n  Sea levels are expected to rise 10 inches to 2 feet by the end of the \ncentury, and those projections do not account for recent observed \nmelting of the world's major ice sheets, which means the estimates \ncould be too conservative.\n  What is now considered a once-in-a-century coastal flooding in New \nLondon and Groton along the Thames River could occur as frequently as \nevery 17 years. Several experts agree that modeling sea-level rise is \nmore difficult than predicting other effects of climate change because \nthere are so many variables related to the ocean. In any scenario, the \nseas are expected to rise.\n  Houghton, the head of the Woods Hole Research Center, said that what \nhappens to the climate depends on a multitude of factors around the \nglobe--from deforestation in tropical areas to the burning of fossil \nfuels for energy. One important distinction is that weather and climate \nare different. Climate future does not predict when and where it will \nrain. Instead, it predicts patterns, such as overall warmer \ntemperatures or the greater likelihood for violent floods, such as \ntornadoes or floods. For climate change, it is more about general \ntrends and extreme changes as a result of global warming.\n  As more erratic and extreme weather becomes more likely, property \nowners, town governments, cities, States, and the Federal Government \nwill be put to new tests of their responses and adaptability.\n  Dr. Ekwurzel said that maybe 30 years down the road we will have \ngotten better at dealing with those extreme events because they are \ngoing to become the new normal. I would say in the next decade--15 or \n20 years--we are going to have some hard lessons as to how to deal with \nthis.\n  The work of responding and adapting is already underway and has been \nfor years, though there is renewed concern after power outages and \nwidespread property damage during Tropical Storm Irene and the October \nstorm of 2011 and Superstorm Sandy in 2012. ``They were clearly wake-up \ncalls,'' said Jessica Stratton, director of policy in charge of climate \nissues at the State Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.\n  Connecticut has a wide-ranging climate strategy that ranges from \nbuying energy that produces less carbon which causes further warming \nand a less predictable climate to better preparation for greater \nextremes. In terms of preparing for higher sea levels and inland \nflooding from harsh rain, there are three priorities, according to \nJessica Stratton.\n  First, Connecticut is researching areas vulnerable to rising sea \nlevels and storm surges and inland flooding. Second, the State is \nlooking to critical infrastructure, facilities, and property at risk in \nthose high-hazard areas. Third, the State, and other parties, will work \nto develop best practices to protect infrastructure and habitat and to \nmitigate or reduce risk to the greatest extent possible. The last \nmeasure will involve assisting residents, State, and local government.\n  In 2010 a committee of scientists, engineers, farmers, policymakers, \npublic health officials, and business owners published a 195-page \ndocument called ``The Impacts of Climate Change on Connecticut \nAgriculture, Infrastructure, Natural Resources and Public Health.''\n  ``We think it is highly probable that we are going to experience \nthese kinds of events more frequently,'' Stratton said of recent storms \nand flooding.\n  She continued:\n\n       And because of that, I don't want to sit here and just say, \n     ``OK. We'll take it. We'll pick up the pieces afterward.'' \n     Let us do what we can to lessen the negative impacts, and \n     those are human, those are property, those are business \n     losses. There are a whole bunch of things. So, let us take \n     whatever steps we can to enable our society as it \n     currently is to function as well as it can and to get back \n     to normal as quickly as it can.\n\n  I have quoted so extensively from this article in the Courant because \nit summarizes many of the facts that cannot be denied. Those facts are \nstubborn. Those facts presage a disaster that we have the power to \nignore, but we also have the power to act and to deal with it and to \ntake advantage of the immense opportunity that lies ahead. This is an \nopportunity that could actually create jobs and economic growth, and \nthat is the key point.\n  The problem of climate disruption is also a tremendous opportunity. \nIt is an opportunity not only to change mindsets and culture--the \nculture of indifference--it is an opportunity to change the way we \nlive, create jobs, a new lifestyle, and economic growth.\n  The real and serious health impact of climate change impacting \nmillions of Americans should be enough to force Congress to act, but if \nthat is not enough evidence, let us look to the economic impact of \ninaction. Take the asthma rates--just one example of climate change \nimpact on health costs.\n  According to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, \nthe United States spends approximately $3,300 per person with asthma \nper year. In the 5-year period between 2002 and 2007, asthma costs grew \n6 percent, from $53 billion to $56 billion.\n  NOAA, the National Climate Data Center, estimates that the extreme \nweather events that occurred across the country in 2012 alone, which \nincluded tornadoes in the Plains States and the South, the wildfires in \nthe West, and the Midwest drought and Hurricane Sandy, cost the \nAmerican economy $1 billion in rebuilding and lost economic \nproductivity. That estimate is no doubt low and conservative.\n  A rocket scientist is not needed to understand the effects that \nrising sea levels will have on our coastal communities, which include \nmany of America's large cities and population centers. America's cities \nwill be underwater, and we will have to rebuild their defenses at great \ncost.\n  There is another side of this situation. There is a different side of \nthis coin of climate disruption. Yes, climate disruption can be \ndevastating to our economy; indeed, it has already begun to be so, but \nit also offers the hope and opportunity of spurring new technology, \nreducing our dependence on oil, and thus driving down greenhouse gas \nemissions in a way that will empower and drive economic growth.\n  The U.S. Economic and Statistics Administration reports that the \ncountry's 2010 trade deficit in petroleum-related products was $265 \nbillion or approximately $855 per American citizen. The EPA and the \nDOT--the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of \nTransportation--estimate that the corporate average fuel economy \nstandards that require vehicles to be more fuel efficient and emit less \nCO2 by 2025 save $8,000 per vehicle over each car's \nlifetime. Upgrading and retrofitting buildings to be more energy \nefficient and creating jobs by creating new technologies and training \nworkers to develop skills to execute the retrofit and to work in \nburgeoning alternative energy industries will generate tremendous \nreturn for our economy.\n  The bipartisan Shaheen-Portman Energy Savings and Industrial \nCompetitive Act, which I was proud to sponsor, is waiting in the wings \nfor congressional action. It would create over 190,000 jobs and save \n$16 billion a year for consumers by 2030. We must make the Shaheen-\nPortman bill law. It is only one example of what the Senate can and \nmust do to help stop climate disruption. It is a small measure--modest \nin its impact--but it is a start. If we do nothing else as a result of \nthis debate tonight, let it lead us to bring back the Shaheen-Portman \nbill.\n  So even if--unlike the overwhelming majority of scientists--you have \ndoubts about the science of climate change, remember that the economic \nbenefits of addressing it, even if you think it is a dream, a nightmare \nor some fantasy supporting renewable energy, promoting greater \nefficiency in motor vehicles and buildings will save\n\n[[Page S1455]]\n\nmoney, add jobs, make for stronger buildings and better vehicles. Most \nimportant, it will save wasteful energy use. That argument ought to be \nenough to convince anyone that these investments are smart for America.\n  So whatever your reasons may be, whether you are motivated by the \nneed to ensure a livable climate for future generations, whether you \nare moved to action by Americans suffering by millions from health \nproblems, exacerbated by a more polluted environment, whether you \nunderstand the threat to the U.S. economy that is created by not only \nthe more intense weather events but a more efficient energy landscape--\nwhatever your motivation, whether it is fear or anxiety, apprehension \nabout the future or simply a desire to save money from wasteful use of \nenergy, the intense weather events are becoming more intense and they \nare becoming the new normal. Inefficiency in energy is becoming a norm \nas more people around the globe use energy, and we can lead by example \nin the United States. The Nation must wake up. Congress must awaken, \nand now is the time to act.\n  I wish to close by reading some letters from the people of \nConnecticut because I think they speak eloquently to the reason we are \nhere and the reason the people of Connecticut are taking this kind of \naction.\n  They are letters to me from constituents in all walks of life \nexpressing their personal feelings about this issue. Patricia Wallace \nof New Haven wrote:\n\n       As the director of elderly services for the City of New \n     Haven last year when we had 34 inches of snow, I heard from \n     seniors who could not get out of their front or back doors \n     and had no way to move that much snow, who could not get fuel \n     delivered, who could not get food. I have a husband who uses \n     a wheelchair to get to work. It was nearly impossible for us \n     to move the snow that city plows pushed up on the side of the \n     street so that he could get on the lift of the van to get to \n     work.\n       A few years back, many senior housing complexes lost power \n     during Sandy and had no generators. When they were built, we \n     did not face the frequent severe weather that is now routine. \n     Two non-profit nursing homes have generators, but they are \n     not built for the length of time we have had to operate \n     during these severe weather storms.\n\n  Another Connecticut resident named Diane Taber-Markiewicz told me:\n\n       The global warming of our planet is now creating a push \n     back from the environment that is causing millions of people \n     around the world to lose their way of life. This affects us \n     all and results in a loss of people and other valuable \n     resources needed to sustain and progress our species. \n     Personally, we deal with severe weather events regularly; \n     power outages that cause us to lose work and cost us in \n     wasted food that spoils during outages. Our local, regional, \n     national infrastructure is dangerous in its deteriorated \n     state and our tax dollars go to assisting the very companies \n     and politicians who support our demise.\n\n  Lenore Lewis-Foreman of Bridgeport wrote me to say:\n\n       I have a nerve disorder. Because of this, the weather plays \n     a significant part of my day-to-day activities. Some days I \n     am okay enough to get out of bed and participate in society \n     while being productive. There are days the pains are so bad \n     that my eyes blur and I cannot move. The past season has made \n     it increasingly difficult for me to even motivate myself \n     enough to get out of bed. I have many family and relatives \n     who have been affected by climate change. Some have passed on \n     or moved to another State. A few have decided to stay here in \n     the northeast and stick it out.\n\n  Countless Connecticut residents, in other words, countless members of \nour communities across our State have written to me with their \npositions and concerns. Like these three writers whose letters I shared \nwith you, many Connecticut citizens fear that climate change will \ndisproportionately affect the most vulnerable among our population: the \nelderly, the ill, and people without financial resources. People \nunderstand that climate change will have consequences, not only for \ntheir personal lives but for our food and water, our way of life. \nPeople are already bearing the burden of climate change and disruption \nevery day. They know that if nothing is done, it will only get worse \nfor them and for future generations. Again, the time for action is now. \nAmerica must wake up.\n  Let me close by reading a small part of a book that was quoted \nearlier in this debate by my colleague from the State of Oregon, \nSenator Merkley, who cited the ``Lorax'' book by Dr. Seuss. It says in \npart:\n\n       Now I'll tell you, he says, with his teeth sounding gray, \n     how the Lorax got lifted and taken away. It all started way \n     back, such a long time back, way back in the days when the \n     grass was still green and the pond was still wet and the \n     clouds were still clean.\n\n  It goes on to describe the degradation and the tree cutting and the \ndisregard for that environment. I know Senator Merkley has quoted it at \nlength so I will not do so. But it closes with a very poignant and \ndramatic observation that maybe others, maybe many in this body have \nread to their children.\n\n       I worried about it with all of my heart, but now says the \n     Once-ler, now that you are here, the word of the Lorax seems \n     perfectly clear. Unless someone like you cares a whole awful \n     lot, nothing is going to get better, it's not. So Catch! \n     Calls the Once-ler. He lets something fall. It's a Truffula \n     Seed. It's the last one of all. You're in charge of the last \n     of the Truffula Seeds. And Trufulla Trees are what everyone \n     needs. Plant a new Trufulla. Treat it with care. Give it \n     clean water. And feed it fresh air. Grow a forest. Protect it \n     from axes that hack. Then the Lorax and all of his friends \n     may come back.\n\n  In a certain sense, the stories we read our children have a message \nthey understand. Our children understand in many ways better than we \ndo, because they understand what it means to play in the snow or have \nsunny skies or a day that is not filled with superstorms. They \nunderstand what it means to act individually, to take care of the \nenvironment and our planet. I would like to think it is because we have \nread them the stories of environmental heroes who championed the right \ncauses, who cared enough to act. I would like to think the leadership \nof some in this body, their leadership by example and countless others \nacross the Nation, who take stands, stand up, speak out against climate \ndisruption, against the emissions that threaten the very existence of \nour planet, provide those young people with leadership by example. I \nwould like to think they are learning from some of us and the stories \nwe tell them and read to them from Dr. Seuss or others.\n  The story from Dr. Seuss is not about games, about fantasies. It may \nseem like a fantasy and it may be spoken as a story, but it carries a \nmessage that the trees are what everyone needs; we need to plant them. \nFresh air is what everyone needs, and we must preserve it. We need to \nprotect this planet from the axes that will hack at them, as climate \nchange most assuredly will do.\n  Climate disruption--call it climate change, global warming, whatever \nyou will--is a threat that we have the opportunity and obligation to \ncounter. We are taking baby steps. We need great strides. America must \nwake up and so must the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Murphy). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. May I inquire through the Presiding Officer if the \nSenator from Connecticut would be willing to engage in a brief \ncolloquy. If the answer to that is yes, I would propound the following \nquestion:\n  I know the senior Senator from Connecticut to be a very deeply \nbelieving patriot. He spoke in his remarks about how each American \ngeneration takes upon itself a covenant. I also know the senior Senator \nfrom Connecticut serves on the Armed Services Committee and has to \nconsider, as part of his responsibilities in the Senate, the power that \nAmerica projects around the world, which is sometimes military power, \nbut also sometimes the soft power that comes from our role.\n  I know also, as a student of history, Senator Blumenthal knows that \nPresident Lincoln described the United States of America as the ``last \nbest hope of earth'' and that Thomas Jefferson, in his first inaugural, \ndescribed this American government as the ``world's best hope.''\n  Finally, I heard the Senator say that climate change will have \nconsequences. I wonder if he would care to comment on what a failure to \naddress climate change by the United States of America, knowing the \ninformation we know, would mean in terms of the kind of hope America is \nto the world, in terms of the kind of credibility America needs to \nproject its soft power. Is there a consequence the Senator could \nforesee in our foreign policy and in our national security from \nfumbling and dropping this ball at this time?\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. If I may respond to the Senator, my colleague and \nfriend from Rhode Island, with a question that summarizes one of the \nkey reasons we are here today. I see we\n\n[[Page S1456]]\n\nhave been joined by the senior Senator from Rhode Island who is senior \nto me on the Armed Services Committee and so knows better than I \nprobably some of the answers that can be made to the question posed by \nthe Senator from Rhode Island. But let me say at the outset, the \nmilitary understands, in some ways better than America, the crisis of \nenergy waste and climate disruption this Nation and the world faces. \nIndeed, the military has taken steps to be greener in its energy use, \nto use fuel cells and other renewable sources of power, because it \nknows the cost of excessive energy consumption, particularly oil \ndependence and energy reliance on powers that will do us no good and \nmean us harm.\n  Energy dependence cannot be good for America's strategic interest or \nAmerican defense. That is one of the reasons why our military is \nseeking to lead by example. I thank them for doing so. The Secretary of \nthe Navy, for example, has spoken to me at great length, Secretary \nMabus, about the use of new sources and renewable sources of power on \nthe ships that take the navy to the farthest corners of the globe. So \nthe American military is leading by example. But America can lead by \nexample. Thomas Jefferson and our Founders thought America would be the \nbest hope for the world in its example of leadership. Thomas Jefferson \nsaid, ``The world belongs to the living.'' Let us resolve that the \nliving have a world that is worthy of that covenant we make as \nAmericans to leave this Nation better and stronger than it was when we \ntook over.\n  Let's not have failed on our watch. America can be a shining example \nin what it does, inspiring the world by that example, not by its \nmandates or its military, but by its peaceful use of energy in a way \nthat preserves the planet. We can use renewables. In fact, in \nConnecticut, we make fuel cells that can power the world in a much more \nenergy-efficient and environmentally friendly world. Fuel cells are our \nfuture. They are made in Danbury and Torrington and the Hartford area \nby companies that are growing, another example of jobs creation and \neconomic boom that can result from addressing the opportunities as well \nas the obligation of climate change.\n  I have spoken on the floor about those companies, as well as about \nthe Connecticut climate action plan launched in 2005, the main goal of \nwhich is to substantially cut the amount of greenhouse gases being \nproduced within our State. In Connecticut, we are moving ahead, just as \nthe Nation must move ahead with these kinds of initiatives.\n  The Connecticut Sea Grant College Program, another example, \nunderstands the opportunity and the obligation of this time in our \nhistory. We can translate climate disruption into a positive through \nthese kinds of measures we use to show the world that there are \nprofoundly important gains at hand.\n  The regional cooperation Connecticut has helped to lead in the \nConnecticut Energy Finance and Investment Authority, the RGGI program. \nThat kind of initiative is, in a microcosm, what America can do for the \nworld.\n  So the question posed by the Senator from Rhode Island, who has \nhelped to lead this debate, goes to the heart of what we are as \nAmericans, as leaders in providing the world an example of energy \nsavings, respect for our planet, addressing the problem that exists for \nus now, and denying the deniers their sway in this debate.\n  I have heard from others on the floor about how it is all a product \nof our imagination, but, as Ronald Reagan said, facts are stubborn \nthings, and the facts show, regrettably and tragically, that climate \ndisruption is destructive, implacable, relentless, and only we can stop \nit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise this morning to join my colleagues in \ncalling for action to address climate change. This is a global \nchallenge that has far-reaching consequences for our economy, our \npublic health, and our national security.\n  I begin by thanking my colleague Senator Schatz, who is with us; \nSenator Whitehouse, my colleague from Rhode Island; Senator Boxer; and \nmembers of the Senate Climate Action Task Force for their leadership \nand for bringing so many of our colleagues to the floor last evening \nand through the early hours of this morning to call attention to the \ncritical issue of climate change.\n  This issue is daunting and difficult. One reason it is so daunting \nand difficult is that it is a slow-moving crisis. We are often faulted \nfor not responding to critical issues before us, but we are certainly \nfaulted for not responding to those that have evolved over many months \nand many years--the nature of our political process, the nature of our \nattention span, and the fact that other issues crowd out these longer \nterm issues. But what we have seen as we look back is a clear path of \nevidence suggesting that our climate is changing. Our climate is \nchanging in ways that are going to disadvantage us--disadvantage us in \nterms of our economic productivity, our national security, and it is \ngoing to disadvantage us in terms of things that we take for granted.\n  Senator Blumenthal, Senator Murphy, Senator Whitehouse, and I grew up \nalong the New England coast. I am a little older than my colleagues, \nbut in the 1950s and 1960s those coasts had wide beaches and homes \nbuilt along those beaches for middle-class workers. All of that has \nliterally eroded over the last several years--particularly these \nsuperstorms that have come up our coast. Now we are seeing that places \nwe saw as our summer ideal, beautiful places, have literally been lost. \nHomes have been upended by storms. Areas that were frequently places \nfor summer relaxation are now gone because of rising seas and because \nof changing climates around oceans, bays, and our estuaries. This is \nonly one example. I could go on and on. This evidence is so clear-cut, \nso condemning, and so convincing that we have to take steps now.\n  Across the globe, these issues are also increasingly important. It is \nnot simply a localized issue. This is an issue which is impacting every \nperson across every part of the globe. We see temperatures increasing, \nseasons shifting, sea levels rising, extreme water events becoming more \nfrequent, and heat-related illnesses and diseases on the rise.\n  As I said before, these changes are being felt everywhere--they are \nbeing felt in Rhode Island, Connecticut, Hawaii, and all across this \ncountry. California has been enduring a crippling drought, and in other \nparts of the world we have seen unusually large rains. All of these \nweather patterns suggest that there is a changing dynamic that has \nconsequences. We have to deal with these consequences.\n  There are some who would argue that we should take no action to \nmitigate these impacts because there is a cost of addressing these \nissues, a cost to our economy. In fact, there have been proposals \nintroduced in Congress that would greatly restrict the U.S. EPA, for \nexample. Their position is: See no evil. Hear no evil. Do nothing.\n  That approach is only going to make this problem worse. That approach \nis going to make the cost for us but also, more profoundly, for our \nchildren and the next generation of Americans, much more severe. We \nhave to act wisely now. We have to move forward wisely now.\n  I think we have to do so with the notion--which I think is quite \nobvious and true--that sound environmental protection is not in \ncontradiction to economic growth. In fact, they work together hand in \nhand. We have to have the long-term combination of sound environmental \npolicy to encourage sustainable, economic growth. A healthy environment \nis essential for our economy and for our quality of life. Indeed, the \nstrength of the economy depends on the health and resilience of our \npeople, our critical infrastructure, and our natural resources. The \ncost of inaction, as I have suggested, is substantial, and it will be \npaid.\n  We talked today about rising seas, and as we look at most of our \nmajor cities, many of them are clustered on the ocean. They started \nthere. They were ports. They were points of entry into the United \nStates. They are the economic engines that drove this country from its \nfounding until today.\n  But as our seas rise, critical infrastructure is jeopardized. There \nhave been discussions in New York City, for\n\n[[Page S1457]]\n\nexample, of building walls in certain low-lying areas of Manhattan. \nThat whole process is likely a multimillion-dollar process, and it \nmight well have to be taken--certainly, if we do nothing--because the \nrise of these tides seems inevitable. But if we act now, it might be \nmitigated or lessened or, through different techniques, avoided. But it \ntakes action now. That is why my colleagues have tried to galvanize us \ninto this session to underscore the need to act and the need to act \npromptly.\n  According to the U.S. Global Change Research Program, economic losses \nfrom weather-related events, including floods, droughts, and storms, \nhave been significant and have been increasing. That is sort of the \ndynamic we are seeing. Not only are we seeing an increase in these \nweather incidents, but we are seeing them in a larger scale and it \nseems to be an accelerating process--more and larger weather incidents \ncreating more damage.\n\n  We in Rhode Island and our sister States, Connecticut and \nMassachusetts, saw significant damage from Sandy, but we did not \nreceive the brunt of the storm. However, that was a factor that could \nhave altered, indeed, hours before the storm hit. We were concerned it \nwould come straight, pouring down on Rhode Island with catastrophic \neffects.\n  Fortunately we missed the worst of it, but that was not the fortune \nof New Jersey and New York. They suffered billions of dollars in \ndamage. They are still trying to restore communities, and they are \nstill trying to restore services. We have had some effects, too, that \nwe are dealing with.\n  But what we have seen is these storms coming repeatedly. My sort of \nvague history of hurricanes in Rhode Island--it was the 1938 hurricane \nthat came roaring through. I was not there, but that was a devastating \nevent. Then there was the 1954 hurricane, Hurricane Carol, and that was \na devastating event. But there was, it seemed to me at least--and this \nis anecdotal more than analytical--a decade or more, 15 years, almost \n20 years between storms. In the interim the storms were the old-\nfashioned nor'easters. They would come and go, and there would be a \nlittle damage but nothing significant. But that pattern and intensity \nof storms seem to have increased in their repetitiveness and their \nnearness of time. What we are seeing is a barrage, really, of economic \nevents--huge environmental events--that have huge economic costs.\n  According to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, since 1980 the United States has sustained 151 weather-\nrelated disasters where overall damages reached or exceeded $1 billion. \nThe total cost of these events tops $1 trillion. In 2012 Superstorm \nSandy, the prolonged Midwest drought, and the nine other weather-\nrelated disasters led to damages in excess of $110 billion, making 2012 \nthe second costliest year for disasters.\n  Let's stop and think. These disasters--that is $110 billion or so for \nSuperstorm Sandy and some of the other incidents that took place in \n2012--if they were avoided or mitigated, could allow public resources \nto be used for other things. That is one of the facts we have to face. \nThis is not free to us.\n  If this prolonged drought in the West produces more forest fires--and \nthere is a rough correlation between those two--we will pay for that. \nWe will have to fight those fires. That is a huge amount of Federal \nspending before $1 goes to an Indian health care center or $1 goes to a \nFederal program to support higher education. Before $1 goes anywhere, \nwe have to respond to those fire crises. That is only one example that \nis coming from the conditions established by a drought.\n  When we look at the coastal storms that are bearing down on us, we \nhave to fix the infrastructure, we have to fix the shattered roads that \nline the coastlines, and we have to fix the sewer systems that have \nbeen shattered by these storms. It is not avoidable. So these costs \nkeep accumulating.\n  Then there is another cost; that is, the opportunity cost of not \nbeing able to invest more in schools, invest more in other \ninfrastructure, invest more in lowering the cost of energy--all of \nthese things. We have to recognize that. As I said before, my State has \nbeen impacted, along with every other State, by these different weather \nphenomenon. The Sandy storm--mercifully we missed the brunt, but we \nstill sustained significant damages.\n  Our coastline is increasingly vulnerable. That is the other factor. \nThese storms weaken our coastlines and our barrier beaches. So when the \nnext storm comes, the damage is even more severe, and when the next \nstorm comes, it is worse. This cumulative effect is accelerating so \nrapidly that these damages are making us more and more vulnerable to \nstorms.\n  In fact, it goes back to the frequency and the intensity of these \nstorms. There used to be--at least anecdotally--a period of time where \nliterally the coast could recover. There was a decade or so where, \ninstead of severe storms every summer or fall, we had a period of \naccumulation of beach sand, of the ocean depositing sand, not ripping \nit away in a storm. That doesn't seem to be happening. We have to \nrecognize that.\n  We also have to recognize that we have a Federal perspective, but the \nStates are also spending a huge amount of money on responding to the \neffects of the storm, and that also diverts their efforts from \neducation, from health care, and from all of the things States have to \ndo.\n  This is not only a national issue. This is not only a regional issue. \nThis is, as everyone has said on this floor, a global issue. Because of \nthe global characteristics, it touches on interests of national \nsecurity, which my colleague the Presiding Officer from Connecticut \nspoke about.\n  Rising waters--and they are rising for a very simple reason: As the \nwater temperature increases, water expands. That is just simple \nthermodynamics. It is science. Simple thermodynamics is all I remember \nfrom West Point. As the water expands, sea levels rise, and that is \ngoing to keep happening.\n  If we mention the temperatures in the waters around New England over \nthe past 20 or 30 years, they have gone up. And the water levels have \nalso gone up. There is no sinister force out there. There is no \nwhirling machine that is driving the water. There is no high-level \ncombination of winds coming together. That might happen; that is the \nnature of a storm. But water keeps rising because molecules keep \ngetting farther and farther apart as they heat up.\n\n  That water rise is significant to us in Rhode Island, but it is \ncatastrophic to other places. Bangladesh is a country that is \nessentially on the water, and many parts of it are close to being \nunderwater. If the sea waters rise there you have a situation of a \nrelatively poor country that has had problems with its neighbors, and \njust to seek shelter people will be forced to move in and to put \npressure on the boundaries. It could cause tremendous problems. That is \njust one example.\n  In Pakistan, we have invested a huge amount of money to work with the \ngovernment of Pakistan to provide assistance as they battle the \nTaliban, to provide assistance as we move supplies through there to our \nforces in Afghanistan. The floods, the seasonal droughts, the chaotic \nweather they have seen there weakens an already weak government. This \nis repeated time and time again around the globe.\n  So this is, again, not just an issue about whether we are going to \npreserve our beaches, preserve our coasts or save money here in the \nUnited States to devote to more meaningful reasons. It could pose a \nserious national security threat as people are forced together with \npolitical issues already and now are under the threat of environmental \ncatastrophe. They are changing borders, migrating, moving in conflict, \nand creating huge problems, undermining the weak governments that \nalready exist in these areas of the world and providing further \npressure on these governments. The result is chaotic situations which \nare the breeding ground for much of the terror and much of the carnage \nwe see across the globe. This is related and we have to recognize that.\n  There is another part of this, too, that is often neglected. It is a \nchallenge, yes, and a serious challenge, but also it is an opportunity. \nIt is an opportunity to create jobs to deal with this evolving problem. \nFrankly, in the American spirit, one of our greatest characteristics is \nwhen we have seen a challenge, we also saw opportunity. Other nations \njust saw a challenge.\n\n[[Page S1458]]\n\nThey didn't roll up their sleeves and deal with some of the issues as \nwe did, as our predecessors did, as our parents did. Now it is our \nturn. Will we roll up our sleeves, look at this as a real serious \nchallenge, and not ignore it but deal with it?\n  If we do that, we can create good jobs. We can create jobs that will \nreward people and contribute to an improved environment. \nWeatherization, for example, supports thousands of highly skilled \nworkers and additional jobs in related businesses, materials suppliers, \nvendors, manufacturers, et cetera. This is a very straightforward way \nto deal with the issue of climate change. When we make homes more \nweather tight and better insulated, when we don't waste energy, when we \ndon't have to use as much, when we cut down demand and don't have to \ngenerate as much and put as much pollution into the atmosphere, and we \ndo these things on a widespread basis, we put a lot of people to work. \nThese are the types of jobs that many people have the skills to do and \nthat are rewarding. They can do them, and we save ourselves energy. We \nsave the pollution, we save the warming that comes from just spewing \nexcess emissions into the environment, and we put people to work.\n  This is a low-cost, effective way to deal with employment and with \nenergy. We have to do more of these things. It is not, as they say, \nrocket science. This is no fabulous, new, high-tech application that we \nneed to develop. This is giving people and communities the resources \nand the support to go out there and to put better insulation in \nbuildings, to try to use more alternate energy sources, to put better \nwindows in and better doors to hold the heat. This is just \nstraightforward but very powerful. It can help curb energy consumption. \nParticularly for low-income people, it can reduce the cost of energy.\n  One of the problems, again and I see my New England colleagues around \nthat we face in New England is our energy costs are much higher than \nthe rest of the country. One is because we have a poor distribution \nsystem; and two, we have a system also where we are paying for some of \nthe pollution in the Midwest that comes out of stacks and is taken at \nhigh altitudes and then it descends into New England and the Northeast. \nSo we have to compensate not only for our pollution but also for other \nareas of the country. So all these factors come together.\n  My point is we can do a lot collectively across the country. It is \nnot just a challenge, it is a huge opportunity, and that means getting \nour public policies here in Washington right. That means investing in \nbetter energy, investing in better distribution systems, investing in \nimproving those systems that exist.\n  One of our problems in terms of the natural gas distribution in New \nEngland is not only that it is old and inefficient in terms of \ndelivering gas, but it leaks methane, which is not a very good \nenvironmental component to release.\n  So we have these challenges before us, and we want to go ahead and \ndeal with these challenges. We see around the globe increases in \nprecipitation, increases in sea level rise, storm surges becoming \ngreater, and all of these are putting to the test every system we have.\n  Our road systems--I haven't seen the roads as poor in the Northeast \nin my life. Highways--I-95, there are potholes everywhere. Why? We have \nhad so many storms over the last 2 years, so much plowing, and so \nlittle dollars to do the repairs. The roads now leave you bouncing \nalong on the highway like you are not in the United States of America \nbut in some second or Third World country. That is a consequence--\nindirect, but a consequence--of the weather and our inability to \nmarshal the resources to deal with the weather. Not just clearing the \nsnow, but then going in and repaving the roads. We see that everywhere. \nBut we have to do more.\n  This is a threat to our fisheries. It is a threat to our drinking \nwater. It is a threat to our quality of life. Again, growing up in \nRhode Island, we took for granted in the 1950s and 1960s that short \nride to a beautiful beach--a big, broad, beautiful beach--swimming in \nthe water and not worrying about the beach being closed because of \nenvironmental conditions, toxic conditions in the water. Some of that \nhas changed, and we have to go back and reestablish that quality, that \nlifestyle. It is not just all about dollars and cents. It is also about \nthe quality of our lives.\n  As I said before, and let me conclude, this is not just an issue of \ndomestic policy, localized issues. This touches upon our national \nsecurity. Ironically, we debate budgets of billions and billions of \ndollars about platforms, about what kinds of systems we will have in \nthe air, on the sea, under the sea; what types and sizes of units we \nwill have on the ground and what their training is like. But \nironically, one of the things that is likely to trigger the engagement \nof our forces is this growing environmental crisis throughout the \nworld.\n  Someone, I think it was one of the defense ministers in Nigeria, said \none of the greatest problems the east faces, with the rise of these \nbands of radicalized young people, is the fact that because of \ndesiccation of parts of his country, traditional farming, traditional \naspects of economic growth and jobs and livelihood have been taken \naway, and so young people can get a gun and that is their new job. I \nthink we have to be very serious about the national security \nconsequences. So as we are moving forward, I hope we will recognize \nthat these environmental challenges are also national security \nchallenges.\n  There is one thing that was very revealing to me, and that was a few \nyears ago when the Navy announced the Arctic Ocean would be able to be \ncommercially transited during certain parts of the year. Again, growing \nup in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, if someone had told me the Arctic \nOcean was going to be a commercial highway for ships, I would have said \nthat is preposterous. It is frozen. It is always frozen. It will always \nbe frozen. Well, that is not the case. Last year, Arctic sea ice \nreached an all-time low, and as climate change accelerates, the melting \nof sea ice will invariably make that a source of navigation.\n  It will create new opportunities, such as shipping routes, but also \nnew challenges. Who will patrol those seas? Will we have to create not \nonly a Pacific fleet but an Arctic fleet? That costs money. Who owns \nthe rights? Who has access to that area?\n  So we are looking at huge problems that even 10 years ago we thought \nwere fanciful.\n  That underscores the final point I want to make. We see this climate \nprocess, this climate change coming, and it doesn't seem to be \naffecting us minute by minute, so there is this tendency to be rather \ncavalier about it. Beyond the people who out-and-out deny it, which I \nthink ignores the facts of science, even people who do tend to \nrecognize it think, yes, well, we have time. But what we are seeing is \nnot just the intensity of these incidents; we are seeing them \naccelerating, and the consequences of accelerating with such rapidity \nis that what we thought might be a huge problem 2 or 3 years from now \nmight occur in half that time. So we have to act.\n  I want to conclude by thanking my colleagues, Senator Boxer, Senator \nWhitehouse, and Senator Schatz because they have called us to come \nforward and to recognize this issue--to seize the challenge but also to \nseize the opportunity. In doing so, they have done remarkable work for \nthe Senate and for this country.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, before I yield the floor to Senator \nUdall of New Mexico, this may be my last chance to speak before the \nall-night session comes to its end, because I am about to relieve the \nPresiding Officer. In fact, I am overdue for that.\n  But I did want to take this moment to say a few thank-yous. As one of \nthe instigators of this episode, I thank my staff in particular for all \nthe work that went into this. I thank the parliamentarians and the \nSenate clerk staff, who had a long night with us, and I appreciate it \nvery, very much. There is only one page I see on the floor remaining--\nno, there is another one. I want to thank all the pages. Many of them \nstayed here through the night, and it was a very long night for them, \nand I appreciate very much their effort. Then throughout the building, \nbecause\n\n[[Page S1459]]\n\nthe Senate had to be kept open, there were people who were kept here--\nthe Capitol police and others--and it is much appreciated.\n  One of the things about the Senate is when we are in session, the \nlight on the top of the Capitol stays on. So all night last night, \npeople across the city could look and see that the light on the Capitol \nstayed on. I hope that wasn't the only light that was shed last night, \nbut at least it is an example, and I just express my appreciation to \nall of the people who we have inconvenienced in order to make this \npoint.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield before we hear from my good \nfriend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank also everyone who made this \nevening possible, and I want to say to my co-chair of the Climate \nAction Task Force, Senator Whitehouse, what a privilege it is to work \nwith him, as his passion on this runs deep; to Senator Schatz, who, \nfrom Hawaii, is witnessing climate change in real time, just as so many \nof us are who are from coastal States.\n  I am so looking forward to hearing Senator Tom Udall, and I am not \ngoing to quote him but I hope he will say what he said in front of the \nenvironment committee when he was a new Member. He called attention to \nwhat is happening in the West, and all one has to do is read the papers \nto see the suffering that is going on.\n  So I also want to say, because time is wasting here, that this was \nsomething that I think has caught on, that has caught the attention of \npeople. I can tell you that well over 100,000 people--well over that--\nhave signed various petitions calling on Congress to wake up.\n  I am under no illusions that our colleagues on the Republican side \nwatched us. So let's be clear. Senator Inhofe said before he left: You \nare talking to yourselves, and I took great offense at that because the \nvast majority of the American people understand climate change is real. \nThere is no doubt about it, no more doubt than people have that \ncigarettes don't cause cancer. We know this is a fact. And for us to \nclose our eyes to this fact is closing our eyes to the people we \nrepresent and about whom we care.\n\n  Again, my deepest thanks to all the staff in the entire building. To \nall my colleagues, Senator Whitehouse informed me we are about to hear \nfrom the 30th Senator. That is incredible. Thirty percent of the Senate \nis participating.\n  I yield back my time, again, with my deepest thanks. There is more to \ncome from the Climate Action Task Force. We are just getting started. \nWe will have lots more. The next time we do something, we will engage a \nlot of other folks as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I thank Senator Boxer for her \nvery kind words. She is the chairman of the committee which deals with \nclimate change legislation and has been ever present in terms of trying \nto see if we can come up with a bipartisan solution and get \nlegislation. I was very proud to serve on her committee when the Obama \nadministration came in and the Senate sat down to work and was trying \nto do something about climate change. Unfortunately, we ran out of \ntime.\n  But as we can see by the number of Senators who have spoken--we are \nup to 30 now--we still have incredible passion about this issue. We \nknow it is a serious problem, the American people know it is a serious \nproblem, and we want something done.\n  What have we learned? I have watched my colleagues over the night. I \nam No. 30 and I have watched what they have been talking about. The \ntradition here in the Senate is normally if we are talking like this \nand our colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle want to come \ndown and exchange with us, they can do that. That is our tradition, to \nsay we speak and then they speak. What we have ended up seeing is one \nRepublican Senator show up in this 12-plus-hour period is my \nunderstanding. I think I am right. This is what was reported on NPR \nthis morning. To me, this is tremendously sad, because in the glory \ndays of the Senate in the 1960s and 1970s major environmental \nlegislation, major conservation organization legislation--remember the \nWilderness Act, the Clean Water Act, Clean Air, Endangered Species--was \npassed with significant bipartisan support. We don't see that effort \ntoday. It makes me very sad. We are here all night trying to engage and \nsay: This is something the American people believe is serious, and we \nneed to engage on this issue.\n  Today I am going to talk a little bit about New Mexico, and how New \nMexico and the Southwest are at the bull's-eye when it comes to climate \nchange.\n  What do I mean by that? If New Mexico is at one temperature and we \ncompare it with the rest of the country--let's say in the rest of the \ncountry we have a 1-percent rise--New Mexico is going to be 2 percent, \nso there is a doubling effect in the Southwest. This is a map of New \nMexico, but we are talking the Southwest.\n  First let me talk a little bit about the drought we have had. Here we \nare from June 2011 to the present, a drought of epic proportions. The \nU.S. drought monitor shows more than 90 percent of New Mexico is in \nextreme drought. Northern and western New Mexico got some precipitation \nlast year, but several other areas of the State remain mostly dry. We \ncan see this is extreme; the other is moderate. Added together, it is a \nsignificant impact. These are the kinds of challenges we are going to \nface with climate change.\n  To talk a little bit more about these impacts, I would now like to go \nto chart 2 and look at the snowpack in the northern New Mexico and \nsouthern Colorado watersheds. They only range from one-half to three-\nquarters of what normally would be there.\n  This is a winter picture. Normally in northern New Mexico at this \ntime of year we would see a massive snowpack. Why is that important? \nBecause in the summer when we start using the water, we start \nirrigating, the farmers start doing things, they recharge the aquifer. \nSo if we don't have a snowpack, we don't have that kind of recharge and \nwe don't have the storage levels of drinking water.\n  Just to pick one of our communities, Santa Fe, NM, gets 40 percent of \nits water from the ground and it gets another big chunk of the water \nfrom reservoirs. Those reservoirs are fed when we have a snowpack and \nwhen the ground gets recharged and it flows off and flows into those \nreservoirs, so this is something which makes a huge impact when we \ndon't have a snowpack and when we have a decreasing amount of \nprecipitation. We are going to see more and more of this as we move \ndown the road, when we look at the modeling which has been done by the \nexperts who are working on this issue.\n  This next slide is particularly disturbing in terms of water. I \nremember it being roughly at this place on the Rio Grande just last \nyear in the middle of the summer. This photo is showing a very meager \namount of water. When I was there last summer, there was no water. It \nwas completely dry. So here, the river which flows the whole length of \nthe State of New Mexico down to southern New Mexico--El Paso, TX, \nrelies on it; Mexico, our neighbor to the south, relies on it--there \nwas no water to be seen. Once again, it dramatically shows the impacts \nof climate change and the impacts as we see this move down the road.\n  One experience with ranchers and farmers I think really brings this \nhome in terms of water. There was a flood control project in Tucumcari, \nNM, created in the middle of the Great Depression. Everybody in the \ncommunity invested in it. The Federal Government invested in it. These \nprojects have a dual purpose. One is, if there is a big flood, to try \nto control the flood. The second thing is to hold the water, so when we \nget to the irrigation season we can have irrigated farmland. They did \nthis in the 1930s. I think about 600 or 700 farmers and ranchers rely \non this project and have been relying on this project since the 1930s.\n  I visited this community recently and learned from the people who run \nthe project and from the farmers and ranchers, in the last couple of \nyears, zero water. No water at all. They had never seen this since the \n1930s, even though when we went through very serious conditions in the \n1950s it was thought to be one of the biggest droughts and no water. \nThe last 10 or 12 years, this particular project, the same thing: very, \nvery little water.\n\n[[Page S1460]]\n\n  What ends up happening as a result? Farmers and ranchers cannot \nplant. Ranchers sell off their herds. Just to show how dramatic it is, \nin New Mexico we saw 50 percent of our cattle herds sold off this last \nyear. People are hurting so badly in terms of this drought, they are \nunable to keep their livestock on the land and they end up having \nto pull the livestock off. This has a devastating impact to people who \nlive closest to the ground.\n\n  I have been out on the land in New Mexico with conservationists and \nscientists and talked to them about climate change. One of the things I \ntry to describe in what I have learned--and I think this is what \nChairman Boxer is talking about--when I made a presentation in one of \nthe committees, is if we take the modeling which has been done on \nclimate change in the Southwest, and particularly focusing on New \nMexico, what we do with that modeling is ask ourselves: Where are we \ngoing to be 50 years down the line?\n  We just had a study at Los Alamos National Laboratory which says by \n2050--in less than 50 years--we are not going to have any forests in \nNew Mexico. So much of this area of northern New Mexico and down here, \nthe forests throughout this area, they are saying it looks like no \nforests and much less water, as I have just talked about. If we don't \nget snowpack, we can't charge the system back.\n  The most dramatic description to me is what happens here 50 years \nfrom now. These are conservative numbers. These aren't the ones many of \nthe scientists nowadays are saying we have. We are taking conservative \nnumbers, and many scientists are saying it is happening quicker, it is \nmoving faster.\n  What they tell us is--imagine on a computer screen how we can drag \nthings. New Mexico is over 300 miles. If we click on New Mexico and \ndrag it 300 miles to the south--so we are moving the top of New Mexico \ndown 300 miles to the south--what do we get? We are in the middle of \nthe Chihuahuan desert in Mexico. So what was a dramatic forested area, \nwhat was an area which was very acceptable to farming and ranching: \nDevastating impacts.\n  So those are the kinds of things. I could go on and on here. But the \nthing about the impacts--and we could talk about how one of our \nreservoirs at Elephant Butte has the lowest level in 40 years. This is \na great recreational lake which people used. This is a picture of the \nreservoir in June of 1994. Here is the picture today--dramatically \ndifferent.\n  I wish to highlight as I close here--because I know we are trying to \nwrap up after we have been going for many hours--New Mexico has been \nfocusing on solutions. One of the solutions sitting right in front of \nus is renewable energy. We know we are going to have to deal with this \nproblem one way or another. It is much better to deal with it earlier. \nIn New Mexico we are doing everything we can to foster the solar power \nindustry. This slide shows solar power to beat coal prices in New \nMexico. Right now, the solar installations going up are very \ncompetitive in terms of coal.\n  Wind power. Once again, in New Mexico we have installed wind capacity \nof 778 megawatts. New Mexico ranks 19th for the total megawatts \ninstalled. So all over New Mexico, up on our mesas, as we can see here, \nwe have wind turbines collecting the energy from the wind. The number \nof wind turbines: 575. New Mexico ranks 17th for the number of utility-\nscale wind turbines. Current wind generation in New Mexico is 6.1 \npercent.\n  Just a few years ago when we put in place a renewable electricity \nstandard, we had a lower level and we have been pushing that up. This \nis one of the things we need to do at the national level. My cousin and \nI worked in the House of Representatives before we were in the Senate \nto get a national renewable electricity standard. This is something we \nhave to do which is a solution.\n  As I laid out all of the things earlier, the devastating impacts, one \nof the things we should realize is there are solutions; they are here \ntoday; the technology is perfected; and we are able to put those into \nplace.\n  The final area of renewable energy I wish to talk about and we have \nhuge potential here in the Southwest is called advanced biofuels. I \nhave been to this facility and seen the experimentation they are doing. \nThey have taken land and are farming algae. What eventually happens \nwith this algae is it is refined and the algae becomes a very good \nfuel. So this is something which is, once again, a solution to this \nproblem.\n  We shouldn't despair when we look at the impact of climate change and \nwhen we look in the future as to what people are going to predict, \nbecause we know we have the ability to cultivate solutions.\n  I am very proud of my State and how we have really worked to \ncultivate these sources of renewable energy, and we are moving it up \nwith our renewable electricity standard higher and higher every year. I \nam very proud to have been a part of this effort, the 30th Senator to \nstand and speak about this. I guess we have been going about 13 hours, \n14 hours.\n  Once again, I can't close without mentioning I wish we had our \nfriends and colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle down here to \nengage us. I don't know what to conclude but that either they don't \ncare about this or don't want to engage with us. We only had one \nRepublican Senator in this 14-hour period show up. This sure isn't like \nthe glory days of the Senate when so many Republicans participated with \nDemocrats to tackle the big problems which faced our country. This is a \nproblem which faces the entire world, so we need the U.S. Senate and \nthe entire world working together in a cooperative way to solve this.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, who was a key person in terms of \norganizing this, Senator Whitehouse from Rhode Island, and I yield for \nmy good friend from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Udall.\n  I am proud to join with my colleagues in speaking on climate change. \nSenators have been speaking on this issue since yesterday, all through \nthe night, to add their voices to the millions of voices around the \ncountry who are committed to fighting climate change.\n  The level of commitment we have seen from these Senators is \nextraordinary, and we will need an extraordinary commitment here in \nCongress, around the country, and around the world to address this \nissue. We will need that commitment because we are on the cusp of \nclimate crisis, a point of no return, which will threaten our health, \nour economy, and our world.\n  We are also on the cusp of innovation in clean energy and energy \nefficiency which has the possibility of transforming energy production \nand consumption. In other words, we are at a moment of great danger and \ngreat opportunity, a moment where we must make choices about whether we \nwill go boldly into the future, investing in innovation, establishing \nserious and smart regulations, and committing to address the climate \ncrisis or whether we will continue to subsidize fossil fuels of the \npast and ignore the risks to our future. It is up to us.\n\n  Doing something new is hard, because when it comes to environmental \nand energy issues in this country, powerful, entrenched, deep-pocketed \ncorporations are lined up to fight any change from the status quo. \nThese powerful corporations defend policies which poison our air and \nfoul our water with little regard for the well-being of future \ngenerations. These powerful interests work hard to tilt the playing \nfield so energy entrepreneurs and innovators have a hard time getting a \nfoothold in the market. These powerful interests too often have a \nstranglehold on our political system, blocking not only bold change, \nbut even conservative, market-based reforms.\n  When it comes to environmental and energy policy, the system is \nrigged--it is rigged against our families and it is rigged against our \nfuture. Let me give one example.\n  In 2012, the five biggest oil companies--ExxonMobil, Shell, Chevron, \nBP, and ConocoPhillips--made combined profits of $118 billion. At the \nsame time, they sucked down billions of dollars in tax subsidies from \nthe American people. Over 10 years, oil and gas companies will receive \n$40 billion in taxpayer subsidies. And if the Republicans have their \nway, these companies will get even bigger breaks in their taxes.\n  Think about what $40 billion could mean for our future: a serious \ninvestment in research to figure out the\n\n[[Page S1461]]\n\nproblem of energy storage and to develop better incentives for wind and \nsolar installation; certainty and predictability for investors and \nentrepreneurs who have a big idea in green energy or energy efficiency \nand want to build a new business. And here is the point to underline: \nWe can invest in research and develop new markets without spending any \nnew money, if we just shift our priorities from old fossil fuel energy \nto new clean energy.\n  A tax policy which protects these powerful interests of the past is a \ntax policy which is rigged against the entrepreneurs, small businesses, \nand innovators of the future. It is rigged against families who want \ntheir children to live in a world where they can drink the water and \nbreathe the air.\n  In preparation for the speech I am giving this morning, I asked \nAmericans to write in and talk about how their lives will be affected \nif we do not get serious about climate change. My question was a simple \none: If we don't do anything at all to stop climate change, what do you \nthink the world will look like 25 years from now?\n  I would like to read some of the responses for the record. These are \njust a few of the more than 5,000 letters I received on this issue. It \nis obvious to me the people of Massachusetts and the people of our \ngreat Nation are worried about this problem. So let me read from some \nof their letters.\n  Blake Cady of Brookline, MA, writes:\n\n       I served on a US Navy icebreaker in the Arctic from 1959-\n     1961 and saw th[at] relatively pristine region with intact \n     permafrost and heavy sea ice well into the summer off Baffin \n     Island and further north. Now, much of the Arctic Ocean ice \n     cover is disappearing and is predicted to be entirely gone by \n     the end of the 2030 summer season. . . .\n       Currently there is open water across the Northwest Passage \n     in the summer, and shipping has become routine, [which is] a \n     profound change already. There will be untold alterations--\n     from the warming Arctic Ocean to accompany the rapidly \n     melting Greenland ice cap--which have the potential to change \n     global currents and further escalate global warming trends.\n       There is still a narrow time window to address this looming \n     climate disaster, but action must be forceful and rapid to \n     escape its worst aspects. I fear for my children's and \n     grandchildren's future.\n\n  A letter from Susan Timberlake of Florence, MA:\n\n       I used to be a clinical chemist. We made up ``buffers'' as \n     part of our tools that kept a solution at the pH [that is, \n     relative acidity] that you desired even as you added things \n     that would upset the pH.\n       Really good buffers have really good capacity. \n     CO2 dissolved in water as a bicarbonate has pretty \n     good buffering capability. Once all the buffering capacity is \n     used up the pH change is precipitous. The pH shifts radically \n     and directly as anything else is added to the solution. You \n     lose any control you had over the chemical reaction(s).\n\n  And here is where she makes the connection.\n\n       The oceans are where much of our excess CO2 is \n     going. . . . So far the oceans have been absorbing the \n     CO2. . . . But the coral reefs and the starfish on \n     the west coast of America don't lie. We have no idea . . . \n     how much buffering capacity is left (or not). If we keep this \n     up we will have a well carbonated, acidic--and quite dead--\n     ocean.\n       [That's] [n]ot something I can bear leaving for my children \n     and grandchildren. (And I am a registered Republican--[a] \n     conservationist in the real sense.)\n\n  A letter from Nilan M. MacDonald of Scituate, MA:\n\n       I live in Scituate, MA, on Boston's South Shore. We are \n     about two miles from the coast. In 25 years we could be \n     flooded out. Also, storms are worsening, and we have been \n     left without power for days at a time, which has endangered \n     our health ([and] we are seniors).\n       In 25 years, populations who live at sea level will become \n     climate refugees as sea levels rise. This will affect people \n     worldwide. Crops will be threatened by droughts and floods. \n     Diseases now in check will become rampant as the planet \n     warms. Mosquitos are the deadliest animal vector for human \n     diseases--and their numbers and range will greatly increase \n     with climate change.\n\n  Dorothy Bagley of Hudson, MA writes:\n\n       If folks think that this has been a bad winter in New \n     England and weird all over the world, [consider] how much \n     worse it will be in 25 years. Areas of concern to me [are]: \n     weather changes affecting crops, water supplies, flooding, \n     etc. Our whole style of life is in danger . . .\n       I am a retired Chemistry Teacher and I know what the effect \n     of temperature is on chemical reactions. Our World is one big \n     chemistry experiment . . . with so many variables which \n     compound the problems.\n       We can take steps, however small they may seem, like \n     lessening pollution due to carbon-containing fuels, lower \n     speed limits, increase[d] use of alternative fuels, \n     chang[ing] the Nation's attitude about recycling . . . \n     chang[ing] our transportation by . . . mak[ing} our cars more \n     efficient, etc.\n       Education and focus are the keys. People need to know that \n     they can effect a change both positively and negatively. \n     Unless citizens' attitudes change toward any of the above, \n     nothing will help to minimize what will be in 25 years.\n\n  A letter from Mon Cochran of Orleans, MA, who writes:\n\n       Dear Elizabeth,\n       I am 72 years old and living on Cape Cod, where I grew up. \n     When I was a kid back in the 1940s my parents and other very \n     old people used to tell scary stories about the Hurricane of \n     1938, and how it knocked down all the trees and blew the \n     roofs off houses. We saw pictures of boats smashed on the \n     shore or carried up into the streets by the flood tides.\n       As I grew up in Orleans, we experienced a series of \n     hurricanes, starting with Carol in 1954 and then Diana the \n     next year. Each time our parents remember 1938--and each time \n     I remember being very, very scared as the storms barreled \n     across the bay like furious freight trains while we cowered \n     in the basement. In 1960 Donna came through, and even though \n     I was 18 years old by then the fear that the house would be \n     destroyed brought nightmares.\n       Now I am a grandfather, and know much more about what \n     causes hurricanes and why they can be so destructive than my \n     parents did back then. For the past twenty years or so we \n     have been lucky on the Cape--most of the really bad storms \n     have been confined to the Caribbean or turned inland before \n     reaching us.\n       My grandchildren Tom and Kay and I have been learning about \n     global warming together, and we have noticed, in particular, \n     how our bay, and the ocean it connects to seems to be warmer \n     every year. The ocean water over at Nauset Bay is so warm in \n     the summer that we can boogie board indefinitely without \n     getting cold. What we have been reading about hurricanes is \n     that the warmer the water is, the more energy that is \n     available to the storm and the stronger it becomes.\n       Kay and Tom were very scared by the pictures of Superstorm \n     Sandy they saw on TV and were worried that a storm like that, \n     or worse, might hit us here in South Orleans. As for me, I \n     think it is just a matter of time, but I don't tell them \n     that. They live in Boston and have visions of a great wall of \n     water roaring into Boston Harbor, knocking down all the \n     buildings in the waterfront and surging up into the \n     neighborhood where they live in Roslindale.\n       From what I have been learning, we have already pumped so \n     much extra carbon into the air, that these much more extreme \n     storms are likely to occur no matter what we do. If we \n     redouble our effort to switch to clean energy--solar, wind, \n     hydro, tidal, geothermal, and biofuels--the way they are \n     doing now in Europe, and even in countries such as China and \n     India, then 25 years from now Tom and Kay will know that a \n     sustainable lifestyle is possible and their children can look \n     forward to a much safer and more secure second half of the \n     20th century.\n\n  From Ken Marien of Westminster, MA:\n\n       [I expect to see] [m]ore severe weather patterns, colder \n     colds, warmer warms, dryer days, wetter floods, bigger \n     storms, higher winds, more dust, more mud, loss of marginal \n     growth plant and animal life.\n\n  I have many more letters. As I said, I received more than 5,000 \nletters from people in Massachusetts and across the country. I wish I \ncould read every one of them. I don't kid myself. We are up against an \narmy of lobbyists, and we will not win all the fights ahead. But here \nin the Senate we have leaders who will fight as hard as we can to \nprotect our environmental future.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Whitehouse, has shown dedication \nto addressing climate change and his commitment to ocean issues and the \ncoastline has been visionary.\n  My colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Markey, has committed his \nlong career to protecting and preserving the environment.\n  Senator Boxer, from California, who chairs the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee in the Senate has been a force to fight to protect our \nenvironment. Senator Schatz, from Hawaii, organized Senators to speak \nthrough the night on this issue and is quickly distinguishing himself \nas a leader in the fight against climate change.\n  In a few minutes, Senator Cardin will come forward and continue this \nimportant discussion.\n  I am proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with such dedicated public \nservants and with all of the Senators who have held the floor for so \nmany hours to draw attention to our urgent need for climate change.\n  We are on the cusp of a climate crisis, a point of no return. We can \ncontinue to subsidize polluters and ignore\n\n[[Page S1462]]\n\nthe warnings all around us or we can invest in a future that can create \njobs, a future that can strengthen our national security and, most of \nall, a future that can save our planet.\n  This is our moment in history. We can act, we must act, and we will \nact.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nMaryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, first, I wish to compliment and thank \nSenator Warren for her comments. Senator Warren has brought up a lot of \nissues that I can relate to because our States share the Atlantic \nOcean. We talk about climate refugees around the world, and we are \nstarting to see those in our own States. As sea levels are rising, we \nsee dead zones in the oceans and in our bays. We need to take action in \norder to protect our people.\n  In my State of Maryland, you can see firsthand the effects of the \nrising sea-level. One example is Smith Island. Smith Island is a \nhabitable island in the Chesapeake Bay that is home to many of our \nwatermen who have been practicing their professions for many years. \nThey are at risk.\n  You need a boat to get from one of the towns to the other. Smith \nIsland only has a couple of hundred remaining residents, but they are \nlosing their land daily as they fight to counter the rising sea level \nchange--I think that is a very visible sign of what we are up against--\nand the urgency of dealing with climate change.\n  I am so proud to be identified with the Climate Action Task force. \nMany of the leaders have been mentioned, and I thank Senator Schatz and \nSenator Whitehouse for organizing this opportunity for us to put a \nspotlight on climate change and the need for urgent action. I thank \nSenator Boxer, the chair of the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nfor her extraordinary leadership.\n  Throughout last night and into this morning, we have highlighted the \nscience, which is indisputable, as to the fact that over millions of \nyears we have seen catastrophic changes on our own planet. Because of \nour activities and what we are doing on Earth, within a very short \nperiod of time--just hundreds of years, and less than that now--we are \ncausing a catastrophic impact on our climate. It is urgent. We have \nseen firsthand the impacts of climate change.\n  I was in Beijing, China, last year. I was there 3 days. There wasn't \na cloud in the sky, but I never saw the Sun because of the pollution \nthat was in the air--their carbon emissions. We have seen the costs of \nclimate change in lives and in dollars we spend to try to adapt to the \nnew realities of extreme weather conditions.\n  I will use the few moments I have to talk about the issues that are \ncloser to home in my own State of Maryland. Seventy percent of \nMaryland's population lives in coastal zones. It is now predicted by \nthe Maryland Climate Change Commission that we will see a 1.4-foot \nincrease in the sea level by 2050 and 3.7 feet by the end of this \ncentury. That is going to have a dramatic impact on many Marylanders \nwho live in the coastal area.\n  I can give another example. Ocean City, MD, is a popular place for \nMarylanders and people from outside our State to enjoy the beautiful \nbeaches. I must say that I am very proud that this Congress has \nappropriated millions of dollars for beach renourishment. Those dollars \nhave returned multiple times because they prevent the full force of \nthese nor'easter storms that are more frequent and more severe in \nMaryland and along the Maryland coast. There is a limit as to what we \ncan do if we don't take action to deal with the sources of climate \nchange. We want to protect our property owners, and the best way to \nprotect our property owners is to do something about the causes of \nclimate change.\n  We saw the impact of Sandy along the east coast of the United States. \nI know that the most severe impact was in New Jersey and New York, but \nin Maryland we saw in Crisfield, MD, the full effect of Sandy. The \npeople there know they are at risk because of the severe storms that \nare becoming more frequent and more severe.\n  The Chesapeake Bay itself is at risk. I have talked on the floor many \ntimes about the importance of the Chesapeake Bay, and how it is a \nnational treasure. It is important just by the fact that it is the \nlargest estuary in our hemisphere. It is important because of its \ncoastline and its impact. It is also important because of its impact on \nour economy. The blue crabs and oysters are critically important to \nMaryland. Yet they are at risk.\n  The blue crab is a little complicated, but we know one of the factors \nthat is affecting the blue crabs is the ability of juvenile crabs to be \nable to survive in seagrasses. Yet the seagrass population is declining \nbecause of temperature rise in the Chesapeake Bay. That is just one \nexample of the challenges we have because of climate change. It is \naffecting the economy of my State, and it is affecting the economy of \nour country.\n  The Port of Baltimore is the largest single economic factor creating \njobs in our community, and the Port of Baltimore depends upon a stable \ncoastal climate.\n  The tourism industry is directly affected by climate change. People \nlove to come to our State to hunt and fish. One of the most valuable \nassets we have along the bay is the Blackwater National Wildlife \nRefuge.\n  The Presiding Officer has heard me talk about that frequently in the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. The bald eagles have returned \nto Blackwater. It is an incredible sight. People go there just to see \nthe beauty of nature and to visit our wildlife and our waterfowl.\n  Blackwater is at risk. It is important for tourism, and it is \nimportant for our environment. It is also the land in which Harriet \nTubman conducted the underground railroad, so it has a lot of \nsignificance. Yet, between 1938 and 2006, we lost 5,000 acres of \nmarshland to open water, and that is accelerating. It is not slowing \ndown. If we don't reverse the impacts of climate change, we are going \nto see a more dramatic impact on those types of treasures in Maryland \nand nationally.\n  I will also mention the fact that, of course, this is a Federal \nlegislature, and we should be concerned about the Federal facilities as \nwell. In Maryland we have Pax River, which does incredibly important \nwork for our Navy so they can do their research and flight testing on \nthe coast of our State, and that is at risk by the rising sea-level.\n  I serve on the Board of Visitors at the Naval Academy, and I can tell \nyou I have visited the Naval Academy when it has been flooded because \nof storms. It is a little below sea level at some of its locations. The \nrising sea level jeopardizes that iconic institution that is so \nimportant to our national defense.\n  The Aberdeen Proving Grounds is also located on our coast and does \ncritical work in national security. All of these facilities are being \njeopardized because of the climate change that is occurring in our \ncommunity.\n  I will talk a little bit about some good news. We can reverse what \nhas happened. We can slow down the effects. We can change the course \nthat we are on. We have already done a significant amount. I \ncongratulate President Obama and his policies because he has taken on \nthe major areas that deal with climate change.\n  The United States has to lead internationally, but it starts with \naction right here in the United States. We have to lead by example. \nOther countries are far ahead of us. We have to join with other \ncountries to produce a strategy that works because our environment does \nnot end at our borders. We have to work internationally, but first we \nhave to work at home.\n  What has President Obama done? He has taken on the transportation \nsector, which is one of the greatest uses of carbon fuels, with our \nCAFE standards--our efficiency of our automobiles. We now have \nstandards that would lead to having an automobile get 54\\1/2\\ miles per \ngallon by 2025. That is ambitious. They said we couldn't do it before, \nbut we did it. We met those standards, and we will meet these \nstandards. We will significantly reduce the amount of fuels that we \nneed to fuel our transportation in this country.\n  We are investing in transit facilities, and that reduces our carbon \nfootprint. High-speed rail reduces our carbon footprint. We are \ncommitted to those types of solutions that are common sense to help our \nenvironment.\n  The Obama administration is moving ahead on the regulation of carbon \npollution under the Clean Air Act. They\n\n[[Page S1463]]\n\nrecognize that the energy sector can help reduce our carbon footprint \nsubstantially.\n  Senator Warren was absolutely correct when she said that we don't \nhave a level playing field today. We subsidize the fossil fuels, but we \ndon't with the renewable fuels. We can expand our renewable energy \nsources.\n  Quite frankly, we are showing innovation among all of our \nstakeholders. Buildings use a lot of energy and generate a lot of \ncarbon. The Federal Government is leading in the LEED certification, as \nis the private sector, in doing things that are much more energy \nefficient in the building sector.\n  Therefore, we have seen progress in transportation and buildings and \nthe generation of electricity. We have been reducing our carbon \nfootprint, which will help the people on Smith Island by reducing the \nsea level changes.\n  The Presiding Officer and I saw firsthand the impact of the glacier \nmelts when we were in Greenland. I thank Senator Boxer for arranging \nthat opportunity. We saw very visually the glacier melts and how much \nhas occurred in a very short period of time. We can reverse that by \nshowing leadership in transportation and the way we use our buildings \nand the way we generate electricity. We can work together with the \ninternational community.\n  The good news is that the solutions for dealing with climate change \nwill help our national security by consuming less fossil fuels. We want \nto get to zero as far as our need for imported energy in this country.\n  We can get that. We now know the threats that are made from Russia to \nUkraine to the Middle East. We can eliminate that threat to our \nnational security. We can create more jobs. Green energy will give us \nmore jobs in the fossil fuel industry. We need good-paying jobs. We can \nleave our children and grandchildren a cleaner planet and a better \nfuture. That is what is at stake. That is why we have taken this time. \nI am proud to be identified with so many who have spoken on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Maryland. I \nthank him for all his work on the Chesapeake and so many important \nissues as it relates to this issue and for being here up all night with \nmy colleagues on this important climate issue.\n  I thank Senators Boxer and Whitehouse and Schatz for organizing this \nendeavor and for everybody participating. Obviously we are here to talk \nabout climate change, but like my colleagues we know climate change is \nactually impacting jobs now because it is impacting our climate now. So \nwhile we are here to talk about what might happen in the future, I am \nhere right now to specifically talk about what is happening to our \neconomy and why we need to take action because ocean acidification is \nan economic issue and it affects so many different people in our \neconomy in the Pacific Northwest.\n  It affects our shellfish growers, which is a major industry. We have \nthree and four generations of shellfish growers who are threatened now \nby the impact of carbon in our oceans and the warming of our oceans. So \nwhen you talk about climate and you talk about acidification of our \noceans, you are talking about an industry that is key to the Northwest \nthat is being affected today.\n  Also, our crab fishermen are being affected today, which is an \nimportant part of our fishing industry all the way to the Bering Sea. A \nlot of people do not realize that the Alaska crab fishermen are based \nin Alaska and in Washington State. They very much depend on making sure \nwe deal with this issue in the future if we want to protect these jobs \nand the important industry that is there.\n  Sea levels are rising and forcing communities to deal with this \nissue. We want to help ticket these jobs, even jobs for the salmon \nfisherman. A lot of people watch ``Deadliest Catch'' and understand the \nseafood industry, but they may not understand that even salmon depend \non a food source that is affected by ocean acidification, that it is \nnot just killing oysters and shellfish, but it is also killing these \npteropod that the salmon industry depends on too.\n  You can see I am here to talk in relation to jobs because commercial \nfishing in Washington State is a $30 billion coastal economy with \n42,000 jobs and contributes about $1.7 billion to our gross economic \nproduct. So for us this is the impact of climate that is being felt \ntoday, not in the future. It is being felt today. It threatens a key \nindustry. Not only is that industry important to Washington State, it \nis also important to the Nation. It contributes $70 billion to the U.S. \neconomy and supports over 1 million fishing jobs. So our inaction in \nCongress, deciding not to do something, basically threatens those 1 \nmillion jobs because the climate is impacting our oceans and our oceans \nare impacting the food supply these fishermen harvest.\n  If we do not do something about this, we are going to have severe \nproblems in the future. Why is this? The key point--if we could have \njust one chart today played over and over, I would have this chart--is \nour oceans absorb 25 percent of the CO2 emissions. That is \nright. All of the CO2 emissions, 25 percent of them \nbasically sink into the ocean. So that means carbon emissions from \nfossil fuels are being absorbed into the ocean. That basically creates \na very corrosive environment in our waters.\n  So the notion that people think we can continue doing what we are \ndoing and not make the change, I guarantee you the problems we are \ncausing for our oceans is a serious threat. This graph shows you the \nkind of acidification that is happening in our sea water.\n  That ocean acidification has increased 30 percent over the last 200 \nyears. Oceans are on track to be 150 percent more acidic by the end of \nthe century. The current rate of acidification is 10 times faster than \nanything Earth has experienced in the last 50 million years.\n  As you can see, this increase of carbon and an increase of the \nacidity level in water, an increase in acidification, is what is \ncausing this problem for us. Again, my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle who think this is just something that we do not have to deal \nwith are ignoring the real science and the state of our oceans.\n  What does that acidification cause? I guess if there was another \nchart here I would make this chart also the star of the show, because \nthis is not a science experiment, this is the current state of oyster \nlarvae. Last night I was at a restaurant here in town and they offered \nWashington oysters, shellfish on the menu. That is great to see.\n  But this is a picture of actual larvae, the beginning stages of these \nshellfish that are being impacted. You can see here that this is what \nacidification is doing to that larvae. It is not able to form. We saw \nin 2005 when shellfish production plummeted on the West Coast, it \nseemed like a freak accident, but then it happened again in 2006 and in \n2007. Then in 2008, more than 80 percent of the oysters at Whiskey \nCreek Shellfish Hatchery died before they could be planted into the \nshellfish farm. In total, billions of shellfish died because of that \nacidification. These images from Oregon State University show ocean \nacidification, what it does to the larvae because that acidification \nerodes and becomes corrosive and actually kills the oysters.\n  As I said, these are third- and fourth-generation jobs in my State. \nIt is very important that we protect them. They have been a big driving \npart of our economy. But when corrosive sea water increases and then \nyou have a 60-percent decrease in production, you are talking about \nhundreds of jobs in Washington State that are being impacted. We need \nto do something right now to act.\n  It does not just affect the larvae of oysters, acidification destroys \nother shellfish. This again is another example of a pteropod, which \njust happens to be the food source for salmon. Some of these shellfish \nare what salmon feed off of for a protein source. Yet these same shells \nare not being able to form. Over 30 percent of the marine life in Puget \nSound is a calcifier. So these calcifiers basically are species that \nare a calcium carbonate shell, just like the oysters and the shellfish, \nthat needs to form. That is 30 percent of our marine life, of our food \nsource.\n  So if we do not do something about ocean acidification, these shells \nare not forming, and we are going to have an even more serious impact \nto our salmon industry in Washington State.\n  My constituents know these are big issues. In fact, the Seattle Times \nran a\n\n[[Page S1464]]\n\ngroundbreaking series called ``Sea Change,'' the highlighting of the \nimpact of carbon to the oceans because it could--as this article \ndetails--cause a collapse of that huge Alaska crab fishing industry--a \ncollapse. I know my colleagues from the Northeast are here. They \nunderstand what a collapse to a fishing industry means. They understand \nit means a lot of people without jobs, it means a lot of people who \ndepend on the fishing industry as ancillary or related jobs end up \nwithout jobs. They understand that a collapse of the fishing industry \nmeans a collapse to the economy overall in their region.\n  So if we do not do something to address acidification, we are talking \nabout climate change impacting a key jobs sector and causing huge job \nlosses. That is what this chart shows. Basically it shows how the crab \nharvest industry is being impacted by ocean acidification and that it \ncould cause a very precipitous decline.\n  We cannot afford that. I will show you why we cannot afford that. We \njust recently--people might have caught it on the west coast. You might \nthink what I just showed you is about oysters and about the pteropod \nfor a salmon source, but scallops, we just had I think 1 week ago a \nmassive die-off, another canary in the coal mine. Basically it shows \nthat 10 million scallops died off the coast of British Colombia. \nAcidification was to blame. So acidic water was blamed for west coast \nscallop die-off.\n  It shut down a processing plant and one-third of its workforce. You \ncan see these things basically are killing jobs. So ocean acidification \nkills jobs. Us doing nothing about ocean acidification or about \nCO2 in the atmosphere is going to cause us economic \nproblems.\n  I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to make sure we \nsupport measures that will allow us to mitigate now the impact of this \nand plan for the future because we cannot have what is happening now.\n  We have a buoy system that we have deployed all across the United \nStates. That buoy system helps us identify acidification levels and \nhelps the fishermen come up with alternative strategies about when to \ndo their planting. Let's just say it this way: They figure out when is \na perfect moment to actually have the seeding. If you have too much \nCO2 and a warming of the oceans, then figuring out that very \nmoment where it might not be so acidic or challenging and then actually \ndoing the planting is giving us some problems.\n  But these are high-risk tactics. We actually have to reduce the level \nof CO2. We are here this morning to talk about how this \nissue impacts the industry in my State. But this last chart shows a \npicture that is irrefutable. This is ocean acidification's effects on \ncoral. Here is healthy coral. You can see it is vibrant, colorful. If \nyou have ever been off our coast or walking on the beaches, you can see \nthe shell life that exists in a healthy coral reef.\n  This is the same coral reef years later with an unhealthy effect. We \nare here this morning to talk about jobs, to talk about climate and its \nimpact on our economy today. It is important that we address this \nissue. I have sponsored bipartisan legislation with my colleague on the \nother side of the aisle called the CLEAR Act. It is just one idea, but \nthe premise of that is that we have to not only reduce greenhouse gases \nnow, we have to mitigate the impact and plan for a more diverse energy \nsource in the future.\n  That is what we are talking about. We are talking about trying to \nsave jobs in the United States of America by doing a better job of \nplanning on this important issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I wish to agree with Senator Cantwell, \nour colleague from Washington State, because in New Hampshire we are \nalso seeing the impact of climate change on our traditional industries. \nIt is contributing to sea level rise, it imperils businesses and homes \nin coastal communities such as Portsmouth. New Hampshire's very popular \nHampton Beach is experiencing greater storm surges and beach erosion. \nThe outdoor recreation community is facing shorter winters, less snow, \nand that results in fewer tourism dollars.\n  Wildlife and public health are becoming increasingly vulnerable to \ndiseases. In New Hampshire, tourism is our State's second largest \nindustry. It accounts for $9.3 billion in the State's economy. It \nprovides jobs and economic growth throughout the State, but climate \nchange could put some of New Hampshire's best attractions in jeopardy. \nThe fall foliage in New Hampshire is a main draw for visitors from \naround the world who spend millions annually to see our beautiful \nlandscape. As climate change continues, those warmer temperatures are \ncausing dulling and browning of climate-stressed unhealthy trees.\n\n  Another driver of tourism in New Hampshire is our State's outdoor \nrecreation activities, such as downhill and cross-country skiing, \nsnowshoeing, and snowmobiling. As temperatures increase due to climate \nchange, the ski industry has to make more snow, and that increases \ntheir expenses. In fact, the EPA has predicted that by the end of the \ncentury, summers in New Hampshire could be as warm as summers in North \nCarolina, which would drastically shorten fall foliage without cooler \ntemperatures starting in September. We are already seeing it in terms \nof fewer snow days in New Hampshire and earlier ice out on our lakes.\n  Maple sugar production is being affected. It depends on prolonged \ncold temperatures with freezing nights and warm daytime temperatures to \ncreate the optimal sugar content and sap production. With warming \nunderway, maple sugar producers in New Hampshire tell me they are \nalready seeing an impact on production. According to a report by the \nNew Hampshire Citizens for a Responsible Energy Policy, ``Current \nmodeling forecasts predict that maple sugar trees eventually will be \ncompletely eliminated as a regionally important species in the \nnortheastern United States''--that is, if we fail to act on climate \nchange.\n  New Hampshire's seacoast is facing rising sea levels along our 18 \nmiles of shoreline. The coastline is one of the most developed parts of \nthe State, and flooding could devastate coastal towns and their \neconomies. Ted Diers, who is the administrator of the Watershed \nManagement Bureau of the NH Department of Environmental Services, \nrecently said:\n\n       Sea level has been rising at 6 to 8 inches a century. What \n     we're seeing right now is a tripling of that.\n\n  Climate change is expected to cause widespread tree deaths, which \ncould cause extensive wildfires. We are already seeing that in the \nWest. There are large increases in pest and pathogen outbreaks and a \nlag in the establishment of new forests for several decades. It is also \na threat to animals and their habitats.\n  The moose population in New Hampshire is declining due to warming \ntrends in winter and summer. The fact is that New Hampshire's moose \npopulation is down 40 percent this year, and it is the result of ticks. \nWe have not had winters that are cold enough to cause those ticks to \ndie off, and so we are seeing that across our wildlife population.\n  What is happening in New Hampshire is happening around the world. We \nmust take action now to slow these harmful trends, and we can make \nprogress. We should be looking at all kinds of ways to make progress, \nto address what is happening to our environment.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to find \nsmart and sensible solutions because New Hampshire's economy, the \nhealth of our citizens, the U.S. economy, the world's economy, and our \nhealth all depend on it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I want the 31 colleagues who have been on \nthe floor to know how proud I am. As I have watched throughout the \nevening and this morning, I have seen our colleagues continue to hold \nthis floor to try to bring attention to climate change. I am very proud \nof them.\n  I have the privilege of being the cleanup hitter in this session that \nhas gone on for hours and hours. I want to speak from the perspective \nof the part of the United States that is going to be and is most \naffected by sea level rise, which is a consequence of climate change; \nthat is, the State of Florida. I also want to speak from the \nperspective of outer space.\n\n[[Page S1465]]\n\n  When someone looks back at the planet through the window of a \nspacecraft--which I had the privilege of doing 28 years ago in the \nearly part of the space shuttle program, the space shuttle Columbia, \nwhich was piloted by now-retired Marine Gen. Charlie Bolden, who is the \nhead of NASA and has been for the past 5 years--when we look back at \nour home, we see this incredible creation that is so colorful suspended \nin the midst of nothing. Space is nothing. Space is an airless vacuum \nthat goes on and on for billions of light years, and there is our home \nand it is so beautiful, yet it looks so fragile from that perspective \nof miles and miles away. What the naked eye can see from that altitude \nas we orbit the Earth at 17,500 miles an hour is incredible in the \ndetail we can see, but some of that detail is quite disturbing.\n  For example, coming across the Amazon I could see the color contrast. \nI could see the destruction of the rain forest. Then I could look to \nthe east coast of Brazil at the mouth of the Amazon. I could see the \nsilt that discolored the waters of the Atlantic for hundreds of miles, \nthe extra silt coming off the destruction of the trees upriver.\n  On the other side of the globe, for example, coming across Madagascar \n28 years ago when they were cutting down all of their trees for fuel, \nfor fires, and as a result there was no vegetation, and when the rains \ncame, the water ran down the hills, the silt came into the rivers, and \nwe could see for miles and miles at the mouths of the rivers from \nMadagascar--flying 203 miles above the surface of the Earth, we could \nsee the effects. We could see those kinds of effects in the midst of \nthat God-given beauty, that the Earth is so fragile.\n  We could look at the rim of the Earth and see this thin film. It went \ninto a blue band that then went into the blackness of space, and we \ncould see what sustains all of life--the atmosphere. As a result, I \ncertainly became more of an environmentalist because I saw in its \nentirety how fragile this ecosystem is.\n  We could see the effects of storms. We were up in January, so we saw \na hurricane in the Southern Hemisphere going clockwise, not \ncounterclockwise as in the Northern Hemisphere. For hundreds of miles, \nthere was this storm in the Indian Ocean. We could see from that \nperspective of the window of a spacecraft the delicacy of this God-\ncreated ecological balance.\n  What we have done, as we burn more fuel and carbon dioxide goes into \nthe air, instead of what was created where the Earth's rays come in and \nhit the surface--where the Sun's rays come in through the atmosphere \nand hit the Earth's surface and reflect back into space, suddenly the \nexcess gases in the atmosphere create a kind of greenhouse effect, \nwhich then traps the heat. The heat, as it reflects off of the Earth's \nsurfaces and bounces as it radiates back into space, can't get out and \nthe Earth continues to heat.\n  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projects that the globe \ncould warm 1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. It \nalso estimated that sea levels could rise from 1 foot to 3 feet over \nthe same period.\n  Since we are talking about inches, degrees, and hundreds of years, \nnow I want to go from space to my home in my native State of Florida, \nwhich is ground zero for the sea level rise. What will Florida look \nlike in the year 2100? Florida has a population closing in on 20 \nmillion people. We are surpassing New York as the third-largest State. \nAbout 14 million of those people live along the coast, and that number \nis going to double by the year 2100. In those coastal cities and towns, \nthere are homes, schools, powerplants, water treatment plants, roads, \nand bridges which could be underwater as the sea level rises. This \nisn't only hypothetical; this is real. Florida's Atlantic University, \none of our great State universities, indicates that Florida has \nrecorded 5 to 8 inches of sea level rise in the last half century. This \nrate is a rate of 1 foot per century, and it is about 8 times the \naverage rate over the past 2,500 years. Today at high tide we can see \nfor ourselves the flooded roads. They are a regular occurrence. We can \nsee the flooded neighborhoods. We can see what happens when the \ninfrastructure is flooded.\n  If we just take a few years further in this century, 2060, we are \ngoing to see close to 1 to 2 feet of sea level rise. According to the \nNational Research Council, by 2100 that number could be as much as 3 \nfeet. Do you want to see what 3 feet is? Three feet of sea level rise--\nlook at the heavy population of southeast Florida. Look at all of these \nportions of the Everglades. Look at the Florida Keys--gone, under \nwater. Look at the Fort Myers area, the Caloosahatchee River, Charlotte \nBay, and look at Tampa Bay. Look where our space shuttle launched from \npad 39A, Cape Canaveral--under water. Look at all of the coast of \nFlorida, look over here at the tremendous Apalachicola oyster estuary--\nunder water, and so forth and so on. That is what prominent scientific \norganizations have estimated at the end of this century: a 3-foot rise \nin the sea and 14 million people--a population that over the course of \nthe next few decades will double; 28 million people living on the coast \nof Florida--are going to be under water. Why aren't people paying \nattention?\n  Before I came to the Senate, I had one of the toughest jobs I had \never had in elected public service. I was the elected insurance \ncommissioner in Florida. The task fell to me in the aftermath of the \nmonster storm Hurricane Andrew to resuscitate the insurance marketplace \nback to life.\n  Back then, in the early 1990s, we could see monster storms meant \nwarming of the climate, warmer ocean temperatures, more frequency and \nferocity of storms. So as the then-insurance commissioner, I tried to \ngo to the insurance companies to try to start getting them interested \nin protecting the investments they insured, and they kept their heads \nin the sand. We couldn't get it.\n\n  So you can see that 75 percent of the State's population on the coast \nmakes up 80 percent of the State's total income. Because we have more \nbeaches than any other State, we have more coastline than any other \nState, save for Alaska, and a warmer climate, we have a great tourism \nindustry--a tourism industry that attracts 37,000 companies to \nFlorida--businesses related to the coast, from boating, to fishing, to \nlodging, to leisure recreation, all told employing a quarter of a \nmillion people.\n  This 1,350 miles of coastline is a magnet for visitors. They come and \nthey enjoy the beaches. They fish for red snapper in Destin, up here. \nThey look for red snapper off of Panama City. Maybe they go for \nscallops off of Cedar Key. Maybe they go to see the spring training \ngames in Tampa. Maybe they watch the sunsets from the Florida Keys. \nWell, you can see what is happening. The most recent data from the \nState indicates that in 2011 tourists spent $67 billion in Florida and \ncontributed $4 billion to our State treasury.\n  So while a lot of people have their heads in the sand, some local \nleaders, happily some local elected leaders are starting to do \nsomething about it. The city of Miami Beach already experiences \nflooding and drainage problems due to the high tides. They are planning \nto spend $200 million to purchase more pump stations, raise seawalls, \nand upgrade stormwater storage. Do you know whom we are talking to? \nHolland, the Netherlands. We are trying to learn about large-scale \ndikes and engineering fixes and how the Dutch have kept their lands \ndry. Miami Beach is taking the initiative so that homes and businesses \nwill continue to thrive.\n  The higher sea levels--get this--also threaten the water supply. Do \nyou know why? Because Florida is basically land on top of a vast \nlimestone honeycomb. Like a sponge, it holds freshwater deep \nunderground, but when the sea level rises, the saltwater moves in and \nreplaces the freshwater, so those aquifers become too salty or \nbrackish. You can't drink that. That is happening, and it is happening \nin a little town on the southeast coast of Florida called Hallandale \nBeach. Their local officials are spending right now $16 million to \nupgrade their stormwater system and move the city's drinking water \nsystem to the west side of the city, further away from the coast.\n  So local leaders are making the tough decisions to prepare for the \nfuture, and that is one reason I have the privilege of having the \nsupport of Senator Rockefeller, the chairman of the commerce committee, \nand we are going to take a commerce committee field hearing during the \nApril recess down to South Florida, to Miami Beach, and we\n\n[[Page S1466]]\n\nare going to hear what local governments, businesses, and even \nreinsurance companies are doing in the wake of the sea level rise.\n  One additional thing. I described what CO2 does, going \ninto the air and creating the greenhouse effect, which stops the \nradiating of the Sun's heat back out into space. But there is another \nthing it does. Because carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is making our \noceans more acidic, it threatens the coral reefs and all of the \ncreatures in the ocean, from lobsters to clams.\n  This is a picture of a healthy coral reef.\n  This is not.\n  The coral reef system in Florida is responsible for bringing in $3.5 \nbillion in sales and income, and off of the coast of South Florida it \nsupports 36,000 jobs. More acidic water means oysters, crabs, and \nlobsters are threatened. Biologists tell us that when shelled organisms \nare at risk, the entire food web may also be at risk because the reefs \nprovide the core reproductive and feeding habitat for the marine life.\n  So I come to the end of my comments, Mr. President. Whether you look \nat it from the perspective of the Senator from Florida, whose State is \nseverely threatened at this moment, or from the perspective of the \nwindow of a spacecraft, looking back at this creation we call home, \nplanet Earth, we are in severe jeopardy, and it is time for us to get \nout of our lethargy and recognize the problem happening in front of our \nvery eyes.\n  I am so proud of my colleagues. Before the Senators came in, I said \nthat I had been watching on C-SPAN during the course of last evening \nand this morning, and I am so proud of you for what you have done in \nbringing attention to this issue.\n\n\n                       Hawaii Travel and Tourism\n\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, as you have heard here tonight, climate \nchange is real, it is caused by humans, it is happening now, it is \nsolvable, and it is time for Congress to wake up and take action.\n  I want to talk now about an important sector of the U.S. economy and \nhow it is specifically impacted by climate change.\n  I am talking about travel and tourism. It is a major economic driver \nin this country, representing almost 3 percent of the gross domestic \nproduct. It generates nearly $1.5 trillion in economic output and \nsupports nearly 8 million jobs.\n  This sector is critical to my home state of Hawai`i but as chairman \nof the commerce committee's tourism subcommittee, I am also concerned \nabout the economic impacts climate change could have on this critical \nindustry for the entire Nation.\n  The U.S. welcomed nearly 70 million international arrivals in 2012 \nwho spent almost $130 billion on hotels, restaurants, airline tickets, \nshopping, attractions, and more. This is significant.\n  As the United States works to meet our national goal of welcoming 100 \nmillion international visitors annually by 2021, we must think of how \nclimate change factors into the equation for this economic sector as \nwell as how the industry itself contributes to climate change.\n  Travel and tourism is responsible for about 5 percent of global \nCO2 emissions. Transportation generates three quarters of \nthese emissions with the majority coming from air travel.\n  In addition to transportation, the hospitality sector also consumes \nsignificant amounts of water for bathrooms, landscaping, laundries, and \nkitchens, and consumes sizeable quantities of electricity for lighting, \nheating and cooling systems and elevator and other equipment.\n  Changes in extreme weather caused by climate change will impact this \nindustry and the experience our visitors have while exploring our \nStates and territories by potentially damaging travel and tourism-\nrelated infrastructure, increasing the required investment in emergency \npreparedness to prepare coastal tourism communities for disasters, \nincreasing operating expenses to do business in challenging and \nuncertain conditions; and discouraging travel to affected areas.\n  As we certainly know here in Washington, DC, the United States has \nexperienced an extreme winter season this year, with record cold \ntemperatures and plenty of snow. As extreme weather events continue to \noccur, made more frequent by a changing climate, the travel and tourism \nindustry will continue to feel the impact.\n  To put this into real terms, economists estimate that the \ncancellation of one domestic flight for weather-related reasons costs \nover $31,000 in passengers' lost economic activity or $3.5 billion in \n2013.\n  The travel and tourism industry is a major economic driver in Hawaii. \nIt is the biggest generator of jobs. More than eight million visitors \ncame to Hawaii in 2013 and spent $14.5 billion in Hawaii. Damage to our \nvisitor industry will cost us jobs and threaten our economic \nprosperity.\n  If we don't act now, climate change over the next several decades \ncould have a negative impact on Hawaii's visitor industry. Climate \nchange affects the quantity and quality of Hawaii's tourism assets, \nincluding our beaches, coral reefs, and tropical ecosystems.\n  Extreme weather and natural disasters, like droughts and hurricanes, \nare also made worse and more severe by climate change and impact \nresidents and visitors alike.\n  But it is not enough to just recognize the impacts of climate change \non tourism. One of the themes here tonight is that climate change is \nsolvable.\n  We have a responsibility as policymakers to strike a sensible balance \nbetween the positive and negative aspects of travel and tourism and \nensure that it is conducted in an environmentally sustainable way.\n  According to the United Nations World Tourism Organization, ``There \nis now a wide recognition of the urgent need for the tourism industry, \nnational governments, and international organizations to develop and \nimplement strategies to face the changing climate conditions and to \ntake preventive actions for future effects, as well as to mitigate \ntourism's environmental impacts contributing to climate change.''\n  The U.S. travel and tourism industry recognizes its impacts and is \nstepping up to the challenge of mitigating its contribution to climate \nchange.\n  The US Travel Association says that, ``the [U.S.] travel community as \na whole and its sectors individually are committed to taking actions to \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions and explore mitigation measures needed \nto address climate change impacts.''\n  In my home State, Hawaiian Airlines is working to reduce its \nemissions. It was awarded the first ever aviation-based carbon credit \nin 2012 for its use of the EcoPower engine wash system, which reduces \nfuel consumption--saving the company money at the same time.\n  One of our biotech companies is working on producing advanced \nbiofuels for aviation and has signed a deal to produce green fuel for \nAlaska Airlines, perhaps as soon as 2018.\n  Hotels have gone far beyond simply asking guests to reuse towels and \nclose lanai doors to save on water and energy. They have invested in \ntechnology to improve lighting efficiency, manage energy use in \nunoccupied spaces and improve the efficiency of building equipment to \ndecrease energy and water use while not impacting guest services. And \nthey are continuing to look for more ways to operate efficiently, \nincluding technology such as seawater air conditioning.\n  We can solve the problem through reductions in our energy use by \nimproving energy efficiency, increasing the use of renewable energy, \nchanging how we conduct business, and adopting policies that promote \nsustainable tourism.\n  We need to work together to implement policies that support the \ncontinued growth of this important sector to support jobs and economic \nprosperity. We need to protect the natural resources that bring \nvisitors from around the world to our beautiful country and to my home \nstate of Hawaii.\n  It is time for Congress to act.\n\n\n                              Asia Pacific\n\n  Mr. President. We have heard from many colleagues tonight about the \nchallenges of climate change and the need for urgent action. Left \nunaddressed it has the potential to impact the lives and livelihoods of \nnearly everyone on the planet.\n  As Secretary of State John Kerry cautioned recently in a speech in \nJakarta, climate change is akin to many other global challenges that \n``know no borders,'' like terrorism, disease, poverty and nuclear \nproliferation.\n  ``The reality is that climate change ranks right up there with every \nsingle\n\n[[Page S1467]]\n\none of them,'' he said. I could not agree more.\n  But with every challenge comes an opportunity. And just as the world \nhas come together to confront the crises of pandemic disease and the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, climate change too holds \nthe potential for collective action.\n  So I would like to spend some time tonight discussing climate change \nin a different way--not just as a problem to be solved, but as an \nopportunity for the U.S. to exercise its leadership in the world; an \nopportunity for the U.S. to develop long-lasting and effective \npartnerships with the international community.\n  Regardless of whether all Americans believe global climate change \nshould be a top priority and an issue worthy of immediate Congressional \nattention, I believe that we all can agree this issue should be a part \nof our diplomatic and development efforts with countries facing the \ngravest and most immediate climate change impacts.\n  Nowhere is this more true than in the Asia-Pacific region, where \nAmerica's partners and allies face acute and imminent risks associated \nwith climate change, such as sea-level rise, extreme weather, flooding, \nand environmental degradation.\n  According to the U.N.'s Environmental Program:\n\n       Asia-Pacific is one of the most vulnerable regions to \n     climate change and impacts are likely to become more intense \n     in the future. Rising temperatures and extreme weather events \n     have contributed to loss of crop yield in many countries. \n     Crop yields are projected to decline by a further 10 percent \n     by 2020.\n       Sea-level rise is likely to result in significant losses of \n     coastal ecosystems and put nearly a million people along the \n     coasts of South and Southeast Asia at risk. Diarrheal disease \n     primarily associated with climatic changes will also put many \n     lives at risk in South and Southeast Asia. In addition, the \n     greenhouse gas emissions of a number of Asia-Pacific \n     countries are large and will grow significantly in future if \n     actions are not taken to curb emissions.''\n\n  The Obama administration's foreign policy rebalance to the Asia \nPacific has been well-covered in recent months. With nearly a third of \nthe Earth's population and one quarter of global GDP, ``America's \nfuture prosperity and security are intertwined with the East Asia \nPacific region.'' What America's rebalance to the region will mean for \nU.S. military engagement and U.S. traditional diplomacy in the region \nhas been widely discussed. Yet, issues such as the region's huge \nproportion of the planet's biodiversity vulnerable to climate change \nhave gone largely unnoticed in the discussions.\n  To strengthen our existing relationships and to develop new \npartnerships, we must bring our engagement with Asia-Pacific countries \non global climate change issues to the forefront of diplomatic and \ndevelopment efforts. This includes promoting efforts to help countries \nadapt to their most vulnerable risks. By developing a robust global \nclimate change engagement plan, we are also countering the naysayers \nwho claim that the United States rebalance to the Asia Pacific is only \nabout projecting military power in the region.\n  In fact, promoting climate change mitigation and adaptation \nstrategies as part of our foreign policy toolkit would serve to \ndeescalate military tensions in the region by demonstrating that our \nrealignment to the region is more than military power. I would like to \nspend the next few minutes detailing several avenues for addressing \nclimate change in the region, with some specific examples of how we and \nour partners are already engaging on the issue.\n  First, I will discuss our traditional diplomatic efforts and the \nimportance of developing and enhancing bilateral and multilateral \nagreements and partnerships.\n  Second, I will highlight how climate change mitigation has become an \nintegral part of our development and foreign aid packages. Finally, I \nwill advocate for a cross-sector approach that brings together private \nsector investments, non-governmental organizations, and educational and \nscientific partners.\n  It is important for the United States to collaborate in ways that, \nfirst and foremost, promote America's interests. However, we must also \nrecognize that we can learn valuable lessons from our partners and \nallies as well. As a recent progress report on President Obama's \nClimate Action Plan states: ``Just as no country is immune from the \nimpacts of climate change, no country can meet this challenge alone.''\n  In that light, we have much to learn from other countries confronting \nthe crisis of climate change, just as much as we have to share about \nour efforts to manage the challenge ourselves.\n  In June 2013, President Obama presented his Climate Action Plan, \nwhich laid out the case for action on climate change and the steps his \nadministration will take to address it. The Climate Action Plan \nincludes measures to lead international efforts to address global \nclimate change.\n  It is particularly important that we expand bilateral cooperation on \nclimate change with the major emerging economies in the Asia-Pacific \nregion, China and India, and the President's plan has started to do \nthat.\n  Climate change was a central theme of the United States-China \nStrategic and Economic Dialogue in July 2013. The United States-China \nWorking Group on Climate Change launched five focus areas to deepen \nbilateral efforts to address greenhouse gas emissions: reducing heavy-\nduty vehicle emissions; smart grids; carbon capture, utilization, and \nstorage; collecting and managing greenhouse gas data; and energy \nefficiency in buildings and industry.\n  In December, during Vice President Biden's visit to China, the United \nStates and China committed to reviewing their fossil fuel subsidies \nunder the G20 process. In addition, China committed to implement \naggressive low sulfur fuel and motor vehicle emissions standards. These \nstandards can pave the way toward the adoption of more fuel efficient \ntechnologies, and ultimately lower greenhouse gas emissions. The United \nStates is also working with China to combat short-lived climate \npollutants.\n  During Indian Prime Minister Singh's visit to Washington in October \n2013, the United States and India launched a new large-scale off-grid \nclean energy initiative to help bring clean energy to those under-\nserved by the electricity grid, as well as an initiative to help India \ndeploy advanced space cooling technology.\n  We must also continue to engage in the region through multilateral \norganizations like the United Nations, the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations, ASEAN, and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation, APEC. \nASEAN members are also attempting to tackle climate change issues in \nthe region. Several countries have announced voluntary mitigation \ntargets, including Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore. \nASEAN has also developed a Socio-Cultural Community Blueprint, an \ninnovative strategy to ``enhance regional and international cooperation \nto address the issue of climate change and its impacts on socio-\neconomic development, health and the environment in ASEAN Member States \nthrough implementation of mitigation and adaptation measures, based on \nthe principles of equity, flexibility, effectiveness, common but \ndifferentiated responsibilities, respective capabilities, as well as \nreflecting on different social and economic conditions.''\n  On the economic and energy front, APEC leaders have:\n\n     proposed a regional goal to reduce energy intensity by at \n     least 45 percent by 2035. To this end, APEC Ministers \n     determined to improve energy efficiency and support the use \n     of cleaner and more efficient energy technologies by setting \n     individual goals and action plans; collaborating with the \n     International Energy Agency to develop energy efficiency \n     indicators; sharing information on energy efficiency policies \n     and measures; and encouraging APEC economies to contribute to \n     and utilize the APEC Energy Standards Information System. \n     Economies are held accountable through the APEC Peer Review \n     Mechanism on Energy Efficiency.\n       This peer review is also a vehicle for economies to share \n     their respective policies, experiences, information and \n     ultimately to improve energy efficiency.\n\n  United States development assistance is also rising to meet the \nchallenges of climate change in the Asia-Pacific region. Three projects \nare particularly noteworthy:\n  The United States Agency for International Development is investing \n$7.3 million in the Indonesia Forestry and Climate Support program, \nwhich works with the Indonesian government, the private sector, and \ncommunities to improve forest governance and planning\n\n[[Page S1468]]\n\nat the district level; promote sustainable forest management in target \nlandscapes; and increase sustainable development of local economies by \nengaging private sector partners who can provide financing and \ntechnical expertise;\n  The United States Agency for International Development is investing \n$2.9 million in the Asia-Pacific Climate Change Adaptation Support \nFacility, known as ADAPT. ADAPT will work with governments in the Asia-\nPacific region to support training on the preparation of financeable \nadaptation projects, and provide assistance for analysis and financial \nreview of selected project proposals. The program will link climate \nfund managers with representatives of government adaptation projects to \nidentify adaptation investment opportunities and facilitate access to \nclimate funds. A regional knowledge platform will also broadly \ndisseminate best practices, climate fund eligibility requirements, and \napplication procedures;\n  The United States Agency for International Development is investing \n$2 million in the Maldives Program to Enhance Climate Resiliency and \nWater Security. The United States Agency for International Development \nwill partner with the Maldives Ministry of Housing and Environment, \nprovincial utility service providers, and Island Councils and residents \non two northern islands to assess long-term climate vulnerability and \ndevelop cost-effective adaptation strategies. The program will support \ninnovative solutions to the growing problem of water scarcity, which is \nmade worse by climate change and sea level rise. The program will \nassist the Government's goal of developing the standards and criteria \nfor a ``climate resilient island'' model program that can be replicated \nthroughout the country, and potentially in other small island \ndeveloping states.\n  As a Senator from the island State of Hawaii, I have a particular \ninterest in this last project. Hawaii stands in the center of the Asia-\nPacific region.\n  The people of Hawaii--including native Hawaiians who have lived on \nour islands for millennia--and Hawai`i-based institutions such as the \nEast-West Center provide a unique cultural and geographic perspective \non global climate change and stand ready to serve as ambassadors for \nclimate change issues in the region.\n  In Hawaii, I have been involved with the Asia Pacific Disaster Risk \nReduction and Resilience, APDR3, initiative, which was launched at the \nAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings in Honolulu in 2011. APDR3 \nrecognizes that ``there are steps we can take to mitigate the impact of \nnatural disasters, but we must work together across all sectors of \nsociety in order to maximize our effectiveness.\n  The APDR3 network, hosted by the University of Hawaii Foundation, is \na collaborative initiative, which works across six sectors of society--\nacademia, business, government, military, nonprofit organizations and \ncivil society, and philanthropy. The network believes that by working \ntogether through a `whole of society' approach, we can enhance our \nability to reduce risks from disasters and build more resilient \ncommunities and economies in the Asia-Pacific region.\n  Government and international organization efforts to mitigate climate \nchange are important, but the public sector cannot do it alone. If we \nare to truly make significant progress, the APDR3's cross-sector \napproach must be replicated on a much wider scale. Innovative solutions \nare being developed in think-tanks, universities and other non-profit \ninstitutions across the United States.\n  To cite just one example, International Food Policy Research \nInstitute fellow Mark Rosegrant has published findings that climate \nchange could cause the production of irrigated and rain-fed staple \ncrops--rice and wheat in Asia, and taro, sweet potatoes, and cassava in \nthe Pacific--to decline by as much as 25 percent by 2050.\n  According to Rosegrant, ``this will have a direct effect on \nnutrition, increasing the number of malnourished children in the area \nby an additional 9 to 11 million.'' However, Rosegrant proposes \nsolutions to the worst scenarios. Through ``targeted, aggressive \ninvestment in agricultural research, rural roads, and irrigation,'' \nRosegrant believes we cut the increase in childhood malnutrition due to \nclimate change significantly. This type of investment, however, hinges \non ``regional cooperation on research'' and ``nonagricultural \ninvestments for clean water and maternal education.''\n  ``In addition to these increased investments, Rosegrant's other \nrecommendations include establishing regional centers of excellence in \nthe Pacific countries to link national and international research \ncenters; forming integrated data management, monitoring, and evaluation \nsystems for a wide range of market and climate information; opening the \nglobal agricultural trading regime to share risk and increase \nresilience; and revitalizing extension systems to include local \nparticipation and effectively coordinate public, private, and NGO \nproviders.''\n  Many of these ideas would help countries in the region mitigate other \npotential effects of climate change as well. It is crucial that \ngovernments utilize studies and recommendations such as these when \ndeveloping policies on climate change.\n  I close with this reminder: climate change is not merely a \ncomplicated problem to be solved; it is an opportunity for the United \nStates to demonstrate forward-thinking leadership and positive \nengagement with the world community. Climate change diplomacy, \nespecially in the Asia Pacific, has the potential to transform our \nrelationship with present and future partners and strategic allies for \nyears to come.\n  It must serve as cornerstone of our rebalance to the region. Let us \nseize that opportunity.\n\n\n                           National Security\n\n  Mr. President. One of the themes that we have heard tonight is that \nclimate change is a challenge that affects all Americans--from small \nbusinesses and local farmers to major corporations and agricultural \ncommunities. But there is one community that I would like to focus \nspecific attention on because the consequences of climate change fall \non its shoulders in unique ways: the U.S. military.\n  In an interview last year, ADM Samuel J. Locklear III, commander of \nthe United States Pacific Command in my home State of Hawaii, argued \nthat climate change is the greatest long-term security challenge in the \nAsia-Pacific region. Upheaval and political instability from climate \nchange he said ``is probably the most likely thing that is going to \nhappen . . . that will cripple the security environment, probably more \nlikely than the other scenarios we all often talk about.''\n  His comments echoed those of 11 retired 3-star and 4-star admirals \nand generals who, in 2007, unequivocally stated that climate change is \na ``significant national security challenge'' that can serve as a \n``threat multiplier for instability in some of the most volatile \nregions of the world.'' Their comments are not without a sense of \nurgency.\n  As Admiral Locklear explained last year, ``I'm into the consequence \nmanagement side of it. I'm not a scientist.'' When he testified before \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee last April, Admiral Locklear made \nhis point clearer when he explained the urgency for preventive action. \nHe said:\n\n       We are also seeing--if you go to USAID and you ask the \n     numbers for my PACOM AOR how many people died due to natural \n     disasters from 2008 to 2012, it was about 280,000 people \n     died. Now, they weren't all climate change or weather-\n     related, but a lot of them were due to that. About 800,000 \n     people were displaced and there was about $500 billion of \n     lost productivity.\n\n  Admiral Locklear's comments and those of his former colleagues before \nhim are not out of the ordinary. They reflect the growing consensus \nwithin the Department of Defense and the broader national security \ncommunity that climate change is real and already shaping the global \nsecurity environment in new and profound ways.\n  The Department of Defense is focused on two areas in particular.\n  First, climate change is shaping the U.S. military's strategic \noperating environment, forcing the Department of Defense to grapple \nwith new mission requirements that it generally did not anticipate a \ndecade ago.\n  In its 2010 strategic planning document, the Quadrennial Defense \nReview, the Department of Defense for the first time concluded that, \n``While climate change alone does not cause conflict, it may act as an \naccelerant of instability\n\n[[Page S1469]]\n\nor conflict, placing a burden to respond on civilian institutions and \nmilitaries around the world.''\n  Simply put, the drivers of instability that fragile States already \nconfront--drought, food shortages, water scarcity, and pandemic \ndisease--may be made worse as a consequence of climate change. These \nstresses could break the backs of weak central governments and \ninstitutions in countries around the world where the United States has \nenduring interests--places such as Burma and Pakistan, to name a few.\n  Last week, the Department of Defense confirmed its initial \nconclusions when it published its 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review, \nnoting that:\n\n       The pressures caused by climate change will influence \n     resource competition while placing additional burdens on \n     economies, societies, and governance institutions around the \n     world. These effects are threat multipliers that will \n     aggravate stressors abroad such as poverty, environmental \n     degradation, political instability, and social tensions--\n     conditions that can enable terrorist activity and other forms \n     of violence.\n\n  The more pressing concern for the U.S. military, perhaps, might be \nwith those countries that are most vulnerable to extreme weather events \nand least capable of responding to them. Like drought, food shortages \nand other environmental grievances, natural disasters can overwhelm \nweak governments, contributing to the conditions that lead to \ninstability and violence.\n  With each passing day, as we pump more carbon dioxide into the \natmosphere, we know that we are increasing our chances of extreme \nweather events that carry with them dangerous consequences.\n  The Asia-Pacific region is particularly at risk of extreme weather \nevents that may become more frequent and severe as a result of climate \nchange. The National Intelligence Council cautioned last year that, \n``Asian cities are vulnerable to the severe weather connected to \nclimate change, which amplifies storm surges and flooding of low-lying \nareas.''\n  The tragic typhoon that struck the Philippines last November, while \nnot directly attributable to climate change, is a stark reminder of the \nkinds of natural catastrophes that the U.S. military gets called on to \nrespond to.\n  As Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel noted not long after this awful \nevent:\n\n       Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines is a reminder of \n     humanitarian disaster brought on by nature. And \n     climatologists warn us of the increased probability of more \n     destructive storms to come.\n\n  The Department of Defense recognizes that it has a role to play in \nsupporting humanitarian assistance and disaster relief missions. And \nlike many first responders, the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces \nhave an obligation to respond when called on because the U.S. military \nis often the only organization with the capability and personnel \nnecessary to support those most in need, including fixed- and rotary-\nwing aircraft that can bring relief supplies to communities otherwise \ncutoff from the outside world.\n  But we should not be resigned to be the world's 911 first responder--\ncrouched in a reactive posture to respond to the next climate-related \ndisaster. As the Department of Defense has already noted and planned \nfor, ``Proactive engagement with these countries can help build their \ncapability to respond to such events.''\n  And as Admiral Locklear stated, U.S. Pacific Command can play an \nimportant role in helping our partners and allies build their \ncapacities to respond to natural disasters, building their civil \ndefense forces so that they can mobilize ahead of an impending storm. \nThe U.S. military can work with them to professionalize their air \nforces, training them to be more efficient users of search and rescue \naircraft and other capabilities so that they can do more with less.\n  Next month, Hawaii will host the inaugural United States-ASEAN \nDefense Forum in Honolulu, convening 10 of the defense ministers from \nthe Association of Southeast Asia Nations to discuss challenges that \nour countries face in the region. I hope that leaders use this forum in \npart as an opportunity to discuss the urgency of climate change and an \nopportunity for proactive engagement to weather any climate-related \nimpacts in the future.\n  Proactive engagement is cost-effective and can serve as a force \nmultiplier for U.S. military forces in the future by helping our \npartners and allies develop the resources and skills they need to help \nthemselves; freeing our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines and \ncoastguardsmen to defend our interests elsewhere, responding only when \nabsolutely necessary.\n  The simple fact though is that the U.S. has treaty obligations and \nagreements with many of these vulnerable states. But regardless of \nthose commitments, we also have a moral obligation to help those \ncountries most in need. When the next disaster strikes, the U.S. \nmilitary will be called on to provide relief. And that will force \ndefense planners to make tradeoffs somewhere else. But if we can reduce \nthe number of military assets and personnel required to support natural \ndisaster relief by making it possible for other countries to help \nthemselves then we should do that.\n  In an increasingly lean budget environment, we owe it to the U.S. \nmilitary to make wiser investments where possible. Preventive \nengagement is a smart solution. Such a commitment of our time and \nresources would recognize an age-old truism that an ounce of prevention \nis worth a pound of cure.\n  Besides the prospect of more frequent humanitarian assistance and \ndisaster relief missions, the Department of Defense is also facing new \nmission requirements as a result of a new theater of operations that \nuntil recently has largely been quiet--the Arctic.\n  Rapid environmental change at the top of the world is quickly making \nthe Arctic one of the most accessible maritime domains on the planet. \nSecretary Hagel declared last November that, ``Climate change is \nshifting the landscape in the Arctic more rapidly than anywhere else in \nthe world.''\n  What is striking is how quickly the region is changing. Chief of \nNaval Operations ADM Anthony Greenert wrote recently in the U.S. Navy's \nupdated Arctic Roadmap that ``ice conditions in the Arctic Ocean are \nchanging more rapidly than first anticipated.''\n  The pace of change in the region compelled the Department of Defense \nto develop its first-ever arctic strategy to provide for a ``secure and \nstable Arctic,'' which Secretary Hagel presented last November to an \ninternational security forum in Halifax, NS.\n  To achieve the strategic aims that he laid out for the Department, \nSecretary Hagel presented eight simple objectives, to include \n``[evolving] Arctic infrastructure and capabilities at a pace \nconsistent with changing conditions.''\n  Simply put, the U.S. military will likely face new mission \nrequirements in the Arctic as a result of climate change, and those \nrequirements might develop sooner than we may expect.\n  These new mission requirements did not come out of the blue, of \ncourse. The U.S. military operated in the Arctic during the cold war, \nand there had been growing acceptance that as climate change continues \nto take its toll on the region it would operate in High North once \nagain.\n  The Defense Science Board concluded in 2011, for example, that \n``Climate change is currently having a major impact on the demands of \nmilitary operations in the Arctic,'' and that the military would need \n``additional capabilities to meet the demands of the expanded Arctic \nmission.''\n  What sets today's Arctic apart from yesterday's is the mission that \nthe U.S. military is likely to confront. During the cold war, the U.S. \nNavy largely stayed under the ice. But many suspect that with the ice \ndisappearing, the U.S. Navy's surface fleet could play an ever \nincreasing role in the region.\n  The need for additional capabilities in the Arctic may also require \nthe U.S. Navy to think anew about whether its tried and tested \ncapabilities are well calibrated for a changing operating environment.\n  There is new evidence to suggest, for example, that climate change \ncould have direct and indirect effects on the Navy's operating \nenvironment, particularly in the Arctic.\n  A study by one national security think tank found that, ``ice melt \nwill change water densities, as an infusion of fresh water lowers the \ndensity of high-latitude northern waters, while increased evaporation \nfrom a warmer atmosphere increases the density of tropical waters.''\n  The study cites one example when, ``In 1999, the Sturgeon-class \nnuclear-\n\n[[Page S1470]]\n\npowered attack submarine, USS Hawkbill, noted how changes in water \nsalinity--attributed to polar ice melt--made it harder for the captain \nto maintain neutral buoyancy''--essentially, making it difficult for \nthe submarine not to sink or rise.\n  The same study found that:\n\n       Water density affects not only submarine mobility but also \n     sonar . . . Sonar detection is especially crucial in arctic \n     regions, where it is necessary for detecting underwater ice \n     ridges. Accurate detection will be critical in the coming \n     years, as submarine operators have to contend with the \n     continued break up of major ice sheets, which can drive ice \n     ridges deeper under water. In the 1999, aforementioned \n     expedition by the USS Hawkbill, the crew noted risks \n     associated with detecting ice ridges.\n       Outside the Arctic, the Department of Defense must confront \n     other operational challenges that could result from climate \n     change. This is the second area of concern that bears \n     mentioning, and one where the Department of Defense has \n     focused considerable time and resources.\n\n  The Department of Defense has warned that climate change is likely to \nimpact the U.S. military's facilities and capabilities. In particular, \nAmerica's military installations may be particularly vulnerable to \nclimate change.\n  According to a 2008 National Intelligence Council finding, ``more \nthan 30 U.S. military installations were already facing elevated levels \nof risk from rising sea levels.''\n  The Department of Defense's recent Quadrennial Defense Review \nacknowledged that the U.S. military's ``operational readiness hinges on \ncontinued access to land, air, and sea training and test space,'' which \nmeans ensuring that climate change does not prevent the military from \naccessing these critical training and range areas.\n  Following the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review, the Department of \nDefense began working in earnest to map out its vulnerabilities, with \noffices like the Strategic Environmental Research and Development \nProgram helping installation planners develop the tools they need to \nplan accordingly.\n  Last year, the Department of Defense released its climate change \nadaptation roadmap which lays out in greater detail a plan of action \nfor managing the short- and long-term consequences of climate change. \nReferencing the 2010 findings from the Quadrennial Defense Review, the \nadaptation roadmap concluded that, ``The military is potentially \nvulnerable to climate change in many of the same ways as the rest of \nsociety, and in ways that are unique due to its operations and \nmission.''\n  There is still much work that the Department of Defense must do to \nassess its vulnerabilities at the regional and installation level, \nincluding where to best prioritize adaptation efforts at each of the \nmost vulnerable bases.\n  The Department of Defense committed itself in its 2014 Quadrennial \nDefense Review to ``complete a comprehensive assessment of all \ninstallations to assess the potential impacts of climate change on our \nmissions and operational resiliency, and develop and implement plans to \nadapt as required.''\n  Although these assessments are ongoing, the last several years have \nnevertheless witnessed a groundswell of support in an effort to better \nunderstand the specific mission vulnerabilities that the U.S. military \nmay face as a consequence of climate change.\n  These vulnerabilities are not specific, but they can better frame the \nrisks that the Department of Defense faces so that we in Congress can \nensure that they have the resources they need to plan accordingly.\n  These risks include the potential for: increased occurrence of test/\ntraining limitations due to high heat days; reduced land carrying \ncapacity for vehicle maneuvers; increased maintenance cost for roads, \nutilities, and runways; limits on low-level rotary wing flight \noperations; temporary or prolonged disruption of military operations or \ntest and training activities due to intense storms and resulting storm \ndamage; inundation of and damage to coastal infrastructure; degradation \nor loss of coastal areas and infrastructure; increased cost of \ninfrastructure reinforcement to withstand increased storm intensities; \nand ``coastal installation vulnerability.\n  These potential vulnerabilities are particularly worrying in my home \nState of Hawaii, where U.S. Navy and Marine Corps installations like \nPearl Harbor Naval Base and Marine Corps Base Kaneohe Bay are literally \non the water's edge. I am glad that the Department of Defense is \nassessing these risks now and making short- and long-term plans to \nadapt where it needs to.\n  Hawaii is America's anchor for the strategic rebalance to the Asia-\nPacific region. A cornerstone of that rebalance rests on ensuring that \nAmerica's military presence in Hawaii and the region can cope with the \nturbulence of more frequent and severe weather events, operate under \nthose conditions, and help America's partners and allies do the same.\n  I have focused on the U.S. military because of the unique ways in \nwhich the men and women of the Armed Forces are and will continue to \nshoulder the burden of managing the challenges of climate change.\n  But to say that climate change is a challenge that can only be \nmanaged by the U.S. military would be wrong and undermine the serious \nefforts underway within the broader foreign policy and national \nsecurity communities to confront this issue.\n  The men and women of our diplomatic corps and consul services are \ninvaluable to facilitating cooperation between our partners and allies, \nand will continue to play an important role in ensuring that we are \nproviding the resources they need to plan for the future. Aid workers \nwith the U.S. Agency for International Development have the expertise \nthat is necessary for designing and deploying toolkits that can help \nvulnerable communities improve their resiliency to natural disasters \nand other environmental crises.\n  The Department of Defense has an important role to play in helping \nthe United States manage the challenges of climate change. But in many \nways it is other agencies, not the U.S. military, which must lead on \nour climate engagement abroad.\n  What the Department of Defense's efforts to date show is that climate \nchange is no longer solely the purview of conservationists concerned \nabout protecting endangered species, or of environmentalists concerned \nabout preserving the Earth for future generations.\n  Climate change is an urgent national security challenge.\n  Secretary of State John Kerry put it well when he said recently that \namong the global challenges that ``know no borders . . . terrorism, \nepidemics, poverty, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . \n. . the reality is that climate change ranks right up there with every \nsingle one of them.'' Secretary Kerry went on to add that the United \nStates cannot confront this challenge alone. That like the challenge of \nconfronting nuclear weapons proliferation, we must come together as a \nglobal community and take collective action to confront the challenge \ntogether.\n  The consequences of inaction are too real. For ``in a sense,'' \nSecretary Kerry said, ``climate change can now be considered another \nweapon of mass destruction, perhaps the world's most fearsome weapon of \nmass destruction.'' We must attack the challenge with the same \nfierceness and urgency that we would nuclear weapons proliferation, \nbecause the consequences are no less real.\n  Congress can begin by giving climate change the rightful attention \nthat it deserves, rather than ignore its responsibility of dealing with \nthe hard choices of managing one of the greatest challenges a \ngeneration of Americans faces.\n\n\n                             Energy Sector\n\n  Mr. President, I will discuss the role of the power sector in the \nUnited States. Modern sources of fossil energy have been a tremendous \nforce for good, but they also come with a cost--pollution--requiring us \nto quickly and decisively transition to cleaner sources of energy.\n  The effects of pollution are both local and global, and as many of my \ncolleagues have discussed here tonight climate change, caused by the \nburning of fossil fuels, is one of the greatest threats to the future \nprosperity and health of the human race.\n  As we look for ways to combat climate change, we must redouble our \nefforts to transition away from fossil fuels, reduce energy use, and \nbuild an energy sector based on renewable and low-carbon power.\n  Humanity has been using fossil fuels for centuries. It was not until \nthe industrial revolution of the late 1700s and\n\n[[Page S1471]]\n\nearly 1800s that its use really began to take off. The first U.S. \ncommercial coal mine opened in Virginia in the 1740s, and as the \nindustrial revolution came to the U.S. in the 1800s, coal was the \ndriving energy source behind steamships, railroads, and factories.\n  From 1800 to 2000, the world saw total energy use increase 80 to 90 \ntimes over. Fossil fuels drove almost all of that growth and today \naccount for three quarters of global energy use.\n  As coal, then oil and natural gas grew in availability, humanity \nfound new ways to use these new energy resources, driving even further \ndevelopment in energy hungry industries. The widespread adoption of \nfossil fuels during this time contributed to unprecedented global \npopulation growth and urbanization.\n  There is no doubt this explosion of fossil fuels and the multiple \nopportunities it presented for use was a major driver of American and \nglobal economic growth. And this had enormous benefits for humanity. It \nhelped increase efficiencies in agriculture, improved human health, \ncreated increased opportunities for trade, and improved standards of \nliving for many people in the world.\n  I say all of this to make it clear that when I call for a transition \naway from fossil fuels--it is not because of some inherent dislike for \nthem, or some capricious judgment of those who make a living in that \nindustry. But as their use increases, the downside of fossil fuels--\npollution, and a dramatically changing climate--is too big an issue to \nignore.\n  Global pollutants--greenhouse gasses that contribute to the warming \nand changing climate on the entire planet, and chemicals that threaten \nthe earth's protective ozone layer--are causing global pollution. And \nglobal pollution requires global solutions. No one country can solve \nthe problem alone--but let me be clear here--any solution will require \nbold leadership by the United States.\n  My colleagues and I have stressed the following points all evening: \nClimate is real, and it is caused by burning fossil fuels. Analysis of \npeer-reviewed scientific studies finds that over 99 percent of actively \npublishing climate scientists are firmly convinced that climate change \nis real, that human activities are a significant cause, and it will \nincrease if we continue to burn fossil fuels.\n  The most recent United Nations International Panel on Climate Change \nreport calls evidence that the earth is warming ``unequivocal'' and \nplainly states many of the changes to the climate we see today are \n``unprecedented over decades to millennia.''\n  And at the risk of repeating myself this evening, it is important to \nnote the IPCC report shows that the biggest driver to the changing \nclimate is ``the increase in the atmospheric concentration of \nCO2 since 1750.'' This is a key point, because humanity's \nuse of fossil fuels for energy, heat, and transportation--is \nresponsible for close to two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions \neach year.\n  The U.S. electricity sector is the largest user of fossil fuels in \nthe country. In 2012 we used coal to generate 37 percent of our \nelectricity and natural gas to generate almost 30 percent. Nuclear \npower, which emits little to no greenhouse gases, was almost 20 percent \nof the mix, with renewable energy from wind, solar, geothermal, and \nhydropower contributing just under 13 percent of the Nation's \nelectricity.\n  This overreliance on fossil fuels is exactly why I support President \nObama's Climate Action Plan to set carbon pollution limits for new and \nexisting power plants, and to continue to push the transportation \nindustry towards advanced vehicle technologies, advanced biofuels, and \ngreater fuel efficiency standards. President Obama's plan is a good \none, but there is only so much he can do. Without decisive legislative \naction, Congress is choosing to hold American innovation and leadership \nin check.\n  We must do more to transition energy to renewables, reduce emissions, \nand improve efficiency. The world has made tremendous strides in \ndeveloping and improving renewable energy technologies, and the United \nStates has benefited. Between 2008 and 2013 total U.S. renewable energy \ngeneration, not including hydropower, almost doubled. 2014 will likely \nbe the first year generation from hydropower is overtaken by generation \nfrom other renewable energy technologies.\n  Prices, one of the major barriers to renewable energy deployment, \nhave dropped dramatically. Solar module prices have declined by 99 \npercent since 1976 and a stunning 80 percent in the last 6 years. Wind \npower costs have also declined markedly to the point where wind is \noften the low-cost option. For example, a utility in Michigan decided \nto lower its customers' rates 6.5 percent for 2014, and one of the \nmajor factors it cited in the decision was its ability to provide low-\ncost wind power.\n  Solar power is growing by leaps and bounds both at the utility and \ndistributed scales, as homeowners in some parts of the country are \nfinding that putting solar panels on their roofs can lower their energy \ncosts. My home State of Hawaii is a prime example of this. Distributed \nenergy installations have skyrocketed in recent years, with the total \nnumber of annual installations doubling from 2011 to 2012. At the end \nof 2012, Hawaii had a total capacity of 138 MW in distributed \ngeneration--most of it coming from solar power.\n  Wind energy has been an incredible success story in America. Aided by \nimportant tax incentives and State renewable energy goals, wind power \nin 2012 was the number one source of new U.S. generation capacity for \nthe first time in history. This represented a $25 billion investment in \nthe United States. Wind energy is also a great story for American jobs. \nOver 70 percent of the content of wind turbines is made right here in \nthe United States.\n  Globally, investment in clean energy has been strong, hitting an all-\ntime high of $318 billion in 2011 following the great recession. But in \norder to successfully drive down costs and accelerate deployment, \ninvestment in clean energy must increase, and Congress can help.\n  In order to help the United States do its part in avoiding the most \nextreme effects of climate change, Congress must double, triple, or \nperhaps quadruple-down on current policies to drive down costs of clean \nenergy technologies and accelerate widespread adoption.\n  Reauthorizing and extending important tax credits for wind, \ngeothermal, marine and hydrokinetic power, efficiency improvements, and \nadvanced biofuels should be a number one priority. There is no excuse \nfor the on-again off-again policies of Congress which create false \nboom-and-bust cycles for crucial industries. I applaud the new Chairman \nof the Finance Committee for making an extension of these incentives \nhis first order of business.\n  Congress must also encourage technologies which help with the \ntransition to renewable energy. I am proud to be a cosponsor of a bill \nthat would create incentives for energy storage, which can help with \ngrid management, especially as we move towards intermittent resources.\n  The United States and Europe have done incredible work improving \nenergy efficiency over the last several decades. As recently as the \nearly 1990s, electricity sales in the United States were growing by \nover 2 percent per year.\n  According to a new study by the American Council for an Energy \nEfficient Economy, growth in electricity sales has stopped. In fact, \nretail sales in 2012 were almost 2 percent lower than in 2007. This \nstudy finds that the drop in economic activity due to the great \nrecession cannot fully explain this decline in electricity demand. \nRather, energy efficiency in the residential and commercial sectors \nplays a critical role. The last several years have been the first in \nwhich energy use and economic growth have moved in opposite \ndirections--a highly encouraging sign for a leaner and meaner American \neconomy.\n  I wish to highlight energy efficiency as an important part of the \nsolution to reducing carbon pollution. By being able to do more with \nless power, we reduce the need to burn additional fossil fuels in the \nshort term, and we save ourselves money by having to build less new \npower generation capacity in the future.\n  At the commercial and utility level, innovative financing mechanisms \nand business models are driving energy efficiency. Energy Savings \nPerformance Contracts allow building owners to\n\n[[Page S1472]]\n\nwork with efficiency experts that reduce their clients' energy bills \nand get paid through a portion of the savings.\n  As the largest energy user in the country, the Federal Government \ncontinues to expand its use of these contracts--a goal specifically \nhighlighted by President Obama in his Climate Action Plan. I have \nintroduced a bipartisan bill which would offer the government even more \nchoice in executing these energy savings contracts. It is an excellent \nexample of a commonsense small step we can take immediately to save \nmoney and energy.\n  I would be remiss here without mentioning the important work done by \nSenators Shaheen and Portman on their pragmatic bipartisan energy \nefficiency legislation. It is another commonsense piece of legislation \nthat deserves immediate consideration by the full Senate.\n  I wish to turn now to discuss the incredible government support \nenjoyed by the fossil fuel industry over the decades, and make the \nargument that renewable energy technologies deserve a similar \ncommitment.\n  Because of their importance to U.S. and global economic growth, \nfossil fuels began to receive government subsidies early in their \ncommercial development. From 1916 to 1970, Federal energy tax policy \nfocused exclusively on promoting oil and gas production. In addition, \ngovernment-funded research into fossil fuel production helped to create \nthe technologies that today drive one of the biggest energy booms the \nworld has ever seen. This sustained and ongoing Federal support has \nprovided unbelievable certainty for the fossil fuel industry.\n  The energy crisis of the 1970s showed just how dependent on foreign \nenergy the United States is, and spurred an additional focus on \nefficiency and alternative sources of transportation fuels. After a \nbrief dalliance with renewable energy incentives in the late 1970s and \nearly 1980s, Congress enacted incentives for wind and biomass \nelectricity generation in the early 1990s. This credit was sparingly \nused, however. It wasn't until 2005--not even 10 year ago--Congress \nfinally began to show real commitment to incentives for renewable \nenergy and energy efficiency.\n  And in just that short time, with stop and start policies in recent \nyears; look at the success of renewable energy in America. We are on \nthe verge of full-fledged, competitive domestic industries in wind, \nsolar, advanced biofuels and geothermal, but if we stop now and don't \nnurture these industries, we may lose them to other countries. We \ncannot go backwards.\n  Congress should seriously examine, and consider repealing, tax \nincentives for fossil fuels. The billions of dollars spent per year to \nsubsidize one of the most mature and profitable industries in the world \nis not money well spent. Nor is there sufficient evidence these \nsubsidies result in lower fuel prices for Americans.\n  Rather, we should use this money to invest in innovative federal \nfinancing programs for cutting-edge technologies and incentives to help \ndeploy more renewable energy systems.\n  Let me be clear, fossil fuels have done a lot for humanity. They \nhave, in a very real sense, reshaped our civilization. But if we \ncontinue to rely on them, they will reshape our world once again, and \nthis time not for the better.\n  We know we cannot switch completely to low or zero emissions sources \nof energy overnight--especially in a sector which makes long-term, \ncapital-intensive investments. This will take a sustained commitment \nfrom individuals, States, and the Federal Government. The best thing \nCongress can do to unleash innovation in the private sector is to send \na clear message to the private sector by crafting policies that \nencourage renewable energy technologies, reward efficiencies, invest in \nour national infrastructure, and remove hundred-year-old subsidies for \nalready mature industries. We need to give our energy sector the tools \nto reshape itself, and we need to do it now. The world will not wait.\n\n\n                           Insurance Industry\n\n  Mr. President, I wish now to speak about how the insurance industry \nis dealing with climate change today and preparing for it in the \nfuture.\n  Insurers are risk experts--it is not their job to care about the \nenvironment. Their job is to look at the facts to calculate value and \nthe odds of loss--and then put a price tag on insuring the value. As \nhardnosed folks who work from spreadsheets and calculators, they keep \ntheir personal politics out of the equation. And they say the risks are \nreal.\n  In 2009, Lloyd's of London issued its assessment: ``Climate Change \nand Security: Risks and Opportunities for Business.'' The report \nrecognizes the uncertainty of the exact timeline for climate change, \nand instead focuses on a simple message--to be successful, businesses \nmust adapt:\n\n       As climate change takes hold, few businesses will be able \n     to escape the impact of greater competition for resources. As \n     nations become more protective of their assets, and markets \n     become more volatile, it can no longer be business as usual.\n\n  Lloyd's of London is not alone. Major players like Allianz, Swiss Re, \nand Munich Re have all published their own reports on climate change to \nurge businesses to start planning now.\n  Their motivation is simple: protect the bottom line. With billions \nand trillions of dollars in play, risk experts like Lloyd's are making \nthe high stakes risk projections to protect their own business models. \nThose projections are telling them the risks are increasing, and so \noutreach to industry is part of their pro-active plan to manage their \nown risk.\n  To understand other ways insurers are adapting to climate change, the \nGovernment Accountability Office issued a report in 2007 examining the \nsubstantial climate related risks to insurers in coming decades. The \ngeneral findings should come as no surprise: the insurance industry has \nconcluded that climate change is real, that it is happening, and that \nit will have an enormous effect.\n  Their projections are telling them the risks are increasing, and so \nthey are acting to reduce their exposure to catastrophic events in \nreinsurance and primary insurance coverage along the gulf coast and the \neast coast.\n  Part of ``reducing exposure'' means the outreach and education I just \ndiscussed, but it also means raising insurance premiums in coastal \nStates.\n  Even these pro-active measures may not be enough. According to a \nCongressional Research Service report, there is serious concern both \nwithin the insurance industry and among policymakers about the ability \nof the insurance industry to pay for extremely large disasters or \nmultiple catastrophic events that happen within a short period of time.\n  The report says that, and I quote:\n\n       Insuring increasingly vulnerable residential private \n     property risks will likely require a substantial increase in \n     risk transfer capacity that is currently beyond the existing \n     property and casualty insurance industry's total claims \n     paying capacity.\n\n  In other words: the increasing intensity of many natural disasters \nmeans increasing risk of catastrophic loss--and one day, we may reach \nthe point where the insurance industry will be unable to cover our \nlosses.\n  When disaster strikes, insurers and reinsurers bear the initial costs \nof reconstruction. Those costs get passed on to the public in the form \nof: increased insurance rates; reduced coverage; withdrawal of insurers \nfrom some high risk locations; and increased demands on government-run \ninsurance programs.\n  This is already happening because some extreme weather events are \nhappening more frequently, as the reinsurance industry has testified \nbefore Congress. For the risk experts the facts are clear: the rate of \nmajor natural catastrophic events increased both globally and in the \nU.S. between 1980 and 2012.\n  Frank Nutter, President of the Reinsurance Association, has spoken \nout to Congress. Last year, Mr. Nutter testified on climate change \nbefore the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. In his \ntestimony, he quoted the reinsurance industry giant, SwissRe which \nsaid:\n\n       Today, global warming is a fact. Since the beginning of \n     industrialization and the rapid growth of world population, \n     man's activities--along with natural variability--have \n     contributed to a change of climate manifesting itself as a \n     considerable increase in global temperature . . . the \n     financial services industry can help guide society towards an \n     effective response.\n       However, the industry can only be effective in this role if \n     the regulatory and legislative framework establishes the \n     right incentives for emissions reduction and adaptation . . .\n\n\n[[Page S1473]]\n\n\n  Mr. Nutter's testimony is not an empty pledge. Hartford, one of the \noldest insurance companies in the U.S., agrees with this analysis and \nis acting:\n\n       The Hartford Financial Services Group recognizes the clear \n     consensus in the scientific community that climate change is \n     of real and increasing concern.\n       As an insurer, investor, employer, property owner and \n     responsible corporate citizen, Hartford is committed to \n     understanding, managing and mitigating the risks associated \n     with climate change.\n\n  Suiting actions to words, Hartford has engaged in an effort to \npromote energy efficiency and reduce waste and emissions. By 2012, the \ncompany reduced its own greenhouse gas emissions by 42% from their 2007 \nbase year. It has also worked with the American Insurance Association \nto advocate for land use planning and building codes that reflect risk \nexposure. Raising premiums is also part of the response, and so they \nhave warned that ``proper pricing will send appropriate risk signals to \nthe most vulnerable areas.''\n  Hartford is not alone. Allianz is an integrated financial services \nand insurance company that is over 120 years old and has over 80 \nmillion customers worldwide. Here is what it says about climate change:\n\n       Human-induced global warming threatens to radically change \n     our climate. This poses a major risk to the global economy, \n     and for a global insurance company like Allianz, could have a \n     severe impact on our business. In recognition of this, we \n     have been implementing a group-wide strategy covering \n     climate-related risks and opportunities for our business and \n     our clients.\n       As an integrated financial services provider, we are well \n     aware that climate change could result in a range of compound \n     risks and opportunities that affect our entire business. As a \n     result, we are committed to supporting the development of a \n     low-carbon economy, and see this as not just a sustainability \n     priority--it is a viable business and investment case.\n\n  Insurance and re-insurance companies are risk experts. They measure \nrisk, they are seeing risk all around them from climate change. And \nthey are speaking up and acting to protect their bottom lines.\n  As a Congress, we need to support their efforts by establishing \nincentives for industry to incorporate the risks from climate change \ninto their business plans.\n\n\n                              Agriculture\n\n  Mr. President, I want to discuss how climate change potentially hurts \nour farms. Agriculture is profoundly affected by climate change, and we \nmust take action now to ensure that we are able to protect crop \ndiversity, yields, and food security in coming decades for a growing \npopulation.\n  Farmers and ranchers occupy an important cultural part of the \nAmerican psyche, even if recent decades have seen a consolidation of \nthe farming sector. Concepts of ample subsistence, self-reliance, and \nthe virtues of farming pepper early-American literature.\n  More than anyone else, Thomas Jefferson articulated the notion of a \ncountry founded on agriculture. In 1785, he wrote, ``Cultivators of the \nearth are the most valuable citizens. They are the most vigorous, the \nmost independent, the most virtuous, and they are tied to their country \nand wedded to its liberty and interests by the most lasting bands.''\n  During World War I and World War II victory gardens became an \neffective way to relieve the pressure on the food supply, as well as a \nsymbol of patriotism--farming became a civic duty.\n  Today, amidst incredible changes in global agriculture and an \nincreasingly scientific and mechanized approach to farming, a \nnoticeable trend towards organic farming, local agricultural economies, \nand crop diversity has reinvigorated the cultural importance of farming \nin the United States. Farmers markets have become an increasingly \nvisible sight, especially in urban areas.\n  Agriculture is an extremely important part of the American economy \nand contributes at least $200 billion to the economy each year. U.S. \nfarmers are the most productive in the history of the world, and food \nis more affordable here than in any other developed country.\n  Climate change could have an enormous impact on farming worldwide, \nand this could come at a time when the world's producers must prepare \nto grow even more. Today the world population stands at 7.2 billion \npeople. By 2050 the world will be home to more than 9.6 billion people. \nThe World Bank estimates that agricultural production must increase by \n70 percent during that time in order to feed the population.\n  One of the myths that climate deniers spread is that climate change \nwill mean longer growing seasons and more carbon dioxide for plants, \nwhich will translate into increased yields and abundant food resources. \nThat does not align with what our scientists say. While slightly warmer \ntemperatures could bring some benefits, climate change brings much more \nthan rising temperatures and increased carbon dioxide. Both observation \nand modeling estimate that by midcentury and beyond, any \nCO2-related benefits to crops may be outweighed by the \ndownsides of global temperature increases. For example, scientists have \nprojected that for each degree Celsius of warming, yields of corn in \nthe United States and Africa, as well as yields of wheat in India, \ncould drop by 5 to 15 percent. As yields fall, farmers must deal with \nincreasing threats. They currently spend over $11 billion per year \ndealing just with weeds. Warming means that crop pests, weeds, and \nplant diseases will expand in both geographic range and frequency, \npotentially affecting crop yields and increasing the need for \npesticides and fungicides.\n  As shortages become more common, prices could go up, especially as \nthe population grows, and increasing extreme weather events may further \nthreaten crops.\n  This future is not far off. A 2013 Department of Agricultural report \nfound that within 40 years, climate change might have a negative effect \non both farming and ranching in the United States. This will have an \neconomic cost for both the private sector and the Federal Government. A \nGAO report that studied crop insurance and climate change found that \nthe three biggest causes of loss to crops were ``drought, excess \nmoisture, and hail.'' It is worth repeating that scientists agree that \nclimate change will mean more extremes: wet places get wetter and dry \nplaces get drier, meaning that it is possible that crop insurance \nclaims--and government costs--will increase.\n  We need to do the big things necessary to fight climate change but in \nthe meantime, we are taking small steps.\n  I am proud to have supported the 2014 farm bill and appreciate the \nleadership of the chairwoman of the Agriculture Committee. This bill \nauthorizes almost $900 million in mandatory funding for energy, which \nincludes important programs for advanced biofuels like biodiesel. It \nalso supports the Rural Energy for America Program, which is a major \nsource of funding for renewable energy systems in rural America. \nImportantly, these programs are available to small businesses and non-\nprofits in rural America, not only to farmers.\n  The farm bill's conservation programs also deserve mention.\n  Perhaps the most important achievement is the linkage between crop \ninsurance assistance and basic conservation practices, which requires \nthat farmers take common sense steps to conserve soil health in return \nfor crop insurance assistance.\n  But we can and must do more--both to fight climate change and to \nadapt to its effects. Farming is a practice that knows no political \nboundaries. Farmers and ranchers might feel the effects in red and blue \nStates alike, and if they don't have the resources to be able to adapt, \nin the long-term their production and income could suffer, which means \nthat every American might pay more for fruits, vegetables, bread, and \nmilk.\n  There is a representative in Congress from every single part of the \ncountry, As a body that must balance both local and national interests, \nCongress should be acutely aware of the need for action on climate \nchange. It may have real economic consequences on our farmers and \nranchers in the coming years. And those consequences threaten a part of \nour culture with deep roots in the history of our Nation. We must act \nto preserve that culture and come to the aid of those farmers who ``are \ntied to their country and wedded to its liberty and interests by the \nmost lasting bands.''\n\n\n                             Transportation\n\n  Mr. President, I will take some time now to talk about climate \nchange, transportation, and infrastructure. Every day millions of \nAmericans rely on cars, trucks, transit, trains, ships,\n\n[[Page S1474]]\n\nand planes to get to work, visit relatives, and go to the doctor. \nTransportation is vital to the continued success and growth of our \neconomy. But we know that our transportation system is a major driver \nof climate change, and if we are to tackle this problem, we will need \nto reduce this sector's contribution to global greenhouse gas \npollution.\n  Thankfully, we have solutions--solutions that are creating jobs and \nimproving the ease and efficiency of moving people and goods. We are on \nthe right track, but we need to continue in this direction by making \nour vehicles more efficient, building resilient infrastructure, and \nmaking smarter decisions about how we get around. This will take a \nstrong commitment from government, business, and the American people.\n  Transportation accounts for more than 30 percent of greenhouse gas \nemissions in the United States. In Hawaii, this is even more \npronounced, where transportation accounts for approximately 50 percent \nof total greenhouse gas emissions. We all face different challenges, \nbut regardless of where we are from, we can't tackle climate change \nwithout addressing the emissions generated by getting people and goods \nfrom point A to point B.\n  In the United States transportation grew as a contributor to climate \nchange through economic and population growth--our more affluent \npopulation takes more trips on planes, trains, and by car. Demand for \nconsumer goods has increased, and sprawling development patterns have \nincreased auto travel. We are seeing some of these trends across the \nworld. Currently, the transportation sector accounts for 15 percent of \nworldwide emissions. But in many countries, this trend is expected to \ngrow. In China, for example, energy consumption and CO2 \nemissions are expected to increase almost fourfold in 2030 compared to \n2005.\n  Even as transportation is contributing to climate change, severe \nweather is threatening our critical national infrastructure--our roads, \nbridges, ports, and airports. Severe weather can wipe out our \ninfrastructure connections quickly and catastrophically. We saw this \nwith the tragic Superstorm Sandy, which devastated the Northeast when \nit made landfall in October 2012, washing away roads and bridges and \nflooding the subway system and two major rail tunnels under the Hudson \nRiver.\n  These Hudson River tunnels--critical access points on the busiest \ncommuter corridor in the nation--were flooded with more than 3 million \ngallons of water, halting all Amtrak Northeast corridor and New Jersey \nTransit service into Manhattan for roughly 5 days. Let me repeat that. \nCommuter and subway tunnels in New York City were flooded with more \nthan 3 million gallons of water. That is not a projection; that is a \nfact. This impacted nearly 600,000 daily riders and caused significant \neconomic disruption.\n  Former Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood highlighted the importance \nof building our infrastructure to withstand storms:\n\n       Hurricane Sandy exposed the risks of relying solely on a \n     system of century-old tunnels for rail access into New York \n     City. We were fortunate that these tunnels were not destroyed \n     during the hurricane, and providing Amtrak with funds to \n     preserve its ability to build a second tunnel will provide \n     much-needed resiliency to the Northeast Corridor in case of \n     future disasters.\n\n  I am glad Congress directed emergency funding to be used to harden \nand rebuild our infrastructure. But we need to invest much more.\n  Continued weather fluctuations will amplify issues we face today. For \nexample, derailments during extremely hot days are safety hazards, and \nhundreds of thousands of rail commuters are inconvenienced by slower \ntravel times. Air traffic disruptions due to severe weather have \nalready cost airlines and passengers $5.8 billion this year, according \nto a recent study.\n  We also need to plan for the longer term impacts of climate change, \nwhich will wear down our infrastructure even faster. Transportation \ninfrastructure is expensive and built to be long-lived. Studies show \nthat climate change impacts will shorten that infrastructure life. \nTemperature fluctuations continue to degrade our pavement and bridges \nwhile severe flooding damages low-lying infrastructure, imposing \nsignificant costs to drain and rebuild.\n  Water temperatures are expected to affect the volume and rates of \nwater flows throughout our marine highways, threatening to reduce \nshipping access to docks. All this translates into higher maintenance \nand construction costs for a system that already has significant \nneeds--the American Society of Civil Engineers estimates the United \nStates will need to invest approximately $2 trillion by 2020 to \nmaintain and expand our transportation infrastructure.\n  In Hawaii, we can't escape the reality that climate change is \nthreatening the way we move our people and our goods. It affects all \naspects of transportation infrastructure--our ports, airports, roads, \nbridges, and transit systems. On Maui, we need a new bus storage \nfacility because the current facility is now in the flood plain. By \n2100, all of our most critical transportation assets--our harbors, \nairports, and roads--will be highly vulnerable to sea level rises, \nstorm surges, or high intensity rainfall.\n  We don't even yet know how much it will cost to protect against \nclimate change. As an island State, we are more vulnerable to the \ndisruption of transportation infrastructure than most. First, 90 \npercent of Hawaii's goods are imported into the State, which means that \nif severe weather or environmental change disrupts transportation, we \nlose access to food and other necessities.\n  That makes Hawaii especially vulnerable to maritime disruptions--but \nalso to disruption of truck and rail transport to west coast ports. We \ncan't afford to have our transportation system disrupted; we need to \ninvest now in resiliency.\n  Recent estimates put the minimum cost of hardening our infrastructure \nin the tens of billions of dollars each year. For example, annual costs \nfor strengthening our bridges alone are estimated at around $2 billion \nbetween now and 2090. The full costs--which also include rebuilding and \nrestoring services after extreme events and maintaining and making \ndesign changes for the full range of critical infrastructure--could \neasily rise to hundreds of billions of dollars each year.\n  Building in resilience is common sense management to protect our \ninfrastructure investments, but simply hardening existing \ninfrastructure will not solve our problems because the costs of this \napproach will grow over time.\n  In order to build true resilience we need a combination of \ntraditional mitigation measures and forward-looking approaches that \nfind resilience in other ways--from green infrastructure, to growing \nour own energy and food independence.\n  At the national level, the U.S. Department of Transportation is \nalready working to integrate climate change impacts and adaptation into \nfuture planning and operations. But we need to do much more to help our \nStates and cities address the costs of climate change. This includes \nsmarter, integrated planning, prioritization, and funding.\n  We also need to make our transportation sector cleaner and more \nefficient. The good news is that the United States can lead by example. \nWe have already begun implementing a number of solutions developed by \nindustry with public sector support that are cutting into \ntransportation-related greenhouse gas emissions. New technologies are \nbeing developed for all modes of transportation that are cleaner and \nmore efficient.\n  U.S. automobile manufacturers are working hard to increase fuel \nefficiency and develop vehicles that run on alternative energy such as \nfuel cell, hybrid, and electric vehicles. They have paired with our \nuniversities and research institutions to advance biofuel development \nand alternatives to oil.\n  These investments promote research and manufacturing jobs and save \nmoney for consumers at the pump. In turn, they have more in their \npockets to spend in the U.S. economy.\n  Many of these advances are part of the President's Climate Action \nPlan. CAFE standards are helping to improve fuel economy. In 2013, more \nthan 400 models that achieve 30 miles per gallon or better were on our \nNation's highways. And we will continue to see improvements in fuel \nefficiency of our light-duty fleet. I applaud President Obama's recent \ncall for new fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions\n\n[[Page S1475]]\n\nstandards for medium and heavy-duty trucks by 2016.\n  Focusing on these trucks will get us more bang for our buck--20 \npercent of the transportation-related emissions in this country are \nfrom heavy-duty trucks, even though they make up only 4 percent of \nvehicles on the road.\n  Across the country our universities and industry are working together \nto develop ideas and solutions to decrease transportation-related \ngreenhouse gas emissions. In my home State of Hawaii, a number of \ninnovative state and private sector initiatives are leading the country \nin the areas of bioenergy and other alternative fuels and vehicles. For \nexample, Hawaii BioEnergy, a consortium of three of Hawaii's largest \nlandowners as well as partners in the venture capital community, is \nplanning to use locally grown feedstocks to produce biofuels. Last \nyear, Hawaii BioEnergy announced a deal to supply Alaska Air with \nsustainable biofuel for their aircrafts possibly as soon as 2018. \nPacific Bio-Diesel is producing diesel from recycled cooking oil that \nis used in public transit buses and other vehicles. Hawaii is home to a \nnumber of demonstration projects, including the sustainable hydrogen \nproject at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam that demonstrated the use of \nhydrogen produced by solar and wind in aircraft towing vehicles, \ntrucks, small buses, and cars made by General Motors. General Motors \nhas also deployed fuel cell cars in Hawaii, and the Department of \nEnergy has funded a project on Hawaii Island to demonstrate the use of \nbuses powered by hydrogen produced with geothermal energy that would \notherwise have been curtailed. The State of Hawaii used stimulus funds \nto deploy the Hawaii E V Ready Program--a network of electric vehicle \ncharging stations to encourage early adoption of this exciting \ntechnology. The Maui Smart Grid Project now includes fast chargers as \npart of an initiative to demonstrate the use of electric vehicles as \npart of an electric grid management project.\n  It is important to note that many of the exciting projects my State \nis working on extend past improving efficiency for our trucks and cars. \nWe are committed to making travel by sea and sky more efficient and \ncost-effective.\n  Our consumers and businesses don't want the instability of the wild \nfluctuations in the oil market. This is especially important in Hawaii, \nwhere we are so dependent on air travel, and I am proud that Hawaiian \nAirlines is one of the Nation's most fuel efficient airlines.\n  As a nation we are investing billions of dollars in Next Generation \nAir Transportation System upgrades, which will help to make air travel \nmore safe, productive, and sustainable. Through improving efficiency \nand easing congestion in our skies, NextGen will improve air quality \nand limit aircraft emissions. The FAA predicts net reductions of the \nclimate impact from all aviation emissions over the long term by 2050.\n  We need to continue to support critical clean energy research and \ndevelopment to further these types of advances. In addition, we need to \nact now to extend important tax credits for advanced biofuels and \nadvanced vehicle technologies.\n  In the same way that we look at increasing fuel economy for our \ntrucks and planes, we can improve the efficiency of our transportation \nsystems by making smarter choices about how we build our communities. \nBy providing American workers and families options other than driving \nto get to where they need to go, we can help to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions, increase mobility, and improve the quality of life for all \nAmericans.\n  In Hawaii, we recognize that in addition to making our vehicles more \nfuel efficient, improving reliable transportation options is a critical \npart of reducing our impact on climate change. This is one of the \nreasons why I have been such a staunch supporter of the Honolulu Rail \nTransit Project. Electrically powered rail transit will not only ease \ntraffic congestion in Honolulu, but it will also advance Hawaii's goal \nof 70 percent clean energy by 2030.\n  As noted by the National Resources Defense Council, ``By investing in \ntransit we can give people real transportation choices so people aren't \nforced to burn a gallon of gas every time they need to pick up \ngroceries or get to work. Along with other solutions--like charging \nstations for electric cars, smart traffic technology, or communities \nwhere people can walk or bike to shops, schools and work--transit can \nhelp break our addiction to oil. Laying the groundwork for a 21st \nCentury transportation system that makes our communities more \nproductive and efficient will free us from constantly worrying about \nprices at the pump while boosting our economy, safeguarding our \nenvironment, and improving our quality of life.''\n  Major transit investments, like Honolulu Rail, have the added benefit \nof attracting development around stations. Transit-oriented \ndevelopment, or building neighborhoods with homes and businesses close \ntogether and accessible to transit, allows residents to choose to make \nat least some trips without a car, reducing emissions. The market is \nshowing that more and more Americans want these options, and for good \nreason.\n  Transportation is the second largest item in the average American \nhousehold budget, and more options can shorten commutes and save money. \nFamilies can save on gas or forego that second car and the payments \nthat come along with it. When communities become livable and walkable, \nproperty values skyrocket. And when our children and seniors can walk \nand bike to school, community centers, and shopping destinations, we \nsee health benefits. Building our communities with housing and \ntransportation near jobs, schools, stores, and restaurants can help \nsupport local economies while protecting the environment.\n  I am working hard to find ways to support these types of commonsense \noptions at the Federal level. One of those commonsense solutions I have \nchampioned is my Military Installations Enhancement Act of 2013, which \nwas included in the 2013 defense authorization. Commanders now have \nmore authority to make smart, cost-saving choices about how we use \nspace on facilities. Using less space is more efficient.\n  It is also about improving quality of life on bases, connecting our \nmilitary families housing to jobs, the commissary, and the rest of the \ncommunity.\n  In Hawaii we are already moving on this. Honolulu is in the process \nof building our rail system, and the military is working with the local \ntransit authority to situate two stations next to Pearl Harbor-Hickam.\n  Though the Department of Defense has been looking at these benefits \nprimarily to promote defense readiness, they also help address climate \nchange by making bases more sustainable over the long term. With \ndestinations closer together, people who work on or visit the base can \nchoose to walk, bike, take transit, or drive. Having these options \nmeans less air pollution and less traffic on roads.\n  Biking and walking are great ways to take zero emissions trips, but \ntaking that trip isn't an option if it means you risk your life to do \nit. I recently introduced the Safe Streets Act of 2014 with my \ncolleague, Senator Begich. The Safe Streets Act would require complete \nstreets policies in all States, meaning that roads would be built to be \nsafe for all of the people who use them, including bikers and walkers. \nThis is especially important in Hawaii, where we have some of the most \ndangerous roads in the Nation for seniors.\n  AARP highlighted how important this bill is: ``Safe mobility options \nare . . . essential to the independence and well-being of mid-life and \nolder Americans. Fully one-fifth of persons ages 65 and above does not \ndrive. Yet almost half of respondents to an AARP survey of persons age \n50 and above said they cannot safely cross the main roads in their \nneighborhoods . . . AARP supports Safe Streets legislation because it \nwould ensure that federal transportation infrastructure investments \nprovide safe travel for all-whether driving, bicycling, walking, or \ntaking public transportation.\n  These improvements that allow older adults to travel by foot will \nbenefit younger road users as well. Your bill will help ensure that all \nusers are safe, that scarce transportation dollars are spent wisely, \nand that Americans have choices in how they move around their \nneighborhood.''\n  Smarter transportation choices improve mobility, save money, and \nreduce emissions. We have an opportunity in\n\n[[Page S1476]]\n\nthe next surface transportation authorization to ensure that we \ncontinue Federal support for transit, biking, walking, and smart \ndevelopment.\n  All these innovations in the transportation sector to reduce carbon \npollution have benefits beyond climate change. The research, design, \ndevelopment, and production of fuel efficient vehicles and airplanes \nhelp to create new high paying jobs. Such innovations will help America \nreduce its dependence on foreign oil and shield consumers from the \nvolatility of fluctuating foreign oil prices. Moreover, high-quality \npublic transportation surrounded by mixed-use developments will \nincrease mobility and expand job opportunities for all Americans. \nOverall, this is a win-win for businesses, consumers, and the \nenvironment.\n  It is time for Congress to wake up to the realities of climate change \nand take action to reduce our consumption of fossil fuels, but we can \nmake real and lasting changes to our transportation sector and \ninfrastructure without climate change being our primary motivation. \nReducing our dependence on oil just makes long-term economic sense. It \nis a pragmatic decision that will have dramatic impacts to our economy, \nour health, and our way of life.\n\n\n                            Water Resources\n\n  Mr. President, without water, life on Earth would not exist. Water \nsustains our ability to grow crops and raise livestock. It quenches. It \ncleans. It provides habitat for plants and animals and produces \nelectricity. It is perhaps the world's most valuable resource. Yet many \nof us in the United States take water for granted on a daily basis when \nwe turn on our faucets, flush our toilets, water our plants, cook our \nfood, and drink from our cups. Others around the globe do not have that \nluxury. The World Bank estimates that 1.6 billion people live in \ncountries or regions with ``absolute water scarcity'' and that number \nis expected to rise to 2.8 billion people by 2025.\n  Growing up in Hawaii and now representing my State in the Senate, I \nknow the value and scarcity of our planet's water resources, especially \nas we confront the effects of climate-driven changes to our \nenvironment.\n  As stated by the Center for Island Climate Adaptation and Policy, \n``Hawaii water experts have recognized that alterations in rainfall, \ntemperature, wind, or other climate phenomena have the potential to \ndevastate natural resources and human communities'' on our islands. Our \nfreshwater resources are particularly at risk.\n  Water resource issues are by no means confined to my State. Most of \nthe other 49 are also facing or may soon face water-related problems, \nsuch as changes in precipitation and runoff patterns, drought, \nflooding, and sea level rise, that have the potential to be \ncatastrophic. From California, through the American Southwest and \nMidwest, down to Florida and up the east coast, our cities, farms, and \ncommunities are at risk.\n  I will begin tonight by stating the facts. Climate change is real, \nand it is perhaps most real in its effects on the water patterns of the \nplanet. Countries around the world, including the United States, have \nalways been afflicted by some degree of variability. Droughts have \nstricken portions of North America for thousands of years. Floods have \nbeen commonplace on our major rivers and tributaries. But never before \nhas this variability been caused by humans.\n  Scientists predict that warmer temperatures have three major effects \non the planet's water: increased evaporation, increased precipitation, \nand a rise in sea levels.\n  These in turn may drastically affect our water resources. Increased \nevaporation, caused by higher temperatures, heightens our risk for \nlonger and more severe droughts--what scholars have termed \n``megadroughts''--especially in our already vulnerable drought-prone \nareas. Changes in precipitation and runoff patterns leave areas near \nrivers, lakes, and streams much more susceptible to devastating floods. \nAnd sea level rise endangers the homes and infrastructure in our \ncoastal communities and can taint their drinking water.\n  When it comes to these water resource issues, the future is now. The \neffects of climate change on our water resources are already upon us.\n  Drought is among the earliest documented events related to climate \nand has been a part of human history much longer. Evidence even exists \nto suggest that a megadrought in Africa more than 100,000 years ago may \nhave caused the migration of our ancestors out of the continent.\n  A report by the Congressional Research Service notes that precolonial \nNorth America was subject to ``severe, long-lasting droughts'' that \n``may have been a factor in the disintegration of Pueblo society in the \nSouthwest during the 13th century, and in the demise of central and \nlower Mississippi Valley societies in the 14th through 16th \ncenturies.''\n  More recently, ``droughts in the 1930s Dust Bowl era and 1950s were \nparticularly severe and widespread. In 1934, 65 percent of the \ncontiguous United States was affected by severe to extreme drought, \nresulting in widespread economic disruption and displacement of \npopulations from the U.S. heartland--many relocating to California's \nCentral Valley--and revealing shortcomings in agricultural and land use \npractices.''\n  The CRS report states that in the past 50 years, human-induced \nclimate change has caused scientists to question whether we are \nentering a ``new megadrought era'' akin to the worst megadrought \nperiods of the past, which are believed to have been caused by a \nwarming climate. Large areas of the United States, such as the American \nSouthwest and California, would be particularly susceptible to \nmegadroughts.\n  In California, the snowpack in the Sierra Mountains as of February \n2014 was, according to the CRS report, ``well below normal, and water \nlevels in multi-year reservoirs were below average conditions for that \ntime of year.'' This follows 2013, which was California's driest year \non record. Now I want to be clear: We still cannot connect any single \nweather event or drought directly to human-caused climate change, but \nwe can use these extreme weather events as examples of what future \nclimates might look like. We know firsthand the economic consequences \nof major weather events.\n  Looking to examples in our history will help illuminate the future. \nIslands like Hawaii with small land masses and limited water resources \nalso face difficult times ahead if global temperatures continue to rise \ndue to greenhouse gases. Recent studies have shown that most of the \nHawaii islands have experienced a steady decline in rainfall over the \npast 20 years, which has had an enormous effect on our ranching \nindustry.\n  I am pleased that Governor Abercrombie and the Hawaii Department of \nAgriculture are working to improve our State's irrigation systems and \nto develop long-term solutions to help the farmers of Hawaii deal with \nthe effects of climate change.\n  To quote Scott Enright of the Hawaii Department of Agriculture, ``We \nknow we will experience climate change in Hawaii and the department has \nbeen putting through legislation to help us with that.'' Such efforts \nat the State level are crucial to helping the agricultural sector \nadapt.\n  Like droughts, floods have been a scourge to humanity since the \nbeginning of civilization. Climate science predicts that severe floods \nmay result from global warming.\n  According to the National Resources Defense Council, ``Climate change \nhas contributed to a rise in extreme weather events.'' These events \n``will increase the frequency of heavy rainstorms, putting many \ncommunities at risk for devastation from floods. Flooding can cause a \nrange of health impacts and risks, including: death and injury, \ncontaminated drinking water, hazardous material spills, increased \npopulations of disease-carrying insects and rodents, moldy houses, and \ncommunity disruption and displacement. As rains become heavier, \nstreams, rivers, and lakes can overflow, increasing the risk of water-\nborne pathogens flowing into drinking water sources. Downpours can also \ndamage critical infrastructure like sewer and solid waste systems, \ntriggering sewage overflows that can spread into local waters.''\n  I turn now to the issue of sea level rise, which, as National \nGeographic has noted, can have ``devastating effects on coastal \nhabitats. As seawater reaches\n\n[[Page S1477]]\n\nfarther inland, it can cause destructive erosion, flooding of wetlands, \ncontamination of drinking water and agricultural soils, and lost \nhabitat for fish, birds, and plants.''\n  Like drought and floods, sea level rise due to climate change is \nalready upon us. A recent joint report from the National Academy of \nSciences and the British Royal Society shows that since 1901, global \nsea level rose by about 8 inches, with a large percentage of that rise \ncoming in the past two decades.\n  If greenhouse gases continue to increase on their current \ntrajectories, it is projected that sea level may rise by as much as 3 \nfeet by the end of the 21st century. And ``rising sea levels will not \nstop in 2100; sea levels will be much higher in the following centuries \nas the sea continues to take up heat and glaciers continue to \nretreat.''\n  Eight inches of sea level rise might not sound like a big deal, but \nit is.\n  Even very small increases in sea level, such as those seen already, \ncan have devastating impacts, one of which is saltwater intrusion into \nfreshwater sources, which is a fancy way of saying that drinking water \nalong some coasts will become salty and undrinkable.\n  ``Rising sea levels are causing saltwater to flow into the Ganges, \nIndia's biggest river, threatening its ecosystem and turning vast \nfarmlands barren in the country's east,'' according to a Reuters \narticle from several years ago. In the United States, the Fort \nLauderdale Sun-Sentinel reports that Florida aquifers, which provide \nmuch of the freshwater to communities throughout the State, are in \ndanger of oversalinization.\n  More than half of freshwater used in Florida is from underground \nsources like the Biscayne Aquifer. The consequences of climate change \ninduced sea level rise are dire for some low-lying coastal areas.\n  The combination of sea level rise and a growing population are \nputting strains on freshwater sources in Florida. A local natural \nresources official noted in the Sun-Sentinel article that ``potable \nwater supply is obviously a major concern long-term.'' One possible \nsolution proposed by the Southeast Florida Utility Council is \nreengineering stormwater runoff to drain into the aquifers, instead of \nflowing back out to sea. This would beat back the saltwater intrusion \nand replenish freshwater.\n  Saltwater intrusion also poses problems in low-lying parts of my \nState and many other Pacific island nations and U.S. territories with \nlimited freshwater supplies. If sea levels continue to rise, these \nareas could quickly become uninhabitable.\n  The United Nations reports that rising sea levels have left and are \nleaving salt deposits in the soil and contaminants in the groundwater \nsupply. Both of these have adverse impacts on agriculture, food, and \nwater security. Many small Pacific nations face the risk of saltwater \nintrusion of their freshwater supplies.\n  Allow me to share with you a few words from the Honorable Enele S. \nSopoaga, Prime Minister of Tuvalu, who spoke at the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change in 2013: ``Some have suggested \nthat the people of Tuvalu can move elsewhere. Let me say in direct \nterms. We do not want to move. Such suggestions are offensive to the \npeople of Tuvalu. Our lives and culture are based on our continued \nexistence on the islands of Tuvalu. We will survive.'' It is our duty \nas a pacific nation to help the people of Tuvalu and other island \ncommunities do just that--survive.\n  Let me end on a positive note and describe some of the additional \nways that I have supported protecting our water resources through \nlegislation at the national level.\n  As chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Subcommittee on Water \nand Power, I have introduced the \nSECURE Water Amendments Act of \n2014 to conserve water resources and \npromote sustainability.\n  As part of the SECURE Water Amendments Act, I am fighting for funding \nfor a national water inventory. In its last major report on water use \nin the United States in 2005, the U.S. Geological Survey reported that \nover 400,000 million gallons of water are withdrawn every day. However, \nwe also need to know how much water we have and where we have it so \nthat we can better prepare for the effects of climate change on our \nwater resources.\n  Finally, I support the National Integrated Drought Information System \nReauthorization Act, which President Obama signed into law on March 6. \nAs the White House noted in its official statement, ``This bipartisan \nlegislation ensures that the federal government can continue to provide \ntimely, effective drought warning forecasts and vital support to \ncommunities that are vulnerable to drought. States, cities, towns, \nfarmers, and businesses rely on tools and data from the National \nIntegrated Drought Information System to make informed decisions about \nwater use, crop planting, wildfire response, and other critical \nareas.''\n  Mr. President, I am joined tonight by many of my colleagues, who also \nunderstand what is happening to our planet and what will continue to \nhappen if we do not address the causes and effects of climate change. \nAs I conclude, however, let me speak not just as a Member of Congress \nbut as a father. Every parent worries about the future that their \nchildren face, and I am particularly troubled about the planet we are \nleaving for our children.\n  Several decades from tonight, when my son and daughter are the same \nage I am now, will they have adequate water resources? And if they have \nchosen to live in Hawaii or any of the other communities in the United \nSates with water resource issues, will there even be any useable water \nleft at all?\n  Despite my worries, I am hopeful that this scenario will not play \nout. It has been said that water seeks its own level. I see this as \ntrue both literally and figuratively. Those who are convinced that \nclimate change is real and who also have real solutions are seeking \neach other out. And someday, in the not too distant future, I am \nconfident we will reach that critical mass of people who firmly believe \nthat we can no longer sit idly by in the face of climate change and \nthat the time to act is not tomorrow but now.\n\n\n                          Emergency Management\n\n  Mr. President. I now will use some time to discuss the impact of \nclimate change on our Nation's security and resiliency.\n  The effects of climate change will require additional investments in \nour communities in order to protect our most critical infrastructure, \nsuch as our roads, bridges, and powerplants. As extreme weather events \nbecome more frequent and severe, there will be a need for increased \ndisaster assistance and mitigation efforts.\n  These events will have a direct impact on our economy. One need only \nlook at the $1 trillion dollars in damages that the United States has \naccumulated since 1980 due to extreme weather events, which scientists \nknow are becoming more frequent and severe. This is one of many reasons \nwhy Congress must wake up and take action now to address climate \nchange.\n  We know we cannot attribute any one event to climate change, but what \nscience is telling us is that with each passing day, as we pump more \ncarbon dioxide into the atmosphere, we are increasing our chances of \nextreme weather events that carry with them dangerous consequences.\n  Global average temperatures have risen by more than 2 degrees in the \nlast 50 years. Climate scientists caution that this warming increases \nthe chances of more intense and frequent droughts and heat waves. \nRising temperatures in various parts of the country could also increase \nthe severity and frequency of wildfires.\n  Precipitation levels have increased by an average of 5 percent and \nheaviest downpours have increased by 20 percent over the last 50 years. \nThese higher levels of precipitation can lead to more flood events \nthroughout the country.\n  A changing climate could cause hurricanes to become more intense and \nsevere. And this is particularly worrisome in the Pacific, where \nhurricanes have increased in strength since the 1980s. Moreover, sea \nlevels have risen in the past 50 years along our coastlines and will \ncontinue to do so as the Earth warms. As a result, our coastal areas \nare becoming increasingly vulnerable to flooding, erosion, and damage \ncaused by storms. The combination of sea level rise and increased \nstrength of hurricanes amplify the destructive force of Mother Nature \nby putting more coastal communities at risk of dangerous storm surge.\n\n[[Page S1478]]\n\n  My home State of Hawaii is expected to experience worsening severe \nweather. Last year, researchers at the University of Hawaii found that \nwarming temperatures and changing storm patterns will lead to fewer but \nstronger tropical cyclones that will track more toward Hawaii in the \nfuture.\n  Across the country, we are seeing an increasing number of disasters. \nThe number of Presidential disaster declarations has increased from 65 \nin 2004 to 98 in 2011.\n  During that time, FEMA provided more than $80 billion in disaster \nassistance. As the severity and frequency of weather-related disasters \ncontinues to increase, FEMA will need to spend more to help communities \nrespond to and recover from disasters. For instance, disaster \nassistance for Hurricane Sandy totaled around $60 billion.\n  In addition, due to the increasing potential of flood related events, \nmore funding will be needed for the National Flood Insurance Program. \nThis program is currently $24 billion in debt due to increasing costs \nand payouts because of extreme weather events.\n  Last year, the Government Accountability Office added managing \nclimate change risks to its high risk list. According to GAO, ``Climate \nchange creates significant financial risk for the federal government, \nwhich . . . provides emergency aid in response to natural disasters.'' \nOverall, the fiscal impact of climate change on the United States \neconomy could top more than $1 trillion by the year 2050. Emergency \nmanagers at all levels of government would have to stretch their \nbudgets even further to prepare for and respond to such devastating \nevents.\n  We know how severe weather-related events can endanger our \ncommunities and put lives at risk. But these events also threaten our \ncritical infrastructure. Last month, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity's Office of Infrastructure Protection testified before the \nSenate Homeland Security Committee that ``higher temperatures and more \nintense storms may damage or disrupt telecommunications and power \nsystems, creating challenges for telecommunications infrastructure, \nemergency communications, and the availability of cyber systems.''\n  Many of our roads, bridges, water systems, and electrical grids are \nalready very old and in need of repair. According to GAO, \n``Infrastructure is typically designed to withstand and operate within \nhistoric climate patterns. However, according to the National Research \nCouncil, as the climate changes and historical patterns--in particular, \nthose related to extreme weather events--no longer provide reliable \npredictions of the future, infrastructure designs may underestimate the \nclimate-related impacts to infrastructure over its design life, which \ncan range as long as 50 to 100 years. These impacts can increase the \noperating and maintenance costs of infrastructure or decrease its life \nspan, or both, leading to social, economic, and environmental \nimpacts.''\n  Additional funding will be needed to spend on adaptation, which is \nthe process of adjusting systems to possible climate risks. This is to \nensure that businesses and communities are protected against changes in \nthe climate.\n  FEMA has already established an Agency-wide directive to integrate \nadaptation planning into its policies and operations. Federal agencies \nare working to develop guidelines that incorporate climate change into \nrisk-based analysis to ensure that infrastructure is more resilient.\n  Emergency managers will be required to better coordinate with all \nlevels of government for better mitigation, preparation, response, and \nrecovery. Federal emergency managers are trying to mitigate the impact \nof climate change by raising awareness. But it is important that \nCongress promote these policies too.\n  We need a unified national approach to encourage investments in \nmaking our infrastructure more resilient to extreme weather events \nbrought on by climate change. We need to promote weather-ready planning \nand ensure that funding is available to emergency managers to \neffectively prepare for these types of events. We also need to equip \nindividuals to be prepared by increasing their awareness.\n  Congress needs to wake up and act now. Failure to do so puts our \nNation at risk.\n\n\n                          International Action\n\n  Mr. President, the only place where people continue to debate whether \nclimate change is real is right here in Congress. But while Congress is \nparalyzed by inaction, the rest of the world is acting.\n  People around the world are concerned about what the science is \ntelling them. A Pew Research Center poll published last year found that \na majority of publics in many of the countries surveyed said that \nglobal climate change is one the greatest challenges facing their \ncountries. Concerned communities spanned from Latin America and Europe, \nto Sub-Saharan Africa and the Asian-Pacific.\n  Not surprisingly, leaders in these countries are already acting to \nconfront climate change with the sense of urgency it deserves. Some of \nthem have focused on efforts to mitigate climate change by placing caps \non their greenhouse gas emissions; others have focused on efforts to \nadapt to climate change with targeted investments in coastal defense \nand other programs that will make them more resilient in the face of \nclimate uncertainty in the future.\n  The steps that these representatives have taken to confront climate \nchange are proof of what is possible when we cast aside partisanship \nand decide to act on the science.\n  Just across the Atlantic, our allies in the United Kingdom have \ndemonstrated what is possible. In 2008, leaders in London made the \nUnited Kingdom the first country in the world to adopt legally binding \ntargets that required the country to reduce greenhouse gas emissions \nand the first country to require businesses to report their carbon \nemissions. The 2008 Climate Change Act was a seminal piece of \nlegislation that has put the United Kingdom on track to confront its \ncontribution to climate change, with a goal of reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions at least 80 percent from its 1990 levels by 2050 below the \nnation's projected baseline.\n  In 2012, Mexico followed in the United Kingdom's footsteps, becoming \nonly the second country in the world to set legally binding reductions \non greenhouse gas emissions. The landmark bill signed into law that \nyear committed Mexico to cutting its greenhouse gas emissions 30 \npercent by 2020 and by 50 percent by 2050.\n  What is most remarkable about the legally binding targets that the \nUnited Kingdom and Mexico enacted and have continued to advance is that \nit proves that both developed and developing countries are both capable \nof cutting carbon pollution.\n  While greenhouse gas targets are important, that is only one activity \nthat countries across the world are undertaking to address climate \nchange. Given that climate change is already happening, many countries \nare being forced to take matters into their own hands and adapt to the \nreality around them.\n  We have heard numerous accounts tonight about how one of the most \npernicious impacts of climate change is sea level rise.\n  Sea level is expected to rise nearly one meter by 2100. This seems \nlike a distant challenge. But with each passing year, as the seas inch \nhigher, tides grow more threatening and storm surges more dangerous. \nEven slight changes in sea level rise pose serious dangers to coastal \ncommunities, from the Pacific Island nation of Kiribati to the mangrove \nvillages along the Bay of Bengal in eastern India.\n  The Netherlands is wasting no time in preparing for sea level rise. \nThe seawall of the Netherlands is 42 feet high and 50 yards thick at \nits base. The people have raised the wall several times since 1976, \nwhen it stood half as tall. Over the next 100 years, the Netherlands \nplans to invest $25 billion in strengthening existing sea defenses. \nWith $2.5 trillion worth of existing infrastructure, the seawall is \nvital to the Netherlands's future.\n  The Netherlands is just one dramatic example of how countries are \nworking to adapt to the challenges of climate change.\n  In addition to leading the world in crafting national greenhouse gas \nlegislation, the United Kingdom is working to assess its climate \nvulnerabilities. In order to better examine the risks that climate \nchange poses to its communities, the government has produced its\n\n[[Page S1479]]\n\nfirst Climate Change Risk Assessment and plans to release an updated \nassessment every 5 years, informed by the best available science.\n  Denmark has, in recent years, increased wind power to generate over \n30 percent of its electricity and aims to be 100 percent fossil fuel \nfree by 2050. While these efforts are in part to help the country \nreduce its greenhouse gas emissions, its embrace of renewables is also \nlikely to make it more resilient to climate change in the future by \ndiversifying their energy portfolio. It is no wonder that Denmark is, \naccording to the Climate Change Performance Index, No. 1 in taking \nactions against climate change.\n  Efforts to confront climate change head on are not unique to \ndeveloped countries either.\n  In 2013, Kenya launched its National Climate Action Plan, which \noutlined options for low carbon emissions, climate resilient \ndevelopment, and ways to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Like most \ndeveloping nations, Kenya's greenhouse gas emissions are low compared \nto those of developed nations. However, Kenya feels the effects of \nclimate change and is planning for increased uncertainty in the future. \nIndeed, leaders in Nairobi know too well that climate change will \ndisproportionately impact the world's poorest, and they need to be \nprepared.\n  Developing countries have long understood the risks of a warming \nplanet, even though the world community has continued to debate who, \nprecisely, is responsible. In the 1990s, the government of the African \nstate Seychelles prepared its own Environmental Management Plan.\n  The purpose of the plan was to conform to the United Nations \nConvention on Climate Change. Part of the plan was dedicated to \nsustainable development of the islands, to ensure that proper \nenvironmental protections were taking place throughout the country's \ndevelopment.\n  Leaders in the Seychelles, which at the time had a population of only \n70,000, took it upon themselves to make sure they took the necessary \nsteps to protect their home. Today, Seychelles, comprised of 115 \ngranite and coral islands, is at risk from sea level rise. Seychelles \nhas been dumping granite boulders on sand beaches to prevent them from \nwashing away.\n  Ronald Jemeau, Seychelles' Ambassador to the United Nations and the \nUnited States, offered these sobering remarks in 2010 that are worth \nrepeating at length:\n\n       We're having the problems of the coral reefs. And coral \n     reefs are central to our economy, central to our culture, \n     central to our way of life. What many people don't realize \n     about coral reefs is not--it's not that they're just \n     beautiful for diving and, as we call them, the rainforests of \n     the ocean. But coral reefs are where many of the deep sea \n     fishes spawn and grow up. It's a nursery for small fish. So \n     if coral reefs die, you are affecting fish in the deep seas, \n     which we use for--which we fish. Also, coral reefs are the \n     first defense--natural defense of violence against ocean \n     waves. When the coral reefs die because of--after they're \n     bleached, they break down, and they allow the waves to hit \n     the shore.\n       For some time now, our islands are being--have been eroded \n     away, islands actually changing shape because of the problem \n     of--on the one hand, the dying reefs. On the other, you have \n     much more serious, much more intense storm events, higher \n     tides, very strong tides which have been really eroding our \n     beaches. And the only defense we've been able to do--we have \n     a lot of granite. We are the oldest oceanic islands because \n     we have a lot of granite. And we've been dumping granite \n     boulders on our sand beaches to prevent them from being swept \n     away. That's not exactly the reason tourists come to \n     Seychelles. They come to see beaches with white sand, not \n     beaches strewn with boulders.\n\n  Mr. President, I want to take a moment to address opponents of action \nwho say: Well, China is the biggest polluter of them all, and they \naren't doing anything, so even if the United States does act, it \nwouldn't mean a thing.\n  By the way, notice how that argument implicitly accepts the realities \nof climate change. It is no longer a scientific argument; it is a \ncollective action argument.\n  Well if that is all that is holding some Americans back from taking \naction, then I have news. China is working to fight pollution and \nclimate change. The United States is the laggard.\n  Last week at the opening of China's annual meeting of Parliament, the \nChinese Premier said that China will ``declare war on pollution'' in \nthe coming years. China faces the twofold challenge of extreme local \npollution and the effects of climate change and recognizes that \ntransitioning to clean sources of energy is a decision that has \nenormous implications for its economic and political stability.\n  In January, the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change said that China is ``doing it right'' as \nit begins to tackle climate change. She continued to say that the \nChinese are ``not doing this because they want to save the planet. \nThey're doing it because it's in their national interest.'' Regardless \nof their motivations, the Chinese are acting.\n  So what exactly is China doing? Last September, the Chinese State \nCouncil released its Atmospheric Pollution Prevention Action Plan, \nwhich called for a reduction in the construction of new coal-fired \npowerplants and a goal of generating 13 percent of its electricity from \nrenewable sources by 2017.\n  In 2013, China installed 12 to 14 gigawatts of solar panels and \nexpects to do it again this year. Prior to 2013, no country has ever \nadded more than 8 gigawatts of solar in a single year. A price \nguarantee for utility-scale solar projects known as a feed-in-tariff, \nas well as low-cost panels, drove this dramatic growth.\n  The argument that the United States shouldn't act until China acts \ndoesn't fly anymore because China is taking action.\n  Chinese officials have announced that they plan to institute a tax on \ncarbon pollution in 2015 or 2016. Certain regions have also started to \nimplement pilot cap-and-trade programs and are beginning to develop \nplans to create a national carbon market by 2020.\n  How about current investments? In 2012 the United States spent about \n$35 billion on renewable energy, while China spent $64 billion.\n  The overwhelming buzz of climate action that we hear coming from \ncapitals around the world is a stark contrast to the deafening silence \nhere in Washington.\n  I worry about the message that Congress's inaction sends to the rest \nof the world, that while so many countries are going to great pains to \nconfront climate change, too many Members of Congress would deny that \nchange exists at all.\n  Many of these world leaders are looking for American leadership. They \nwant American leadership. European Commission President Jose Manuel \nBarroso acknowledged this ahead of the 2007 United Nations Climate \nChange Conference in Bali when he said, ``We can succeed only if we \nhave the United States with us.'' We must meet our partners on this \nissue. We risk conceding our credibility on this issue to others who \nare rising to the occasion.\n  I am grateful that we have a true champion on climate change in \nPresident Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry. Despite our neglect \nhere in Congress, Secretary Kerry has been America's ambassador to the \nworld on climate change, working hard to preserve our leadership \nposition on this crucial issue.\n  Secretary Kerry has thoughtfully said before that ``those who deny \nthe science or choose excuses over action are playing with fire.'' I \nhave no doubt that leaders in these countries know, through their \ndialogue with him, that he is committed to tackling climate change and, \nthrough him, America's commitment is real. I have no doubt that despite \nCongress's stubbornness, America understands the challenge.\n  Washington might be paralyzed, but the rest of the world is not. Once \nyou get outside of Washington, outside the grip of special interests, \nthe rest of America is further ahead in confronting climate change.\n  Take my home State of Hawaii.\n  Besides being on the cutting edge of climate science research, \npolicymakers in Hawaii have shown incredible leadership in adopting \npragmatic and principled legislation to confront the challenge of \nclimate change.\n  In 2007, Hawaii became only the second State in the country to adopt \nbinding targets for greenhouse gas emissions. The bipartisan Global \nWarming Solutions Act committed Hawaii to an aggressive goal of \nreducing its greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020.\n\n[[Page S1480]]\n\n  At the time, skeptics of the legislation thought that the legislation \nwould doom Hawaii given the State's outsized reliance on fossil fuels \nfor electricity. But, in fact, it is working in concert with the \naggressive greenhouse gas targets that legislators adopted that year \nwith a burgeoning partnership between Hawaii and the Department of \nEnergy that became the Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative.\n  The Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative has been perhaps one of the most \nsuccessful partnerships between the State, Federal Government, \nnonprofit, and private sector. It helped lay out a road map for Hawaii \nto achieve its aggressive greenhouse gas emissions goals with clean \nenergy as the means for doing it. Our job is far from done, but as a \nresult of this effort I am optimistic about Hawaii's energy future and \nour ability to reduce carbon pollution.\n  Hawaii is just one example of the many efforts under way outside of \nWashington to confront climate change. All across the country, cities, \ncounties, and State representatives are waking up to the reality of \nclimate change, just as international leaders already have.\n  The only people who are asleep on this issue are here, right here in \nCongress. It is time for them to wake up.\n\n\n                          Ocean Acidification\n\n  Mr. President. I will now address another impact of rising carbon \ndioxide: ocean acidification, or OA. The ocean absorbs CO2 \ngas from the atmosphere based on its concentration level: the higher \nthe levels of CO2, the more the oceans will absorb. When \nthis happens, the CO2 reacts with water to become more \nacidic.\n  Although acidity levels vary from place to place, NOAA scientists \nestimate that since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the \nacidity of surface ocean waters has risen approximately 30 percent.\n  Future predictions indicate that the oceans will continue to absorb \ncarbon dioxide and become even more acidic. Estimates of future carbon \ndioxide levels, based on business as usual emission scenarios, indicate \nthat by the end of this century the surface waters of the ocean could \nbe nearly 150 percent more acidic, resulting in acidity levels that the \noceans haven't experienced for more than 20 million years.\n  Scientists have been studying rising CO2 levels and ocean \nacidification for years, and I am proud to report that Hawai`i in \nparticular has been at the forefront. Our Mauna Loa observatory sits at \nan elevation of over 11,000 feet above sea level on the island of \nHawai`i, and has been recording CO2 levels since the mid-\n1950s, making it the oldest continuous CO2 measurement \nstation in the world. As such, it is the primary global benchmark site \nfor monitoring the increase of this gas that contributes to both global \nwarming and ocean acidification.\n  In addition to watching CO2 levels at Mauna Loa, Hawai`i \nhas also kept track of ocean chemistry at Station ALOHA, just north of \nHawai`i where the University of Hawai`i monitors a variety of \noceanographic conditions in a project known as HOT--the Hawai`i Ocean \nTime-series. With continuous observations of ocean waters at Station \nAloha since October 1988, scientists have learned that the surface \nocean grew more acidic at exactly the rate expected from rising levels \nof CO2 in the atmosphere. Their research indicated the need \nfor further inquiry, however, because the year-to-year rate of change \nvaried considerably.\n  For marine animals, ocean acidity is similar to humans living with \nair pollution: the increased acidity can cause health issues--\nparticularly for shellfish and coral. Most species of coral, oysters, \nclams, and mussels experience slower shell and skeleton growth as the \nwaters become more acidic, which will have significant impacts on \ncoastal communities and their economies.\n  The stakes from ocean acidification are high. According to NOAA: In \n2009, U.S. shellfish accounted for about half of the Nation's estimated \nannual seafood revenue of $3.9 billion. Coral reefs provide habitat for \nan estimated 1 million species, and offer food, income, and coastal \nprotection for about 500 million people globally.\n  Unfortunately, the negative impacts of OA are not speculative. The \nshellfish industry has already started to feel the effects of OA along \nthe Pacific Northwest, where failures at oyster hatcheries beginning in \n2007 have been confirmed as a result of the growing acidity of coastal \nwaters.\n  To get a sense of the impacts, consider this: NOAA estimates that \nWashington's seafood industry is estimated to contribute over 42,000 \njobs and at least $1.7 billion to the gross State product through \nprofits and employment at businesses such as restaurants, distributors, \nand retailers.\n  This is not an abstract, theoretical problem, so to illustrate, I \nwould like to highlight the efforts of several firms that are finding \nways to adapt to adversity brought on by the changing climate.\n  Penn Cove Shellfish, Coast Seafoods, Taylor Shellfish and Goose Point \nOyster Company--among the largest shellfish farms in America--provide \nsustainably farmed shellfish products to customers nationally and \nacross the world: as seed mussels, clams, and oysters for other farmers \nto grow out, and as fully grown shellfish, ready to eat.\n  After their hard work to develop their businesses, I can only imagine \nthe panic they must have felt when suddenly, some of their mainland \nshellfish hatcheries started to see production rates declining sharply, \nand it appeared that something was affecting the health of the larvae.\n  Working with scientists and researchers, the problems were diagnosed \nas being caused by ocean acidification. The researchers found that as \nmore and more atmospheric CO2 was absorbed by the ocean, the \nspecial form of calcium used by shellfish to create their shells--known \nas aragonite--declined. This lack of aragonite prevented the shellfish \nlarvae from creating their protective shells, and so many of them died \nas a result.\n  Fortunately, research on ocean acidification is not just science for \nscience's sake, so when the shellfish industry's hatchery problems were \ndefinitively linked to ocean acidification, Federal science agencies \nlike NOAA found ways for businesses to adapt to increasing \nCO2 conditions. Together, scientists from NOAA, academia, \nand the shellfish industry formed a strong partnership to help industry \nto adapt.\n  Here's how NOAA described the team's efforts:\n\n       Together these researchers determined that acidification \n     was threatening oyster production and offered an approach to \n     address it. They installed carbon chemistry monitoring \n     equipment at shellfish hatcheries. Real-time data from \n     offshore buoys now serves as an early warning system for \n     shellfish hatcheries; these buoys are capable of signaling \n     the approach of cold, acidified seawater 1-2 days before it \n     arrives in the sensitive coastal waters where larvae are \n     produced. The data have enabled hatchery managers to schedule \n     production when water quality is good and avoid wasting \n     valuable energy and other resources when water quality is \n     poor.\n\n  These efforts solved the immediate problem, but the experience set \nthem thinking about long-term environmental risk to their businesses.\n  First, they recognized that based on the best available science, \nocean acidity levels can vary greatly--so to find a way to insulate \nthemselves from changes to the waters in coastal Washington, they \nfigured they should look to a different State altogether.\n  That State wound up being my own home: Hawai`i. It happens that we \nhad existing infrastructure at the Natural Energy Lab of Hawaii; NELHA, \nto support shellfish aquaculture in Kona on Hawai`i Island, and so Penn \nCove and Coast Seafoods negotiated and moved in at Kona Coast \nShellfish, and Taylor Shellfish followed suit with a separate hatchery \nat the same facility. More recently, the Goose Point Oyster Company has \ndeveloped a new hatchery known as Hawaiian Shellfish near Hilo. Now, in \naddition to having more security for their supply chain, the increased \nproduction has allowed them all to expand sales to reach new North \nAmerican and Asian markets, and grow their business.\n  Their case is an object lesson on how adaptation can create economic \nopportunity, and I am grateful they chose Hawai`i to locate their \nbackup facilities! But it's also a stark reminder of how changes in \nocean chemistry have already disrupted the ability of shellfish to live \nin their native habitats and why there is so much urgency to act now.\n  Hawai`i is also connected to the other side of ocean acidification: \nits effects on coral reefs. Unfortunately,\n\n[[Page S1481]]\n\nocean acidification is not the only pressure on coral reefs.\n  Warming ocean waters, pollution and sedimentation from the land, and \noverfishing all reduce coral growth and vitality, making it harder and \nharder for reefs to survive into the future. Like the impacts on \nshellfish, the threat to corals from ocean acidification is invisible--\nunless you work with them on a daily basis, like coral scientists do. \nHowever, considering that coral reefs provide the habitat for an \nestimated 1 million species, and offer food, income, and coastal \nprotection for about 500 million people globally, it is a problem that \neveryone should care about.\n  Because it's their daily bread, coral scientists at the University of \nHawai`i see vividly how ocean acidification is changing our reefs and \nthey are doubling down to refine scientific understanding of corals and \nto find solutions. For others, like Dr. Bob Richmond, it's about \nmaintaining strength in science, while reaching out to elected \nofficials, community leaders, and members of the public to share what \nresearchers have learned.\n  The Honolulu Star Advertiser recently recognized Dr. Richmond's \nefforts:\n\n       Ocean scientists were urged . . . to go beyond their own \n     scientific research and inject themselves into the political \n     realm to give politicians and decision-makers the information \n     they need to make the best policy decisions.\n       Robert Richmond, director of the University of Hawai`i's \n     Kewalo Marine Laboratory, used his own research on coral \n     reefs to illustrate how it can be done in a speech before \n     hundreds of scientists from around the world at the 2014 \n     Ocean Sciences Meeting at the Hawai`i Convention Center.\n       Richmond, president of the International Society for Reef \n     Studies, said there's a need to teach scientists to be better \n     communicators.\n       In discussing his own research, Richmond described talking \n     to chiefs in Palau, community members in Guam and Pohnpei and \n     to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in East Honolulu to \n     accomplish successes in support of coral reefs on the local \n     level.\n       He urged the scientists to work with local organizations, \n     elected and traditional leaders, and stakeholders to effect \n     change. ``It requires partnerships. I've worked with groups I \n     never intended to, from economists to cultural \n     practitioners.''\n\n  Dr. Richmond's approach to bridge science and policy led him to work \nwith colleagues to develop a Consensus Statement on Climate Change and \nCoral Reefs, which has been signed by over 3,000 coral reef scientists \nfrom all over the world.\n  The consensus statement expresses the shared conclusions of the \nscience community about the impacts of greenhouse gases on the world's \ncoral reefs, along with their best predictions about the future. The \nstatement is intended to assist people like us--government officials--\nto make decisions with a firm foundation of objectively verifiable \nscience.\n  The science presented in the consensus statement is clear and \nsobering: If CO2 emissions continue at the current rate, the \ncombination of warming and acidification of ocean waters will reach \nlevels that have not occurred since 55 million years ago. At that time, \nthere was a ``coral reef crisis'' where environmental conditions caused \na dramatic reduction in reef development, and scientists fear that we \nwill face a similar situation in our lifetimes.\n  The situation is grave, but the consensus statement also details the \nscience-based steps we can take to improve the outlook for our corals.\n  The topline item, however, is one that my colleagues here tonight and \nI have long suspected: that we need a dedicated and consistent effort \nto reduce climate change through reduction in CO2 and other \ngreenhouse gas emissions throughout the world. This is simply the only \nlong-term, comprehensive solution to the problems of climate change.\n  Scientific research shows that we can also make a difference by \ntaking steps to reduce the damage done by local actions. For example, \ncommunities can: Rebuild fish stocks; Reduce runoff and pollutants \ncoming from the land; Rebuild populations of iconic species like \nturtles, whales, seals, and dolphins; Identify and protect the most \nresilient reefs; and Promote aquaculture without increasing pollution \nand runoff.\n  Unfortunately, these steps alone will not solve the challenge facing \ncoral reefs, but they will empower individuals to claim a role in \nprotecting their reefs.\n  Another notable Hawai`i coral scientist, Dr. Ruth Gates, who is based \nat the University of Hawai`i's Hawai`i Institute for Marine Biology, \nhas focused on a different science-based approach: finding resilient \ncorals that can stand up to the pressure of global warming and ocean \nacidification. Her work was featured in the Honolulu Star Advertiser \nlast week:\n\n       ``We can confirm that reefs are declining. There's no \n     disputing that,'' Gates said on a recent morning, a cool \n     breeze blowing off a cloudy Kaneohe Bay behind her. ``But \n     it's not all doom and gloom.''\n       Using the popular Oahu bay's turquoise waters as a \n     laboratory, Gates has spent the past several years scrambling \n     to find the hardiest, strongest coral--the ``professional \n     athletes'' of the bunch--that can endure the warmer and more \n     acidic seas of the future.\n       The idea is to then take those corals' traits and breed \n     them on a large scale similar to breeding preferred traits in \n     dogs and other animals.\n       In Hawai`i, a State that has become a flash point in the \n     debate over the use of genetically modified organisms, the \n     Hawai`i Institute of Marine Biology researcher is quick to \n     stress that her concept of selective coral breeding is \n     something entirely different.\n       ``We're looking for the supercorals that already exist'' \n     several feet from a stretch of coral just offshore, Gates \n     explained. The approach would not introduce foreign DNA into \n     coral, as is done in the controversial GMO process.\n       It's more than just scientists who are working to save \n     reefs in the face of ocean acidification and global warming. \n     Community leaders, cultural practitioners, scientists, and \n     the general public have all come together to designate a \n     National Estuarine Research Reserve in O`ahu's He`eia estuary \n     in Kane`ohe Bay, and I am doing all I can to support their \n     efforts. When we succeed, the He`eia site will provide a rich \n     base of information from diverse knowledge bases: Native \n     Hawaiian cultural practitioners; The University of Hawai`i's \n     Hawai`i Institute of Marine Biology, which specializes in \n     coral research, and is located on a small island in K?ne ohe \n     Bay; and The local community of Kane`ohe.\n\n  Because the site lies within the footprint of Kane`ohe town, we can \nuse it to learn how best to live with coral reefs so that we can \npreserve the economy and the environment at the same time.\n  As legislators in the national Congress, we have a role to play as \nwell. My distinguished colleague from Florida, Bill Nelson, has \ndeveloped an impressive reauthorization of the Coral Reef Conservation \nAct. In addition to continuing the strong efforts already present in \nthe Federal Government, this bill would empower local action and \nmandate the development of an international strategy for coral \nconservation. I am a proud cosponsor of his bill.\n  We can also continue to support the Federal Ocean Acidification \nResearch and Monitoring Act, or FOARAM, which provided the science that \nhelped the shellfish industry. I understand that my friend from \nWashington State, Maria Cantwell, is working hard to develop a \nreauthorization of this bill. She is a real ocean champion, and I am \ngrateful for her leadership on this important issue. I look forward to \nsupporting her efforts.\n  Finally, we need to continue to support NOAA's Integrated Ocean \nObserving System, which provides critical data that coral scientists \nrely on to understand how the changing acidity of the ocean impacts our \nreefs.\n  I was glad to help organize a bipartisan coalition of 15 colleagues \nfrom this Chamber to express support of the program to our \ndistinguished colleague, Appropriations Chairwoman Barbara Mikulski.\n  Friends, the threat of ocean acidification is real and imminent, but \nwe can still take action. Thank you for your time to hear me out on \nthis issue of great national and global significance.\n\n\n                   Big Business and Economic Impacts\n\n  Mr. President, when the financial crisis hit, global economic output \ndropped 1.3 percent. It was catastrophic.\n  The world now faces the risk of another major blow to global GDP--\nclimate change. By some estimates, the impact could be several times \nthe size of what we saw during the financial crisis.\n  Climate change could be the biggest shock to the global economy we \nhave ever seen.\n  To put the cost in context, consider what the United States spent \ntrying to recover from the financial crisis. We committed almost $500 \nbillion to stabilize the financial system, and the\n\n[[Page S1482]]\n\nFederal Reserve continues to pump trillions of dollars into the economy \nto stimulate growth. That investment will seem tiny in comparison to \nwhat it will cost to deal with the fall-out from climate change.\n  Climate change is not a new challenge. What is new is that big \nbusiness is finally starting to pay attention.\n  Big businesses are vulnerable to changes in our climate--and they \nknow it.\n  Already, these changes are affecting their bottom lines by driving up \nthe price of inputs, disrupting global supply chains, and introducing \nuncertainty into their business plans.\n  Now that we have the attention of multinational corporations, it is \ntime to harness those powerful economic interests to drive solutions to \nclimate change before it is too late. It is time to get the attention \nof those in Congress who would even deny a problem exists.\n  The impact of climate change on our global economy will be massive.\n  Climate change is likely to hurt industries that are sensitive to \nchanges in the environment--such as agriculture, fisheries, forestry, \nand tourism.\n  The global economy will also be hit by higher costs as we need to do \nmore to cool our environments. We will spend more to get the water \nneeded for industry and human consumption, and to repair the damage \ncaused by extreme weather, which will continue to disrupt global supply \nchains. The cost of these disruptions will ripple throughout the world \neconomy.\n  We can also expect to see negative impacts on capital flows, \ninvestment, and savings as a result of lower economic output and \nuncertainty about the future.\n  The economic impact of climate change will not just be felt in our \nmarkets. We will face rising healthcare costs as a result of the spread \nof infectious diseases and health problems associated with intense heat \nwaves, droughts, and floods.\n  So what do we know about the actual cost of climate change? Quite a \nbit, actually.\n  Just within America's borders, we have seen how costly extreme \nweather events can be--Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Sandy, record \ndroughts on the west coast, wildfires and floods in Colorado, \ndevastating floods in the Midwest, and record heat waves in the \nNortheast.\n  The price tag is not just the cost of rescuing people from harms' \nway, repairing the damage, and rebuilding communities. There is also \nthe cost of higher food prices, lower tourism revenue, and the loss of \neconomic productivity when people can't work.\n  A recent study was commissioned by 20 governments of countries that \nare highly vulnerable to climate change. The study estimated that, in \n2010, climate change cost the world over $1.2 trillion, or 1.6 percent \nof global GDP. It also showed that, by 2030, climate change will cut \nglobal economic growth by over 3 percent.\n  The International Monetary Fund is paying close attention to the risk \nthat climate change poses to the world economy. In its view, studies \nthat attempt to estimate the global economic damage of climate change \ntend to be underestimates.\n  That is because these studies are based on fairly conservative \nestimates of changes in global temperatures. And they have a hard time \ntaking into account the multifaceted and far-reaching impact of climate \nchange.\n  As an example, Lord Nicolas Stern, author of the most respected study \non how climate change will impact the economy said the following:\n  ``I got it wrong on climate change--it's far, far worse.''\n  Keep in mind that his initial study predicted dire economic \nconsequences for the world. And now, just 6 years later, he's saying \nthose predictions were not dire enough.\n  Americans are taking action. Former Mayor of New York Michael \nBloomberg and former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson teamed up with the \nfounder of a global investment capital firm in a nonpartisan effort to \nconduct an assessment of the economic risks of climate change to the \nUnited States.\n  In Mayor Bloomberg's words, ``If the United States were run like a \nbusiness, its board of directors would fire its financial advisers for \nfailing to disclose the significant and material risks associated with \nunmitigated climate change.''\n  Big business is finally paying attention.\n  Unlike Congress, big business has finally woken up to the reality and \nurgency of climate change.\n  A recent article in the New York Times ran with the headline \n``Industry Awakens to Threat of Climate Change.''\n  According to the article, senior officials at Coca-Cola and Nike are \njoining a growing group of American business leaders who see climate \nchange as a major challenge to global economic growth.\n  A senior official at Coca-Cola listed risks to the company's bottom-\nline: in his words, those risks include ``increased droughts, more \nunpredictable variability, [and] hundred-year floods every two years.'' \nThese risks are not hypothetical--Coca-Cola has already seen the \neffects in real time. In 2004, Coca-Cola lost a major operating license \nin India because of a serious water shortage.\n  Likewise, Nike has seen its supply chain disrupted by changes in \nclimate and extreme weather. Floods have shut down Nike's factories in \nSoutheast Asia. Droughts have lowered production of the cotton the \ncompany relies on to make its athletic clothes. Nike, like many other \ncorporations, now includes the risks posed by climate change on its \nfinancial risk disclosure forms to the Securities and Exchange \nCommission.\n  Recently, Chipotle made headlines when its annual financial report \ndisclosed that climate change could have a significant impact on the \nprice or availability of its avocadoes. The company warned that if \ncosts went up too much, it could have to stop serving its much beloved \nguacamole.\n  Starbucks also has its eye on how climate change will impact its \nbottom-line. The company sources nearly two-thirds of its coffee from \nsmall-scale producers in Latin America, Africa, and Indonesia. These \nregions are vulnerable to both droughts and excessive rain. Changes in \nweather patterns are likely to reduce their coffee yields and hurt the \nquality of their beans. Extreme weather is also likely to affect the \nroads that the company relies on to move its goods around the world. \nThese risks are not far-off or theoretical. They affect the company \ntoday.?\n  Some deniers accept the science but say we're better off doing \nnothing. They should start listening to the business world.\n  They say it's too expensive: regulations will kill jobs and hurt the \neconomy, driving up prices on everything from gasoline to bread and \nmilk.\n  We have heard this argument before; many times in fact, and it is \nalways proven wrong. Over and over again, large-scale collective action \non environmental problems has helped to grow the economy and improve \nhuman health.\n  For example, a 2011 peer-reviewed EPA study found that programs \nestablished by the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments will yield direct \nbenefits to Americans vastly in excess of the costs. In just a couple \nof decades, the study estimates that the benefits of this legislation \nwill exceed the costs by a margin of 30 to 1--and may even approach 90 \nto 1.\n  What kind of benefits am I talking about? The study estimated that in \n2011 alone the cleaner air we now enjoy avoided more than 160,000 \npremature deaths from things like heart attacks. It also avoided \nmillions of cases of acute bronchitis and asthma attacks. These meant \n13 million fewer lost workdays and 3.2 million fewer lost schools days.\n  National vehicle efficiency standards, put in place in 1975--have \nachieved a major reduction in pollution and significant economic \nbenefits to consumers, despite dogged resistance from opponents. And \nnew standards implemented by President Obama are projected to not only \nreduce our consumption of gasoline but also yield significant savings.\n  One study finds the following: ``The standards will save consumers \n$140 billion in 2030. When compared to a typical vehicle on the road \ntoday, a new car buyer will save more than 8,000 dollars over the \nlifetime of a new 2025 vehicle, even after paying for the more fuel-\nefficient technology.''\n\n[[Page S1483]]\n\n  The Department of Energy efficiency standards for appliances are \nanother great example of Federal standards that both reduced pollution \nand saved consumers money. As a result of the standards under this \nprogram, the Department reports that consumers saved close to $40 \nbillion on their utility bills, just in 2010 alone. They estimate that \nby 2030, total cost savings from these standards will be well over 1\\1/\n2\\ trillion dollars--and will reduce carbon pollution equivalent to the \nannual emissions from 1.4 billion cars. And yet still today, members of \nCongress waste time and effort trying to get rid of efficiency \nstandards for things like light bulbs--standards that the lighting \nindustry itself has requested.\n  The removal of lead from gasoline has had enormous positive impacts. \nIn the 1960's, scientists began to establish that humans were \ncontributing enough lead to the environment to have an effect on human \nhealth. And scientists and doctors were showing that lead pollution was \ncontributing to IQ deficits in children, nerve damage, anemia, and \nmental retardation.\n  Industry, as you can imagine, resisted strongly. In 1965, the \nAmerican Petroleum Institute responded to reports that lead was \nincreasing in the environment with the following quote:\n  These findings ``have no real bearing on the public health aspects of \nlead . . . the mass of evidence proves unquestionably that lead isn't a \nsignificant factor in air pollution and represents no public health \nproblem in any way.''\n  It took over 10 years and a major court decision for the EPA to even \nbegin phasing out lead in gasoline, and that's due to outright \nfalsehoods such as this one.\n  By 1986, studies showed that the health benefit to cost ratio was 10 \nto 1. Blood levels of lead across the country dropped significantly as \nsoon as the lead phase-out began.\n  From 1978 to 1991 they dropped 78 percent.\n  If you remember one statistic from this speech, remember this one. \nLargely as a result of government regulations, between 1970 and 2011, \ntotal air pollution dropped 68 percent, while the U.S. gross domestic \nproduct grew 212 percent.\n  The evidence is overwhelming. Well-designed solutions to \nenvironmental problems aren't harmful; they contribute to a healthier \nand growing economy. A warming planet and changing climate is what will \nhurt the economy.\n  For many multinational companies, climate change has moved from a \ncorporate social responsibility issue to a bottom-line issue. They are \nstarting to see the impact of unpredictable and extreme weather and \nrealize that investing in environmental protection means investing in \nthe economy. Climate change affects the supply of key inputs, disrupts \nfactories, demolishes infrastructure, and drives up prices.\n  The economic calculus has shifted--business as usual will lead to no \nbusiness at all.\n  Businesses have woken up to the risks of climate change, and they are \ncalling out for Congress to act. It is time for Congress to wake up.\n\n\n                     Ascent Conference Mini-Speech\n\n  Mr. President, finally, I wish to report on activities in my home \nState of Hawaii that show how our Nation is making progress toward \nsustainability and adaptation to climate change. Back at home, we see \nthe effects of climate change up close and personal. Our coral reefs, \nour beaches, and the lush vegetation that greens our landscape--it's \nall imperiled by climate change, and people are standing to take \naction.\n  They recognize that the rhetoric of denial will not hold back rising \nsea levels. They understand that junk science will not save our coral \nreefs--or bring back the tradewinds and rain that supplies our water \nwhen climate change has traded it for cycles of hurricane and drought.\n  That is why they have come together to host a first-of-its-kind \nconference in Hawaii on sustainable development and climate adaptation. \nFrom transportation to energy to community development, the conference \nwill bring local and national leaders together to share stories of \nsuccess, and inspire action for the future. We call it ``Ascent'' to \nrecognize our upward progress, and to challenge ourselves to aim higher \nand higher.\n  Our Ascent conference will be held on April 15, 2014, when University \nof Hawai`i Sea Grant College Program, University of Hawaii Chancellor \nTom Apple, and I will hold a 2-day-long conference and Senate field \nhearing featuring world-renowned experts from across the State and \nNation. These experts will address key underlying issues of \nsustainability, and engage directly with high school and college \nstudents who are poised to lead these efforts in the future.\n  We will be happy to welcome Mr. Nainoa Thompson, president, \nPolynesian Voyaging Society; Mr. Geoffrey Anderson, president, Smart \nGrowth America; and Mr. Jeff Seabright, vice president, Environment & \nWater Resources for The Coca Cola Company, among other visionaries at \nthe conference. They will be partnering with State and local experts as \nwell as Hawai`i's youth to examine risks and propose solutions to \nenergy and water resource security, and the complexities of climate \nchange.\n  That evening, we will also welcome former U.S. Vice President Al \nGore, who will present a free public lecture on sustainability and \nclimate at the University of Hawai`i.\n  The Ascent conference was created because we recognize that the only \nway to solve a problem is to own it, and act. I respect our colleagues \nfrom across the aisle for their work to focus on the fiscal issues our \nNation faces. Together we have rolled up our sleeves and found \nsolutions. Now we need to do the same on climate change. Denying the \nproblem and trying to muzzle the opposition will not make environmental \nchange go away. Owning up, and facing it together will.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues to bring \nattention to the important issue of climate change. It is time to wake \nup and take action--we owe it to our planet, to our country, and to \ngenerations to come. I thank the organizers of this event, Senator \nBoxer, Senator Whitehouse, and Senator Schatz, for their leadership on \nthis issue. This is a problem that must be addressed, and this call to \naction is long overdue.\n  Maryland is one of the most vulnerable States to climate change. Our \nexpansive coastline is greatly affected by rapidly rising sea levels \nthat are eroding our shoreline and causing flooding. We are also \nstarting to see the effects of more frequent extreme weather events, \nsuch as flooding, heavy precipitation, heat waves, and droughts. This \nwill cause environmental damage to our shoreline, the Chesapeake Bay, \nand our water and air quality. It could impact our health by increasing \nrespiratory illnesses. And this will cause economic damage by costing \nour coastal cities billions of dollars in lost tourism, our farmers \nheavy losses from droughts and heat waves, and many Marylanders \nproperty damage from flooding.\n  Maryland is leading the way in responding to the dire problem of \nclimate change. Maryland has developed a Climate Change Plan that will \nreduce greenhouse gases 25 percent by 2020, contribute $1.6 billion to \nMaryland's economy, and create 37,000 jobs. I am very proud of my State \nfor setting an example and tackling this problem head-on.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency is also moving forward with its \nefforts to put forth commonsense rules for curbing greenhouse gas \nemissions. This has included standards to promote a new generation of \nclean vehicles, which are expected to save more than 6 billion barrels \nof oil through 2025 and reduce more than 3,100 million metric tons of \ncarbon dioxide emissions. It has also included an effort to limit \nemissions from new powerplants, and the EPA has pledged to hold \nlistening sessions as it develops rules for existing plants. I support \nthe EPA's actions--they are offering tailored solutions to a complex \nproblem, and working within the Clean Air Act to protect public health.\n  Even though Congress hasn't been able to agree on a long-term \nsolution to combat climate change, I have worked hard to fund the \nresearch that informs us about climate change and will help us develop \nsolutions. As the chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee and the \nCommerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations Subcommittee, I funded \nover $3 billion for climate-related research in the Consolidated \nAppropriations Act of 2014.\n\n[[Page S1484]]\n\nThis includes $226 million for NOAA, which uses peer-reviewed research \ninitiatives and partnerships with universities to study regional \nclimate data and make climate predictions. It includes $1.85 billion \nfor NASA's Earth Science program, which examines the Earth on a global \nscale and develops data that is used for climate prediction models. It \nalso includes $958 million for climate-related research at the National \nScience Foundation within the Geosciences Directorate and the National \nCenter for Atmospheric Research. I commend the employees at these \noutstanding institutions who are working every day to develop long-term \nsolutions for climate change, and I will continue to fight hard for \nrobust funding for these agencies.\n  Climate change is an enormous problem, but it is not enough for us to \njust recognize the problem. When it is a problem of this magnitude, we \nmust truly rise to the occasion. The science is sound, and the reasons \nto act are numerous. Let's move it on climate change--the time is now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/10/senate-section/article/S1484-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1484-S1485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                                SCOUTING\n\n Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask that a copy of my remarks \nto the Wilson County Friends of Scouting Luncheon in Lebanon, TN be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The remarks follow.\n\n                         Lessons From Scouting\n\n       Thank you very much. In a little book I did a few years ago \n     called Lamar Alexander's Little Plaid Book, it has lots of \n     rules in it and one of them is ``If you want a standing \n     ovation, seat a few friends in the front row.'' So, thanks to \n     the front row for that. And, thanks to Rob, my friend, for \n     inviting me here and all of the others of you who did, and \n     for the terrific job you do as aldermen and for your \n     friendship. Jason Flannery, Peter Williston, Chris Crowell, \n     Bobby Kane, Quin Cochran, thank you for your remarks, which \n     will come a little later. Representative Mark Pody is here, \n     and Mayor Hutto and Mayor Craighead and Mayor Jennings all \n     are here. It's exciting to be in Lebanon and to hear about \n     all of the good things that are happening here.\n       I had a great friend Alex Haley, the author of Roots, who \n     once heard me make a speech and he came up afterwards and \n     said, ``Lamar, may I make a suggestion?'' And I said ``Well, \n     of course, Alex.'' And he said ``Well, if when you start, \n     instead of making a speech you would say `Let me tell you a \n     story,' people might actually listen to what you have to \n     say.'' So let me tell you a few stories from scouting.\n       I was about 13 years old. It was in a hot summer over in \n     East Tennessee. But, when you're in scouting and you go up in \n     the Smokies, you learn that it drops about five degrees every \n     thousand feet, so by the time you get to the top of Spence \n     Field Mountain on the Appalachian Trail, it's pretty nice. \n     So, our explorer scout group had gone up there one August \n     day, and we'd loaded up our packs with Bisquick and bacon and \n     all the things that you cook for breakfast because that's \n     when all of the blueberries were ripe on Spence Field and we \n     were going to make blueberry pancakes the next morning.\n       We stayed in one of the trail shelters along the \n     Appalachian Trail--we'd done that many times before--with our \n     explorer scout leader, Dick Grave, who later was the head of \n     Alcoa in Tennessee, and went to bed that night. At about 3 \n     a.m., I noticed someone rustling around--these trail shelters \n     had an open front--fire out front, and then three sides were \n     closed. I was sleeping down on one end and I noticed some \n     rustling around in the middle around where our packs were. \n     So, I thought it was one of the boys getting up and I looked \n     over there and there was a bear. Well, I woke everybody up, \n     which didn't take long, and we did the only thing you do in a \n     circumstance like that which was, we climbed up on top of our \n     trail shelter with our aluminum pans and our cooking \n     utensils, and we beat the cooking utensils on the aluminum \n     pans and shouted unprintable things at the bear, who took all \n     of our packs, including what we had for breakfast, down to \n     the spring in front of the Spence Field Shelter. I learned a \n     lesson about not sleeping with your breakfast bacon on top of \n     the Smoky Mountains when the bears are around.\n       That's not the only thing I learned in Boy Scouts. About \n     the same time, about the same age, when the weather was just \n     as hot, we went spelunking in Monroe County in East \n     Tennessee. That means you go down in caves. And if you have \n     been down in caves, you know that they're all about the same \n     temperature--I forget, but it's about 57 degrees, something \n     like that, but it was a hundred degrees outside. I decided, \n     which thirteen-year-old boys will do sometimes, to try \n     something I'd been told I couldn't do, which was to have a \n     chaw of tobacco. So, I took it down into the cave with me, \n     got down in there, and with a couple of other boys, we tried \n     it. Then, we came back up to the top in 103 degree weather, \n     which made us as sick as I have been in my entire life. And \n     so ever since that day, I've never even thought of having a \n     chew of tobacco. I learned that lesson in Boy Scouting as \n     well.\n       I learned how to go on a snipe hunt in boy scouting. \n     Essentially, you take a bag, and you're told you sit out \n     there all night with the bag open and you'll catch a snipe. I \n     learned a lesson there as well.\n       I learned a lesson when my father, when I was twelve or \n     thirteen, drove me the day after Christmas with two other \n     explorer scouts not much older, maybe a year or two older, \n     and just dumped us out on Newfound Gap at about 5,000 feet in \n     the Smokies with three feet of snow on the ground and said \n     he'd pick us up in Gatlinburg at the end of the day. The \n     three of us walked up to the top of Mount LeConte, and then \n     down, and we got to Gatlinburg. It wasn't very easy, but we \n     learned a lot about the importance of getting to your \n     destination on that day.\n       I was at Camp Pellissippi, which was our scout camp nearby \n     Maryville and Knoxville and I learned a little bit about \n     authority. We had a camp director named Kyle Middleton. He \n     must have been 7'10'' tall, at least he looked that tall to \n     us, and we would all assemble in the amphitheater at the \n     first day of Camp Pellissippi, and Mr. Middleton would stand \n     up in front of us. Actually, we all called him ``Kyle,'' I \n     don't know why we would do that, he was so familiar, but I \n     think it was because he told us to, and this is what he'd \n     say. He said, ``Camp is now open, and we have one thing we \n     need to get straight. I think I'm in charge. Does anyone here \n     think I'm not?'' And, of course, none of us did, and we \n     learned a little bit about the importance of authority. I \n     joined the order of the arrow there. I learned about how to \n     make a fire with flint and steel. One of my friends from \n     Maryville, a couple of years older than me, would have been \n     the first person ever to walk the entire Appalachian Trail \n     through my area, from Maine to Georgia, but he made the \n     mistake of getting all the way down to Virginia (he started \n     in Maine), and he called his father in August and his father \n     said he had to come home and go to college. So I learned the \n     importance of education.\n       And even in Cub Scouts, we learned lots of lessons. One of \n     the most vivid was when we were playing baseball and knocked \n     the ball through the upstairs window of the neighbor's house. \n     And, we all looked at each other wondering what to do until \n     Bill Ernest, I'll remember this until I die, said, ``What we \n     should do is go tell Mr. Smith (or whoever it was) what we \n     did.'' So, we all trooped up to his house and knocked on the \n     door and said, ``Mr. Smith, we just knocked a baseball \n     through your upstairs window.''\n       For more than 100 years, the Boy Scouts of America have \n     talked about leadership, have taught lessons of community \n     service. There are 110 million scouts in the world in 185 \n     countries, and 2 million Eagles. There are 9 Eagles in the \n     United States Senate. There are a million adult volunteers in \n     the Boy Scout movement. It is the largest and most prominent \n     youth organization in the world. Its job is helping to turn \n     boys into men.\n       Looking back, I realize how much I took for granted, all \n     the time that our volunteer scout leaders gave to us. I know \n     there are a lot of volunteers here in the room, but we just \n     thought the world was made that way, that Mr. Studley--Joe \n     Studley--and Mr. Miller, that they just had all this time to \n     give to us. And because we grew up at the edge of the Smoky \n     Mountains, close to the great American outdoors, just like \n     you do in Middle Tennessee, we were out there all the time. \n     Almost every weekend or every other weekend, we were hiking \n     or camping or learning about the great outdoors. They taught \n     us to love the Great American Outdoors, and as important, \n     they taught us not to be afraid of the Great American \n     Outdoors.\n       Today we have fewer parents who take their kids into the \n     Great American Outdoors and I don't think it's because the \n     boys are afraid of the outdoors. I think it's because a lot \n     of the parents never had the chance to be in scouting and to \n     know what to do in the outdoors. I still remember the Scout \n     Law. I imagine most of you can say it: ``trustworthy, loyal, \n     helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, careful, \n     thrifty, brave, plain, reverent,'' I remember that. And I \n     remember the motto, ``Be Prepared.'' That's a good lesson in \n     life whether you're preparing for a piano concert or whether \n     you're running in a Republican primary. Over the years I've \n     tried to apply those rules to whatever I was doing in life, \n     and I've found it hard to improve on the Boy Scout lessons.\n       I've put my love of the outdoors to work as a senator, \n     trying to protect the parks, trying to keep the air clean, \n     trying to keep enough open space so that our children and \n     grandchildren can enjoy the outdoors as I did. And I've tried \n     my best to teach my boys and girls, or as Honey likes to say, \n     ``our boys and girls,'' our family about the outdoors and to \n     help teach those grandchildren as well.\n       Some people say that it's naive in this tough world that we \n     live in to take the simple Boy Scout lessons, like to walk up \n     and say, ``Mr. Smith, I just knocked a baseball through your \n     window and I take responsibility for it.'' That's the right \n     thing to do but some people say it's naive in the \n     sophisticated world in which we live.\n       Well, let me close with a story that suggests it's not \n     naive at all. Shortly after I graduated from law school, I \n     had the privilege of working in the White House for a man \n     named Bryce Harwell, who had also worked for President \n     Eisenhower. He was President\n\n[[Page S1485]]\n\n     Eisenhower's favorite staff member. He was a diminutive \n     little fellow who took shorthand, gave good advice, wrote \n     good speeches, and everybody loved him. And he told me this \n     story about President Eisenhower's cabinet meeting. The \n     Eisenhower cabinet was meeting one day in the cabinet room in \n     the White House right off the Oval Office where the president \n     works, and they had a particularly difficult decision to \n     make.\n       Now, Eisenhower as we know, was a sophisticated man. He was \n     a five-star general. He was in charge of our troops during \n     World War II, the Allied forces, in fact. He was president of \n     a university, he was the head of NATO and now he was the \n     president of the United States. He was a sophisticated fellow \n     who knew how to operate in a tough world, who even knew how \n     to win world wars. So he put an issue on the table, and asked \n     the cabinet members what to do. The secretary of state said, \n     ``Oh, Mr. President, as a matter of foreign policy, we should \n     do x.'' The secretary of the treasury was next, and he said, \n     ``No, Mr. President, we couldn't possibly do that; that would \n     damage the economy.'' The secretary of defense said, ``No, we \n     couldn't do either one of those two options, because it would \n     hurt our military strength.'' And so all the way they went \n     around the table and down the line, every single member of \n     the cabinet pointing out a problem with the option based on \n     how it would affect their particular department.\n       So, finally, President Eisenhower asked this question of \n     his cabinet: ``What would be the right thing to do?'' The \n     secretary of state said, ``Oh, Mr. President, the right thing \n     to do would be x,'' and the secretary of the treasury said, \n     ``Mr. President, that's right, the right thing to do would be \n     x.'' And so said the secretary of defense and the secretary \n     of commerce and on down the line. So the president, this \n     sophisticated man who had won the world war asked that \n     question, ``What would be the right thing to do,'' heard from \n     his cabinet what it would be, turned to his press secretary \n     and said, ``Mr. Hagerty, then go out and tell the press that \n     that's what we'll do.''\n       The moral of the story, I think, is whether you're a Cub \n     Scout who's just broken a window, or whether you're a Boy \n     Scout trying to learn about life, that the lessons you learn \n     in scouting are lessons that are good for the rest of your \n     life. And another lesson, and I think particularly for this \n     group today, as we honor and salute the volunteers and the \n     supporters and the scouts in Wilson County, and those in the \n     Walton Trail district, is that it's hard to think of anything \n     more important that you could be doing with your time and \n     with your money for your community and for our country than \n     teaching these lessons of life that help these boys become \n     men. Thank you very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/10/senate-section/article/S1485-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING BOB ``MAC'' McQUILLEN\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the \nextraordinary life of Bob ``Mac'' McQuillen, who passed away on \nFebruary 4, at Catholic Medical Center in Manchester, NH, at the age of \n90. Bob was a veteran of two wars, a nationally renowned musician, a \nrespected teacher, a police chief and a friend to all who had the joy \nof knowing him. He was an icon in New Hampshire and in the folk music \nworld.\n  Mac, as he was known by friends, was born in Massachusetts in 1923 \nshortly before the Great Depression and moved north with his mother to \nNew Boston, NH, as a teenager. In 1943, he answered his country's call \nin World War II, joining the U.S. Marine Corps and serving in the South \nPacific. Although he came from a musical family, it was only when he \nbefriended a guitar player during the war that he came to appreciate \nmusic. When he returned to New Hampshire in 1946, that love of music \ngrew immeasurably as he traveled around Cheshire and Hillsborough \ncounties in the southwest part of the State, attending contra dances in \ntown halls and churches. Mac fell in love with contra dancing and the \nrhythm of the music, taking up the accordion and piano in a local band. \nHe even met his wife-to-be, Priscilla Scribner from Dublin, NH, at a \ncontra dance. Mac reenlisted in the Marines in 1951, and for a time \nbefore fighting in Korea, he taught marksmanship at Marine Corps Base \nQuantico in Virginia. It was a critical experience for him as it was in \nthis capacity that he discovered one of his life passions, teaching.\n  After his tour in Korea, Mac attended an esteemed institution in New \nHampshire, Keene State College, graduating in 1959 with a degree in \neducation. Mac put his education to good use right away, teaching shop \nclass and weight-lifting at Peterborough High School, which is now \ncalled ConVal Regional High School. He was also one of the bus drivers, \nand it didn't take long for him to become one of the most popular \nteachers in the school.\n  Throughout Mac's 35 years of teaching, he played music constantly and \ncomposed over 1,500 of his own tunes. He also created a fund to teach \nyoung people contra dance music. In 2002, for his impact on traditional \nmusic and dance in New England, Mac received the Nation's highest honor \nin traditional and folk art, the National Heritage Fellowship from the \nNational Endowment for the Arts.\n  Mac's ability to find the good in everyone and his upbeat outlook on \nlife will be sorely missed. His dedication to his community, his \nNation, and to traditional folk music will always be remembered; and \nhis songs, his jokes, and his spirit will live on in the hills, barns, \nchurches and town halls of New Hampshire.\n  Along with his many admirers and mentees, Mac is survived by two of \nhis three children: his son, Daniel; his daughter, Rebecca; five \ngrandchildren; two great-grandchildren; and also his former students, \ncolleagues and lifelong friends. He is predeceased by his wife, \nPriscilla, and his son, William. The generosity of this patriot, \nmentor, musician and friend will be dearly missed by all.\n  I ask my colleagues and all Americans to join me in honoring Bob \n``Mac'' McQuillen and his rich life of service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/10/senate-section/article/S1485-2", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1485-S1486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              RxIMPACT DAY\n\n Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the sixth \nannual RxIMPACT Day on Capitol Hill. This is a special day where we \nrecognize the contributions of pharmacies to the American health care \nsystem. This year's event, organized by the National Association of \nChain Drug Stores, takes place this week. Nearly 400 individuals from \nthe pharmacy community--including practicing pharmacists, pharmacy \nschool faculty and students, State pharmacy leaders and pharmacy \ncompany executives--will visit Capitol Hill. They will share their \nviews with Congress about the importance of supporting legislation that \nprotects access to community and neighborhood pharmacies and that \nutilizes pharmacists to improve the quality and reduce the costs of \nproviding healthcare.\n  Advocates from 40 States have traveled to Washington to talk about \nthe important role that over 40,000 community pharmacies nationwide \nplay in big cities and small towns all over the country. Patients have \nalways relied on their local pharmacist to meet their healthcare needs. \nThe local pharmacist is a trusted, highly accessible healthcare \nprovider deeply committed to providing the highest quality care in the \nmost efficient manner possible.\n  As demand for healthcare services continues to grow, pharmacists have \nexpanded their role in healthcare delivery, partnering with physicians, \nnurses and other healthcare providers to meet their patients' needs. \nInnovative services provided by pharmacists do even more to improve \npatient healthcare. Pharmacists are highly valued by those that rely on \nthem most--those in rural and underserved areas, as well as older \nAmericans, and those struggling to manage chronic diseases. Pharmacy \nservices improve patients' quality of life as well as healthcare \naffordability. By helping patients take their medications effectively \nand providing preventive services, pharmacists help avoid more costly \nforms of care. Pharmacists also help patients identify strategies to \nsave money, such as through better understanding of their pharmacy \nbenefits, using generic medications, and obtaining 90-day supplies of \nprescription drugs from local pharmacies.\n  Pharmacists are the Nation's most accessible healthcare providers. In \nmany communities, especially in rural areas, the local pharmacist is a \npatient's most direct link to healthcare. Eighty-nine percent of \nAmericans reside within a 5-mile radius of a community pharmacy, and \nthat is one of the reasons that pharmacists are one of our Nation's \nmost trusted healthcare professionals. Utilizing their specialized \neducation, pharmacists play a major role in medication therapy \nmanagement, disease-state management, immunizations, healthcare \nscreenings, and other healthcare services designed to improve patient \nhealth and reduce overall healthcare costs. Pharmacists are also \nexpanding their role into new models of care based on quality of \nservices and outcomes, such as accountable care organizations, ACOs, \nand medical homes.\n\n[[Page S1486]]\n\n  As we continue to implement healthcare reform and seek new strategies \nto improve patient care, pharmacists will play a critical role. As the \nchairman of the Senate Community Pharmacy Caucus, I believe Congress \nshould look at every opportunity to make sure that pharmacists are \nallowed to utilize their training to the fullest to provide the \nservices that can improve care and lower costs. In recognition of the \nsixth annual NACDS RxIMPACT Day on Capitol Hill, I congratulate \npharmacy leaders, pharmacists, students, executives, and the entire \npharmacy community represented by the National Association of Chain \nDrug Stores, for their contributions to the good health of the American \npeople.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/03/10/senate-section/article/S1486-1", "month": "03", "year": "2014", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, MARCH 11, 2014\n\n  Mr. NELSON.
